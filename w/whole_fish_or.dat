50|$|In Lebanon and Cyprus, meze {{is often}} a meal in its own right. There are vegetarian, meat or fish mezes. Groups of dishes arrive at the table about 4 or 5 at a time (usually between five and ten groups). There is a set pattern to the dishes: {{typically}} olives, tahini, salad and yogurt {{will be followed by}} dishes with vegetables and eggs, then small meat or fish dishes alongside special accompaniments, and finally more substantial dishes such as <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> <b>or</b> meat stews and grills. Establishments will offer their own specialities, but the pattern remains the same. Naturally the dishes served will reflect the seasons. For example, in late autumn, snails will be prominent. As so much food is offered, it is not expected that every dish be finished, but rather shared at will and served at ease. Eating a Cypriot meze is a social event.|$|E
50|$|Fish hydrolysate, in its {{simplest}} form, {{is ground}} up fish {{transformed into a}} liquid phase, where the cleavage of molecular bonds occurs through various biological processes. Raw material choice; either <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> <b>or</b> by-products, depends on the commercial sources of the fish. In some cases, the fillet portions are removed for human consumption, the remaining fish body (generally the guts, bones, cartilage, scales and remaining meat) is put into water and ground up. Some fish hydrolysate is ground more finely than others so more bone material is able to remain suspended. Enzymes may {{also be used to}} dissolve bones, scale and meat. If the larger chunks of bone and scales are screened out, calcium or mineral content may be lacking in the finished product form. If purchasing fish hydrolysate for agricultural applications, one should look at the label carefully for the concentration of mineral elements in the liquid. Some fish hydrolysates have been made into a dried product, increasing the potential for inclusion as an ingredient in other food or feed products. The oil is separated out in this process, which means the Omega 3 fatty acid would remain with the oil and not the hydrolysate.|$|E

30|$|Nile tilapia {{is popular}} in Southeast Asia and other {{counties}} like China, India, etc., owing to its white flesh and delicacy. In general, it is sold as <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> <b>or</b> as fillets. To add more value, hydrolysis processes {{have been developed}} to convert fish protein into the potent bioactive peptides. Nevertheless, one problem connected to protein hydrolysate from fish flesh is the presence of pro-oxidants such as heme proteins and unstable lipid substrates (Raghavan and Kristinsson [2008]). Oxidation of lipids is associated with fishy odor development which can make hydrolysates unsuitable for use as food supplements. Yarnpakdee et al. ([2012]) reported that fishy smell in protein hydrolysate from Nile tilapia mince was mainly caused by lipid oxidation, especially when fish which were not fresh were used. To tackle such a problem, pretreatments of mince prior to enzymatic hydrolysis, in which both pro-oxidants and lipids are removed or reduced, are required.|$|E

40|$|A 67 -day {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} with juvenile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) (approx. 5 g). Seven experimental diets were formulated in which a control diet was included containing fishmeal as the major protein source.

40|$|Since fluoroquinolones {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used antibacterial drugs in aquaculture, there is a risk of their residues to be found in the treated fish. The objective of this study was to examine t he changes in enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin levelsduring storage of rainbow trout and common carp muscle at - 18 °C.

Tissue samples were collected 24 h after the treatment and stored at - 18 °C for 270 days either as a <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> <b>or</b> as precut muscle samples. Results for trout revealed that in the precut samples enrofloxacin concentration decreased significantly only after 9 months of storage, whereas a significant decline in the ciprofloxacin level was observed much earlier (after 3 months). After 9 months of storage, the trout stored without being sliced and eviscerated showed significantly higher levels of both quinolones as compared to the precut muscle samples. The enrofloxacin levels in the carp musculature decreased considerably after 3 months of storage and stayed almost unchanged up to the end of the study, whereas the ciprofloxacin concentration continued to drop even after this period and after 270 days constituted 1 / 6 of the initial values...|$|E

40|$|International audienceUsing {{measurements}} of naturally occurring stable isotopes to reconstruct diets or source of feeding requires quantifying isotopic discrimination factors or {{the relationships between}} isotope ratios in food and in consumer tissues. Diet-tissue discrimination factors of carbon (13 C/ 12 C, or d 13 C) and nitrogen (15 N/ 14 N, or d 15 N) isotopes in whole blood and feathers, representing noninvasive sampling techniques, were examined using three species of captive penguins (king Aptenodytes patagonicus, gentoo Pygoscelis papua, and rockhopper Eudyptes chrysocome penguins) fed known diets. King and rockhopper penguins raised on a constant diet of herring and capelin, respectively, had tissues enriched in 15 N compared to fish, with discrimination factors being higher in feathers than in blood. These data, together with previous works, allowed us to calculate average discrimination factors for 15 N between whole lipid-free prey and blood and feathers of piscivorous birds; they amount to 2. 7 ‰ and 4. 2 ‰, respectively. Both fish species were segregated by their d 13 C and d 15 N values, and importantly, lipid-free fish muscle tissue was consistently depleted in 13 C and enriched in 15 N compared to <b>whole</b> lipid-free <b>fish.</b> This finding has important implications because previous studies usually base dietary reconstructions on muscle of prey rather than on whole prey items consumed by the predator. We tested {{the effect of these}} differences using mass balance calculations to the quantification of food sources of gentoo penguins that had a mixed diet. Modeling indicated correct estimates when using the isotopic signature of <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> (muscle) and the discrimination factors between <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> (muscle) and penguin blood. Conversely, the use of isotopic signatures of muscle together with discrimination factors between <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> and blood (<b>or</b> the reverse) leads to spurious estimates in food proportions. Consequently, great care must be taken in the choice of isotopic discrimination factors to apply to wild species for which no controlled experiments on captive individuals have been done. Finally, our results also indicate that {{there is no need to}} remove lipids before isotopic analysis of avian blood...|$|R

40|$|Production of silage {{for animal}} feed by {{acidification}} of <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> <b>or</b> offal was investigated {{as a means}} of utilizing periodic gluts including small purseseined fish. Fifty-three samples, each of 4 - 10 kg, were selected over 14 months and subjected to various degrees of comminution. Samples were hand-mixed in a plastic bucket with quantities of 85 percent formic acid, usually 3. 5 percent by weight, and kept indoors in covered buckets at ambient temperatures of 10 - 30 °C. All whole fish liquefied satisfactorily; offal tended to liquefy at a slowcr rate, have a more pungent odour and appeared to need more than 3. 5 percent acid. Comminution was unnecessary f m small fish, e. g. anchovies (Stolephonrs spp.), but filefish (Monocanthus spp.) and offal needed mincing. Scads (Decapterus and Trachurus spp.) and similar fish of 10 - 15 cm length needed mincing in the winter, but a coarser comminution, or none at all, was adequate in the summer. Stirring facilitated liquefaction, which varied in speed from 12 h to five weeks. Final viscosity varied; scads producing a glutinous product in the winter, anchovies a watery liquid. Whole fish silages maintained a pleasantly malty smell for one to six months. Deterioration involved the formation of a mould (Aspergil-lus) or infestation with a small dipterid fly. Crude protein was assayed at 15. 6 - 17;O percent and fat at 1. 2 - 7. 0 percent for whole fish.

A.) limit their capture to fish ≥ 40 cm in length (total length) and {{to a maximum of}} four fish per person per day (for recreational fishers). Since C. cauteroma rarely reaches more than 40 cm in length, these regulations essentially protect this species from capture in those two regions. Regulations for the Pilbara/Kimberley region of W. A. are currently under review and thus may change in 2004 to fall in line with the west and Gascoyne regions of W. A. In the Pilbara/Kimberley region there is currently no minimum legal length for C. cauteroma and the catch limit for recreational fishers is 8 fish per person per day. Choerodon cauteroma should be considered Least Concern due to the minimum size limit for tuskfish species of 40 cm in Western Australia. This essentially protects this species from capture, since it rarely reaches this size, however, changes to regulations may occur in the future to reflect increased knowledge of the biology of this species (Fairclough in prep.).
