The train was eventually brought down a week later, and the ride remained closed for more than two months. Kings Dominion later explained the closure through a statement released on their official Facebook page on August 28, 2013, which stated that a problem <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> distribution on the gearbox caused a part to warp and fail. The replacement part had to be custom-built in another country, causing the extended closure. The ride eventually reopened on September 14, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Charlie {{is pouring}} {{his own money}} into the factory to ensure it will be ready in time for Milan, and he is getting frantic that the product is not right, angrily forcing his staff to redo what he {{considers}} to be shoddy work. Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, humiliating {{her in front of}} the other workers. Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man ("Soul of a Man").|$|E

50|$|The second way {{to produce}} a hook is by modifying the bowling ball. Illegally, one can play <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weighting</b> of <b>the</b> bowling ball, such as {{drilling}} the ball {{so that there is}} more side <b>weight</b> on <b>the</b> right side of the ball (for a right-hander,) which would cause the ball to pull from right to left, causing a hook. Bowling balls ship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weighting</b> specifications on <b>the</b> container. A bowling shop professional can drill a bowling ball by first knowing the type of roll the bowler wants, and then can pick out <b>the</b> bowling ball <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weighting</b> specifications in mind that match the bowler's needs.

25|$|The Federal Clean Air Act caused Ford {{to install}} {{catalytic}} converters for 1975 to help meet new emission standards. The converter significantly reduced the power {{output of the}} engines due to increased exhaust back pressure. In response, Ford changed the base engine on all Torinos to the 351-2V engine; along with this change, the Cruise-O-Matic transmission became standard. No manual transmissions were available. Power for all engines, except the 460, was significantly reduced compared to 1974, and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> increase, fuel economy and performance continued to decrease. The 400-2V and the 460-4V were the only engine options, as the 351-4V was no longer available.|$|E
25|$|West Yorkshire Police were criticised {{for being}} inadequately {{prepared}} {{for an investigation}} on this scale.

Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} of the batsman for a particular delivery depends on the shot being attempted. Front-foot shots are played <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> on the front foot (left foot for a right-hander) and are usually played when the ball is pitched up to the batsman, while back-foot shots are played putting the weight onto the back foot, usually to bowling that is pitched short. Shots may also be described as vertical bat shots, in which the bat is swung vertically at the ball (e.g. when playing a drive or leg glance), or horizontal or cross-bat shots, in which the bat is swung horizontally at the ball (e.g. when playing the pull or cut shot).|$|E
25|$|While {{on a tour}} of the United States, Caldwell visited Curtiss-Wright in Buffalo, New York. On August 6, 1942, he {{was invited}} to come on an {{acceptance}} re-flight of a Curtiss C-46 Commando, the latest transport aircraft destined for overseas use. The aircraft was also loaded with Curtiss executives, and flown by Chief Production Test Pilot Herbert O. Fisher. The landing gear became stuck in a three-quarters down position, and after an extended eight-hour attempt to release the gear, Fisher calmly belly-landed the C-46. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the aircraft gently pushing the gear back into the wheel wells, a minimum of damage resulted. Caldwell had taken over as the co-pilot on the eight hours of circling over Buffalo, receiving certification that he was checked out on the C-46, under the tutelage of Fisher.

25|$|The {{toll road}} {{authorities}} found fords {{something of a}} nuisance as passage was free unlike the bridge where a toll was levied. To prevent this they often obtained authority to deepen the fords in the river to force the use of bridges on the toll roads; very few fords therefore remain in Ayrshire. Even the Dean Ford has ceased to exists on the Kilmarnock Water after resolution of difficulties {{to do with the}} legal transfer of the property to the council by Lord Howard de Walden and the legal definition of the boundaries of the lands gifted. Further up the Fenwick Water the Bringan Ford still survives. Many of the fords eventually developed wooden footbridges alongside, such as at the Bringan Ford and as at Knockentiber in 1860 on the old Kilmarnock Road ford. The fine 'suspension bridge' footbridge at the Dean Ford was famous for collapsing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of sightseers on its opening day.

25|$|On January 27 at the Royal Rumble, Ryback {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final entrant and {{eliminated}} five superstars before being {{the last man}} eliminated by John Cena. Ryback would then resume his rivalry with The Shield on the February 4 Raw, when he teamed up with John Cena and Sheamus to attack the stable. This culminated in a six-man tag team match on February 17 at Elimination Chamber, where The Shield emerged victorious when Seth Rollins pinned Ryback for the win. The following night on Raw, Ryback and Sheamus teamed up with Chris Jericho to face The Shield in a rematch, but were again defeated. Ryback then began a feud with Mark Henry after several non-verbal confrontations led to them attacking Drew McIntyre with their finishing moves {{in an attempt to}} one-up each other. On the March 15 episode of SmackDown, Ryback defeated Henry via disqualification following interference from The Shield. Afterwards, Henry delivered the World's Strongest Slam to Ryback three times in a row. Ryback and Henry competed in a Bench Press Challenge on the March 29 SmackDown, where Ryback tied Henry at 53 reps after Henry choked him <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight.</b> On April 7 at WrestleMania 29, Ryback was defeated by Henry in a singles match.|$|E
25|$|The {{energy of}} the nuclear {{explosion}} is released in one microsecond. In the following few microseconds, the test hardware and surrounding rock are vaporised, with temperatures of several million degrees and pressures of several million atmospheres. Within milliseconds, a bubble of high-pressure gas and steam is formed. The heat and expanding shock wave cause the surrounding rock to vaporise, or be melted further away, creating a melt cavity. The shock-induced motion and high internal pressure cause this cavity to expand outwards, which continues over several tenths of a second until the pressure has fallen sufficiently, to a level roughly comparable <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>weight</b> of the rock above, and can no longer grow. Although not observed in every explosion, four distinct zones (including the melt cavity) have been described in the surrounding rock. The crushed zone, about two times the radius of the cavity, consists of rock that has lost all of its former integrity. The cracked zone, about three times the cavity radius, consists of rock with radial and concentric fissures. Finally, the zone of irreversible strain consists of rock deformed by the pressure. The following layer undergoes only an elastic deformation; the strain and subsequent release then forms a seismic wave. A few seconds later the molten rock starts collecting {{on the bottom of}} the cavity and the cavity content begins cooling. The rebound after the shock wave causes compressive forces to build up around the cavity, called a stress containment cage, sealing the cracks.|$|E
