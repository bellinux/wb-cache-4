5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E

25|$|The VIII Corps {{moved into}} the Province of León in February. Clausel scouted the region and sent a summons of {{surrender}} {{to the city of}} Astorga on 26 February 1810. This was refused by its governor, General José María Santocildes even though the ancient walls mounted only 14 guns, the heaviest of which were two 12-pound pieces. No siege guns were immediately available, but a large convoy with heavy artillery was plodding slowly across Spain. But Junot was too impatient to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Anxious to erase the stain of his defeat at Vimeiro, Junot obtained Spanish fortress guns from Burgos and Segovia to form his own siege train. On 15 March he directed his troops to march on Astorga. Clausel's division began the Siege of Astorga on 21 March while Saint-Croix's dragoons covered the siege from La Bañeza and Solignac supported the operation from León and Benavente. Because the guns had not arrived, Clausel's men occupied themselves by digging the first parallel and preparing artillery positions.|$|E

25|$|Bozděch elected {{instead to}} carry the dog instead rather than killing {{him as one of}} the others suggested, and after a while they began to take turns {{carrying}} Ant over their shoulders. They reached Blois and were directed to a train to Montpellier further down the track where found it overwhelmed with people trying to board. Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of the girls had been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.|$|E
500|$|Equally {{proficient}} {{as both a}} blocker and runner, Johnson {{was described}} as [...] "the perfect NFL fullback". A talented runner, he ran with power {{both inside and outside}} the tackles, and he was as fast as McElhenny and Perry. Jim Brown called Johnson the greatest running back he had ever seen. He was also a very skilled safety and linebacker on defense. During a preseason game in 1955, Johnson hit Chicago Cardinals halfback Charley Trippi so hard that he fractured Trippi's face in multiple places, leaving him with a smashed nose and concussion and all but ended his career. [...] "Football was like a combat zone," [...] said Johnson. [...] "I was always told that you carry the impact to the opponent.

Nevertheless, the Phillies won the series, three games to one. He earned the win in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series as the Phillies beat the Dodgers, 8–6. Hamels started Game 3 of the World Series against the New York Yankees, pitching [...] innings, allowing 5 earned runs and taking the loss as the Yankees won that game 8-5. Afterward, he told reporters, [...] "I can't <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> (the season) to end. It's been mentally draining.

[...] Later in the series, after the Phillies won game five, a confrontational Brett Myers mockingly asked Hamels: [...] "What are you doing here? I thought you quit."

[...] Kenneth Partridge of AOL commented, [...] "Packed with sex, violence and questionable acting, the new Britney Spears video, 'Criminal,' {{has all the}} trappings of a midnight movie." [...] A reporter from the American edition of The Huffington Post said: [...] "We can't honestly remember the last time Britney Spears looked so gorgeous in a music video" [...] and deemed it as the best video from Femme Fatale. Erin Strecker Entertainment Weekly also called it the best video of the album, and highlighted Spears' look, the ending scene and the [...] "fun story". Katherine St Asaph of Popdust said it is [...] "probably the best video of the Femme Fatale era." [...] Tom Townshend of MSN stated that although the video was not appropriate for Spears' younger fans, [...] " [...] is actually rather compelling and feels more like a short film rather than a pop starlet's music video." [...] A writer for VH1 said that part of the reason the video works is the comic sensibility between Spears and Marrs Piliero, explaining that [...] " [...] point to one of Spears's greatest talents: giving the impression that although she takes her career extremely seriously, she nevertheless doesn't take it too seriously." [...] The critic summarized the review by saying that the video is [...] "entertaining [...] a bad-girl adventure story, and her role here is essentially that of a (<b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>it)</b> femme fatale." ...|$|E
500|$|After scoring 114 not {{out in a}} club {{match against}} Riverside, Ponting became the {{youngest}} player to appear for Tasmania in a Sheffield Shield match, breaking Boon's record by 14 days. In November 1992, {{at the age of}} 17 years and 337 days, he batted at number four in the order against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. Despite scoring 56 in a 127-run partnership with Boon, he could not prevent defeat, scoring just four in Tasmania's second innings. In his first match in Tasmania—this time against New South Wales—Ponting contributed 32 and 18 in a draw, before scoring 25 against Western Australia in a narrow loss. His first match in Sydney also marked the debut of future Australian opening bowler Glenn McGrath. At {{the end of the first}} day's play, Tasmania were 6/200, and Ponting was the only player to resist, reaching 98 not out. He eventually reached three figures the next morning, having endured three rain breaks and 54 minutes in the nineties. The century made him the youngest Tasmanian to score a first-class century, at 18 years and 40 days, eclipsing Boon's record of 19 years and 356 days. The next day he spoke about the achievement: [...] "I knew I had to be patient and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to come [...] I wasn't that nervous last night, but I was a bit nervous this morning." [...] Dismissed for 125 out of a total of 298, Ponting scored 17 boundaries in his five-and-a-half-hour stay at the crease. Coach Greg Shipperd was impressed in what he saw: [...] "It was an excellent innings, one of classical stroke play. The way he freely put together a good, solid innings, showed that his potential is being realised. It was an indication, for him, of what it's like to go the extra step." [...] These performances lead Ponting to his List A debut on 13 December against Victoria in Devonport. He struggled, however, scoring 22 from 45 balls in Tasmania's defeat. His form, nonetheless, remained strong in first-class cricket, scoring another half-century, Ponting scored back-to-back centuries against Western Australia in Perth, the nation's fastest wicket, thus becoming the youngest batsmen in Shield history to score two centuries in a match. After setting a goal of scoring 500 first-class runs in the season, Ponting finished with 781 runs at 48.81. But his form in List A games were not as strong, aggregating 99 at 33 in four matches. Still, Ponting hit an unbeaten 59 from 52 balls against a touring England A side in Hobart. After the season's end, still aged 18, Ponting played seven four-day games for the Australian Academy, scoring 484 runs at 96.70.|$|E
2500|$|The Council had lodged a {{resource}} consent application {{for the new}} building in December 2004, but did not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to be confirmed before demolishing the existing building in May–June [...] the next year. [...] According to a 2006 examination of the project management, Council assumed there was little risk of the application being declined. However, an amended Council report by planner Ian Jefferis revealed that the building was to occupy 15% more of the reserve than expected (pictured).

2500|$|There {{are three}} classes of soldier: swordsmen, bowmen, and spearmen. Swordsmen are most {{effective}} against spearmen, bowmen against swordsmen, and spearmen against bowmen. The strength of each recruited unit depends {{on the level of}} [...] "Divine Promotion" [...] which that class has reached, with each class requiring two promotions to reach the maximum level. Divine Promotion is contingent on how much manna the player has produced; to promote a class, the level of manna must be at 100%. Once promoted, the level drops to 0%, and the player must <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to rise again before they can perform the next promotion. Each race can also produce war machines; catapults for the Romans, ballistae for the Egyptians, cannons for the Asians, and war gongs for the Amazons.|$|E
2500|$|Bukowski died {{of leukemia}} on March 9, 1994, in San Pedro, aged 73, shortly after {{completing}} his last novel, Pulp. The funeral rites, orchestrated by his widow, {{were conducted by}} Buddhist monks. He is interred at Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes. An account of the proceedings {{can be found in}} Gerald Locklin's book Charles Bukowski: A Sure Bet. His gravestone reads: [...] "Don't Try", a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington: [...] "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. You <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it." [...] Bukowski was an atheist.|$|E
2500|$|The combat {{systems from}} Saints Row have been updated {{but many of}} the basics remain unchanged. While {{engaging}} in melee-based combat, the player character will perform combos and charge up attacks, and can execute a finishing move if three consecutive hits are dealt. With a gun equipped, the player can perform a groin attack, and can zoom in for a finer aim reticle. The player can also employ the use of human shields, and can use makeshift weapons pulled from the environment e.g. fire hydrants, cement blocks. Should the player either commit illegal activities or incite rival gang members, they will provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative figures or rival gangs. The notoriety bar is a visual representation of the proactivity of the opposing figures' response and continual inciting of these groups will bring about a more powerful response, such as SWAT teams from the police. The player will continue to be chased by these groups until captured or killed and must reduce the notoriety bar by either hiding from the police or gang and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> to [...] "cool off", or by seeking out a drive-through confessional which will clear the notoriety bar for a small fee. Should the player character be apprehended or killed, {{a small percentage of the}} player's earnings will be removed and the player will respawn at law or healthcare institutions. The game contains over forty different weapons, many of which have been recycled from Saints Row. The game allows the player to utilise new weapon types, examples of which include satchel charges, laser-guided rocket launchers, chainsaws and more. The player has the ability to dual wield handguns and submachine guns. Weaponry can be purchased by the player from specific stores or unlocked throughout in-game progress.|$|E
