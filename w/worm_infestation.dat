The aim {{of the study was to}} determine whether children who have developed autoimmune disease were less likely to have had <b>worm</b> <b>infestations</b> in childhood. The ABIS-study is a prospective population-based cohort study of children born in southeast Sweden 1997 / 99. 17. 055 children participated. As of June 2014 116 individuals had developed Type 1 diabetes, 181 celiac disease, and 53 Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. The parents answered questions on <b>worm</b> <b>infestations</b> when the children were 1, 5 and 8 years of age. The ABIS registry was connected to the National Registry of Drug Prescriptions, and national registries for diagnosis of the studied diseases. We found no differences in incidence of <b>worm</b> <b>infestations</b> at 1, 5 or 8 years of age between children who developed autoimmune disease(s) or healthy controls. At 8 years in total 20. 0 % of the general child population had experienced a worm infestation; children who developed Type 1 diabetes, 21, 3 %, celiac disease 19, 5 % and JRA 18, 8 %. There was no difference in prescriptions of drugs for treatment of <b>worm</b> <b>infestations</b> between those who had and who had not developed Type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. We found no associations indicating that <b>worm</b> <b>infestations</b> in childhood does not play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases in Sweden.

5000|$|In September 2016 a screw <b>worm</b> <b>infestation</b> was {{discovered}} (the first infestation {{of its kind}} in the U.S. since 1982) to be affecting the Key deer population, necessitating the euthanasia of affected animals. The Screw worm is a fly larva that enters an open wound of a live animal and eats the flesh of the animal from within, leading to a gruesome death. The female flies mate once in their life so the infestation can be battled by introducing sterile flies to the population, causing the females to die out without laying any more larvae. Other steps to battle the outbreak included injecting deer with anti-parasitic drugs, fencing off healthy sections of the population and tracking a portion of deer with radio-collars. The pest was declared as eradicated in April 2017. The outbreak killed 135 deer, roughly an eighth of the herd.|$|E
