5|$|Having {{relocated}} to north Wales by 1985, West met with Harrison regularly {{over a period}} of two years at the latter's Oxfordshire estate, Friar Park. The pair discussed the images required for all of Harrison's songs, in order to ensure empathy between the illustrations and the message behind the lyrics. West <b>worked</b> <b>up</b> pencil sketches, which he would submit to Harrison, before completing the final watercolour illustrations.|$|E
5|$|Portland Harbour, {{in between}} Portland and Weymouth, {{is one of}} the largest {{man-made}} harbours in the world. The harbour was made by the building of stone breakwaters between 1848 and 1905. From its inception it was a Royal Navy base, and played prominent roles during the First and Second World Wars; ships of the Royal Navy and NATO countries <b>worked</b> <b>up</b> and exercised in its waters until 1995. The harbour is now a civilian port and popular recreation area, and was used for the 2012 Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting <b>worked</b> <b>up</b> about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is <b>worked</b> <b>up</b> through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, {{moving about}} 100 miles away to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where his uncle had a barber {{shop in the}} Hotel Conneaut. Around 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the {{itinerary}} for dance bands who <b>worked</b> <b>up</b> and down the Ohio Valley. Como, Roselle, and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times {{took them to the}} Silver Slipper Ballroom where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent to come up and sing with his band. Young Como was terrified, but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como's performance that he immediately offered him a job.|$|E
5|$|Due to rain {{shortly before}} the start of the race, it {{commenced}} behind the safety car, with every car equipped with full wet tyres. The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate tyres. Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the still damp track, sliding off the track and getting stuck in the gravel, leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed tyres. The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio Pérez, who had <b>worked</b> <b>up</b> his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, who was running well on the intermediate tyres. Bottas came into a spin on lap 11, losing positions and dropping back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to make the switch to slick tyres, while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.|$|E

40|$|The {{awareness}} of the diagnostic difficulty and the documented high mortality risk of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) {{has led to the}} wide use of <b>work</b> <b>up</b> to rule out PMI after major noncardiac operations. This has caused stable postoperative patients to be kept in monitored hospital beds for extended periods of time and to be subjected to additional tests. We hypothesized that the mortality of PMI is high and, therefore, the wide use of postoperative <b>work</b> <b>up</b> to identify these patients is justifiable. We performed the following study to prove our hypothesis. All patients in the recovery room after major noncardiac operations who underwent <b>work</b> <b>up</b> to rule out PMI were identified and followed.
