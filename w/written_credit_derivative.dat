40|$|One of {{the risks}} of making a bank loan or {{investing}} in a debt security is credit risk, the risk of borrower default. In response to this risk, new financial instruments called <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> have been developed {{in the past few}} years. <b>Credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> can help banks, financial companies, and investors manage the credit risk of their investments by insuring against adverse movements in the credit quality of the borrower. If a borrower defaults, the investor will suffer losses on the investment, but the losses can be offset by gains from the <b>credit</b> <b>derivative.</b> Thus, if used properly, <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> can reduce an investor's overall credit risk. > Estimates from industry sources suggest the <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> market has grown from virtually nothing two years ago to about $ 20 billion of transactions in 1995.

40|$|Following the 2007 - 2009 {{financial}} crisis, {{the debates}} {{on the effects}} of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> has become more widely and fierce. The key objective of this dissertation is to understand how <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> can affect portfolio performance of banks, and empirically examine whether <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> can improve portfolio performance and reduce bank earnings volatility during both non-crisis and crisis periods. To reach the research objective, two research questions are addressed: The primary question is does usage of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> improve bank portfolio performance? The secondary question is does hedging through <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> reduce banks’ risk on return? The secondary is set to offer better answer for the primary question. Panel data models are employed in this study to investigate the research questions. From the estimation results on these models, no evidence is found that using <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> improve banks’ portfolio performance during the non-crisis period. However, the effects of using <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> are proved to be significantly negative on portfolio performance during the financial crisis. Simultaneously, the hedging activities in <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> market are observed to have no significant correlation with the volatility of bank return. It is suggested that banks should pay attention when using <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> and efficient usage is desirable to offset the potential risks brought about by <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives.</b> This study provides a systematic review on <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives,</b> and shed a light to the effectiveness of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> during different macroeconomic environments.

40|$|Abstract Before {{the credit}} crisis {{that started in}} mid- 2007, it was {{generally}} believed by top regulators that <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> make banks sounder. In this paper, we investigate the validity of this view. We examine the use of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> by US bank holding companies with assets in excess of one billion dollars from 1999 to 2005. Using the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Bank Holding Company Database, we find that in 2005 the gross notional amount of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> held by banks exceeds the amount of loans on their books. Only 23 large banks out of 395 use <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> and most of their derivatives positions are held for dealer activities rather than for hedging of loans. The net notional amount of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> used for hedging of loans in 2005 represents less than 2 % of the total notional amount of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> held by banks and less than 2 % of their loans. We conclude {{that the use of}} <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> by banks to hedge loans is limited because of adverse selection and moral hazard problems and because of the inability of banks to use hedge accounting when hedging with <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Our evidence raises important questions {{about the extent to which}} the use of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> makes banks sounder.

40|$|The <b>credit</b> <b>derivative</b> {{contract}} {{is a new}} type of contract in the Financial Law and Banking Law that emerged in the early 1990 ’s and now applies all over the world.

The part that takes over the credit risk receives payment for taking over the credit risk from the other part. The thesis analyses the <b>credit</b> <b>derivative</b> contract in relation to the existing legislation, the legal nature of this type of contract and compares it to similar types of contracts in Swedish Law and English Law.

40|$|The <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> {{market has}} been growing rapidly over the past years. Credit risk, like market risk or {{interest}} risk, {{is part of the}} risk family in the financial industry. A number of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> have been developed to protect investors against credit risk.

40|$|Is hedging with <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> always beneficial? The {{benefit of}} hedging with <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives,</b> such as <b>credit</b> default swaps, is presumed by the Dodd-Frank Act, which {{excludes}} hedge transactions from {{much of the}} new financial regulation. Yet, new, significant risks can arise when <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> are used to manage risks. Hedging, therefore, should be defined not only in relation to whether a transaction offsets risks, but also whether, on balance, the risks that are mitigated, as well as any new risks that arise, are outweighed by the potential benefits. Firms using <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> to hedge often fail to account for the full costs associated with using those instruments. There are numerous risks that can arise. Informational asymmetries and negative externalities, however, make it difficult for firms to accurately assess those risks. Consequently, the far-reaching exemptions for hedge activity provided by the Dodd-Frank Act are inappropriate. <b>Credit</b> <b>derivative</b> hedges must be subject to regulatory oversight, rather than exemption. Regulation of the derivatives markets must consider the risks of hedging with <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> and the inability of firms to account for those risks, as well as the value to firms of mitigating risks with <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> and the costs arising from their use. Among other proscriptions, the types of <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> transactions that can be classified as a hedge should be limited, as well as the size of those positions. In addition, margin and collateral requirements for <b>credit</b> <b>derivatives</b> should take account of the greater risks arising from their use...|$|R

The strongest effect is for large term loans [...] newly negotiated loan extensions to large corporate borrowers, with a largely negative impact on (previously negotiated) commitment lending.
