25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the hardest thing to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

Except for my religion, I {{easily could have}} become excessively occupied with industry, social and recreational activities. Sharing personal responsibility for church <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> fellow members has been a vital counterbalance in my life." [...] Following LDS Church practices, he did not drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages, smoke, or swear. [...] Romney and his wife tithed, and from 1955 to 1965, gave 19percent of their income {{to the church and}} another 4percent to charity.|$|E
500|$|On January 7, 1986, John Poindexter {{proposed}} {{to the president}} a modification of the approved plan: instead of negotiating with the [...] "moderate" [...] Iranian political group, the United States would negotiate with [...] "moderate" [...] members of the Iranian government. Poindexter told Reagan that Ghorbanifar had important connections within the Iranian government, so {{with the hope of}} the release of the hostages, Reagan approved this plan as well. Throughout February 1986, weapons were shipped directly to Iran by the United States (as part of Oliver North's plan, without the knowledge of President Reagan) and none of the hostages were released. Retired National Security Advisor McFarlane conducted another international voyage, this one to Tehran; bringing with him a gift of a bible having a handwritten inscription by Ronald Reagan; and, according to George Cave a cake baked {{in the shape of a}} key. Howard Teicher described the cake as a joke between North and Ghorbanifar. He met directly with Iranian officials associated with Rafsanjani that sought to establish U.S.-Iranian relations in an attempt to free the four remaining hostages. [...] The American delegation comprised McFarlane, North, Cave (a retired CIA agent who worked in Iran in the 1960s–70s), Teicher, an Israeli diplomat Amiram Nir and a CIA translator [...] arrived in Tehran in an Israeli plane carrying forged Irish passports on 25 May 1986. This meeting also failed. Much to McFarlane's disgust, he did not meet ministers, and instead met in his words [...] "third and fourth level officials". At one point, an angry McFarlane shouted: [...] "As I am a Minister, I expect to meet with decision-makers. Otherwise, you can <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> staff". The Iranians requested concessions such as Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which the United States rejected. More importantly, McFarlane refused to ship spare parts for the Hawk missiles until the Iranians had Hezbollah release the American hostages whereas the Iranians wanted to reverse that sequence with the spare parts being shipped first before the hostages were freed. The differing negotiating positions led to McFarlane mission going home after four days. After the failure of the secret visit to Tehran, McFarlane advised Reagan not to talk to the Iranians anymore, advice that was disregarded.|$|E

Anselmo said [...] "These days, I wouldn't want anything to fucking do with it because truthfully... I wouldn't. The way I feel and the group of people I've had to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> whole life, you see a Confederate flag out there that says 'Heritage, not hate.'

2500|$|After 18 {{months at}} Oxford, she dropped out, finding {{work in a}} factory and a burger bar and hoping to write in her spare time.

But I very quickly {{discovered}} why people who work in factories don't usually have the energy to write when they get home."

2500|$|Marcus {{probably}} {{began his}} {{education at the}} age of seven. He was taught at home, in line with contemporary aristocratic trends; Marcus thanks Catilius Severus for encouraging him to avoid public schools. Three of his childhood tutors are known: Euphoric, Geminus, and an unnamed educator. These three are otherwise unattested in the ancient sources, and would probably have been household slaves or freedmen. Since Euphoric had a Greek name, he probably taught Marcus the basics of that language. (He is said to have taught Marcus literature.) Geminus is described as an actor, and he may have taught Marcus Latin pronunciation and general elocution. The educator would have been Marcus' overall supervisor, charged with his moral welfare and general development. Marcus speaks of him with admiration in his Meditations: he taught him to [...] "bear pain and be content with little; to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own hands, to mind my own business, to be slow to listen to slander".|$|E
