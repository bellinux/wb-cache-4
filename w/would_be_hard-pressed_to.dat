5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on the sketch and Belushi's performance in 2013. Lane thought that the sketch was an effective satire of the cancellation of the series and simultaneously served as a death knell for the Star Trek franchise. He felt that viewers watching the sketch in 1976 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> imagine a future, thirty-seven-years later, where Star Trek was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture. Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character. Lane wondered how the Star Trek franchise could ever {{come back from the}} total deconstruction the SNL skit presented.|$|E

500|$|Evans was {{promoted}} to group captain in January 1969 and appointed Director of Air Force Plans. In this position he proposed and organised the gift of 23 of the RAAF's old CAC Sabres to the Indonesian Air Force, following an earlier presentation of 10Sabres to the Royal Malaysian Air Force. He completed studies at the Royal College of Defence Studies, London, in 1972. [...] Returning to Australia, he {{was promoted}} to air commodore and appointed Director-General Plans and Policy, Air Force, in January 1973. He served as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Amberley from February 1975 until April 1977. In this role he qualified as a pilot on the recently delivered F-111C swing-wing bomber, as well as the UH-1 Iroquois helicopter. Following his tour as Amberley base commander, Evans {{was promoted to}} air vice marshal and became Chief of Air Force Operations (CAFOPS). He held this newly created position for the next two years, broken by a temporary posting as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff between January and August 1978. As CAFOPS, Evans played a major part in developing the RAAF's plans for the defence of Australia. Following America's announcement in the 1969 Guam Doctrine that its allies would have to assume greater self-reliance in their military affairs, Australia's strategic thought underwent a change from its earlier policy of [...] "forward defence" [...] to a more localised defensive posture. While the consensus among RAAF planning staff was to adopt a [...] "repulsion" [...] concept of attacking an enemy force along the air and sea approaches to northern Australia, Evans considered that this did not go far enough in exploiting the long-range offensive capabilities of such aircraft as the F-111. Convinced that Australia's numerically small forces <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> dislodge an invader that had gained a foothold on the continent, he refined the [...] "repulsion" [...] stance into what he termed an [...] "anti-lodgement" [...] strategy, focussing on defeating the enemy at its potential staging bases north of Australia and then, as a last resort, on the approaches closer to home. The Air Force's role in shaping an overall strategy that took advantage of the [...] "air-sea gap" [...] was later acknowledged in the Federal government paper The Defence of Australia 1987. Evans was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia on 26January 1981 for his achievements as CAFOPS.|$|E

40|$|Warning to American {{women in}} the twenty-first century: your {{happiness}} is on the decline, feminism {{has something to do}} with it, and yes, it is reversible. This writing shows how the Women’s Movement prompted the decline in the happiness of women relative to men, and how individual and systemic barriers to social equality continue to contribute to this decline. It also discusses how, in order to break down these barriers, reverse this negative trend, and allow women to maximize their happiness, women’s leadership must continue and transform. One significant change is for women to embrace leadership in the public sphere, which includes opting out of the public labor force less than they do today. Author’s Note Candace Fox is a senior at Barnard College majoring in Political Economy. Before attending Barnard, she <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> come up with definitions for feminism and women’s leadership.

5000|$|The {{weight of}} a solid core reactor was {{initially}} thought to be its main drawback. Immediately after World War II, a complete nuclear reactor was so heavy that it was feared that solid core nuclear thermal engines <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> [...] <b>to</b> achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1:1, which is needed to overcome {{the gravity of the}} Earth at launch. This problem was quickly overcome, however, and over the next twenty-five years U.S. nuclear thermal rocket designs eventually reached thrust-to-weight ratios of approximately 7:1. This is still a much lower thrust-to-weight ratio than what is achievable with chemical rockets, which have thrust-to-weight ratios on the order of 70:1. That fact, when combined with the large tanks necessary for liquid hydrogen (or other working fluid) storage, means that solid core nuclear thermal engines are best suited for a) use in upper stages, where vehicle velocity is already near orbital, or b) in space [...] "tugs", or intra Solar System transports, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> used to take payloads and/or people between gravity wells, or c) for launches from a planet smaller than Earth, a planetoid (or [...] "dwarf planet"), an asteroid, or a moon where the required thrust is lower due to lower gravity fields. Currently then, for a solid core nuclear thermal rocket to be more useful than chemical rockets as a first or second stage Earth launch engine, the system would either have to be made much lighter, or provide even higher specific impulse. Until that day, it can be said [...] that the true strength of nuclear rockets currently lies in solar system exploration, outside Earth's gravity well.|$|R
40|$|Sawankhalok" is {{the name}} of the medieval city that was part of the Sukhothai kingdom and was located on the banks of the Yom River about 50 km north of Sukhothai. This city shows {{evidence}} of flood sedimentation of up to 2 m since its founding, prompting the question of when the flooding occurred and why the city was founded in an evidently flood-prone site. Several elements of the physical environment, especially the disposition of hills and river, are propitious in terms of Thai cosmology and almost certainly constitute one element in the decision to locate the old city at the site. Flood damage to the walls of the city indicate, however, that the city's founding and early growth probably occurred during a period of lower flooding. This conclusion is consistent with the long Chinese records of regional meteorological phenomena that are related to the strength of the monsoon, one of the key controllers of river flow at the old city. After being founded, the city persisted at this location despite a return to a regime of higher and, possibly, more frequent floods. This persistence was almost certainly related, at least in part, to the economic and political power that resided in the city and was founded on flourishing ceramics and agricultural industries and the decline of Sukhothai itself. The history of old Sawankhalok shows that the physical environment remains an important element in understanding the emergence of proto urban sites, despite the lack of attention paid to this currently unfashionable element of urban development. It seems that the old city <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> develop had it been subject to inundation and sedimentation by floods. The modern Asian supercities are evidently likewise resilient to the extremes of the physical environment. Inertia is a strong factor in this resilience, but one might suggest that Bangkok would also find it very difficult to cope with regular inundation by flood waters and sediment.

40|$|As Professor Michael Green 2 ̆ 7 s {{comments}} trenchantly remind us, all of {{this has}} a familiar ring: insurers and tort defendants claim unfairly escalating liability, plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 lawyers and consumer groups counterattack, and (for the most part), insurers and defendants obtain some of the relief they seek. The tort reform victories are not so overwhelming as to completely unravel the historical rights of victims or the power of courts generally, but some constriction of rights inevitably occurs. During periods of quiescence, plaintiffs and consumers take back some lost territory through common law victories expanding claimant rights, or through specific legislation. Statutes that permitted states to sue tobacco companies for state-paid health care costs during the 1990 s are an example. Arguably, Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 40, which governs claims for defective construction, is another example. But plaintiffs and consumers during the past thirty years have probably not been net gainers relative to inflation and population growth. While plaintiffs may have won some doctrinal victories, defendants have had no shortage of the same. In fact, this particular time period contained what Professors Theodore Eisenberg and James Henderson call the “quiet revolution” in product liability claims, leading to common law doctrine and adjudication favorable to defendants. It was also an era of civil procedure rule “reform” that systematically favored defendants. Meanwhile, the U. S. Supreme Court also weighed in on behalf of defendants and insurers, making it easier for defendants to get summary judgment, harder for plaintiffs to introduce expert testimony in their cases, and dramatically limiting punitive damages as a matter of a constitutional right. If keeping a scorecard, one <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> not <b>to</b> conclude that defendants have been the overall winners in both the chronic and episodic tort reform battles of the past thirty years. Yet, neither have they been able to deliver a knockout punch - though not for want of trying. The legal, political, social, economic, and rhetorical battle over tort reform continues. Compromise resolves most of the issues for a time, but final consensus remains elusive. Why have these and similar explorations of tort litigation failed to produce greater consensus? Why does the issue of tort reform continue to be so divisive and the divisions so repetitive (the “deja vu all over again” noted by social critics Yogi Berra and Mike Green) ...|$|R
40|$|Victorian sartorial {{convention}} {{allowed for}} the routine inspection of only two body parts: the head and the hands. While it is well-documented that the perceptual codes of phrenology and physiognomy shaped psychological, aesthetic and fictional conventions {{by the middle of}} the nineteenth century, the hand has attracted relatively little attention. One <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed,</b> for example, <b>to</b> identify a critic of Vanity Fair who does not comment on the relationship between Becky Sharp 2 ̆ 7 s facial expressions and the pervasiveness of her manipulative temperament. However, even within the heavily sifted topic of 2 ̆ 2 manipulation 2 ̆ 2 in Vanity Fair, critics have overlooked the extent to which Becky 2 ̆ 7 s social maneuverability depends on Thackeray 2 ̆ 7 s representation of her hands. As I intend to demonstrate, the partial invisibility of Becky 2 ̆ 7 s hands is a deliberate and fundamental aspect of Vanity Fair 2 ̆ 7 s thematic and formal design. That is, for her subversive gestures to have social efficacy, they must be both observable and camouflaged. Drawing on the work of body theorists who discuss the ways that social values are anatomized in unremarkable attributes of physical bearing, I show how the indeterminacy of Becky 2 ̆ 7 s manual gesture allows her to perform subordinate social actions while still asserting individual agency. Since her gestures fulfill social obligation yet contain sublimated aggression, Becky 2 ̆ 7 s hand constitutes one of the few sites where Victorian hierarchies can be contested, destabilized, and even inverted. Her hand is so frequently the object of Thackeray 2 ̆ 7 s narrative and pictorial attention in Vanity Fair not merely because it was a central topic of popular discourse in the 1840 s, but also because it provides a dynamic location for the novel 2 ̆ 7 s overarching concern with the physical and psychic foundations of social control...|$|R
40|$|Young Projects {{is pleased}} to present Wake Me Up When It’s Over by the UK duo, Thomson & Craighead, who have shown {{extensively}} at galleries, museums and film-festivals worldwide. The exhibition will feature nearly a dozen works spanning the years 1996 - 2016, thereby presenting an in-depth look into the couple’s practice and methodologies. For {{the better part of}} the past two decades Jon Thomson and Alison Craighead have been “digging deep,” as curator Marc Garrett once described their practice, “into the algorithmic phenomena of our networked society; its conditions and protocols (architecture of the Internet) and the non-ending terror of the spectacle as a mediated life. ” In the process they've employed web cams, data feeds, networks, movies, images, sound and text in their many installations, videos and art-objects [...] often with a wide array of art-historical reference points, including 1960 s systems art, 1970 s structuralist film-making, and the compositional experiments of the literature group, Oulipo. Of course, given their interest in the ever-shifting world of the digital, their work can also be as sardonic and menacing as our daily news feed might suggest. Terrorism, dystopia, the apocalypse, the loss of privacy, police states, political apathy, radioactive waste, fear mongering and the self-help industry are common targets for the artists. However, in each case, such works can also convey a wry sense-of-humor and a well-honed critical distance. Apocalypse 2016 for instance, (pictured above), which will be featured in Wake Me Up When It’s Over, is a professionally made perfume that captures the odor of the ‘end of times’ as described in the Book of Revelation. "[It's] the nasal equivalent of a subsonic frequency," wrote critic Nell Frizzell after his encounter with the scent. [It's] doom, in sprayable, wearable, purchasable form. ” Other writers, such as Eddy Frankel, have written similarly of Thomson & Craighead. “There’s a chance you’ll feel like [the artists] have a direct line into your neuroses,” he wrote upon exiting one of their exhibitions; “or at the least have been monitoring your emails or something, because it all taps so perfectly into contemporary anxiety. It’s almost too real. This is aggressive, angsty art that really sticks in your throat. ” Perhaps, but one <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> overlook the obvious compassion and implicit optimism that is also apparent in much of their work. Video-based projects such as Belief, A Short Film About War, and Help Yourself for example, give tactile form to an astonishing array of anonymous, disembodied voices that pervade the internet—voices that often convey the alienation, loneliness and quiet supplication that tends to dominate online life. By doing so, the artists not only celebrate and delight in the so-called 'promise' of technology, but “tell us about a networked society's gaze at its mediated self,” as Garrett has written. For writers such as Baudrillard, Postman and Eco that kind of self-reflexiveness was the very definition of hyperreality, which they dubbed the information age. “But,” as Garrett continues, “if we add a contemporary flavor to what hyperreality looks like now in a networked society we come up with hyper-mediality. ” Wake Me Up When It’s Over is just that: a taste of hyper-mediality in all its strange, woeful and endlessly beguiling glory...|$|R
