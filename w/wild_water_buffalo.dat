5|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution, the uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the heterosic hybrid species. When new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact, extinction in some species, especially rare varieties, is possible. Interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool. For example, the endangered <b>wild</b> <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the domestic water buffalo. Such extinctions are not always apparent from a morphological standpoint. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionary process, nevertheless, hybridization threatens the existence of rare species.|$|E

25|$|The mouse deer, a small tusked deer {{as large}} as a toy dog or cat, mostly can be found on Sumatra, Borneo (Indonesia) and in Palawan Islands (Philippines). The gaur, a {{gigantic}} wild ox larger than even <b>wild</b> <b>water</b> <b>buffalo,</b> is found mainly in Indochina. There is very little scientific information available regarding Southeast Asian amphibians.|$|E
25|$|The {{water buffalo}} (Bubalus bubalis) or {{domestic}} Asian water buffalo {{is a large}} bovid originating in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and China. Today, it {{is also found in}} Europe, Australia, South America and some African countries. The <b>wild</b> <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> (Bubalus arnee arnee) native to Southeast Asia is considered a different species, but most likely represents the ancestor of the domestic water buffalo.|$|E
25|$|Gaurs {{are among}} the largest living land animals. Only elephants, rhinos, the {{hippopotamus}} (Hippopotamus amphibius) and the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) consistently grow heavier. Two species that naturally co-exist with the gaur are heavier: the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis). By most standards of measurements, gaur is the largest wild bovid alive today. However, the shorter-legged, bulkier <b>wild</b> <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> (Bubalus arnee) is similar in average body mass, if not maximum weight.|$|E
25|$|Many of the country's {{species are}} {{recognized}} by the IUCN or World Conservation Union as threatened, endangered, or critically endangered due to deforestation and habitat destruction, poaching, illegal wildlife trade, farming, fishing, and unauthorized forestry concessions. Intensive poaching may have already driven Cambodia's national animal, the Kouprey, to extinction. Wild tigers, Eld's deer, <b>wild</b> <b>water</b> <b>buffaloes</b> and hog deer are at critically low numbers.|$|R

25|$|The <b>wild</b> Asian <b>water</b> <b>buffalo,</b> and {{on various}} islands related dwarf species of Bubalus such as anoa were once {{widespread}} in Southeast Asia; nowadays the domestic Asian <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> is common across the region, but its remaining relatives are rare and endangered.|$|R
25|$|Including Sri Lankan elephant, 44 {{species of}} mammals are {{resident}} in Yala National Park, {{and it has}} one of the highest leopard densities in the world. 25 individual leopards are estimated to roam in Block I. The elephant herd of Yala contains 300350 individuals. The sloth bear, leopard, elephant, and <b>wild</b> <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> are all threatened species that Yala is harbouring. Although water buffaloes are indigenous to Sri Lanka, most populations contain genes of the domestic stock or have descended from feral populations. Toque macaque, golden palm civet, red slender loris, and fishing cat are among the other mammals that can be seen in Yala. The elephant population of the park varies seasonally.|$|E
25|$|Purebred {{wild species}} evolved to a {{specific}} ecology can be threatened with extinction {{through the process of}} genetic pollution—i.e., uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the introduced (or hybrid) species. Endemic populations can face such extinctions when new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact. Extinction is likeliest for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones; interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool (for example, the endangered <b>wild</b> <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the abundant domestic water buffalo). Such extinctions are not always apparent from morphological (non-genetic) observations. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionarily process, nevertheless, hybridization (with or without introgression) threatens rare species' existence.|$|E
25|$|Assam has {{wildlife}} sanctuaries, {{the most}} prominent of which are two UNESCO World Heritage sites-the Kaziranga National Park, {{on the bank of the}} Brahmaputra River, and the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary, near the border with Bhutan. The Kaziranga is a refuge for the fast-disappearing Indian one-horned rhinoceros. The state is the last refuge for numerous other endangered and threatened species including the white-winged wood duck or deohanh, Bengal florican, black-breasted parrotbill, red-headed vulture, white-rumped vulture, greater adjutant, Jerdon's babbler, rufous-necked hornbill, Bengal tiger, Asian elephant, pygmy hog, gaur, <b>wild</b> <b>water</b> <b>buffalo,</b> Indian hog deer, hoolock gibbon, golden langur, capped langur, barasingha, Ganges river dolphin, Barca snakehead, Ganges shark, Burmese python, brahminy river turtle, black pond turtle, Asian forest tortoise, and Assam roofed turtle. Threatened species that are extinct in Assam include the gharial, a critically endangered fish-eating crocodilian, and the pink-headed duck (which may be extinct worldwide). For the state bird, the white-winged wood duck, Assam is a globally important area. In addition to the above, there are three other National Parks in Assam namely Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Nameri National Park and the Orang National Park.|$|E

50|$|The {{morphology}} of Bubalus murrensis is {{very similar}} to other Bubalus species like the <b>Wild</b> Asian <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> (Bubalus arnee).

It provides {{one of the last}} wild habitats for the Asian elephant. The Assamese economy is aided by wildlife tourism to Kaziranga National Park and Manas National Park which are World Heritage Sites. Sal tree forests are found in the state which, as a result of abundant rainfall, looks green all year round. Assam receives more rainfall compared to most parts of India. This rain feeds the Brahmaputra River, whose tributaries and oxbow lakes provide the region with a hydro-geomorphic environment.|$|E

It covers an area of [...] comprising grasslands and khair–sissoo riverine forests. It was established in 1976 and was declared a Ramsar site in 1987. The reserve provides habitat for hog deer, spotted deer, wild pig, blue bull, gaur, smooth-coated otter, jackal, 485 bird species including 114 water bird species, 200 fish species, 24 reptile and 11 amphibian species. The last surviving population of <b>wild</b> <b>water</b> <b>buffalo</b> in Nepal {{is found in the}} reserve, as well as gharial, Gangetic dolphin, swamp francolin and rufous-vented prinia. A small population of the critically endangered Bengal florican is present along the Kosi River. There are also records of white-throated bush chat and Finn's weaver.
