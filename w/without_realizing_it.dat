She has a great passion and interest for architecture and she wishes to be an architect when she is older. Although she has a growing love interest in Percy, her feelings for Luke remain a problem between the two. Percy returns her feelings <b>without</b> <b>realizing</b> <b>it,</b> and is oblivious to how she feels about him.|$|E

25|$|After {{giving birth}} to their son, Ricky Williams, Isabella was {{convinced}} that her life would get better. Christine apparently didn't {{want anything to do}} with Paul, so Paul decided to marry and move away with Isabella. Paul's jealousy got the best of him, and he raped Christine, which Isabella later found out about and decided to dump Paul. Isabella was suspicious of a woman named Kelly Simmons that tried to investigate her, <b>without</b> <b>realizing</b> <b>it</b> was Christine in disguise. Paul decided to go back to Isabella and was even ready to move away with her. Christine found out about Michael's plot with Isabella and told everything to Paul. The couple reunited, and an unhappy Isabella decided to have her revenge. She made it seem like Christine had murdered her and, at the same time, she was plotting her next move. While everyone thought she was dead, Isabella confronted Christine in a bathtub after drugging her. Isabella was about to kill Christine when Paul arrived to stop her in time. Christine and Paul reunited but were unaware that Isabella was still alive. Michael came just in time to save Christine's and Paul's lives and Isabella was committed to a psychiatric hospital in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Congress {{passed the}} Coinage Act of 1853 in February of that year. The act lowered the silver {{weight of the}} coins ranging from the half dime to half dollar by 6.9%, though the dollar {{remained}} unaffected. The 1853 act eliminated the practice of depositing silver bullion to be struck into coin, except into the dollar for which a coining charge of [...]5% was imposed. [...] According to the Senate report filed with the bill which became the Coinage Act, these changes were intended as a temporary expedient, with the free coinage of silver to be restored when bullion prices became stable. Sources vary in their explanation as to why Congress chose to exempt the dollar from the silver coinage overhaul: numismatic historian R.W. Julian suggests that it was done due to its status as the [...] "flagship" [...] of American coins. [...] According to Don Taxay in his history of the Mint and coinage, [...] "the silver dollar, which it [...] left unchanged to preserve a bi-metallic currency, continued to be exported and was rarely used in commerce. [...] <b>Without</b> <b>realizing</b> <b>it,</b> the country had entered onto the gold standard." [...] Julian agreed, noting that the act instituted a de facto gold standard in the United States, because it required silver coinage {{to be paid for}} in gold. [...] The silver dollar continued to circulate little; quantities were sent west beginning in 1854 to serve as [...] "small change" [...] in California. [...] Silver prices remained high into the 1860s, and little silver bullion was presented for striking into dollars. [...] To serve collectors, individual specimens were made available to the public by the Mint at a cost of $1.08.|$|E
500|$|Nearly a {{year after}} the events of the first film, Elsa tries to make Anna's 19th {{birthday}} as perfect as possible a way of making up for the years they spent apart. To do so, she works heavily with Kristoff, Sven and Olaf to make this a reality. Upon making sure that her surprise party in the palace courtyard is ready, she leaves Kristoff in charge while she goes to get Anna. However, Elsa starts to come down with a cold as she leads Anna on a treasure hunt to find all the gifts that have been made for her. <b>Without</b> <b>realizing</b> <b>it,</b> each sneeze she makes creates small snowmen called [...] "snowgies", which create trouble for Kristoff, Sven and Olaf. As Anna notices Elsa's cold getting worse, she tries in vain to get Elsa to stop exerting herself, even taking medicine from Oaken in case Elsa gets sicker. Unfortunately, Elsa's cold cause her to become very tired and behave in a seemingly intoxicated-like manner, and she nearly falls from Arendelle's clock tower only for Anna to save her. Upon finally admitting to Anna that she is indeed sick after the previous incident, she allows Anna to escort her home feeling she has ruined everything, and finds that the party has gone off successfully for Anna (as well as discovering her snowgie creations), and still slightly intoxicated, she ends the party by accidentally sneezing into the birthday bugle horn, which inadvertently sends a gigantic snowball {{all the way to the}} Southern Isles and hits the now-demoted Hans, causing him to fall into a pile of horse manure. Afterwards, Anna tells a now bed-ridden Elsa that she has given her the best birthday ever by letting her take care of her.|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{suggestion}} that {{on the day of}} Richthofen's death, the prevailing wind was about 25mph (40km/h) easterly, rather than the usual [...] westerly.

Gradually, <b>without</b> <b>realizing</b> <b>it,</b> she got {{into the habit of}} leaving him to amuse himself, as he best could, for she knew he did not specially care for the pursuits which gave her the keenest joy. In consequence of this unintentional neglect he very naturally fell more and more {{into the hands of the}} bar-room spongers who loitered about the hotel corridors.

60|$|From day to {{day there}} grew upon her a feeling that she had {{subjected}} herself to domination, almost to tyranny from Mr. Greenwood. The man whom she had known intimately during her entire married life now appeared to assume different proportions and almost a different character. He would still stand before her with his flabby hands hanging listlessly by his side, and with eyes apparently full of hesitation, and would seem to tremble as though he feared the effect of his own words; but still the words that fell from him were felt to be bonds from which she could not escape. When {{he looked at her}} from his lack-lustre eyes, fixing them upon her for minutes together, till the minutes seemed to be hours, she became afraid. She did not confess to herself that she had fallen into his power; nor did she realize {{the fact that it was}} so; but <b>without</b> <b>realizing</b> <b>it</b> she was dominated, so that she also began to think that it would be well that the chaplain should be made to leave Trafford Park.

60|$|What {{the devil}} {{was it in}} her that made him so uncomfortable? When in his office he had {{difficulty}} in keeping his mind on matters of import; he would watch her furtively as she went about {{the room with the}} lithe and noiseless movements that excited him the more because he suspected beneath her outward and restrained demeanour a fierceness he craved yet feared. He thought of her continually as a panther, a panther he had caught and could not tame; he hadn't even caught her, since she might escape at any time. He took precautions not to alarm her. When she brushed against him he trembled. Continually she baffled and puzzled him, and he never could tell of what she was thinking. She represented a whole set of new and undetermined values for which he had no precedents, and unlike every woman he had known--including his wife--she had an integrity of her own, seemingly beyond the reach of all influences economic and social. All the more exasperating, therefore, was a propinquity creating an intimacy without substance, or without the substance he craved for she had magically become for him a sort of enveloping, protecting atmosphere. In an astonishingly brief time he had fallen into the habit of talking things over with her; naturally not affairs of the first importance, but matters such as the economy of his time: when, for instance, it was most convenient for him to go to Boston; and he would find that she had telephoned, without being told, to the office there when to expect him, to his chauffeur to be on hand. He never had to tell her a thing twice, nor did she interrupt--as Miss Ottway sometimes had done--the processes of his thought. <b>Without</b> <b>realizing</b> <b>it</b> he fell into the habit of listening for the inflections of her voice, and though he had never lacked the power of making decisions, she somehow made these easier for him especially if, a human equation were involved.|$|E
