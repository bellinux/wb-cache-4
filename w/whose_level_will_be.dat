40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the question whether}} adjudication {{can be viewed as}} a private good, i. e., one <b>whose</b> optimal <b>level</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> generated in a free market. Part I focuses on private courts, noting their limitations as institutions for dispute resolution and rule creation but also stressing the important role that the private court, in its various manifestations, has played both historically and today. Part II discusses a recent literature which has argued that the rules generated in the public court system, in areas of the law where the parties to litigation are private individuals or firms and the rules of law are judge-made, are the efficient products of purely private inputs. Our analysis suggests that this literature has overstated the tendency of a common law system to produce efficient rules, although areas can be identified where such a tendency can indeed be predicted on economic grounds. Viewed as a contribution to the emergent literature on the positive economic theory of law, our finding that the public courts do not automatically generate efficient rules is disappointing, since it leaves unexplained the mechanisms by which such rules emerge as they seem to have done in a number of the areas of Anglo-American judge-made law. However, our other major finding, that the practices and law governing private adjudication appear to be strongly influenced by economic considerations and explicable in economic terms, is evidence that economic theory has a major role to play in explaining fundamental features of the legal system. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to objectively verify whether Horses Assisted Therapy leads to an {{improvement}} of social attitudes in people with autism, analysing, through saliva samples, by the enzyme immunoassay technique ELISA, the hormonal levels of Cortisol and Progesterone and infer the behaviour of Oxytocin, {{before and after the}} therapy sessions. A non-random convenient sample is performed, approaching a group of eight autistic children (n= 8). The results show a statistically significant decrease in Cortisol levels in saliva in Pre-Therapy in relation to Post-Therapy (Pre- Therapy 8. 71 ± 1 ng/ml vs Post-Therapy 6. 58 ± 0. 63 ng/ml). Additionally, the Progesterone levels in Pre-Therapy are significantly less than in Post-Therapy (Pre-Therapy 32. 78 ± 7. 60 pg/ml vs Post-Therapy 60. 05 ± 6. 72 pg/ml). This leads us to determine in an approximate way the behaviour of the Oxytocin hormone, <b>whose</b> <b>levels</b> in Pre-Therapy <b>will</b> <b>be</b> less than in Post-Therapy. We therefore conclude that Horses Assisted Therapies lead to an improvement of social attitudes in the treatment of people with autism...|$|R
30|$|This section reports our {{participatory}} {{research on}} a French literacy course for adults in Luxembourg. The French literacy course {{took place in}} a city in the south of the country, launched in October 2011 by an NGO, Inter-Actions. 11 Our participatory research was conducted from May 2012 to June 2012. During that period, the authors of this paper observed and participated in seven sessions of its two-hour classes, {{in order to understand the}} actual implementation of adult literacy training in Luxembourg, including the profile of the course participants, the organization of the classes, teaching methods and material, and problematic areas for learning. After each two-hour class, we had a debriefing and discussion session with the teacher, where we exchanged information on possible ways to improve the learners’ learning processes and practices. While observing the literacy classroom, we applied a few linguistic interventions to the learners in order to assess their literacy skills and processes. The interventions are divided into phonological interventions and interventions on a textual <b>level,</b> <b>whose</b> detail <b>will</b> <b>be</b> given later. In addition, we also conducted socio-linguistic background interviews with the participants to obtain their profiles. Finally, a rough assessment of their oral and literacy skills in French was made in the course of our class observations and interventions, because there was no such assessment provided by the teacher.|$|R

40|$|Often groups {{need to meet}} {{repeatedly}} {{before a}} decision is reached. Hence, most individual decisions <b>will</b> <b>be</b> contingent on decisions taken previously by others. In particular, the decision to cooperate or not will depend on one's own assessment {{of what constitutes a}} fair group outcome. Making use of a repeated N-person prisoner's dilemma, we show that reciprocation towards groups opens a window of opportunity for cooperation to thrive, leading populations to engage in dynamics involving both coordination and coexistence, and characterized by cycles of cooperation and defection. Furthermore, we show that this process leads to the emergence of fairness, <b>whose</b> <b>level</b> <b>will</b> depend on the dilemma at stake. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
