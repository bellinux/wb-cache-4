Method: Data from the 2004 – 2006 Childhood Determinants of Adult Health Study (age range 25 – 36 years) were used. A lifestyle score [0 (unhealthy) to 8 (healthy) ] was derived from eight behaviours (normal body mass index, nonsmoking,low alcohol, salt, meat and regular fish consumption, leisure time physical activity and skim milk use). Using linear regression to adjust sociodemographic characteristics, we examined relationships between the lifestyle score and blood pressure (BP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, glucose and an estimate of insulin resistance (IR).

40|$|Accepted 19. 11. 2013 Little {{is known}} about the {{subjective}} experience of alcohol desire and craving in young people. Descriptions of alcohol urges continue to be extensively used in the everyday lexicon of young, non-dependent drinkers. Elaborated Intrusion (EI) Theory contends that imagery is central to craving and desires, and predicts that alcohol-related imagery will be associated with greater frequency and amount of drinking. This study involved 1, 535 age stratified 18 - 25 year olds who completed an alcohol–related survey that included the Imagery scale of the Alcohol Craving Experience (ACE) questionnaire. Imagery items predicted 12 - 16 % of the variance in concurrent alcohol consumption. Higher total Imagery subscale scores <b>were</b> <b>linearly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> greater drinking frequency and lower self-efficacy for moderate drinking.

The relationship between the average wearer prickle score and known properties of constituent fibre, yarns and fabrics and fabric evaluation using the Wool ComfortMeter (WCM) was determined using linear modelling. After log transformation, the best model accounted for 87. 7 % of the variance. The major share of variation {{could be attributed to}} differences between mean fibre diameter (MFD) and WCM values. Low prickle scores <b>were</b> <b>linearly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> lower MFD, lower WCM and lower yarn linear density. There was an indication that yarn twist affected prickle scores and that fabrics composed of cotton evoked less prickle. Measures of fibre diameter distribution or coarse fibre incidence and other fabric properties were not significant. The analysis indicates that wool garments can be constructed to keep wearer assessed prickle to barely detectable levels and textile designers can manipulate a range of parameters to achieve similar wearer comfort responses...|$|E

Similar findings were obtained for both Trichogramma species: fitness of wasps was strongly related to wing size and some shape dimensions, but not to the asymmetries of these measures. Wasps which performed well in the field had larger wings and a different wing shape compared to wasps from the mass reared population.

Methods: This cross-sectional study included 34 patients with ALS, on whom DTI was performed. Clinical measures were separately obtained including the Penn UMN Score, a summary metric based upon standard clinical methods. After normalizing all DTI data to a population-specific template, tractography was performed to determine a region-of-interest (ROI) outlining the CST, in which average Mean Diffusivity (MD) and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) were estimated. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate associations of DTI metrics (MD, FA) with clinical measures (Penn UMN Score, ALSFRS-R, duration-of-disease), along with age, sex, handedness, and El Escorial category as covariates. Results: For MD, the regression model was significant (p = 0. 02), and the only significant predictors were the Penn UMN Score (p = 0. 005) and age (p = 0. 03).

This paper presents an experimental study {{of the influence of}} water absorption on the durability of concrete materials. A detailed analysis is also presented in order to establish useful relationship between them. Concrete specimens of different water absorption were prepared through different curing conditions, and results indicated that curing condition can significantly affect the surface water absorption. SEM photos also showed that different curing conditions caused different microstructure. After 28 -days curing, compressive strength, permeability, sulfate attack, and chloride ion diffusion of concrete samples were investigated. As a result, both of surface sorptivity and internal sorptivity have no clear relationship with compressive strength. Results obtained also showed that only surface water absorption related to the performance of concrete including permeability, sulfate attack, and chloride ion diffusion.

Outcomes were large for gestational age (LGA) baby, cesarean section, and spontaneous preterm birth. We calculated the area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUCs) to assess the capacity of OGTT glucose values to predict adverse outcomes, and compared the AUCs of different components of OGTT. Results: 1325 women had a LGA baby (10. 5 %). Glucose measurements <b>were</b> <b>linearly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> LGA, with strongest associations for fasting glucose (odds ratio 1. 37, 95 % confidence interval 1. 30 – 1. 45).

Therefore, {{red blood cell}} (RBC) transfusions and operative time are potential surgical quality indicators. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare peri-operative RBC transfusion and operative time with 30 -day morbidity/mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy. MethodsAll pancreatoduodenectomies (2005 to 2008) were identified using the American College of Surgeons-National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). RBC transfusions and operative time were correlated with 30 -day morbidity/mortality. ResultsPancreatoduodenectomy was completed in 4817 patients. RBC transfusions were given to 1559 (32 %) patients (1 – 35 units). Overall morbidity and mortality rates were 37 % and 3. 0 %, respectively. Overall 30 -day morbidity increased in a stepwise manner with the number of RBC transfusions (R= 0. 69, P < 0. 01). Although RBC transfusions and operative times were not statistically linked (P= 0. 87), longer operative times <b>were</b> <b>linearly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> increased 30 -day morbidity (R= 0. 79, P < 0. 001) and mortality (R= 0. 65, P < 0. 01).

There {{was evidence of}} transient mus-cle injury {{at the onset of}} training (reduced tetanic force, elevated ratio of inorganic phosphate/phosphocreatine in the resting muscle). There was no significant effect of the training on mean muscle fatigability.

Though, evidence is still inconclusive, some preliminary data suggest that arterial stiffness and central blood pressure evaluation can be of use for risk stratification and treatment individualization.

A total of 1002 cases who developed fatal or non-fatal CHD were matched to 1859 controls on the basis of age, sex, and enrolment period. Circulating levels of C-reactive protein, sPLA 2 (women only), fibrinogen, and adiponectin <b>were</b> <b>linearly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> increasing waist circumference and decreasing physical activity levels. After adjusting for waist circumference, physical activity, smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and further adjusted for hormone replacement therapy in women, C-reactive protein, MPO (men only), sPLA 2, fibrinogen, but not Lp-PLA 2 and adiponectin were associated with an increased CHD risk. Inactive participants with an elevated waist circumference were characterized by deteriorated levels of inflammatory markers. However, several inflammatory markers were associated with an increased CHD risk, independent of underlying CHD risk factors such as waist circumference and physical activity level...|$|E
40|$|Background Little {{is known}} about the {{influence}} of blood pressure (BP) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes among Asian populations. Methods We examined population attributable fractions (PAFs) and hazard ratios (HRs) associated with BP in relation to stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) incident and mortality within a cohort of 33, 372 Japanese men and women aged 40 – 69 years, free of prior diagnosis of cancer and CVD. The BP was classified based on modified criteria of the 2003 European Society of Hypertension–European Society of Cardiology guidelines. A total of 943 stroke events, 182 CHD events, 262 stroke deaths, and 120 CHD deaths occurred between the baseline questionnaire (1990 – 1994) and the end of follow-up in 31 December 2003. Results BP levels <b>were</b> <b>linearly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> incidence and mortality of CVD in men and women. According to the PAF estimation, the elimination of normal to severe hypertension would prevent 64 % of stroke incidence in men and 50 % in women; 67 % of stroke mortality in men and 29 % in women; and 38 % of total CVD mortality in men and 36 % in women. The PAF estimate for total stroke incidence was the highest for mild hypertension, and lower for moderate to severe hypertension in both sexes. Conclusions The contributions of normal BP, high normal BP, and mild hypertension to the occurrence of stroke events were greater than those made by moderate and severe hypertension, highlighting the importance of primary prevention and of treatment for low-to-moderate degrees of hypertension...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{association}} of microalbuminuria with outcomes {{in patients with}} different comorbidities. BACKGROUND: The risk of adverse outcomes associated with proteinuria {{has been found to}} be linearly decreasing with even low-normal levels of microalbuminuria. It is unclear if comorbid conditions change these associations. METHODS: We examined the {{association of}} urine microalbumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) with mortality and the slopes of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in a nationally representative cohort of 298, 875 US veterans. Associations of UACR with all-cause mortality overall and in subgroups of patients with and without diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure and advanced CKD were examined in Cox models, and with the slopes of eGFR in linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Very low levels of UACR <b>were</b> <b>linearly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> decreased mortality and less progression of CKD overall: adjusted mortality hazard ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope (95 %CI) associated with UACR = 200, compared to < 5 mcg/mg were 1. 53 (1. 38 - 1. 69, p< 0. 001) and - 1. 59 (- 1. 83, - 1. 35, p< 0. 001). Similar linearity was present in all examined subgroups, except in patients with CKD in whom a U-shaped association was present and in whom a UACR of 10 - 19 was associated with the best outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The association of UACR with mortality and with progressive CKD is modified in patients with CKD, who experience higher mortality and worse progression of CKD with the lowest levels of UACR. Proteinuria-lowering interventions in patients with advanced CKD should be implemented cautiously, considering the potential for adverse outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Background— The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the prognostic implication of myocardial perfusion in patients with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and signs of heart failure, treated with primary angioplasty. Methods and Results— Our population is represented by 1548 consecutive patients undergoing primary angioplasty for STEMI. Congestive heart failure was defined as Killip class > 1 at admission. Killip class <b>was</b> <b>linearly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> myocardial perfusion, enzymatic infarct size, predischarge ejection fraction, and 1 -year mortality rate. Myocardial blush was an independent predictor of 1 -year mortality (RR [95 % CI]= 2. 92 [1. 37 to 6. 23], P= 0. 005) in patients with advanced Killip class at presentation. Conclusions— Our study shows that patients with heart failure complicating STEMI have impaired myocardial perfusion, which accounts for the poor outcome observed in these patients. Further efforts should be aimed at improving myocardial perfusion, beyond epicardial recanalization, to further improve the outcome of these high-risk patients...|$|R
40|$|Background Self–reported {{physical}} activity has been inversely <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> mortality {{but the effect}} of objectively measured step activity on mortality has never been evaluated. The objective {{is to determine the}} prospective association of daily step activity on mortality among free-living adults. Methods and Findings Cohort study of free-living adults residing in Tasmania, Australia between 2000 and 2005 who participated in one of three cohort studies (n = 2 576 total participants). Daily step activ-ity by pedometer at baseline at a mean of 58. 8 years of age, and for a subset, repeated monitoring was available 3. 7 (SD 1. 3) years later (n = 1 679). All-cause mortality (n = 219 deaths) was ascertained by record-linkage to the Australian National Death Index; 90 % of participants were followed-up over ten years, until June 2011. Higher daily step count at baseline <b>was</b> <b>linearly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio AHR, 0. 94; 95 % CI, 0. 90 to 0. 98 per 1 000 steps; P = 0. 004). Risk was altered little by removin...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether socioeconomic status (SES) gradients exist among US adolescents for self-rated health and for 5 diseases that cause serious adolescent and continuing adult morbidity. METHODS: Baseline data from 15, 483 adolescent and parental surveys from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used. SES indicators included parental education and occupation, and household income. Dependent variables included self-rated health {{and the presence of}} depression, obesity, asthma, suicide attempt in the past year, and prior sexually transmitted disease. RESULTS: SES gradients were found for self-rated health, depression, and obesity (P <. 01). Suicide attempt <b>was</b> <b>linearly</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> income (P <. 01). After adjustment for other SES and sociodemographic factors, education and income remained independent correlates of both depression and obesity; income remained an independent correlate of attempted suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in susceptibility to socially mediated etiologic mechanisms of disease may exist during adolescence. Understanding the sociostructural context and patterning of adolescents' lives is crucial to clearly understanding health and disease etiology throughout the course of life...|$|R
