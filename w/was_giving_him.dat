25|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> the option of buying an MLS expansion franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25million whenever he stopped playing in the league – an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract. In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2million home on San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills.|$|E
25|$|Cicero {{understood}} {{what was going}} on and got Lucius Ninnius Quadratus, a plebeian tribune, to oppose every move of Clodius. The latter, fearing that this could result in disturbances and delays outwitted them by deceit. He agreed with Cicero not to bring an indictment against him. However, when these two men lowered their guard, Clodius proposed a bill to outlaw those who would or had executed any citizen without trial. This brought within its scope the whole of the senate, which had decreed the executions during the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC (see above). However, it was actually targeting Cicero, who had received most of the blame because he had proposed the motion and had ordered the executions. Cicero strenuously opposed the bill. He also sought the support of Pompey and Caesar. These two men did not want to appear to have instigated Clodius or to be pleased with his motion. Caesar advised Cicero to leave Rome because his life was in danger and offered him to become one of his lieutenants in Gaul so that his departure would not be dishonourable. Pompey advised him that to leave would be an act of desertion and that he should remain in Rome, defend himself and challenge Clodius, who would not achieve anything if he did so because he would help him. He also said that Caesar <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> bad advice out of enmity. Pompey and Caesar presented opposite views on purpose to deceive Cicero and not give rise to suspicions. Cicero attached himself to Pompey. He also thought that he could count on the consuls. Aulus Gabinius was a friend of his and Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus was amiable and a kin of Caesar.|$|E

McCartney later said that Mills's {{contribution}} <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> an acrylic fingernail to protect a finger on his left hand that often bled after playing guitar. McCartney admitted that Mills inspired him, as [...] "Being in love with her makes me want to write songs", such as [...] "Too Much Rain" [...] on Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, and [...] "See Your Sunshine" [...] ("She makes me feel glad/I want her so bad") from Memory Almost Full. Another composition inspired by Mills was used as the bridal march at their wedding.|$|E

500|$|On 1 June 1906, Hastings married Mary Grundy, the {{daughter}} of retired Lieutenant Colonel F. L. Grundy, at All Saints' Church, Kensington. They had met through his uncle J. Comyns Carr's family, who had brought Hastings to dinner at the Grundys' house. After several meetings Hastings proposed, but the wedding was put off {{for a long time}} due to his lack of money. In January 1906, Hastings became the temporary secretary of John Simon, who had just become a Member of Parliament, and when he left the position Simon gave him a cheque for £50. Hastings and his fiancée had [...] "never had so much money before", and on the strength of this they decided to get married. His marriage changed his outlook on life: he now realised that to provide for his wife he would need to work a lot harder at getting cases. To do that he would need to join a well-respected set of chambers; although Gill <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> briefs he was still in Corbet's chambers, which saw little business.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} that Coon got in touch, Gerrold had just been {{employed}} at CBS as a typist working on scripts such as the pilot of Hawaii Five-O. As {{soon as he got}} the response, he quit the job. Gerrold and Coon met once more, and revealed that the network had recently made a request for more episodes based on other planets. Coon told Gerrold to work up a further pitch. This version of the story added the Klingons, and moved the action from planetside to a space station. During a visit to the set, Gerrold had the opportunity to speak to Leonard Nimoy and ask his advice on how to write for Spock and was allowed to watch the dailies from each day's shoot of the episode [...] "" [...] which was being filmed at the time. This version of the story was entitled [...] "A Fuzzy Thing Happened to Me...", which was purchased by Coon as a plot outline. He offered Gerrold a chance to write the script himself, by promising not to hand it to another writer for a month. However, Coon {{made it clear that he}} was not offering Gerrold a script assignment, but <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> the option of submitting a draft.|$|E

2500|$|Sondheim detested his mother, who {{was said}} to be psychologically abusive and {{projected}} her anger from her failed marriage on her son: [...] "When my father left her, she substituted me for him. And she used me the way she used him, to come on to and to berate, beat up on, you see. What she did for five years was treat me like dirt, but come on to me at the same time." [...] She once wrote him a letter saying that the [...] "only regret [...] ever had <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> birth." [...] When his mother died in the spring of 1992, Sondheim did not attend her funeral.|$|E

[...] Faith is [...] "the most important part of my life," [...] he says. [...] According to family friend Michael Mascitto, [...] "When he started doing some of these bigger stunts, he realized that he was developing a platform, or rather God <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> a platform, to use his abilities for God’s glory". [...] Mascitto says Wallenda's faith has been strengthened as his profile grew. [...] "He truly believes it’s because God has given him this platform for a reason — to glorify Him... Him with a capital H." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Michael Crichton {{was born}} on October 23, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, to John Henderson Crichton, a journalist, and Zula Miller Crichton. He was raised on Long Island, in Roslyn, New York, and showed a keen {{interest}} in writing from a young age; at 14, he had a column related to travel published in The New York Times. Crichton had always planned on becoming a writer and began his studies at Harvard College in 1960. During his undergraduate study in literature, he conducted an experiment to expose a professor who he believed <b>was</b> <b>giving</b> <b>him</b> abnormally low marks and criticizing his literary style. Informing another professor of his suspicions, Crichton submitted an essay by George Orwell under his own name. The paper was returned by his unwitting professor with a mark of [...] "B−". His issues with the English department led Crichton to switch his undergraduate concentration; he obtained his bachelor's degree in biological anthropology [...] in 1964 and was initiated into the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He received a Henry Russell Shaw Traveling Fellowship from 1964 to 1965 and was a visiting lecturer in Anthropology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom in 1965.|$|E
