40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} arising <b>when</b> <b>facing</b> <b>with</b> web data {{is the lack of}} explicit structure (schema), which presence may help in understanding semantics of information. In this paper we present an approach to extract logical schema of a web-site starting from page schemas. We first define a page model aiming to divide the contents into logical sections, i. e. parts of a page each of which collects related information. Then, we define a site model in which both physical and logical links between different page sections are represented; the former are existing hyperlinks, while the latter represent links between sections containing semantically related information. Finally, we show how such schemas can be used to improve both browsing and searching. 1.

40|$|Although gaze {{direction}} and face shape have each {{been shown to}} affect perceptions of the dominance of others, the question whether gaze {{direction and}} face shape have independent main effects on perceptions of dominance, and whether these effects interact, {{has not yet been}} studied. To investigate this issue, we compared dominance ratings of <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> masculinised shapes and direct gaze, masculinised shapes and averted gaze, feminised shapes and direct gaze, and feminised shapes and averted gaze. While <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> direct gaze were generally rated as more dominant than those with averted gaze, this effect of gaze direction was greater <b>when</b> judging <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> masculinised shapes than <b>when</b> judging <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> feminised shapes. Additionally, <b>faces</b> <b>with</b> masculinised shapes were rated as more dominant than those <b>with</b> feminised shapes <b>when</b> <b>faces</b> were presented <b>with</b> direct gaze, but not <b>when</b> <b>faces</b> were presented <b>with</b> averted gaze. Collectively, these findings reveal an interaction between the effects of gaze direction and sexually dimorphic facial cues on judgments of the dominance of others, presenting novel evi-dence for the existence of complex integrative processes that underpin social perception of faces. Integrating information from face shape and gaze cues may increase the efficiency with which we perceive the dominance of others. © 2009 a Pion publication...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of "commitment escalation" originated from decision makers, and is part never encountered by traditional risk control theory. The {{phenomenon of}} commitment escalation frequently occurs {{in decision making}} of an enterprise, which seriously affects cultural establishment and training of core competition of the enterprise. In order to search for explanatory variables of "commitment escalation", authors of this article introduced "self-esteem level" and "sunk cost level" for examination, employed scenario simulation experiment and the analytical technique of contingency table for a statistic test. The research results indicate that, <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> up <b>with</b> {{the high level of}} sunk cost, the decision maker is more likely to choose commitment escalation than <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> up <b>with</b> the low level of sunk cost, no matter the self-esteem level of the decision maker is high or low; <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> up <b>with</b> the same level of sunk cost, the decision maker with high self-esteem level is believed to be much more likely to choose commitment escalation than the one with low self-esteem level...|$|R

5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie. <b>When</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality it was on the right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> {{the threat of a}} killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E

5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible.

Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E

5|$|In early 1943, an {{underground}} Jewish resistance organisation was formed at Treblinka {{with the goal}} of seizing control of the camp and escaping to freedom. The planned revolt was preceded by a long period of secret preparations. The clandestine unit was first organised by a former Jewish captain of the Polish Army, Dr. Julian Chorążycki, who was described by fellow plotter Samuel Rajzman as noble and essential to the action. His organising committee included Zelomir Bloch (leadership), Rudolf Masaryk, Marceli Galewski, Samuel Rajzman, Dr. Irena Lewkowska ("Irka", from the sick bay for the Hiwis), Leon Haberman, Hershl (Henry) Sperling from Częstochowa, and several others. Chorążycki (who treated the German patients) killed himself with poison on 19 April 1943 <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> imminent capture, so that the Germans could not discover the plot by torturing him.

He was originally only {{going to work on}} Aya and Eve, but after seeing the settings for the other characters, he offered to design them too. The team wanted to emphasize the character's sexuality. As part of this, the team included a scene where Aya takes a shower. This was inspired by a similar scene in Parasite Eve II. When the title was being developed for PSP, the team's main challenge with the character was to make her look as realistic as possible while retaining her established physical traits. Using this new realism, the team wanted to portray the fear felt by humans <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> such threats through Aya.

5|$|There is an {{extensive}} scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability {{lies at the}} core of expertise. In his doctoral thesis, Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position. According to de Groot, this perception, made possible by years of practice and study, {{is more important than the}} sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, <b>when</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall (about half a dozen positions in each case). Rather, it is the ability to recognize patterns, which are then memorized, which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game, the masters had almost total positional recall.|$|E
