25|$|The {{wind loading}} on a {{skyscraper}} is also considerable. In fact, the lateral <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> imposed on super-tall structures is generally the governing {{factor in the}} structural design. Wind pressure increases with height, so for very tall buildings, the loads associated with wind are larger than dead or live loads.|$|E
25|$|For {{occupant}} comfort, {{the building}} has a tuned mass damper, which also negates much of the <b>wind</b> <b>load.</b> The damper is electrically activated, so if power failed, say during a hurricane, the damper might not turn on and a much lower-speed wind would suffice; wind of this speed occurs on average once in 16 years. LeMessurier also discovered that his firm had used New York City's truss safety factor of 1:1 instead of the column safety factor of 1:2. These factors, combined, put the building in critical danger. The problems were discovered in June, the beginning of hurricane season, {{and had to be}} corrected quickly.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{engineering}} {{is concerned with}} the structural design and structural analysis of buildings, bridges, towers, flyovers (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, aerostructure and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, <b>wind</b> <b>load,</b> earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be serviceable). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including wind engineering and earthquake engineering.|$|E
40|$|The {{provisions}} for <b>wind</b> <b>loads</b> on flat roofs differ considerably between current <b>wind</b> <b>loading</b> standards in different jurisdictions. For {{a number of}} major <b>wind</b> <b>loading</b> codes, both the definition of roof zones, and the values applied to determine the <b>wind</b> <b>loads</b> are discussed. This paper concentrates on the <b>wind</b> <b>loading</b> zones near edges and corners, with special emphasis on local loads on low-rise buildings.

25|$|The nail's design {{began when}} its inventor, civil {{engineer}} Ed Sutt, {{traveled to the}} Caribbean {{in the wake of}} Hurricane Marilyn. Sutt's trip to the Caribbean was part of a team examining the wreckage of the 80% of the island's homes and business that had been destroyed in the hurricane's winds of 95mph (155km/h). The finding among the homes that had been destroyed was that wood failure was not the cause of destruction; instead, the findings showed that the nails holding the wood together had failed, leading to the buildings' ultimate collapse. Sutt's research began after taking a research assistantship program at the Clemson <b>Wind</b> <b>Load</b> Test Facility, which had received funding through a grant from FEMA. The grant was used to research wooden-framed structures and the relationship of their failure to wind velocity. The outcome of the project's research showed {{that the best way to}} strengthen a structure was to improve the fasteners that held the roofing and wall sheathing to the internal frame, and with this information Sutt signed on as a fastener engineer for the Stanley subsidiary, Bostitch.|$|E
500|$|The curved design offered {{two major}} {{benefits}} {{to the structure of}} the building. [...] First, curved designs, such as that found in Calatrava's Turning Torso in Malmö, Sweden, tend to add to the strength of a structure. [...] A similar principle has been used in the past with curved stadium roofs. [...] In addition to structural support, the curved face of the exterior would minimize wind forces. [...] In rectangular buildings, a fluid wind flow puts pressure on the windward face of the building; while air moves around it, a suction is applied to the leeward face. [...] This often causes a sway in tall buildings usually counteracted, at least partially, by stiffening the structure or by using a dynamic wind damper. [...] Since the curved design of the Chicago Spire would not completely negate wind forces, a tapering concrete core and twelve shear walls radiating from it were planned to counteract the remaining <b>wind</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} has become notorious for an intermittent hum, or howling, which is heard in windy weather, {{emanating from the}} roof's glass blade, and first reported in May 2006 – just weeks after the tower opened. The skyscraper {{was intended to be}} 50 storeys high rather than 47, but <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> tests showed that it would sway too much because of its slender shape and the 'glass blade' façade overrun caused by the height reduction has been blamed for the noise.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{a design}} {{oversight}} and changes during construction, {{the building as}} initially completed was structurally unsound. For his original design, LeMessurier calculated <b>wind</b> <b>load</b> on the building when wind blew perpendicularly {{against the side of}} the building—wind from due north, east, south, or west—all that was required by New York building code. Such winds are normally the worst case, and a structural system capable of handling them can easily cope with wind from any other angle. Thus, the engineer did not specifically calculate the effects of diagonally-oriented [...] "quartering winds" [...] (northeast, northwest, southeast, or southwest). In June 1978, prompted by discussion between a civil engineering student at Princeton University, Diane Hartley, and design engineer Joel Weinstein, LeMessurier recalculated the wind loads on the building, this time including quartering winds. This recalculation revealed that with a quartering wind, there was a 40% increase in wind loads, resulting in a 160% increase in the load at the chevron brace connection joints.|$|E
2500|$|Independent {{tests of}} the nail's stretch were {{conducted}} by several organizations, including Florida International University and the International Code Council. Those tests confirmed what the researchers at Bostitch had claimed, that they had created a better nail. Among all of the different tests, {{it was found that}} the new nail had twice the [...] "uplift capacity" [...] of other power driven nails, as well as increasing a home's resistance to wind and increasing earthquake resistance by up to 50%. For further testing, Sutt asked for the assistance of Scott Schiff, the coordinator of the graduate program in civil engineering and engineering mechanics at Clemson University. Tests at the Clemson <b>Wind</b> <b>Load</b> Test Facility confirmed what had already been stated. With equipment to simulate the force of winds, roofs attached with traditional nails were pulled apart at around 13,500 pounds of force (60.1 kN). At forces up to 16,000 pounds (71kN), walls built with the HurriQuake environment nail showed minimal wall movement. As the pressure increased to 17,000 pounds (75kN), then 18,000 (80kN), then 19,000 (85kN), the walls began to make creaking and groaning noises but they still stayed attached. As the test rig pushed 20,000 pounds (89kN), the maximum it was capable of testing, it gave out, showing that the HurriQuake environment nail sustained 20,000 pounds of force (89kN) and still was not sheared or completely pulled out.|$|E
