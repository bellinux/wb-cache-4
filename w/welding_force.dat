The main studies performed on forces and torque are usually done on plane straight welding path when the processing parameter are developed. As industrializing robotized FSW, the robot structure deformation under FSW load depends on the forces generated on the tool.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine the effect of various weld and machine parameters on ultrasonic weld strength. Specifically, welds with six different triple-layer coextruded polyethylene and metallized polypropylene films were examined. These materials were welded in separate experimental studies using a bench top weld system and a high production volume packaging machine. The first study investigated the effect of a range of <b>weld</b> <b>forces,</b> energies, and amplitudes in a lap joint geometry using a bench top ultrasonic plunge welding system. Weld strength was determined by measuring resistance to tearing and peel and shear strength. It was observed that low energy and low <b>weld</b> <b>force</b> had a significant effect on shear strength welds for all materials. High peel strength was observed at relatively high <b>weld</b> <b>forces</b> and energies, and high tear resistance was observed at relatively high forces, high amplitudes, and mid-range energy levels.

This machine was equipped with an ultrasonic end seal jaw. The machine factors tested in this study include energy, amplitude, and production rate (the rate at which bags are created/welded) to determine the effect on peel strength.

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} {{on energy}} consumption increase the demand of lightweight vehicles. One {{of the most}} efficient solutions is to use multi-material structure. As a solid state process, friction stir welding (FSW) is promising for joining dissimilar materials. However, the processing window for achieving successful dissimilar joints is still narrow. Besides, a large axial <b>welding</b> <b>force</b> is required when steel is involved. In order to address these challenges, a material softening phenomenon, electro-plastic effect (EPE) is proposed to {{be incorporated into the}} process. In this research, first, EPE on various materials is systematically reviewed and a hypothesis is proposed for understanding the softening mechanisms. The effectiveness of EPE is then evaluated on one type of advanced high strength steel, TRIP 780 / 800 steel. Second, traditional FSW process is experimentally studied for joining dissimilar Al 6061 to TRIP steel. Effects of process parameters on joint microstructure evolution are analyzed based on the mechanical <b>welding</b> <b>force</b> and temperature measured during the process. Intermetallic compound (IMC) layer of FeAl or Fe 3 Al with thickness of less than 1 μm is formed at the Al–Fe interface in the advancing side. The maximum ultimate tensile strength can reach 85 % of the base aluminum alloy. Third, analytical and numerical models are developed for friction stir welding of dissimilar materials. For plunge stage modeling, the field variable is introduced to identify regions of steel and aluminum and define the generalized material properties. Conservation equations are separately developed at the two materials interface for the discontinuities. The stable welding stage is modeled based on Eulerian formulation using multiple phase flow theories. The developed model can capture the material and temperature distribution measured from experiments. Finally, high density electrical currents are applied to the FSW process. Plunge stage of FSW is studied on aluminum alloy Al 6061 and TRIP 780 steel respectively. Effective reduction of the axial <b>welding</b> <b>force</b> can be obtained with good repeatability. During the FSW of Al 6061 to TRIP steel, the axial <b>welding</b> <b>force</b> can be consistently reduced under various welding conditions, which is a synergic result of both electro-plastic effect and Joule heating...|$|E

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) {{has been}} {{successfully}} used for joining low melting temperature materials. However, applications in high strength alloys, such as titanium and stainless steel, remain limited due to large <b>welding</b> <b>force</b> and consequent tool wear. Ultrasonic-assisted processes have been coupled with tooling in various manufacturing processes {{in order to enhance}} the performance of conventional machining and bonding processes. We suggest ultrasonic assisted friction stir welding (UaFSW), as a hybrid system, in order to improve the weld quality and welding efficiency of high melting temperature materials. For successful and effective implementation of the UaFSW process, integration of the ultrasonics on the FSW equipment is necessary, while minimizing vibratory effects on the remaining machine assembly. The UaFSW system is being developed and its mechanism needs to be understood using both the experiments and the numerical simulations. FE simulations of the UaFSW using ABAQUS are carried out to examine plunge forces and temperature profiles during the plunge stage of the process. To gain the fundamental understanding and insights of the process, force and temperature measurement, mechanical testing, and defect analysis are used in studying the influence of the ultrasonic oscillations on the conventional FSW system. Taking advantage of the characteristics of ultrasonic vibration, the UaFSW of aluminum alloy enables us to decrease the <b>welding</b> <b>force</b> and enhance mechanical properties of welded part in terms of elongation and yield strength.

40|$|Resistance {{spot welding}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} welding procedures. Therefore, a strong emphasis is placed on the quality of the welds. One of thephenomena that causes the deterioration in quality is the eruption of molten material, the so-called expulsion. Expulsion can be avoided with appropriate parameter selection. The problem, however, lies in the fact that the best quality welds are made with parameters just below the expulsion area. Therefore, for any successful control scheme an efficient and dependable expulsion detection is needed. A linear vector quantization (LVQ) neural network system is proposed to achieve this goal. The network is analysed with different sensor combinations and different materials. The results show that the LVQ neural network is able to detect the expulsion in different materials.

40|$|Friction stir welding is an {{innovative}} weld process {{that continues to}} grow in use, in the commercial, defense, and space sectors. It produces high quality and high strength welds in aluminum alloys. The process consists of a rotating weld pin tool that plasticizes material through friction. The plasticized material is welded by applying a high <b>weld</b> forge <b>force</b> through the <b>weld</b> pin tool against the material during pin tool rotation. The high <b>weld</b> forge <b>force</b> is reacted against an anvil and a stout tool structure. A variation of friction stir welding currently being evaluated is self-reacting friction stir welding. Self-reacting friction stir welding incorporates two opposing shoulders on the crown and root sides of the weld joint. In self-reacting friction stir welding, the <b>weld</b> forge <b>force</b> is reacted against the crown shoulder portion of the weld pin tool by the root shoulder. This {{eliminates the need for}} a stout tooling structure to react the high <b>weld</b> forge <b>force</b> required in the typical friction stir weld process. Therefore, the self-reacting feature reduces tooling requirements and, therefore, process implementation costs. This makes the process attractive for aluminum alloy circumferential weld applications. To evaluate the application of self-reacting friction stir welding for aluminum alloy circumferential welding, a feasibility study was performed. The study consisted of performing a fourteen-foot diameter aluminum alloy circumferential demonstration weld using typical fusion weld tooling. To accomplish the demonstration weld, weld and tack weld development were performed and fourteen-foot diameter rings were fabricated.

Moreover the present work suggests an approach how to avoid this conglomeration of oxide fragments in the weld zone {{in order to improve}} the mechanical properties especially the fatigue properties of FSW-joints. The aim of this work is to determine the characteristics and influences of embedded oxide particles as well as to evaluate possibilities to reduce the oxide fragments in the welding zone. In the cross section these particles seem to be arranged in a continuous line and were identified by as a mixture of aluminum hydroxides and oxy-hydroxide. It is assumed that such particles reduce the mechanical strength because of their considerable higher Young's modulus and the resulting strain incompatibility to the surrounding Al-matrix. The oxide particles, often referred to as 'Root Flaw', 'Kissing Bond' or 'Joint Line Remnant', are arranged along a characteristic pattern transversely and longitudinally to the weld. The formation of the pattern is influenced by the welding parameters <b>welding</b> <b>force</b> {{as well as by the}} design of the FSW-tool. In order to reduce or even to avoid the presence of such oxide fragments in the welding zone, first investigations concerning the surface finish of the samples were carried out. In order to investigate the influence of the oxide fragments on crack initiation the face and root of the weld were removed before tensile tests were performed to avoid cracks caused by the surface structure of the FSW-seam. In particular the ratio of the feed and rotational speed was correlated with the periodical length of the measured forces and the distribution of the oxide bands within the seam. Furthermore the detrimental effect of the oxide particles within the welding zone could be shown. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|E

The {{resistance}} spot welding of two galvanized DP 600 steels with 1. 8 and 2. 0 -mm sheet thickness was investi-gated to enhance our understanding of weld fracture during a well-established au-tomotive quality control test. The effects of several process parameters (including weld current, weld time, and <b>weld</b> <b>force)</b> on zinc expulsion, mechanical properties, defects, and microstructures of {{resistance spot}} welds were all studied in relation with the two major types of weld fracture (i. e., interfacial and button pullout). It was es-tablished that the slight differences in chemical composition and galvanized coating between the two selected DP 600 steels affected negligibly weld microstruc-tures, and were of no measurable conse-quences to weld fracture. In contrast, the difference of 10 % for their sheet thickness was responsible for smaller weld diame-ters, lower <b>weld</b> tensile-shear <b>forces,</b> larger shrinkage voids, and more frequent interfacial fractures in welds from the thicker DP 600 steel.
