The fourth season episode [...] "Still," [...] which focuses only on Beth and Daryl, garnered praise in particular from television commentators, with viewers of the series having shipped Beth and Daryl as a couple. [...] Writing for IGN, Roth Cornet commended the [...] "Still" [...] episode, stating that [...] "Daryl and Beth revealed themselves to be more perfect a fit {{than any of the}} other combinations" [...] and that [...] "they brought out a raw honesty in one another that yielded <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most grounded and engaging character moments of the season. They are two sides of a coin, and that's not something that had been entirely clear prior to this entry." [...] She additionally commented positively on Kinney's acting, saying it was: [...] "...the strongest acting we've seen from Emily Kinney, particularly in that final exchange on the porch." [...] Kinney said that the show was never clear on whether Beth and Daryl had a romantic or brother-sisterly connection, but that [...] "it was a situation where they were getting to know each other. First, they were just trying to get along" [...] because they did not see [...] "each other's point of view very well" [...] and, later, [...] "as the story went along they maybe became friends" [...] and [...] "it started to sort of go, 'Oh, what more could this be? Could it keep going into something else?'" [...] In his review for Grantland praising the fifth season as a whole, Andy Greenwald had particular praise for the characters of Beth and Tyreese, citing their newly established complexities and character evolution in the fifth season.|$|E

Books of fantasy and adventure, the colorful stories of 1001 Arabian Nights, Don Quixote, Gil Blas, and the novels of the eighteenth-century authors Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding entertained and comforted the young boy.

Were any other members of your family involved in baseball as much as your grandfather? How were they involved? Did your grandfather ever tell any interesting stories of famous players that played for the Eau Claire Bears? And <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best stories he ever told you? Did your grandfather ever mention any controversies on the signing of black players to the Eau Claire Bears? Do you know how your grandfather reacted to the folding of the Northern League?

He had spoken about how the Eau Claire team had traveled in hearses that were remodeled for the baseball team to use to travel throughout the North. Those travels had included as well constant repair of the vehicles, especially changing flat tires due to the travel on poorly graveled roads that were common during that time. Another aspect that Mr. White had focused on was of how baseball has always been an essential aspect of Eau Claire.

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{focus of}} this study was to examine the {{administrative}} legacy of two African American women administrators, Maxine Buie Mimms and Wintonnette Joye Hardiman, who administrated The Evergreen State College-Tacoma, Washington (TESC-T) campus for more than three decades. TESC-T is nationally known for its community-based curriculum and pedagogy, high retention and graduation rates, with an emphasis on African Americans. I interviewed each woman individually and together to develop a rich understanding of their perspectives to the following questions: What was your vision for this college in the Pacific Northwest? What was the theoretical framework that guided their leadership? <b>What</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defining factors and strategies used to help combat or tolerate issues of race, class, and sexism in the predominately-white administration, and what do you want your legacy to be? Thirteen evolutionary themes emerged from their interviews such as: find a need in your community and serve it; serve non-traditional students where they are; bring status and credibility with applause; work with people who look like me; inspired by a master teacher; create allies; maintain the vision and legacy; black woman soldiers doing guerilla warfare; being afraid of my own brilliance; external racism can be healed internally; and, it is our sacred duty to make sure that things get passed on. The results of this study helped the author understand the reign of dominion over African American women in college administration as well as recognize the vantage point for all under-represented cultures from the margin. The lessons from this study gave the author the ability to recognize how Mimms’s original model developed for African American students can be used to serve and include all cultures and cultural communities in a way that extends beyond ethnicity.

Situated within Ohio's Core Project, literacy specialists were responsible for assuming leadership by helping to develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions essential for excellent literacy teaching in K- 3 classrooms across the state. They were expected to present a core curriculum to their colleagues, particpate in peer coaching and assist with research and evaluation activities. This inquiry was conducted to discover to what extent literacy specialists were {{able to carry out}} the intended goals of the Project. What were literacy specialists doing their roles and <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most critical ecological conditions that supported or constrained them as they functioned? This multifaceted study of between 20 - 34 literacy specialists located in five separate geographic locations in the state verified that literacy specialists were able to carry out the Core Project's goals to a large degree. Results showed that they have an integrative role, encompassing significant amounts of leadership activities including making professional development presentations and modeling lessons and lesser amounts of instruction and assessment. The ecological conditions they reported as supporting and constraining them as they performed their roles were most closely associated with those that thad to do with the impact they were having on their participants and their collaboration with others to be more effective in their roles. Results of this study showed that when the goals of the project were more clearly understood by everyone involved; when professional development and coaching were reported as meaningful to the participants and when district suport was stronger, literacy specialists reported increased time spent at higher levels of efficacy. The school's culture and teacher willingness were also conditions that further promoted the level of sophistication at which literacy specialists functioned in their role. The implications of this study were described in terms of how policies and initiatives can build the individual capacity of literacy specialists and the local school's capacity for increasing literacy performance excellence in their schools...|$|E
40|$|So {{prominent}} did Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin {{become in}} the field of glacial geology that {{it is a matter of}} some interest and importance to consider what was the status of the science at the time he turned his attention, as a student and a teacher, to it. So voluminous is the literature of this subject that it is obvious that one cannot in a sketch of this kind give even a general summary of the many books and papers on the subject published in this country, even were it desirable to do so. The intention is to indicate only <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most notable investigations and publications. Some of Professor Chamberlin 2 ̆ 7 s most important contributions are undoubtedly woven into the warp and woof of the productions of the numerous men who were closely associated with him and carrying on field observations under his direction. So intimate were these relations that, as the writer himself found, it was sometimes difficult in the end to discriminate between the ideas which the student might feel were his own and those which he had absorbed from contact with the professor. About fifty years before the birth of Thomas Chamberlin, which occurred in Mattoon, Illinois, in 1843, references to scattered erratics, and what was later recognized to be glacial drift, began to appear in the scientific literature of North America. For a long time this material was regarded as diluvium, or the product of transportation by Noah 2 ̆ 7 s flood of biblical note, and many curious explanations were offered as to how this debris was transported and left scattered over hill and dale. The theory of transportation and deposition of the drift of Northern Europe by a continental ice sheet, as postulated by Louis Agassiz in 1837, was put on a firm foundation by the publication, in 1840, of Agassiz 2 ̆ 7 Etude sur les Glaciers, which set forth the results of his own studies, together with those of Charpentier, Venetz, and Hugi. In 1846 Agassiz came to America and he very soon began the application of the theory of field studies of the drift in the United States. By the time Mr. Chamberlin had completed his undergraduate studies at Beloit College, in Beloit, Wisconsin, in 1866, the caution with which the theory of continental glaciation was received, both in Europe and America, had given place to rather general, though not unanimous, acceptance among geologists...|$|E
