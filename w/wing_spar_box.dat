40|$|Morphing, or {{geometric}} {{adaptation to}} off-design conditions, {{has been considered}} in aircraft design since the Wright Brothers’ first powered flight. Decades later, smooth, bio-mimetic shape variation for control over aerodynamic forces still remains elusive. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are prime targets for morphing implementation as they must adapt to large changes in flight conditions associated with locally varying wind or large changes in mass associated with payload delivery. The Spanwise Morphing Trailing Edge (SMTE) concept is developed to locally vary the trailing edge camber of a wing or control surface, functioning as a modular replacement for conventional ailerons without altering the <b>wing’s</b> <b>spar</b> <b>box.</b> The SMTE design was realized utilizing alternating active sections of Macro Fiber Composites (MFCs) driving internal elastomeric compliant mechanisms and passive sections of anisotropic, elastomeric skin with tailorable stiffness, produced by additive manufacturing. Experimental investigations of the modular design via a new scaling methodology for reduced-span test articles revealed that increased use of more MFCs within the active section did not increase aerodynamic performance due to asymmetric voltage constraints. The comparative mass and aerodynamic gains for the SMTE concept are evaluated for a representative finite wing as compared with a conventional, articulated flap wing. Informed by a simplistic system model and measured control derivatives, experimental investigations identified {{a reduction in the}} adaptive drag penalty up to 20 % at off-design conditions. To investigate the potential for augmented aeroelastic performance and actuation range, a hybrid multiple-smart material morphing concept, the Synergistic Smart Morphing Aileron (SSMA), is introduced. The SSMA leverages the properties of two different smart material actuators to achieve performance exceeding that of the constituent materials. Utilizing the relatively higher work density and phase transformation of Shape-Memory Alloys combined with the larger bandwidth and conformal bending of MFCs, the resultant design is demonstrated to achieve the desired goals while providing additional control authority at stall and for unsteady conditions through synergistic use of reflex actuation. These advances highlight and motivate new morphing structures for the growing field of UAVs in which adaptation involves advanced compliance tailoring of complex geometry with synergistic actuation of embedded, smart materials...|$|R
50|$|The <b>wing</b> <b>spars</b> {{were built}} from spruce spar caps with maple {{doublers}} at all attachment points and two 3/32 in balsa shear webs attached to 1/8 to 3/8 in balsa strips on the <b>wing</b> <b>spars.</b> The ribs {{were made from}} 3/32 in balsa. This construction resulted in a balsa <b>spar</b> <b>box</b> with tapered spruce caps. The leading edge was covered with 1/32 in balsa to form a leading edge D spar.

The 32 ft span wing weighed 5 lb and was capable of loads up to 100 pounds.|$|R

The Ko displacement theory and associated strain-sensing system (such as fiber optic sensors) form a powerful tool for in-flight deformation monitoring of flexible wings and tails, such as those often employed on unmanned aerial vehicles. Ultimately, the calculated displacement data can be visually displayed in real time to the ground-based pilot for monitoring the deformed shape of unmanned aerial vehicles during flight...|$|R
