5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
25|$|As a {{young man}} {{growing up in a}} {{conservative}} church, it felt impossible to deal with issues around my own sexuality. It did not feel like a safe environment, and certainly not one in which I could have found support and understanding. So, I came to believe that I had to ignore it and do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the right thing at the time: live a heterosexual life.|$|E

5000|$|Litwack's {{interest}} in history was sparked by The Growth of the American Republic, by Samuel Eliot Morison and Henry Steele Commager (1930). Litwack said, [...] "The textbook {{was my first}} confrontation with history. I asked my 11th grade teacher {{for the opportunity to}} respond to the textbook's version of Reconstruction, to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> distortions and racial biases. (I had already read Howard Fast's Freedom Road.) The research led me to the library—and to W. E. B. Du Bois's Black Reconstruction, with that intriguing subtitle: An Essay Toward a History of the Part which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860-1880. Armed with that book, <b>I</b> presented <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> to <b>be</b> a persuasive rebuttal of the textbook." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concerns}} at {{the heart}} of this dissertation have been with me for at least twelve years when I began to ask <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> simple, answerable questions about capitalism, value and gender. Numerous academics and activists nurtured my queries and gently but persistently encouraged me to search for a deeper understanding of the problematic rather than answers. I owe a great debt to those who started me on this path: Altha Cravey...|$|R
500|$|Liam Cunningham, who portrays Davos Seaworth, {{spoke about}} {{the writing of the}} episode {{following}} its airing, and revealed how he reacted to the scene, saying [...] "It was initially shocking. You know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> my favorite bit, and I said it to David and Dan, it was at that moment when the reveal comes and you kind of go, 'Oh my God,' it puts things into context with Melisandre. It doesn't explain or blah, blah, blah. … It's confirmed like, she's a witch, but there was such a touch of humanity. When she went to the bed and got into the bed and covered herself up… it was like a really striking moment in this weird madness of humanity." ...|$|E
500|$|Racism also shaped {{his lifelong}} {{paradigm}} {{as a team}} player. [...] "At that time", he has said, [...] "it was never acceptable that a black player was the best. That did not happen... My junior year in college, I had <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> {{the one of the}} best college seasons ever. We won 28 out of 29 games. We won the National Championship. I was the [...] at the Final Four. I was first team All American. I averaged over 20 points and over 20 rebounds, and I was the only guy in college blocking shots. So after the season was over, they had a Northern California banquet, and they picked another center as Player of the Year in Northern California. Well, that let me know that if I were to accept these as the final judges of my career I would die a bitter old man." [...] So he made a conscious decision, he said, to put the team first and foremost, and not worry about individual achievements.|$|E
500|$|After the Beatles {{completed}} their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool {{with the growing}} Merseybeat movement. However, they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night. In November 1961, {{during one of the}} group's frequent performances at The Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist. He later recalled: [...] "I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a sort of presence... star quality." [...] Epstein courted the band {{over the next couple of}} months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962. Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg. Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April, when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from what would later be determined to have been a brain hemorrhage. Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. In order to secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan. After a New Year's Day audition, Decca Records rejected the band with the comment [...] "Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein." [...] However, three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone label.|$|E
5000|$|During an {{interview}} to promote his third album, Thicke explained that: I think this album was so different than my last album. The last album I did, I spoke about my personal life {{and the things that}} I was going through at that time. However, since I've been on the road, you just see how many people are either in poverty, or are not able to live the life they want to live, have just given up on their dreams, or have had it taken away from them. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> problems are not problems at all, and I think when I made this record a little perspective kicked in.|$|R

2500|$|During the Australian Cricket tour of New Zealand in March 2010, Clarke {{left the}} tour {{to return to}} Sydney for [...] "personal reasons". In a late night press conference on 12 March 2010, Clarke's {{management}} confirmed he and then-fiancée, model Lara Bingle (now Worthington), had decided to terminate their engagement. Speaking to GQ Australia in November 2010, Clarke said of his decision to leave the tour of New Zealand, [...] "My decision that I made there, was <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> right. I respect playing for my country that much that I thought, if I’m going to let anybody down, I shouldn’t be here — there’s somebody else who could be {{doing a better job}} than me. Going home was the right decision at the time for me. I don’t regret that decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parks {{recorded}} {{only two}} albums during the 1970s, {{but he had}} performed on numerous albums recorded by friends who were working in or around the Los Angeles music scene—notably Harry Nilsson, whom Parks considered the [...] "smartest guy" [...] he had ever met in the music business. During the early 1970s, Parks dealt with prescription drug abuse. He would later say of himself as being [...] "dead for five years", and spent {{the first half of}} the decade [...] "trying to regain an interest in living." [...] Parks later stated, [...] "When I was head of audio-visual services and on the A staff at Warner Bros., a man came into my office and he had a snake and his name was Alice. Right then, I knew that my days were numbered as a person really interested in the record business." [...] Speaking about his department during this time, Parks stated, [...] "I provided that each artist would get 25% of the net profits of the rentals or sales. It was going to be a very promising market for the artist. Warners soon tired of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a fair equation of participation in creative profits, and basically isolated me." ...|$|E

And when I said in the first 'Sleep Song' for instance, 'I'll take off my clothes and I'll lay by your side', they said, 'Hey, you can't bloody sing that. We're not going to sing that filthy stuff.' Saying those things to a stoned musician is ridiculous.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed. If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> so, <b>I</b> {{should not}} be {{here to tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> It <b>is</b> because <b>I</b> believe that you are injured that I am here." ...|$|R

5000|$|Whilst Alexandra {{was growing}} up, the Shulman {{family lived in}} Belgravia and she {{attended}} St Paul's Girls' School.
