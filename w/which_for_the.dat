5|$|English has {{two primary}} tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected {{by using the}} preterit form of the verb, <b>which</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> regular verbs {{includes}} the suffix -ed, and for the strong verbs either the suffix -t or {{a change in the}} stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix -s.|$|E
5|$|I believe few plays {{have ever}} adventured {{into the world}} under greater {{disadvantage}} than this.

And secondly, as it is co-temporary with an entertainment which engrosses the whole talk and admiration of the town.|$|E
5|$|In November 1941, Kesselring was {{appointed}} Commander-in-Chief South and {{was transferred to}} Italy along with his Luftflotte 2 staff, <b>which</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time being also functioned as his Commander-in-Chief South staff. Only in January 1943 did he form his headquarters into a true theatre staff and create a separate staff to control Luftflotte 2. As a theatre commander, he was answerable directly to the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) and commanded ground, naval and air forces, but this was of little importance at first as most German units were under Italian operational control.|$|E

5|$|The South Dakotas {{were able}} to reap the {{benefits}} of developments in radar technology during World War 2. By the end of the war, the ships were equipped with air and surface-search radars and radar fire-control. When commissioned, the ships were equipped with the SC air-search radar. This radar would eventually get replaced by the SK and SK-2 air-search radar. The main battery directors were fitted with Mark 3 fire-control radar, which were replaced by the Mark 8 starting in 1942. This radar gave these ships a significant advantage over the Japanese, <b>which</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part relied on optical systems.|$|E

5|$|The current {{understanding}} of planetary habitability—the {{ability of a}} world to develop environmental conditions favorable {{to the emergence of}} life—favors planets that have liquid water on their surface. Most often this requires the orbit of a planet to lie within the habitable zone, <b>which</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sun extends from just beyond Venus to about the semi-major axis of Mars. During perihelion, Mars dips inside this region, but Mars's thin (low-pressure) atmosphere prevents liquid water from existing over large regions for extended periods. The past flow of liquid water demonstrates the planet's potential for habitability. Recent evidence has suggested that any water on the Martian surface may have been too salty and acidic to support regular terrestrial life.|$|E

5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, <b>which</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{most part}} take {{many species of}} fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E

The passionate vigour with which Asturias evokes the terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of the time makes his work a challenge and an invaluable aesthetic gesture.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{magazines}} and books, Robinson challenged many gardening traditions and introduced new ideas {{that have become}} commonplace today. He is most linked with introducing the herbaceous border, which he referred to by the older name of 'mixed border'—it included a mixture of shrubs, hardy and half-hardy herbaceous plants. He also advocated dense plantings that left no bare soil, with the spaces between taller plants filled with what are now commonly called ground cover plants. Even his rose garden at Gravetye was filled with saxifrage between and under the roses. Following {{a visit to the}} Alps, Robinson wrote Alpine Flowers for Gardens, <b>which</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time showed how to use alpine plants in a designed rock garden.|$|E

The first hearings began at the Supreme Court in April 1985 and lasted {{for the remainder of}} the year. In December, the tribunal handed down life sentences for Jorge Videla and former Navy Chief Emilio Massera, as well as 17-year sentences for Roberto Eduardo Viola. President Leopoldo Galtieri was acquitted of charges related to the repression, but he was court-martialed in May 1986 for malfeasance during the Falklands War. Ramón Camps received a 25-year sentence. The trials did not focus only on the military: Mario Firmenich was captured in Brazil in 1984 and extradited to Argentina. José López Rega was extradited from Miami in 1986, because of his links with the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 9November, about 150 councillors {{gathered}} for a two-day meeting in Stuttgart. A majority of the councillors entrusted {{the leaders of the}} SPD and USPD political parties, who had been invited to the meeting, with the establishment of a provisional government in Württemberg. The Spartacist Albert Schreiner, then chairman of a soldier council, initially assumed the key position of Minister of War in this quickly established first government, <b>which</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time being shared power with the councils. However, he resigned already a few days later, after disputes about the future course of the government. While the Spartacists considered as their ideal aim the kinds of results achieved by the previous year's October Revolution in Russia, the position of the other USPD politicians was unclear and the SPD leaders supported a parliamentary democracy and early elections in Württemberg.|$|E

Two years later, the league increased in size to 23 clubs as more teams joined than left, but Stapenhill resigned midway through the 2001–02 season, reverting the number of clubs in the competition back to 22. The league expanded to 24 clubs for the 2003–04 season, at the end of <b>which,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, Alliance clubs were promoted to the Northern Premier League, rather than the Southern League, when Rocester and Willenhall Town joined the more northerly of the two leagues.

5|$|In 2006 and 2007, {{a number}} of {{leveraged}} buyout transactions were completed <b>which,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. The deal was first surpassed in July 2006 by the $33 billion buyout of U.S. hospital operator Hospital Corporation of America, in which KKR participated, though the RJR deal was larger, adjusted for inflation. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–07 period would surpass RJR Nabisco. The RJR transaction benefited many of the parties involved. Investment bankers and lawyers who advised KKR walked away with over $1 billion in fees. Kravis and Roberts attracted an unprecedented amount of publicity that turned the cousins into instant celebrities.

5|$|No.82 Wing {{accepted}} {{its first}} F-111Cs in June 1973. The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Charles Read, ordered {{that the new}} aircraft be flown with great caution initially, well within operational limits, to minimise the possibility of further damage to its reputation through early attrition. No.1 Squadron was assigned 12 of the initial 24 aircraft delivered. It was No.82 Wing's lead strike force, while No.6 Squadron was primarily tasked with crew conversion training. The wing employed a centralised servicing regime, whereby all aircraft and maintenance personnel were held by No.482 Squadron, which released the F-111s in line with Nos.1 and 6Squadrons' joint flying program. In February 1981, responsibility for operating-level servicing of the F-111s {{was transferred to the}} flying squadrons, <b>which</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time took direct control of their F-111s. No.482 Squadron continued to provide intermediate-level servicing, while major upgrades and complex maintenance were carried out by No.3 Aircraft Depot. These two organisations merged in 1992 to form No.501 Wing, which handed over heavy maintenance of the F-111 to Boeing Australia in 2001. Between 1977 and 1993, the RAAF lost seven F-111Cs in crashes. Three of the accidents involved aircraft flown by No.1 Squadron: in August 1979, January 1986 and September 1993, the last two killing both crew members. In July 1996, No.1 Squadron took responsibility for aerial reconnaissance using specially modified RF-111Cs previously operated by No.6 Squadron. This gave No.1 Squadron five mission types: land strike, maritime strike, close air support, long-range air defence, and reconnaissance. In May 1999 the unit was again awarded the Gloucester Cup for proficiency.|$|E
