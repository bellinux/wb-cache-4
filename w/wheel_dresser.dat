50|$|A {{grinding}} dresser or <b>wheel</b> <b>dresser</b> {{is a tool}} {{to dress}} (that is, slightly trim) {{the surface of a}} grinding wheel. Grinding dressers are used to return a wheel to its original round shape (that is, to true it up), to expose fresh grains for renewed cutting action (including cleaning away clogged areas), or to make a different profile (cross-sectional shape) on the wheel's edge.|$|E
5000|$|Bench grinder wheels {{sometimes}} need to {{be restored}} to roundness and given a fresh grinding face with newly exposed grains. New wheels have suitable balance when first made, but whether the balanced state will last after the wheel has been mounted, and (especially) {{after it has been}} in use for a while, is [...] "quite uncertain". It can seem counterintuitive that they could wear as unevenly as they sometimes do, but a slow spin of the resting wheel by hand confirms it by showing the gap between wheel and tool rest varying substantially as the wheel turns. Thus it is normal that wheels sometimes {{need to be}} dressed (neatly trimmed), which is achieved by any of several types of <b>wheel</b> <b>dresser.</b> When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because the wheels have worn out of round and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing usually resolves this problem. Although some consumers might imagine buying a bench grinder and then using it for many years without thinking about wheel dressing, the need for dressing is not so seldom as that. Correcting the imbalance not only reduces the annoyance of vibration (which rattles the wheel guards and shakes the workbench) but also is important to prevent premature failure of the spindle bearings, as heavy vibration beats them excessively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. By {{applying}} NC {{system with}} three axes ganged function to M 1432 universal cylindrical grinding machine, a NC grinding machine with two moving axes and one circumrotating axis ganged function is designed and developed. Besides two moving axes ganged function, this machine {{has a special}} function of driving the form <b>wheel</b> <b>dresser</b> to circumrotate around the Y axis. Ordinary grinding machine with two axes ganged function canâ€™t machine complicated parts such as seaming roll with steep gradient groove. But a grinding machine with this special function can do this by precisely dressing the form wheel with various aspheric curves. With the set-in PLC function of NUM 1020 NC system and the correlative parameters to be respectively setup, the new machine {{can be used to}} machine some complicated parts such as seaming roll. The system receives machining process codes which is pretreated by computer firstly and dresses the form wheel in DNC mode, then machines parts with the form wheel later...|$|E
50|$|Grinding {{wheels are}} self {{sharpening}} {{to a small}} degree; for optimal use they may be dressed and trued {{by the use of}} <b>wheel</b> or grinding <b>dressers.</b> Dressing the <b>wheel</b> refers to removing the current layer of abrasive, so that a fresh and sharp surface is exposed to the work surface. Trueing the wheel makes the grinding surface parallel to the grinding table or other reference plane, so that the entire grinding wheel is even and produces an accurate surface.|$|R
60|$|Quickly {{he tilted}} the cot against the door, wedging its legs against {{a crack in}} the floor--that would stop them for a minute or two. Then he <b>wheeled</b> the <b>dresser</b> beneath the {{skylight}} and, placing the chair on top of it, scrambled to the seat of the latter. His head was {{at the height of the}} skylight. To force the skylight from its frame required but a moment. A key entered the lock of the door from the opposite side and turned. He knew that someone without was pushing. Then he heard an oath and heavy battering upon the panels. A moment later he had drawn himself through the skylight and stood upon the roof of the building. Before him stretched a series of uneven roofs to the end of the street. Barney did not hesitate. He started on a rapid trot toward the adjoining roof. From that he clambered to a higher one beyond.|$|R
5000|$|In 1843 Bartram {{at the age}} of 16 {{went with}} his {{relative}} Thomas Carter to Western Australia. He firstly worked for Carter at his Merrow Farm Inn - the half way house between Perth and York. He later became a leading farmer in Beverley as well as the Justice of the Peace and postman. He also assisted the presentation Catholic nuns in Beverley even though he wasn't a Catholic. He returned to visit England in 1858 and brought back farm equipment including the first wheat stripper in the Beverley district. Bartram also was the first miller in the district, and built the first police station in Beverley in 1861. Bartram may have brought his horse drawn mill from England. [...] This horse mill was built on [...] "Avondale", 4 kilometres west of Beverley. The property was owned by Nicholas CAREY but leased to James BARTRAM by 1865. He advertised a horse mill for sale in July 1866. He had earlier in February advertised a portable steam mill with French Burr <b>wheels</b> and <b>dresser.</b> This included one pair of new, 91cm millstones. Became the [...] "Avondale Research Station" [...] in 1924. He had returned from England in 1858 with farm machinery which may have included the mill.|$|R
