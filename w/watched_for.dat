5|$|From 1961 to 1963, Ginsburg was a {{research}} associate and then {{associate director of the}} Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learning Swedish to co-author a book with Anders Bruzelius on civil procedure in Sweden. Ginsburg conducted extensive research for her book at Lund University in Sweden. Ginsburg's time in Sweden also influenced her thinking on gender equality. She was inspired observing the changes in Sweden where women were twenty to twenty-five percent of all law students, and one of the judges Ginsburg <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> her research was eight months pregnant and still working.|$|E
5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> it but, as predicted, the Sun was below the horizon during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E

5|$|The rivers were as heavily guarded {{as other}} parts of the border. On the Elbe, East Germany {{maintained}} a fleet of about 30 fast patrol boats and West Germany had some 16 customs vessels. The river border was closely <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> escapees, many of whom drowned attempting to cross. Numerous bridges blown up in the closing days of the Second World War remained in ruins, while other surviving bridges were blocked or demolished on the East German side. There were no ferry crossings and river barges were rigorously inspected by the GDR border guards. To prevent escape attempts, the East German river banks were barricaded with a continuous line of metal fences and concrete walls. At one location, Rüterberg on the Elbe, the border fortifications completely surrounded the village and sealed off the inhabitants from the rest of East Germany as well as the West.|$|E
5|$|To handle {{other forms}} of intelligence, Blamey and MacArthur created the Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB). This {{included}} the Services Reconnaissance Department with its Z Special Unit that carried out special operations like Operation Jaywick; Secret Intelligence Australia; the Coastwatchers, who <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> Japanese aircraft and ships from observation posts behind Japanese lines; and the propaganda specialists of the Far Eastern Liaison Office (FELO). Two other important combined organisations, not part of AIB, were the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section (ATIS), which translated Japanese documents, and the Allied Geographical Section, which prepared maps and charts, and drafted appreciations of the terrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{people in}} the coastal areas, {{most of which were}} already {{affected}} by the more catastrophic Pauline a month ago, were ready for Rick. All major ports along the coast were closed ahead of time in preparation, as well as airports in Huatulco and Puerto Escondido where power failures occurred because of Hurricane Rick. One hundred and thirty Red Cross workers, including twenty that were based in Mexico, who were in the area in the aftermath of Pauline, kept in the area to handle the second hurricane. Many people from Puerto Ángel, Huatulco, and Puerto Escondido (where National Operations Director Bernardino Heredia was overseeing recovery efforts) beach areas were evacuated. During the Puerto Ángel evacuation, helicopters landed carrying soldier and rifles, which one tourist likened to a third-world revolution. In Chiapas, officials <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> flooding along the rivers and upstream river valleys, where the rains from three previous systems caused the ground to saturate and in the state capital of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, families were evacuated due to rising rivers.|$|E

25|$|Transitioning from a {{television}} screen {{to a movie}} meant that sets and designs needed to be more detailed, with {{a higher level of}} polish to stand up on the big screen.

Zimmerman repainted the set, added computer consoles, raised the captain's chair for a more commanding presence, and reworked the bridge's ceiling struts; Zimmerman had always been unhappy with how the ceiling looked but had never had the time or money to rework it previously.|$|E
25|$|Grant ordered Hancock {{to cross}} the Po River and attack the Confederates' left flank, driving them back toward Burnside's {{position}} near the Ni River, {{while the rest of}} his command, in the center, <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> an opening to attack there as well. Hancock's II Corps advanced across the Po, but he delayed his attack until the morning. This error was fatal to Grant's plan. That night, Lee moved two divisions of Jubal Early's corps from Spotsylvania Court House into position against Hancock. On the morning of May 10, Grant ordered Hancock to withdraw north of the Po, leaving a single division in place to occupy the Confederates in that sector, while the rest of his army was to attack at 5 p.m. across the entire Confederate line. At 2 p.m., Jubal Early decided to attack the division, which retreated across the Po without being captured, destroying the bridges behind them.|$|E

25|$|On the Union left, Burnside's IX Corps {{approached}} on the Fredericksburg Road from Alrich, led by Brig. Gen. Orlando B. Willcox's division, {{but they}} were delayed by Fitzhugh Lee's cavalrymen. When they reached close enough to observe that the Confederates were at Spotsylvania Court House, Burnside became concerned {{that he was too}} far in advance of Meade's force and ordered his men to begin entrenching. At this same time, Hancock was reporting from the right flank that Early's men had pulled back from his front. Grant absorbed these two observations and concluded that the Confederates were shifting their men from west to east, opening an opportunity for an attack. He ordered Hancock to cross the Po and attack the Confederates' left flank, driving them back toward Burnside's position near the Ni River, while the rest of his command, in the center, <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> an opening to attack there as well.|$|E
25|$|The rank flag or {{distinguishing}} flag is {{the flag}} flown by a superior officer on his flagship or headquarters (hence the term flagship). The origins {{of this are}} from the era before radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony, when orders were given by flag signals. The flag denotes the ship which must be <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> signals designating orders. Such flags are also flown when leaders of the government (presidents, prime ministers or defense secretaries) are aboard Navy ships, showing the ship to hold the headquarters of highest level of authority for the Armed Forces. Today, with the progress in communications, this flag indicates the obligation of the other Naval vessels to pay the relevant honours (Manning the rails, firing cannon salute, attention, etc.) according to nautical etiquette. In a group of naval ships all commanded by superior officers, only {{the commander of the}} group or the officer of the highest rank can fly his flag.|$|E
25|$|Between 5:00p.m. and 6:00p.m. Schulz {{and another}} man rowed across the harbor {{to see what was}} happening. They {{followed}} the sounds of the shooting until they came to the old citadel. By standing on a bunker at the citadel they could see a long deep trench which was said to have been dug by the Jews the previous day. This was about one kilometer north of the lighthouse. They <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> about an hour or an hour and a half. During that time, three or four trucks arrived at the site, each carrying five Jews. They were forced to lie down in the truck. When the truck reached the site, the driver took the vehicle right up to the trench. Latvian guards, wielding clubs, forced the victims to enter directly into the trench. A squad of five men, possibly Latvians, but more probably German SD men, then shot them in the head. The supervising SS or SD officer then shot again any one not immediately killed.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E
25|$|Jacques Ryckmans, who deciphered these inscriptions, {{writes in}} his La Persécution des Chrétiens Himyarites, that Sarah'il Yaqbul-Yaz'an was both the tribal chief and the {{lieutenant}} of Yûsuf ’As’ar (the king) {{at the time of}} the military campaign, and that he was sent out by the king to take the city of Najran, while the king <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> a possible Abyssinian/Ethiopian incursion along the coastal plains of Yemen near Mokhā (al-Moḫâ) and the strait known as Bāb al-Mandab. It is to be noted that the Ethiopian church in Ẓafâr, which had been built by the king of Yemen some years earlier, and another church built by him in Aden (see: Ecclesiastical History of Philostorgius, Epitome of Book III, chapter 4), had been seen by Constantius II during the embassage to the land of the Ḥimyarites (i.e. Yemen) in circa 340 CE. This church was set on fire and razed to the ground, and its Abyssinian inhabitants killed. Later, foreigners (presumably Christians) living in Haḏramawt were also put to death before the king’s army advanced to Najran in the far north and took it.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the attack}} on 14 July, the RFC <b>watched</b> <b>for</b> German road and rail {{activity}} and on 6 July, a 3 Squadron pilot bombed a troop train east of Vélu; later that morning, more trains were seen in Cambrai and Marcoing (later discovered to be {{the arrival of the}} 123rd Division from Flanders). Reconnaissance over Le Cateau and Landrecies found routine operations towards Cambrai and St Quentin. Next day, the lines from Cambrai and Bapaume to Roisel showed that troops were being rushed to the front south of the Somme and on 8 July, there was a lull in rail traffic. On 9 July, trains were seen running between Lille and Douai, implying more reinforcements from the north and on 11 July, a column of vehicles on the road to Tournai, was seen by a night reconnaissance aircraft from 20 Squadron and thought to be carrying ammunition for the 123rd Division. Aircraft and balloon observation discovered that German units from Thélus to Lens were moving to the Somme (despite rain on 12 July). RFC bombing sorties were directed against the railway stations receiving German reinforcements and on 9 July, six Morane scouts escorted six aircraft of 21 Squadron that bombed Cambrai station, obtaining three hits. Bapaume station was bombed by 27 Squadron and two British aircraft were shot down.|$|E
