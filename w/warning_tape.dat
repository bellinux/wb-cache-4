50|$|On November 9, 1979, Brzezinski was woken at 3 am by a {{phone call}} with a startling message: The Soviets had just {{launched}} 250 nuclear weapons at the United States. Minutes later, Brzezinski received another call: The early-warning system actually showed 2,000 missiles heading toward the United States. As Brzezinski prepared to phone President Jimmy Carter to plan a full-scale response, he received a third call: It was a false alarm. An early <b>warning</b> training <b>tape</b> generating indications of a large-scale Soviet nuclear attack had somehow transferred to the actual early warning network, which triggered an all-too-real scramble.|$|R
2500|$|The pilot's cockpit {{was fairly}} {{conventional}} {{for a large}} multiengine aircraft. The electronic controls were ambitious and advanced for the day. The navigator and DSO's cockpits featured wraparound dashboards with warning lights and buttons, and automatic voice messages and <b>warnings</b> from a <b>tape</b> system were audible through the helmet sets. [...] Research during the era of all-male combat aircraft assignments revealed that a woman's voice {{was more likely to}} gain the attention of young men in distracting situations. Nortronics Division of Northrop Corporation selected actress and singer Joan Elms to record the automated voice warnings. [...] To the men flying the B-58, the voice was known as [...] "Sexy Sally." ...|$|R
50|$|Investigator Peter Kerrigan (Cox), {{assisted}} by Ingrid Jessner (McDormand), investigates {{the killing of}} Paul Sullivan (Dourif), an American civil rights lawyer and political activist in Northern Ireland, whilst he {{was accompanied by a}} Provisional IRA sympathiser. The investigation reveals that the two men were shot without <b>warning.</b> A mysterious <b>tape</b> recording surfaces, made by a Captain Harris, an ex-army intelligence officer, now in hiding, of senior military leaders and Conservative Party politicians discussing how they arranged the rise to power of Margaret Thatcher. Eventually, Harris gives a copy of the tape to Jessner, but British security forces kill Harris, and blame his death on the IRA. Kerrigan is blackmailed into silence about the conspiracy. Jessner still has the tape, but without Harris to authenticate it, the recording can be dismissed as a forgery.|$|R

5000|$|When {{radioactive}} contamination is being measured or mapped in situ, any location {{that appears to}} be a point source of radiation is likely to be heavily contaminated. A highly contaminated location is colloquially referred to as a [...] "hot spot." [...] On a map of a contaminated place, hot spots may be labeled with their [...] "on contact" [...] dose rate in mSv/h. In a contaminated facility, hot spots may be marked with a sign, shielded with bags of lead shot, or cordoned off with <b>warning</b> <b>tape</b> containing the radioactive trefoil symbol.|$|E
5000|$|Barricade tape is {{brightly colored}} tape (often {{incorporating}} a two-tone pattern of alternating yellow-black or red-white stripes or the words [...] "Caution" [...] or [...] "Danger" [...] in prominent lettering) {{that is used}} to warn or catch the attention of passersby of an area or situation containing a possible hazard. It acts as a minor impediment to prevent accidental entrance to that area or situation and as a result enhances general safety. Barricade tape is also known as construction tape or barrier tape or in reference to the safety hazard involved as notice tape, caution tape, <b>warning</b> <b>tape,</b> danger tape or hazard tape. In case the tape is used by an organization the tape is named police tape, firefighter tape or traffic control device tape.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to study current practices in enhancing visibility and protection of highway maintenance vehicles involved in moving operations such as snow removal and shoulder operations, crack sealing, and pothole patching. The results will enable the maintenance staff to adequately assess the applicability and impact of each strategy to their use and budget. The reportâ€™s literature review chapter examines the use of maintenance vehicle <b>warning</b> lights, retroreflective <b>tapes,</b> shadow vehicles and truck-mounted attenuators, and advanced vehicle control systems, {{as well as other}} practices to improve visibility for both snowplow operators and vehicles. The chapter concludes that the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices does not specify what color or kind of warning lights to use. Thus, a wide variety of lights are being used on maintenance vehicles. The study of the relevant literatures also suggests that there are no clear guidelines for moving work zones at this time. Two types of surveys were conducted to determine current practices to improve visibility and safety in moving work zones across the country and in the state of Iowa. In the first survey o...|$|R
