5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} in about 93% of blood transfusions using infected blood. In developed countries {{the risk of}} acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed; for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million and in the United States it <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> 1.5 million in 2008. In low income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008), and {{it is estimated that}} up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections. Although rare because of screening, it is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Si Tjonat was {{released}} in 1929. Although a work of fiction, it was advertised as {{based on a true}} story; this had been common in works of Malay literature {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, including Tjerita Si Tjonat. The film <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> a line of domestic production targeted primarily at ethnic Chinese audiences, following Lily van Java and Setangan Berloemoer Darah (both 1928); film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that this was evident from the predominantly Chinese production team and cast. Native audiences also enjoyed the film, particularly its action sequences. Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes that it was of distinctly commercial orientation, meant only to turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|The American Red Cross ran out {{of funds}} while {{responding}} {{to the effects of}} Juan and the mid-Atlantic flooding, following the previous responses to hurricanes Elena and Gloria, as well as flooding in Puerto Rico; this prompted an emergency fundraising appeal. The agency had provided about $8million worth of assistance to families in southern Louisiana. Along the Apalachicola Bay, the series of hurricane strikes severely damaged the local oyster industry, leaving hundreds of oystermen out of work. The high waves caused by Juan prompted the United States Minerals Management Service to recommend increased inspections on older rigs and improve evacuation plans. Hurricane Juan <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> a series of hurricanes that struck Louisiana coast over many years that contributed to the loss of the coastal wetlands.|$|E

5|$|The Crawford {{expedition}}, {{also known}} as the Sandusky expedition and Crawford's Defeat, was a 1782 campaign on the western front of the American Revolutionary War, and one of the final operations of the conflict. Led by Colonel William Crawford, the campaign's goal was to destroy enemy American Indian towns along the Sandusky River in the Ohio Country, with the hope of ending Indian attacks on American settlers. The expedition <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> a long series of raids against enemy settlements which both sides had conducted throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|The Samlesbury witches {{were three}} {{women from the}} Lancashire village of Samlesbury– Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley– accused by a 14-year-old girl, Grace Sowerbutts, of practising witchcraft. Their trial at Lancaster Assizes in England on 19August 1612 <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> a series of witch trials held there over two days, among the most famous in English history. The trials were unusual for England {{at that time in}} two respects: Thomas Potts, the clerk to the court, {{published}} the proceedings in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster; and the number of the accused found guilty and hanged was unusually high, ten at Lancaster and another at York. All three of the Samlesbury women were acquitted however.|$|E
5|$|The meeting <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> {{a series}} held in Zagreb and Washington, D.C. {{following}} the March 1994 Washington Agreement. The agreement ended the Croat–Bosniak War, re-allied the ARBiH and the HVO against the VRS and provided Croatia with US military advisors from the Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI). MPRI was hired because a UN arms embargo {{was still in}} place, ostensibly to prepare the HV for NATO Partnership for Peace programme participation. The organization trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It was also speculated that the MPRI also provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite information to Croatia. MPRI and Croatian officials dismissed such speculation. In November 1994, the US unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments entered through Croatia. The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by President Bill Clinton since February 1993.|$|E
5|$|Maternal age {{affects the}} chances of having a {{pregnancy}} with Down syndrome. At age 20, the chance <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> 1441; at age 30, it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> 959; at age 40, it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> 84; and at age 50 it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> 44. Although the probability increases with maternal age, 70% of children with Down syndrome are born to women 35 {{years of age and}} younger, because younger people have more children. The father's older age is also a risk factor in women older than 35, but not in women younger than 35, and may partly explain the increase in risk as women age.|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} two other {{highways}} to bear the M-84 moniker. The first <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the Upper Peninsula and the second was in The Thumb area. The current highway was originally part of M-47 until that road was relocated onto what was formerly US10 in the Tri-Cities area. Since the 1960s reuse of the number, M-84 has been extended in the 1970s to replace part of Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75, now Business Spur I-75, BS I-75) in Bay City. Other projects have reconstructed and widened the roadway through the Bay City area in the early 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, the Royal African Company was inaugurated, {{receiving}} from King Charles {{a monopoly}} {{of the trade}} to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean. From the outset, slavery was {{the basis of the}} British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of its slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic. To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as James Island, Accra and Bunce Island. In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25% in 1650 to around 80% in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10% to 40% over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies). For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol and Liverpool, which formed the third corner of the triangular trade with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the Middle Passage <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> seven.|$|E
