5|$|In the pre-digital period, IBM offered Aldine, a font {{inspired}} by Bembo, as a font for the IBM Composer. This was an ultra-premium electric golfball typewriter system, intended for producing copy to be photographically enlarged for small-scale printing projects, or for high-quality office documents. Ultimately the system proved a transitional product, {{as it was}} displaced by cheaper phototypesetting, {{and then in the}} 1980s by <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> and general-purpose computers.|$|E

25|$|While {{many homes}} have <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> on their computers, word {{processing}} {{in the home}} tends to be educational, planning or business related, dealing with school assignments or work being completed at home. Occasionally <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> are used for recreational purposes, e.g. writing short stories, poems or personal correspondence. Some use <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> to create résumés and greeting cards, {{but many of these}} home publishing processes have been taken over by web apps or desktop publishing programs specifically oriented toward home uses. The rise of email and social networks has also reduced the home role of the word processor as uses that formerly required printed output can now be done entirely online.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{business}} world, <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> are extremely useful tools. Some typical uses include: creating legal documents, company reports, publications for clients, letters, and internal memos.

25|$|Although {{the early}} <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> evolved to use {{tag-based}} markup for document formatting, most modern <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> {{take advantage of}} a graphical user interface providing some form of what-you-see-is-what-you-get ("WYSIWYG") editing. Most are powerful systems consisting of one or more programs that can produce a combination of images, graphics and text, the latter handled with type-setting capability. Typical features of a modern word processor include multiple font sets, spell checking, grammar checking, a built-in thesaurus, automatic text correction, web integration, HTML conversion, pre-formatted publication projects such as newsletters and to-do lists, and much more.|$|E

40|$|In this paper. {{we report}} on our {{experience}} with a utility which converts files written with the ChiWriter scientific <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> into files. With this converter, it is feasible to write a manuscript in a "what-you-see-is-what-you-get" (WYSIWYG) fashion, with all fonts, special symbols, mathematical formulas, and tables displayed correctly on the screen during editing, and to translate the document into for publication. This method has several advantages over typing straight code. The <b>word</b> <b>processor</b> is easier to learn, and {{it is easier to}} revise material that is displayed on the screen without codes.

25|$|Electric Pencil, {{released}} in December 1976, {{was the first}} word processor software for microcomputers. Software-based <b>word</b> <b>processors</b> running on general-purpose personal computers gradually displaced dedicated <b>word</b> <b>processors,</b> and the term came to refer to software rather than hardware. Some programs were modeled after particular dedicated WP hardware. MultiMate, for example, was written for an insurance company that had hundreds of typists using Wang systems, and spread from there to other Wang customers. To adapt to the smaller, more generic PC keyboard, MultiMate used stick-on labels and a large plastic clip-on template to remind users of its dozens of Wang-like functions, using the shift, alt and ctrl keys with the 10 IBM function keys {{and many of the}} alphabet keys.|$|E
