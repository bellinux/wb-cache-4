5|$|Once Allied troops <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> some German {{units used}} the Rommelspargel for defense, by cutting {{them down and}} using the logs to {{reinforce}} impromptu positions. Sturmmann Karl Vasold of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend described how his unit dug in under fire in a tank trench and foxholes on the road from Buron to Villons-les-Buissons, and used cut-down Rommelspargel poles to cover their positions and protect them from enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} left Hastings—{{approximately}} 15 minutes' flying {{time from the}} West Side Boys' camp—at approximately 06:15. Downstream from the villages—approximately 15 minutes' flying time, {{just out of the}} West Side Boys' visual and hearing range, the helicopters went into a holding pattern to allow the SAS observation teams time to get into position to prevent the West Side Boys from attacking any of the captives before the extraction teams <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Once the observation teams were in position, the helicopters proceeded up the line of Rokel Creek, the Chinooks flying low enough that the downdraft tore off the corrugated iron roofs of several huts in the villages, including the roof of the building in which the Royal Irish were being held. As the helicopters approached, the SAS observation team at Gberi Bana engaged West Side Boys {{in the vicinity of the}} captives to prevent any gang members from attempting to kill them before the area was secured. Upon their arrival, the two Lynx attack helicopters strafed the villages to make the landing zones as safe as possible for the Chinooks and destroy the heavy weapons that had been identified by the SAS observation teams.|$|E
5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E

The Elite Hall had capacity for nearly 500 people and included a stage with an elaborately carved proscenium. At the other end was the Elite Dining Saloon, described as having ‘elegant appointments’. His teahouses were popular with high society and VIPs, with members of the 1891 Federation Convention dining at the Elite Hall.|$|E
25|$|Seven F5s were observed—one each in Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, {{three in}} Alabama {{and the final}} one which crossed through parts of Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. 31 were killed in Brandenburg, Kentucky, and 28 died in Guin, Alabama.

During the peak of the outbreak, a staggering sixteen tornadoes <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> simultaneously. At one point forecasters in Indiana, frustrated because they could not keep up with all of the simultaneous tornado activity, put the entire state of Indiana under a blanket tornado warning. This was the first and only time in U.S. history that an entire state was under a tornado warning.|$|E

25|$|Charlie Company was {{the only}} {{complete}} company at Mary Ann due to operations south and east of the FSB near a location called Landing Zone (LZ) Mildred. Companies A and B, 1-46th Inf, <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in that area of operations, {{and some of the}} artillery previously located at Mary Ann had been moved to LZ Mildred to support operations there (including the 81mm mortars assigned to both companies and the heavy 4.2-inch mortars normally part of Company E). Prior to the attack, the attention of the Battalion commander (LtCol Doyle) was focused more on operations near LZ Mildred. In fact, the Battalion command post was scheduled to move there on 28 March. This impending move led to a freeze on all new construction at Mary Ann, including fencing to block the roads leading out of the FSB.|$|E
25|$|Insects {{that had}} evolved their proto-wings {{in a world}} without flying predators could afford to be exposed openly without risk, but this changed when {{carnivorous}} flying insects evolved. It is unknown when they first evolved, but once these predators had emerged they put a strong selection pressure on their victims and themselves. Those of the prey {{who came up with}} a good solution about how to fold their wings over their backs {{in a way that made}} it possible for them to live in narrow spaces would not only be able to hide from flying predators (and terrestrial predators if they <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground)</b> but also to exploit a wide variety of niches that were closed to those who couldn't fold their wings in this way. And today the neopterous insects (those that can fold their wings back over the abdomen) are by far the most dominant group of insects.|$|E

The Chinooks were equipped with 7.62mm GAU-17/A miniguns and GAU-21/B [...]50-caliber machine guns and extra fuel for the Black Hawks. Their mission was to interdict any Pakistani military attempts {{to interfere with the}} raid. Other Chinooks, holding 25 more SEALs from DEVGRU, were stationed just across the border in Afghanistan in case reinforcements were needed during the raid.|$|E
500|$|Manyon {{continued}} to narrate as the programme reconstructed the IRA team's movements through Gibraltar towards the border until McCann and Farrell reached a petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. [...] "Then, suddenly", Manyon told viewers, [...] "shots rang out, and {{in less than}} a minute all three terrorists were dead—shot by the SAS". The commentary again cut to Howe's statement, after which Manyon detailed This Week investigation. He introduced the four eyewitnesses the journalists had discovered (Diana Treacy, Josie Celecia, Stephen Bullock, and Carmen Proetta). Celecia described witnessing McCann and Farrell walking along Winston Churchill Avenue before hearing several shots, and then seeing a soldier continue to fire at the pair while they <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Proetta told the programme she saw a police car arrive opposite the petrol station, that three armed men in plain clothes then disembarked, jumped across the central barrier, and shot McCann and Farrell while the latter had their hands up. Bullock was interviewed walking the route he had walked on the day of the shootings; his account was of two men in plain clothes shooting McCann and Farrell at very close range and continuing to shoot as the pair fell and while they <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Treacy, meanwhile, was walking along Landport Lane when Savage ran past her, pursued by at least one soldier. She stated that she did not hear any warning before Savage was shot; she ran away after the shooting began. Asquez was not named in the broadcast; his statement—that he saw a soldier firing at Savage while the latter was on the ground—was read out by an actor.|$|E

500|$|Another {{change was}} due to {{every part of the}} {{equipment}} having different power requirements. The tubes for the transmitter used 6V to heat their filaments, but 4V was needed for the receiver tubes and 2V for the filament of the CRT. The CRT also [...] needed 800V for its electron gun, but the transmitter tubes 1000V for their modulators (drivers). At first, the team used motor-generator sets placed in the Anson and Battle fuselages, or batteries connected in various ways as in the earliest sets in the Heyfords. Bowen decided the solution was to build a power supply that would produce all of these DC voltages from a single 240V 50Hz supply using transformers and rectifiers. This would allow them to power the radar systems using mains power while the aircraft <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E
500|$|Aside from {{experts and}} {{security}} personnel, several eyewitnesses gave {{evidence to the}} inquest. Three witnessed parts of the shootings, and gave accounts which supported the official version of events—in particular, they did not witness the SAS shooting any of the suspects while {{they were on the}} floor. Witnesses uncovered by the journalists making [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] also appeared: Stephen Bullock repeated his account of seeing McCann and Savage raise their hands before the SAS shot them; Josie Celecia repeated her account of seeing a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Hucker pointed out that parts of Celecia's testimony had changed since she spoke to [...] "Death on the Rock", and suggested that the gunfire she heard was from the shooting of Savage rather than sustained shooting of McCann and Farrell while they <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> a suggestion Celecia rejected; the SAS's lawyer further observed that she was unable to identify the military personnel in photographs her husband had taken. Maxie Proetta told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car the Proettas saw was the one being driven by Inspector Revagliatte, carrying four uniformed police officers rather than plain-clothed soldiers, but Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' version did not make sense. His wife gave evidence the following day. Contrary to her statement to [...] "Death on the Rock", Carmen Proetta was no longer certain that she had seen McCann and Farrell shot while on the ground. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown.|$|E
500|$|By 4:00pm on August 15, a {{total of}} 6,500 troops <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> {{on the west side}} of Kiska. The Canadian {{contingent}} came ashore on the north side of the island the next day. However, the invasion was an embarrassment for the Allied forces. The island of Kiska was, in fact, uninhabited – the entire Japanese force of 5,183 men had left the island on July 28 without the Americans noticing. However, the Americans suffered significant casualties during their 'invasion' – 313 men died as a result of accidents, with many dying due to accidental fire. Of the total 313 dead, 70 died when the destroyer USS Abner Read struck a mine, while at least 21 died due to friendly fire. The Japanese had completely deserted their buildings on the island, leaving behind them scrawled messages on the walls for the Allied troops to read – most attacked President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill; for example, one of the messages read, in a mixture of English and German, [...] "You are dancing by foolische order of Rousebelt." ...|$|E
