40|$|This dissertation, {{consisting}} of one systematic review and two empirical studies, {{aims to examine}} the relationship between English vocabulary knowledge and English <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> with a sample of Chinese-speaking 8 th and 9 th graders. As the findings reveal, the vocabulary-writing relationship varies with dimensions of vocabulary knowledge. Specifically, vocabulary breadth consistently contributes to <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> across grades whereas vocabulary depth displays a stronger predictive power for <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> in the 9 th grade. Additionally, after-class English literacy experiences exert indirect effects on the 9 th graders? <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> through overall vocabulary knowledge. The systematic review of the current literature synthesizes the role of English vocabulary in English language learners? (ELLs) writing development. Though, overall, vocabulary breadth has a more prominent role than vocabulary depth in ELLs? <b>writing</b> <b>quality,</b> productive vocabulary depth may still significantly predict their writing performance. Learning contexts, students? English proficiency, scoring rubrics, and vocabulary measures are possible factors mediating the vocabulary-writing relationship. The first empirical study looks into the relationship between vocabulary breadth, vocabulary depth, and writing abilities with the 8 th and 9 th graders. Measures include tests of vocabulary size, word association, and morphological awareness, and English writing samples. Standard multiple regression analyses show that vocabulary breadth makes a bigger contribution to writing performance across grades. However, some aspect of vocabulary depth is only related to the 9 th graders? writing performance, suggesting a growing impact of vocabulary depth on writing development. Using the same sample of students, the second empirical study investigates: (1) the relative contribution of vocabulary knowledge, grammatical knowledge, and idea-generating ability to writing quality; (2) the impact of individual motivation and after-class English literacy experiences on <b>writing</b> <b>quality.</b> In addition to the measures utilized in the first empirical study, this study also utilizes a background questionnaire and tests of grammar and idea-generating ability. Path analyses identify overall vocabulary knowledge as the most prominent predictor of the <b>students?</b> <b>writing</b> <b>quality.</b> Furthermore, the 9 th graders? after-class literacy activities have a significant, yet indirect relationship with writing through vocabulary. Therefore, it is likely that the contribution from the literacy activities to ELLs? early writing development may be mediated by their language proficiency levels...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there was a significant difference between students who completed a service-learning component and those who did not complete a service-learning component in the areas of student achievement of learning outcomes and perceptions of the course. Proponents of service-learning claim that <b>students</b> <b>write</b> higher <b>quality</b> papers and are more engaged, motivated, and satisfied when they complete a service-learning component. However, these findings are largely based on anecdotal and qualitative evidence that lack empirical evidence to strengthen these claims. This study employed a quasi-experimental design using static group comparison to measure differences between the groups. Student perceptions of the course were measured by the Academic <b>Writing</b> <b>Student</b> Perceptions Scales that demonstrated high reliability through Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s alpha.

Thus, this study followed a quasi-experimental design along twelve weeks with third grade students of the Elementary School in the context of an intervention designed to promote self-regulation strategies in writing. The current study aimed to deepen our understanding about how struggling writers perceive and use the feedback provided by their teachers, and also how the different emerging feedback profiles are related with <b>students</b> <b>writing.</b> Three feedback profiles related to students’ perception about the feedback provided by the teacher and students will to use it, were identified as follows: low feedback profile, medium feedback profile and high feedback profile. The feedback profiles are consistent in all variables analyzed: self-regulation in writing, attitude towards <b>writing</b> and <b>writing</b> <b>quality.</b> Findings have shown that the majority of students were able to use the feedback provided by the teacher, perceiving it as useful to improve their written compositions.

40|$|Word {{processors}} {{are being}} increasingly used as writing tools during writing instruction for novice writers in {{all levels of}} school. However, the research {{on the use of}} word processors by novice writers indicated that while using the word processor for writing has a positive impact on writing attitudes of novice writers, their <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> was not necessarily improved. Research on the writing process indicated that what was missing from the word processor-writer partnership was support, both memory and procedural, during the writing process. The focus of the study, the Writing Partner computer tool, was designed to supply such support by providing expert-like metacognitive guidance in the form of procedural facilitation during the writing process. In addition, research indicated that those students who mindfully engaged in using such a computer tool were more likely to internalize the guidance provided by such a tool, exhibiting improved performance in partnership with the tool as well as without it. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate empirically the effects of the Writing Partner on <b>writing</b> <b>quality,</b> <b>writing</b> attitudes, writing perceived self-efficacy and perceptions of the classroom environment. Data were collected in the form of writing samples, questionnaires and interviews and observations. Two conditions were examined: (1) <b>Students</b> who <b>wrote</b> with the Writing Partner, and (2) <b>students</b> who <b>wrote</b> with the Writing Partner and were induced to mindfulness by being told they would later tutor others in the use of the tool.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} long-standing tradition in education of sharing and publishing students’ unintentionally amusing mistakes. Often called “bloopers,” “boners,” and “howlers,” students’ writing mistakes {{have been published}} in print since at least the early 20 th century and more recently online. Using theories of reading <b>student</b> <b>writing,</b> academic discourse, ethics, and humor, this project analyzes the misconceptions that teachers and public audiences have of <b>students,</b> re-reads <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> for its potential, and explores the ethical implications of sharing student work with public audiences. The first two chapters ground the reader in the historical, social, and cultural contexts in which teachers share or publish <b>student</b> <b>writing.</b> The culture of remediation, persistent in K- 12 and higher education contexts, shapes readings of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> that prioritize correctness. Collections of student “bloopers” imply aspects of teacher-student relationships; thus these relationships can be re-thought {{not only in terms of}} broader models like remediation, but also through the practices that help define those relationships, such as methods of reading and assessing <b>student</b> <b>writing.</b> The third chapter reviews several frameworks related to ethical uses of <b>student</b> <b>writing,</b> such as those embraced by professional organizations and institutional guidelines. Through a closer look at the value of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> from a research perspective, this chapter explores the tension between the treatment of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> in research and the treatment of <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> in teaching. Meanwhile, the fourth chapter provides an extensive re-reading of several published student excerpts on the website Shit My <b>Students</b> <b>Write.</b> Through the application of humor theory, we can acknowledge the aspects of student error that prompt teachers to be humored while also interrogating the assumptions and misconceptions about error that inform why we are humored.

40|$|Second {{language}} writing teachers face numerous challenges when providing {{feedback on}} <b>student</b> <b>writing.</b> There {{may be so}} many problems in the writing that is almost {{impossible for them to}} focus on or they may constantly seek a better method of giving feedback on <b>student</b> <b>written</b> errors. This paper attempts to provide second language writing teachers with some key considerations in providing written feedback. To begin with, the author reviews reasons supporting the practice of giving feedback on <b>student</b> <b>written</b> errors. Next, he presents a typology of written errors and discussed different ways of offering corrective feedback. Finally, he summarizes key considerations in giving feedback on <b>student</b> <b>written</b> errors in a table...|$|R
40|$|There {{were two}} {{goals of the}} present study. The first {{was to create a}} scoring scheme by which 9 -year-old Chinese children's writing {{compositions}} could be rated to form a total score for <b>writing</b> <b>quality.</b> The second was to examine cognitive correlates of <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> at age 9 from measures administered at ages 6 - 9. Age 9 writing compositions were scored using a 7 -element rubric; following confirmatory factor analyses, 5 of these elements were retained to represent overall <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> for subsequent analyses. Measures of vocabulary knowledge, Chinese word dictation, phonological awareness, speed of processing, speeded naming, and handwriting fluency at ages 6 - 9 were all significantly associated with the obtained overall <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> measure even when the statistical effect of age was removed. With vocabulary knowledge, dictation skill, age, gender, and phonological awareness included in a regression equation, 35 % of the variance in age 9 <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> was explained. With the variables of speed of processing, speeded naming, and handwriting fluency additionally included as a block, 12 % additional variance in the equation was explained. In addition to gender, overall unique correlates of <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> were dictation, speed of processing, and handwriting fluency, underscoring the importance of both general automaticity and specific writing fluency for <b>writing</b> <b>quality</b> development in children. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|This {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of Process Genre and Product Genre Approaches to teach writing to introvert and extrovert students. A quasi-experimental study with 2 x 2 factorial designs was conducted to gain answers. Data were collected by using Myers Briggs Type Indicator, observation notes and a pre-and-posttest. Data were analyzed by using T-test, Two-Way Anova, and Tukey test. The findings revealed that first, Process Genre Approach was significantly effective {{to be used to}} teach writing to both the introvert and extrovert students; while, the Product Genre Approach was only effective to be used to teach writing to the extrovert students. Second, quantitatively, the Process Genre Approach was not significantly more effective to be used to teach writing compared to the Product Genre Approach. Third, the students‟ personalities significantly influenced their <b>writing</b> <b>quality,</b> in which the extrovert students‟ writings were better than the introvert students‟ writings. Fourth, there was a significant interaction occurred between the teaching approaches and the students‟ personalities on their <b>writing</b> <b>quality.</b> Based on the study results, the researcher suggests English teachers to consider using Process Genre Approach in their writing classes and identify each student‟s personality in the very beginning of lessons, acknowledging that the students‟ personalities significantly influence the students‟ <b>writing</b> <b>quality.</b> Keywords: Process Genre Approach; <b>Student’s</b> Personality; <b>Writing</b> Instructio...|$|R
