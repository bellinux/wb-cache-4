5|$|In 1989, Boris Chirikov and Vitaly Vecheslavov {{performed}} {{an analysis of}} 46 apparitions of Halley's Comet taken from historical records and computer simulations. These studies showed that its dynamics were chaotic and unpredictable on long timescales. Halley's projected lifetime could be as long as 10million years. More recent work suggests that Halley will evaporate, or split in two, <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> {{tens of thousands of}} years, or will be ejected from the Solar System within a few hundred thousand years. Observations by D.W. Hughes suggest that Halley's nucleus has been reduced in mass by 80–90% over the last 2000–3000 revolutions.|$|E

30|$|Irrespective {{of storage}} conditions, {{the rates of}} {{respiratory}} CO 2 release of log sections remained high {{during the first two}} weeks post harvest and declined rapidly <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> a <b>few</b> weeks as logs become dehydrated. Respiration rates at a given storage time increased nearly 50 % for every 10 °C increase in temperature from 10 to 40 °C. Drying logs for 4 – 6 weeks before fumigation treatment at moderate temperature may help to achieve consistent fumigation results, prevent life-threatening conditions and to reduce transportation cost.|$|R
5|$|After the First Opium War, Hong Kong was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and {{the colony}} {{soon became a}} popular {{stopover}} for missionaries travelling onwards to China. The parish was established in 1842 by Theodore Joset, the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong, and work began on a new and permanent church soon afterwards. The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street. Construction was completed in 1843. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> years, the number of Catholics in the parish grew significantly, {{partly due to the}} emigration of people from neighbouring Macau. The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline, and many people who resided there sought better opportunities in the young and prospering colony of Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an oestrus ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each oestrus lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus. Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression toward one another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a few more times <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> days. Polyandrous, females can mate with several males. The mean number of motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E

30|$|Irrespective {{of storage}} conditions, {{the rates of}} {{respiratory}} CO 2 release of log sections remained high {{during the first two}} weeks post harvest and declined rapidly <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> a <b>few</b> weeks as logs become dehydrated. A logical recommendation for the forestry industry would be to apply fumigation treatments after 4 – 6 weeks post harvest to reduce the interference with insecticides. The respiration rate increased nearly 50 % for every 10 °C increase in temperature so the CO 2 issue is exacerbated during the warm summer months when a temperature-driven stimulation of respiratory processes will result in very high CO 2 concentrations in ship holds. Also, because respiratory processes are strongly dependent on moisture availability, any actions that can be taken to accelerate moisture loss will mitigate the CO 2 issue.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of black holes and of spacetime singularities {{is a fundamental}} issue in science. Despite this, observations supporting their existence are scarce, and their interpretation unclear. We overview how strong a case for black holes {{has been made in}} the last few decades, and how well observations adjust to this paradigm. Unsurprisingly, we conclude that observational evidence for black holes is impossible to come by. However, just like Popper's black swan, alternatives can be ruled out or confirmed to exist with a single observation. These observations are <b>within</b> reach. In <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> years and decades, we will enter the era of precision gravitational-wave physics with more sensitive detectors. Just as accelerators require larger and larger energies to probe smaller and smaller scales, more sensitive gravitational-wave detectors will be probing regions {{closer and closer to the}} horizon, potentially reaching Planck scales and beyond.

40|$|The present work {{reports on}} a {{feasibility}} study commissioned by the Chinese Academy of Sciences of China to explore various possible mission options to detect gravitational waves in space alternative {{to that of the}} eLISA/LISA mission concept. Based on the relative merits assigned to science and technological viability, a few representative mission options descoped from the ALIA mission are considered. A semi-analytic Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to understand the cosmic black hole merger histories starting from intermediate mass black holes at high redshift as well as the possible scientific merits of the mission options considered in probing the light seed black holes and their coevolution with galaxies in early Universe. The study indicates that, by choosing the armlength of the interferometer to be three million kilometers and shifting the sensitivity floor to around one-hundredth Hz, together with a very moderate improvement on the position noise budget, there are certain mission options capable of exploring light seed, intermediate mass black hole binaries at high redshift that are not readily accessible to eLISA/LISA, and yet the technological requirements seem to <b>within</b> reach in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> decades for China...|$|R
40|$|A {{regulatory}} framework {{allows for the}} conclusion of national licenses in Germany, but this precondition is not given in Switzerland. However, the responsible bodies and authorities have definitely recognized how relevant it has become in the national {{as well as in}} the international competition to provide specialised knowledge by electronic means. The intention of this article is to give information about three projects that are, partly or completely, funded by the Swiss Confederation. Those three projects have created, or still create, enduring values in the field of provision with electronic and scientific information on a national level. The Consortium of Swiss Academic Libraries licenses databases and journal packages for all Swiss academic libraries. As libraries only license what their users need, there are just a few products that are licensed at a large extent. Therefore, they cannot be compared to the German national license. The project E-Archiving deals, among other issues, with the long-term availability of scientific journals from Switzerland that were digitalised for this purpose and of the archive data that has been purchased during the license years. The project Electronic Library Switzerland (E-lib. ch) will basically be concerned with the provision of electronically available information <b>within</b> Switzerland over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> years...|$|R
40|$|Till {{the late}} 1980 s, there was {{precious}} little one {{could do to}} permanently cure arrhythmias. Cardiac surgery did {{not live up to}} its promise for ventricular tachycardia. For WPW syndrome, surgery was too invasive a procedure, with a significant chance of major complications. Electrophysiologists spent hours trying to unravel tachycardia mechanisms, and were often referred to as "electrophilosophers". Since the advent of RF ablation, this scenario underwent a sea change. Suddenly one was able to get rid of many arrhythmias with a much less invasive procedure. Electrophysiology centers mushroomed and got upgraded in the developed world. In India, there were only a couple of centers which had tried intracardiac DC shock ablation, with varying results. In 1995, RF ablation was being performed in a handful of centers, notably AIIMS, Delhi and KEM Hospital, Mumbai. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year a <b>few</b> more centers such as Medicity, Hyderabad, GB Pant Hospital, Delhi and Escorts Institute, Delhi also started RF ablation programmes. Today there are over 20 hospitals {{in various parts of the}} country with well-established RF ablation programmes. It is estimated that over 15, 000 RF ablation procedures have been performed so far in India. This is against a backdrop of around 2 million patients with curable tachycardias in our country. Thus, there is a need for around 100 active EP centers spread all over the country. It is expected that this growth will occur over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade. Thus we are now past the "critical mass" and are well poised for the big leap forward...|$|R

When Cammi tries to tell the others to leave, Bloodstone instead has Daimon Hellstrom teleport the group to Arcade's latest party so they can kill him. After being stuck in catatonic shock, Hazmat finally kills Arcade by blowing him to bits with a concentrated radiation burst. When the team tried to escape Arcade's mansion they were quickly apprehended by SHIELD. Hazmat could be seen being consoled by Striker and Finesse. After the group was [...] "rescued" [...] by Daimon Hellstrom, Anachronism was checking on Hazmat's mental state. The group was invited by Baron Zemo to join his side.
