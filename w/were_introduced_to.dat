5|$|Burke {{was arrested}} and tried for {{manslaughter}} but was acquitted. Following the death in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, also known as Brighton Bill, the London Prize Ring Rules <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> more clearly define the rules of prize fighting and to introduce certain safety measures, rules that still {{form the basis for}} the modern sport of boxing.|$|E

5|$|The Manche Ch'ol subsisted upon a maize-based diet; maize {{was mostly}} {{consumed}} in liquid form, {{such as in}} posole, and was probably eaten as tamales.

5|$|The {{launch of}} the first weather satellite, TIROS-I, in 1960, {{introduced}} new forecasting techniques that remain important to tropical cyclone forecasting to the present.

5|$|After {{completing}} the test, Hyun-jun and Sa-woo <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> {{the director of}} the NSS, Baek San (Kim Yeong-cheol). Baek San explained to them that the NSS is a secret organization tasked with preempting foreign threats and protecting the country's interests through wetwork operations, including assassination of anyone who could be a threat to South Korean (SK) national security. Since its founding in 1976, during the rule of Park Chung-hee, the agency's very existence has remained a state secret from everyone, including the President.|$|E

5|$|After the Nazis came to power, {{the design}} was given priority. Despite initial {{competition}} from the Henschel Hs 123, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM, the German aviation ministry) turned to the designs of Herman Pohlmann of Junkers and co-designer of the K 47, Karl Plauth. During the trials with the K 47 in 1932, the double vertical stabilizers <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> give the rear gunner a better field of fire. The main, and {{what was to be}} the most distinctive, feature of the Ju 87 was its double-spar inverted gull wings.|$|E

For example, John of Montecorvino, archbishop of Beijing founded Roman Catholic missions in India and China and also translated the New Testament into the Mongolian language. Long-distance trade brought new methods of doing business from the far East to Europe; bills of exchange, deposit banking, and insurance <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> Europe during the Pax Mongolica. Bills of exchange made it significantly easier to travel long distances because a traveller would not be burdened {{by the weight of}} metal coins.|$|E
5|$|As {{the teams}} {{prepared}} to leave their dressing rooms, Manchester City deliberately delayed their exit by a short period to play on any nerves the Leicester City players may have had. Manchester City coach Malcolm Allison was not permitted {{to take his place}} on the bench, as he was serving a touchline ban. Instead, he had to sit in the stand behind the dugout. Before kick-off, the players <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> the guest of honour, Princess Anne.|$|E

5|$|Berge and Brundtland <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> {{each other}} through a mutual friend in Tromsø, Norway.

Several years later, the two met up again and formed Röyksopp during the Bergen Wave. After experimenting with different genres of electronic music, the band solidified {{their place in the}} electronica scene with their 2001 debut album, Melody A.M., released on the Wall of Sound record label.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E

After the tour's final concert in New York, the Beatles <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> Bob Dylan, a meeting brought about at the instigation of the New York journalist Al Aronowitz, who arranged for Dylan to visit the Beatles at their hotel before they returned to the UK.|$|E
