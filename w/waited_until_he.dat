5|$|Following the Rangers' defeat, he {{announced}} his retirement from the NHL on 4 May 2009, {{at the age of}} 35. Näslund had informed Rangers general manager Glen Sather, head coach John Tortorella, and his teammates of his intention to retire prior to the team's playoff elimination. By announcing his retirement early in the off-season, Näslund forfeited a $2million buyout from the Rangers, which would have counted against the team's salary cap for the following season had he <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> was formally bought out. Näslund retired from the NHL second among all-time Swedish players with 395 goals (behind Mats Sundin's 564; he retired the same year). His 869 points ranked fifth, while his 1,117 games played ranked fourth.|$|E
25|$|When {{elected by}} the legislature, Clay was below the constitutionally {{required}} age of thirty. His age {{did not appear to}} have been noticed by any other Senator, and perhaps not by Clay. His term ended before his thirtieth birthday. Such an age qualification issue has occurred with only two other U.S. Senators, Armistead Thomson Mason (aged 28 in 1816), and John Eaton (aged 28 in 1818). Such an occurrence, however, has not been repeated since. In 1934, Rush D. Holt, Sr. was elected to the Senate at the age of 29; he <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> turned 30 (on the following June 19) to take the oath of office. In November 1972, Joe Biden was elected to the Senate at the age of 29, but he reached his 30th birthday before the swearing-in ceremony for incoming senators in January 1973.|$|E
25|$|The Senate (not the judiciary) is {{the sole}} judge of a senator's {{qualifications}}. During its early years, however, the Senate did not closely scrutinize the qualifications of its members. As a result, three senators who {{failed to meet the}} age requirement were nevertheless admitted to the Senate: Henry Clay (aged 29 in 1806), Armistead Thomson Mason (aged 28 in 1816), and John Eaton (aged 28 in 1818). Such an occurrence, however, has not been repeated since. In 1934, Rush D.

They feared Xu Chu so they <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> went to rest before they entered Cao Cao's tent with swords hidden under their clothes. Xu Chu felt uneasy earlier on, {{so he had}} returned to Cao Cao's tent to protect his lord. When Xu Ta and the others showed up in Cao Cao's tent, they were very surprised to see Xu Chu there and could not contain their astonishment. Xu Chu sensed their intentions and killed them. After this incident, Cao Cao trusted Xu Chu even more and would go nowhere without Xu by his side.

25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and {{that he was not going}} to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E
500|$|The Malay Archipelago {{was largely}} written at Treeps, Wallace's wife's {{family home in}} Hurstpierpoint, West Sussex. [...] It was first {{published}} in 1869 in two volumes by Macmillan (London), and the same year in one volume by Harper & Brothers (New York). Wallace returned to England in 1862, but explains in the Preface that given the large quantity of specimens and his poor health after his stay in the tropics, it took a long time. He noted that he could at once have printed his notes and journals, but felt that doing that would have been disappointing and unhelpful. Instead, therefore, he <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> had published papers on his discoveries, and other scientists had described and named as new species some 2,000 of his beetles (Coleoptera), and over 900 Hymenoptera including 200 new species of ant. The book went through 10 editions, with the last published in 1890.|$|E

500|$|As he {{explained}} {{in his memoir}} The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Davis believed that each state was sovereign and had an unquestionable right to secede from the Union. At the same time, he counseled delay among his fellow Southerners, {{because he did not}} think that the North would permit the peaceable exercise of the right to secession. Having served as secretary of war under President Pierce, he also knew that the South lacked the military and naval resources necessary for defense in a war. Following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, however, events accelerated. South Carolina adopted an ordinance of secession on December 20, 1860, and Mississippi did so on January 9, 1861. Davis had expected this but <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> received official notification. On January 21, the day Davis called [...] "the saddest day of my life", he delivered a farewell address to the United States Senate, resigned and returned to Mississippi.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2002, Hoffman starred {{opposite}} Adam Sandler and Emily Watson in Anderson's {{critically acclaimed}} fourth picture, the surrealist romantic comedy-drama Punch-Drunk Love (2002), {{where he played}} an illegal phone-sex [...] "supervisor". Drew Hunt of the Chicago Reader saw the performance as {{a fine example of}} Hoffman's [...] "knack for turning small roles into seminal performances", and praised the actor's comedic ability. In a very different film, Hoffman was next seen with Anthony Hopkins in the high-budget thriller Red Dragon, a prequel to The Silence of the Lambs, portraying the meddlesome tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds. His fourth appearance of 2002 came in Spike Lee's drama 25th Hour, playing an English teacher who makes a devastating drunken mistake. Both Lee and the film's lead Edward Norton were thrilled to work with Hoffman, and Lee confessed that he had long wanted to do a picture with the actor, but had <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> found the right role. Hoffman considered his character, Jakob, {{to be one of the}} most reticent characters he had ever played, a straight-laced [...] "corduroy-pants-wearing kind of guy." [...] Roger Ebert promoted 25th Hour to one of his [...] "Great Movies" [...] in 2009, and along with A. O. Scott, considered it to be one of the best films of the 2000s.|$|E

2500|$|Although Beauregard {{had little}} {{concentrated}} strength available to oppose a southward movement by Halleck, the Union general showed insufficient drive {{to take advantage}} of the situation.

He moved slowly in the direction of the critical rail junction at Corinth, taking four weeks to cover the [...] from Shiloh, stopping nightly to entrench. By May 3, Halleck was within ten miles of the city but took another three weeks to advance eight miles closer to Corinth, by which time Halleck was ready to start a massive bombardment of the Confederate defenses. At this time, Beauregard decided not to make a costly defensive stand and withdrew without hostilities during the night of May 29.|$|E
2500|$|Tewodros {{provided}} {{one last}} demonstration of {{his lack of}} diplomatic skills on 17 February, when after accepting the submission of the inhabitants of Delanta, he asked them why they had <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> appeared with his army.

Consequently, when the King [...] further ordered them to be attacked, they all fought bravely, and, in conjunction with the inhabitants of Dawunt, killed a great number of his soldiers and seized their arms and mules." [...] Not only had Tewodros isolated himself for several days in a hostile territory within sight of his last stronghold, a deputation from the Yejju, who were coming to him to offer their submission, upon hearing Tewodros' savagery promptly turned around.|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 1877, a {{few days}} after the Bell Telephone Company was established, Bell married Mabel Hubbard (1857–1923) at the Hubbard estate in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

2500|$|It was Hammond's misfortune {{to live in}} {{the same}} age as Don Bradman, the {{greatest}} batsmen of them all. Bradman made 974 runs (139.14) in 1930 and thereafter when Hammond made a century Bradman would make a double century, if Hammond struck 200, Bradman would make 300. When England amassed 903/7 at the Oval in 1938 Hammond <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>he</b> had medical assurance that Bradman was unfit to bat before declaring and England won by an innings and 579 runs. Bradman never forgot this – or Bodyline – and when Hammond arrived to play a sporting tour to re-establish cricket after the war he was angered by the Australian captain's determination to win. In the First Test Bradman was caught by Jack Ikin off Bill Voce when 28, but refused to walk; [...] "Hammond glared at Bradman and said tensely, [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series." [...] Bradman went on to make a match-winning 187 and did the same in the Second Test when Ikin caught him off Alec Bedser at 22, Bradman refused to budge and made 234. Hammond thought this was gamesmanship and refused to talk to Bradman {{for the rest of the}} tour except to call the toss. Nevertheless, Hammond refused to be drawn into a public war, he did not make official complaints or even reveal to the press his concerns about umpiries, poor wickets, heavy rollers and aggressive fast bowling. [...] "He displayed tact and diplomacy in the interests of cricket, and wherever they went his colleagues were welcomed and liked." ...|$|E
2500|$|The England fast bowler John Snow rescued the England first innings {{when he came}} in at 183/7 {{and made}} 73 to hoist the total up to 304. This was Snow's highest Test and equal highest First Class score, but he was {{disappointed}} not to realise his boyhood dream of a century at Lord's when he was caught off a Chandrasekhar googly. India needed 183 to win in the fourth innings when Snow had the opener Ashok Mankad caught by Knott for 8 and India were 21–2 when Sunil Gavaskar was called for a quick single after hitting the ball to mid-wicket. Snow went for the ball and knocked him over, [...] "I could imagine the horror on the faces of everybody watching the game from the committee room at Lord's". They were both uninjured and continued with the game, and Snow tossed Gavaskar's bat back to him. A similar incident had happened in Georgetown in 1967–68 with Clive Lloyd, but the 5'4" [...] Indian received far more sympathy than the 6'4" [...] West Indian who knocked Snow to the ground. From afar the incident had looked much worse and was replayed repeatedly on slow-motion television. A media furore ensued and with press demanding disciplinary action.

2500|$|Snow was {{exhausted}} {{after the long}} tour of Australia and apart from his broken finger he suffered from a strained back and shoulder. He was dropped from the Sussex County team because his [...] "bowling performances, and more especially his fielding have been so lacking in effort that the selection committee had no alternative". However, instead of playing for the Sussex Second XI Snow was declared unfit by his doctor and missed {{the first half of}} the season and the Test series against Pakistan.
