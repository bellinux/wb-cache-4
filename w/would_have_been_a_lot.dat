25|$|The Miami area {{is known}} for its high level of {{automobile}} dependency and lack of public transportation, which has led to an increasing traffic problem throughout the county. Nearly 20% of household income is spent on transportation and Miami had the most decentralized office space of any metropolitan area in the United States, according to a study in 2000. Despite overwhelming support for public transportation to be funded in place of several new highways in the 1970s, Miami's Metrorail system was not functional until 1984 and as of 2014 has failed to reach the scope which was promised over 30 years ago. Ridership was very low in the early years, averaging less than 10,000 riders per day. The system was not finished, even after nearly US$1 billion in federal subsidies, meaning that approximately US$100,000 was spent for each passenger. This led to criticism from then President Ronald Reagan, who stated that it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> cheaper to buy everyone a limousine. Those supporting mass transit argued that the low ridership was due to the system being incomplete and not going where people needed it to, and noted that within a few years ridership was nearing 50,000 per day. Many of Miami and Florida's politicians have not been advocates of alternative transportation. For example, both state governors Jeb Bush and Rick Scott denied funding for an intercity high-speed rail system in Florida. Two state senators tried to force Scott to accept the funding, but the Florida Supreme Court denied the case and the funding was later directed to several other rail projects across the United States.|$|E

500|$|Website reviewers deemed Soul Reavers {{gameplay}} too non-linear and {{its objectives}} too unclear. GameSpot criticized the warp system for using confusing symbols that did {{little or nothing}} to indicate the warp's destination, and weighed the fun of impaling vampires with the Soul Reaver against the lack of challenge presented by bosses and most enemies. Next Generation Magazine considered the game challenging due to [...] "difficult puzzles and lack of a map", requiring the player to backtrack. The Tampa Tribune also criticized the camera controls, though noted that the [...] "auto-facing" [...] feature made the difficulties negligible. PC Zone criticized the PC port of the game for [...] "chunky" [...] graphics and bad camera controls, stating [...] "it feels too much like a PlayStation release ported hurriedly on to the PC". Computer Gaming World similarly felt that the limitations of the PlayStation carried over in the PC port, rendering the latter's visuals [...] "mind-numbingly boring". The publication praised the Lucifer-based story for engaging players, but was disappointed that [...] "it peters out in an unsatisfying climax". Game Informer stated, [...] "Even after years in development, Soul Reaver doesn't feel finished. It feels rushed." [...] 1UP.com ranked Soul Reaver second on its [...] "Top 5 Games That Ended Halfway Through", stating [...] "it's pretty clear that the plot <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> different if the money hadn't inconveniently run out."

I would say no, absolutely not, for humanitarian, moral, social, security, military, and political reasons.
