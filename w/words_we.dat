5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other <b>words,</b> <b>we</b> removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

40|$|Article dans revue scientifique avec comité de lecture. A {{repetition}} {{in a word}} is a subword {{with the}} period at most half of the subword length. We study maximal repetitions occurring in a word, that is those for which any extended subword has a bigger period. The set of such repetitions represents in a compact way all repetitions in the <b>word.</b> <b>We</b> first study maximal repetitions in Fibonacci <b>words</b> [...] <b>we</b> count their exact number, and estimate the sum of their exponents. These quantities {{turn out to be}} linearly-bounded in the length of the <b>word.</b> <b>We</b> then prove that the sum of exponents of all maximal repetitions in general words of length $n$ (over arbitrary alphabet) is bounded by a linear function in $n$. This implies, in particular, that there is only a linear number of maximal repetitions in a <b>word.</b> <b>We</b> then discuss some algorithmic applications of this result. In particular, we present a linear-time algorithm for finding all maximal repetitions in a word...|$|R

25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{building blocks}} of experience, i.e. objective knowledge, are now in place. First there is the sensibility, which supplies the mind with intuitions, {{and then there is}} the understanding, which produces judgments of these intuitions and can subsume them under categories. These categories lift the intuitions up out of the subject's current state of consciousness and place them within consciousness in general, producing universally necessary knowledge. For the categories are innate in any rational being, so any intuition thought within a category in one mind is necessarily subsumed and understood identically in any mind. In other <b>words,</b> <b>we</b> filter what we see and hear.|$|E
25|$|In every discourse, {{whether of}} the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the {{individual}} in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the <b>words</b> <b>we</b> use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive {{with those of the}} universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the universe of discourse. Furthermore, this universe of discourse is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.|$|E
