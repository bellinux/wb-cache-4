500|$|On 1 September 1917, Kerensky {{declared}} Russia a republic. Michael {{wrote in}} his diary: [...] "We {{woke up this morning}} to hear Russia declared a Republic. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> which form the government will be {{as long as there is}} order and justice?" [...] Two weeks later, Michael's house arrest was lifted. Kerensky had armed the Bolsheviks after a power struggle with the commander-in-chief and in October there was a second revolution as the Bolsheviks seized power from Kerensky. With a permit to travel issued by Peter Polotsov, a former colleague of Michael from the Savage Division who was now a commander in Petrograd, Michael planned to move his family to the greater safety of Finland. They packed valuables and prepared to move, but their preparations were seen by Bolshevik sympathisers and they were placed once more under house arrest. The last of Michael's cars were seized by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
500|$|Booker {{has never}} been married, and in 2013 he was named one of Town & Country’’s [...] "Top 40 Bachelors". Although he has {{generally}} tried to keep his personal life private, Booker {{has in the past}} described himself as a [...] "straight male" [...] and has said that he is trying to date more in hopes of finding someone to settle down with. [...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> if I am? So be it. I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I'm straight." ...|$|E
2500|$|... libri 84 digestorum: [...] "Age-encrusted custom is not undeservedly {{cherished}} {{as having}} almost statutory force, {{and this is}} the kind of law which is said to be established by use and wont. For given that statutes themselves are binding upon us for no other reason than that they have been accepted by the judgment of the populace, certainly it is fitting that what the populace has accepted without any writing shall be binding upon everyone. <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> whether the people declares its will by voting or by the very substance of its actions? Accordingly, it is absolutely right to accept the point that statutes may be repealed not only by vote of the legislature but also by the silent agreement of everyone expressed through desuetude."

6000|$|How paltry {{it seemed}} all at once! <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> if France was ruled by that vapid King or by that brainless, overdressed woman beside him? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> if {{that young man}} with the shifty blue eyes and the fair, curly hair succeeded in ousting another man from the English throne? ...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{characteristic of}} Ryelandt was his modesty. Although he enjoyed hearing his works performed, {{he left it}} to others—especially his teacher Tinel and Charles Lamy (pen name of Charles Martens, meaning ‘Charles, the friend ’)—to make his works known. As he put it: “If God wants my work to be known one day, that will happen. If not, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> The task of the artist is to create, and that’s it. Success is a luxury and a pleasure, it’s not indispensable.” He never bragged about the extra-musical honors that befell him. Sometimes he gently mocked them, like when, on being made Commander {{in the order of}} Leopold, he “complained” no one had told him whom to command. When he was very old, he told his daughter: “You must never call a priest or a doctor for me at night, not before 6 in the morning. Those folk need their sleep.” ...|$|E

You see what depths I have fallen to." ...|$|E

6000|$|She had {{leaned back}} with closed eyes. A wave of {{exhaustion}} had swept over her. She listened in a dull dream. She felt beaten. They were {{too strong for}} her. There were too many of them. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> Why not give in, and end it all and win peace? That was all she wanted--peace now. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> all <b>matter?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, and {{sometimes}} {{she felt as if}} she would go mad. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> if their books were dirty and they did not obey? She would rather, in reality, that they disobeyed the whole rules of the school, than that they should be beaten, broken, reduced to this crying, hopeless state. She would rather bear all their insults and insolences a thousand times than reduce herself and them to this. Bitterly she repented having got beside herself, and having tackled the boy she had beaten.|$|R

60|$|Then, {{satisfied}} and shattered, fulfilled and destroyed, {{he went home}} away from her, drifting vaguely through the darkness, lapsed into the old fire of burning passion. Far away, far away, {{there seemed to be}} a small lament in the darkness. But <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>what</b> <b>did</b> anything matter save this ultimate and triumphant experience of physical passion, that had blazed up anew like a new spell of life. 'I was becoming quite dead-alive, nothing but a word-bag,' he said in triumph, scorning his other self. Yet somewhere far off and small, the other hovered.|$|R
60|$|I promised. I {{would have}} promised {{anything}} {{in my power to}} make her dying pillow easier. Besides, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> I was sure that Hugh would never think of me again.|$|R

60|$|When {{she left}} him, his thought {{was just a}} tired: 'Well, so <b>it's</b> begun again!' <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter,</b> since common loyalty and {{compassion}} cut him off from what his heart desired; and that desire was absurd, as little likely of attainment as the moon. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> If <b>it</b> gave her any pleasure to love him, let it go on! Yet, {{all the time that}} he was walking across under the plane trees, Noel seemed to walk in front of him, just out of reach, so that he ached with the thought that he would never catch her up, and walk beside her.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was a poor}} enough {{thing for}} him, he thought at length. She might trample on him; but it was for her sake. And to him <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> The worst had come. All was over now! ...|$|R
