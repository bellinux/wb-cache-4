5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (<b>who</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|According to the Kennel Club {{studbook}}, Old Jock was bred at {{some point}} during 1859 either by Captain Percy Williams in his Rufford Kennels, or by Jack Morgan <b>who</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time was a huntsman with the Grove Kennels. He was bred from Jock and Grove Pepper, both huntman's terriers. Jock was owned by Captain Williams, while Grove Pepper was owned by Morgan. It was claimed in W.D. Drury's 1903 work British Dogs, Their Points, Selection, And Show Preparation that Old Jock was in fact bred from Quorn Kennels and that the listing in the Kennel Club studbook was incorrect.|$|E

5|$|After reigning two years, Amon {{was assassinated}} by his servants, who conspired against him, and was succeeded {{by his son}} Josiah, <b>who</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time was eight years old. After Amon's {{assassination}} his murderers became unpopular with the people, and were ultimately killed. Some scholars, such as Abraham Malamat, assert that Amon was assassinated because people disliked the heavy influence that Assyria, an age-old enemy of Judah responsible {{for the destruction of}} the Kingdom of Israel, had upon him.|$|E
5|$|All {{three players}} were {{inducted}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. Their inductions have been credited to the fame generated by Adams' poem. Andy Coakley, a teammate with the Cubs {{as well as a}} coach for Columbia University, regarded Tinker, Evers, and Chance to be the best infield in baseball history. Bill James, in his 1994 book, Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, argued that Tinker was less accomplished than George Davis, <b>who</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time was {{not a member of the}} Hall of Fame.|$|E

50|$|Kicking {{the cat is}} {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} behaviour of staff abusing coworkers or subordinates as a mechanism to relieve stress. This behaviour can result in a chain reaction, where a higher-ranking member of the company abuses his or her subordinate, who takes it out on his or her own subordinate, and so on down the line. This domino effect can also be seen in family dynamics, where <b>the</b> father yells <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mother <b>who</b> yells <b>at</b> <b>the</b> older child <b>who</b> yells <b>at</b> <b>the</b> younger child <b>who</b> yells <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pet.|$|R
5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} the disposal of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt to}} build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, <b>who</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 {{as a result of an}} explosion in his lab. McCluskey died at the age of 75 of unrelated pre-existing disease.|$|E

The All-area team included Perry Jones, Le'Bryan Nash, Marcus Smart and Kyan Anderson. During the 2010 SPC championship game, Pressey tallied 32 points, 9 assists, 8 rebounds and 3 steals against Greenhill School. Videos of him dunking {{in high school}} have made him a YouTube sensation. During the 2010 TABC All-star game, he dunked over Tony Mitchell, <b>who</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time was a player approximately a foot taller than Pressey. , this video has about 800,000 views. Because of his diminutive stature, he is often compared to another undersized Dallas basketball player, Spud Webb.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from third parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, <b>who</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} the Damascus government began an overwhelmingly anti-Iraqi Ba'athist propaganda campaign, {{to which their}} counterparts in Baghdad responded. However, the Iraqi Ba'athists helped Assad, <b>who</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 4th Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch called for the reunification of the Ba'ath Party, {{in his attempt to}} seize power from Jadid. It was reported that Assad promised the Iraqis to recognize Aflaq's historical leadership. Iraq's foreign minister Abd al-Karim al-Shaykli even had his own personal office in the Syrian Ministry of Defence, which Assad headed. However, this should not be misconstrued, the Iraqi Regional Branch was Arab nationalist in name only, and was in fact Iraqi nationalist.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute <b>who</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 50 {{can look}} back on a varied life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War. His reputation secure, he lives quietly, on good but not close terms with his neighbours; his Roman Catholicism sets him slightly apart in the local community. He has a pronounced distaste for most aspects of modern life, and has of late become somewhat lazy, given to drinking more than he should. To counter the effects of his several aches and pains, Pinfold has taken to dosing himself with a powerful sedative of chloral and bromide. He conceals this practice from his doctor.|$|E
