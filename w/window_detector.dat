Contours seem intuitively relevant to hold architecture information from building facades. We first provide a robust <b>window</b> <b>detector</b> for our unconstrained data, present some results and compare our method with the reference one. Then, we represent objects by fragments of contours and a relational graph on these contour fragments. We design a kernel similarity function for structured sets of contours which will take into account the variations of contour orientation inside the structure set as well as spatial proximity.

40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a {{technique}} to combine bottom- up segmentation, coming {{in the form of}} SLIC superpixels, with sliding <b>window</b> <b>detectors,</b> such as Deformable Part Models (DPMs). The merit of our approach lies in ‘cleaning up’ the low-level HOG features by exploiting the spatial support of SLIC superpixels; this can be understood as using segmentation to split the feature variation into object-specific and background changes. Rather than committing to a single segmentation we use a large pool of SLIC superpixels and combine them in a scale-, position- and object-dependent manner to build soft segmentation masks. The segmentation masks can be computed fast enough to repeat this process over every candidate window, during training and detection, for both the root and part filters of DPMs. We use these masks to construct enhanced, background-invariant features to train DPMs. We test our approach on the PASCAL VOC 2007, outperforming the standard DPM in 17 out of 20 classes, yielding an average increase of 1. 7...|$|R
