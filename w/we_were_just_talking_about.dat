5000|$|That song {{actually}} {{came out of}} an investigative magazine article that Reeves wife wrote on child prostitution around the world. And {{one of the places}} she went to was Thailand. Reeves had the rather unsavory job of hiring the children and then getting them out of the brothels to Sara, who could then interview them. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> those experiences one night. And Ive also been in Thailand and witnessed the same kind of thing. The actual approach of how to write the song was quite devastating. Cause it was so easy to slip into sensationalism. I tried all kinds of ways of approaching it … the moral point of view … and I just ended up doing it straight narrative. That seems to make it stronger than any other approach.|$|E

50|$|In Adamczewski’s view « … {{languages}} {{have two}} parallel series of grammatical markers, {{from which the}} speaker alternately chooses according to his/her strategy in terms of meaning » (1999: 72-transl. ours). Phase 1 markers are those grammatical items which indicate open paradigmatic choice, while Phase 2 items, marking closed paradigmatic choice, enable the speaker to use {{the result of that}} operation to express his/her own standpoint relative to what s/he is saying and relative to the addressee (this for instance could be warning, or regret, or justification...). Phase 2 markers will therefore appear in what is referred to as ‘presupposing contexts’ in the theory. Let us take the example of the French microsystem VOICI/VOILA. In Voici le Professeur X (« This is Professor X »), the NP le Professeur X is non-predictable (open paradigmatic choice), hence the element of surprise that more or less accompanies such utterances; in Voilà le Professeur X (« Here comes Professor X »), somehow the NP le Professeur X is already part of the linguistic context and/or situation of utterance, for instance because it has been mentioned before (« Why! <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Professor X, and here he comes. »).|$|E

60|$|Now, {{in regard}} to this matter about Trumbull and myself having made a bargain to sell out the entire Whig and Democratic parties in 1854: Judge Douglas brings forward no {{evidence}} to sustain his charge, except the speech Matheny {{is said to have}} made in 1856, in which he told a cock-and-bull story of that sort, upon the same moral principles that Judge Douglas tells it here to-day. This is the simple truth. I do not care greatly for the story, but this is the truth of it: and I have twice told Judge Douglas to his face that from beginning to end there is not one word of truth in it. I have called upon him for the proof, and he does not at all meet me as Trumbull met him upon that of which <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking,</b> by producing the record. He did n't bring the record because there was no record for him to bring. When he asks if I am ready to indorse Trumbull's veracity after he has broken a bargain with me, I reply that if Trumbull had broken a bargain with me I would not be likely to indorse his veracity; but I am ready to indorse his veracity because neither in that thing, nor in any other, in all the years that I have known Lyman Trumbull, have I known him to fail of his word or tell a falsehood large or small. It is for that reason that I indorse Lyman Trumbull.|$|R

40|$|Not all {{investors are}} rational. Quite {{apart from the}} obvious {{examples}} of credulity {{in the face of}} the latest Ponzi scheme, there is no shortage of evidence that many investors 2 ̆ 7 decisions are influenced by systematic biases that impair their abilities to maximize their investment returns. For example, investors will often hold onto poorly performing stocks longer than warranted, hoping to recoup their losses. Other investors will engage in speculative trading, dissipating their returns by paying larger commissions than more passive investors. And <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> about widows and orphans here. There is evidence that supposedly sophisticated institutional investors-mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies-suffer from similar biases that impair their decisions. These biases are not merely isolated quirks, rather, they are consistent, deep-rooted, and systematic behavioral patterns. Apparently even the considerable sums at stake in the securities markets are not enough to induce market participants to overcome these cognitive defects on a consistent basis...|$|R
5000|$|By early February 2007, a film {{adaptation}} of The Dark Tower series {{was in the}} works. J. J.

Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof, who co-created Lost with Abrams, optioned The Dark Tower from King for a reported amount of $19, a number that mysteriously recurs throughout the series.

40|$|First of all, i want {{to thank}} Dr. Matrevili for {{inviting}} me to this symposium. I am very gald to be here for two reasons. One is a a personal reason- this ysmposium will allow me to meet distinguished researchers and scholars I have heard or read about(such as Professor Geipel and Dr. Frey),but have never met. Such personal meetings will allow me to learn about studies and works that are new to me. But, the other reason I am glad to be here is a more professional one. An international symposium such as this one on disasters and accidents is important for what it symbolizes. It indicates <b>we</b> <b>are</b> moving beyond <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> about international cooperation in research. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> starting to move towards collaborative efforts in research and theory...|$|R

We need both. <b>We</b> cannot <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>just</b> about democracy, transparency, good governance. At {{the end of the}} day the population does not have anything to eat, does not have water to drink, no electricity at night, industry to provide work, so we need both. People do not eat democracy." [...] This statement made in June 2007 was then reported and quoted in FP Foreign Passport, and translated later in Chinese and French. Consequently, it was quoted as a prologue in the book La Chinafrique written by French journalists Serge Michel and Michel Beuret (Ed. Pluriel).|$|R
5000|$|Hale {{has been}} a {{periodic}} guest on The Space Show, an Internet radio talk show centering on space commerce and exploration, which is also available as a podcast. On the March 19, 2002 broadcast, Hale spoke {{of the importance of}} the search for Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) and their danger to civilization: Even though a major catastrophic event would be very unlikely to occur during our lifetime, if it were to occur it would wipe out a significant fraction of the Earth's population... The chances that there will actually be a major catastrophic world-wide event during our lifetime are actually very slim, but they are NOT zero. If we know where (the NEAs) <b>are</b> <b>we</b> can project their motions out decades into the future. At least then if there is something heading our way we'll have enough lead time - decades perhaps - in order to figure out what we might want to do about it. For objects a hundred meters in diameter <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> (<b>just)</b> centuries. One such small object exploded over the Siberia wilderness in 1908 (the Tunguska event) and created blast effects similar to a nuclear explosion... If that happened 4 hours later it would have been over Moscow and would have changed world history.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about {{the inspiration for the}} song. Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I was listening to the words and me and [...] and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> laughing and <b>talking</b> about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> done of course, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> laughing and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what people want to do, but are afraid to do." ...|$|R

Smith explained the story behind the name as “Even though <b>we</b> <b>were</b> put together in February, June is the month that we spiritually connected as a group.

40|$|A video {{recorded}} after {{a session}} at the FAP Symposium on Feed in Smallholder Systems Luang Prabang, Laos, 18 - 19 November 2010. After a session of the the November 2010 Fodder Adoption Project (FAP) workshop in Laos, we recorded 'notes' of three world cafe hosts who collated cross-project lessons (from Ethiopia, Syria, and Vietnam) on three issues: Innovation approaches, feed assessment, and scaling out. Here Werner Stür, formerly with CIAT in Vietnam, reports back on the discussions about scaling out in the project. The group {{talked a lot about}} the 'starting point' of scaling out - everybody agreed that a 'success story' is needed - a technology, perhaps a process, that at a particular site has provided a benefit for farmers and people see a potential for many others {{to take advantage of the}} success [...] . He raises the issue of where scaling out should be done, who decides this and who is responsible for the scaling out. It seems there is no fixed methodology, but some guiding principles could be identified: - Many more stakeholders and actors need to <b>be</b> involved. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not <b>talking</b> <b>just</b> of a technology, it is a process that needs other actors like traders, private sector, credit, etc - Political support is needed, from government, also excitement from the NGO sector and others - Many specialized capacities are needed, eg for targeting, facilitating, bringing together the actors - There is a big role for media and communications to get get the story out and help build consensus among all the actors Finally, he drew attention to some 'special skill' and motivations that are necessary to bring the stakeholders together: "The chemistry of the key stakeholder has to fit; if that's not working it becomes very very difficult. ...|$|R
