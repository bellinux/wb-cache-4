The corollary, unmet need, declined slightly worldwide (15 to 12%). In 2015 these targets became part of SDG5 (gender equality and empowerment) under Target 5.6: Ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, where Indicator 5.6.1 is the proportion of women aged 15–49 years <b>who</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care (p.31).|$|E

Since the amount of pressure required to size the bullet is far less than that required to form a bullet, a simple mechanical press can be used, often the same press used for handloading ammunition.|$|E

25|$|Pirogue racing has {{traditionally}} been the most important sport among the Duala. The sport reached its peak during the German colonial period, when organisers held races annually on 27 January (the Kaiser's birthday). Under the French, they became semiannual, occurring on 14 July (Bastille Day) and 11 November (Armistice Day). A typical Duala racing pirogue is 20–28 metres long with no keel and a bow carved with intricate designs. A team of 40-50 canoeists, mostly men <b>who</b> <b>make</b> <b>their</b> livings as fishermen, mans each vessel. In the past, diviners used {{the results of these}} races to predict the future, but today a Christian priest presides instead.
