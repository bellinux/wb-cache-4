40|$|In this thesis, we briefly present ERP systems. <b>We</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> main {{features}} {{of three of}} the most popular systems in our country. These are SAP, Baan, Microsoft Dynamics NAV (Navision). We carried out a comparison of the characteristics of each of these. <b>We</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> basic approaches to integration in the past and today. Later we did an analysis of 3 SAP integration methods with SAP. These are: -Text file in connection with transactions, -BAPI function, -BizTalk Server. For the main challenge as we take received transfer incoming invoice in the SAP system. We carried out the transfer of one invoice in three different ways. <b>We</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> requirements for the performance of a specific integration and the necessary steps for implementation. Finally, we compare the three methods. We compared the price of software development time and complexity of system maintenance in a production operation. From these three comparisons we have chosen the most appropriate means of integration. Guide for selecting was economy of the system. ...|$|R
