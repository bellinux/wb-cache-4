5|$|Abel, Nephilim, KOS-MOS {{and chaos}} choose {{to stay on}} Michtam, drawing all Gnosis to them and using a {{dimensional}} shift to move that region of space to Lost Jerusalem. Their actions {{and the release of}} chaos's Anima energy—which is accelerating the universe's death—will delay the universe's destruction, giving Shion time to find Lost Jerusalem and discover the key to changing humanity's will and saving the universe. During the escape, Jin sacrifices himself to save Shion. The resultant explosion of energy from the dimensional shift destroys the U.M.N., rendering faster-than-light travel impossible. Shion goes with Jr. and Allen on the Elsa to find Lost Jerusalem, while MOMO stays behind with Ziggy to reconstruct a new travel network with Scientia's help. In the mid and post-credit scenes, a badly-damaged KOS-MOS floats through space and is contacted by chaos, saying they <b>will</b> <b>both</b> awake when they are needed. KOS-MOS is last seen drifting towards Lost Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Black {{comes to}} in a {{hospital}} bed, tended to by his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher). She explains to him what has happened, and turns {{on the evening news}} to show him the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they <b>will</b> <b>both</b> soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to recruiting in battle, new demons are acquired through fusion {{at a location}} called the Cathedral of Shadows. Normally only two demons can be fused at once, but under certain conditions more demons can be fused together. Fusions can produce a variety of results based on various circumstances, such as the current phase of Kagutsuchi {{and the addition of}} items called Deathstones. When in the Cathedral of Shadows, the Protagonist can select two demons, viewing a preview of the resultant demon, then initiate a fusion. The resultant demon <b>will</b> <b>both</b> possess its own skills and inherit skills from its two parents: skill inheritance is randomized. Higher-level demons produce more powerful fusions. Demons gained through negotiation or fusion are automatically stored in the Demon Compendium, a record kept within the Cathedral of Shadows. The Protagonist can also pay to summon a demon from the Compendium, returning it to his ranks.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases <b>will</b> <b>both</b> polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E
5|$|The Wii U version {{released}} on March 30, 2013. The beta test began on March 5. A port for Microsoft Windows was {{released on}} September 26. Ports to both the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Nintendo Switch were announced as being in development in August 2016. These ports <b>will</b> <b>both</b> be released in 2017; the PS4 version will release on August 17, and the Switch version on September 21, 2017. With {{the announcement of the}} Switch version, Square Enix offered players the option of switching their characters and progress to the Switch version. In addition to the standard home console releases, versions for potable and mobile platforms have been released that rely on cloud streaming, needing an internet connection to function. A version for Android and iOS was co-developed by Square Enix with NTT DoCoMo and Ubitus: NTT DoCoMo's dGame service was used as the release platform, while Ubitus' cloud technology was used for the streaming. It released on December 16, 2013. A second version was developed for the 3DS, using a similar streaming function to the mobile versions. This version released on September 4, 2014. On release, the 3DS version suffered from multiple technical problems, including issues with logging in, frequent maintenance periods, disconnection issues, poor sound quality, and the game's native text font being too small for the 3DS screen. The negative feedback caused Square Enix to temporarily stop shipments so they could fix the issues.|$|E

25|$|The scuba diver {{generally}} has an operational {{need to control}} depth without resorting to a line to the surface or holding onto a structure or landform, or resting on the bottom.

25|$|These cup {{measurements}} are only correct for a 34-inch band because cup size is relative to band size. The volume of a brassiere cup {{is the same}} for 30D, 32C, 34B, and 36A, though the shape of each cup may be different. These related bra sizes of the same cup volume are called sister sizes. It is sometimes possible that two adjacent sister sizes <b>will</b> <b>both</b> fit a person, since the cup volume is the same, while the band size can be adjusted to a small degree by using the hook and eye fasteners in the bra clasp.|$|E

25|$|The {{cleavage}} {{reaction is}} a phosphodiester isomerization reaction that is initiated by abstraction of the cleavage-site ribose 2’-hydroxyl proton from the 2’-oxygen, which then becomes the attacking nucleophile in an “in-line” or SN2(P)-like reaction, {{although it is}} not known whether this proton is removed prior to or during the chemical step of the hammerhead cleavage reaction. (The cleavage reaction is technically not bimolecular, but behaves in the same way a genuine SN2(P) reaction does; it undergoes inversion of configuration subsequent to forming an associative transition-state consisting of a pentacoordinated oxyphosphrane.) The attacking and leaving group oxygens <b>will</b> <b>both</b> occupy the two axial positions in the trigonal bipyramidal transition-state structure as is required for an SN2-like reaction mechanism.|$|E

25|$|Langer impresses {{me because}} he has proven himself as a {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove yourself as a Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence <b>will</b> <b>both</b> be strong assets in England.|$|E
25|$|The last {{variable}} is body temperature. Elevated body temperature is called hyperthermia, and suppressed body temperature is called hypothermia. Slight hyperthermia results in increasing HR {{and strength of}} contraction. Hypothermia slows the rate and strength of heart contractions. This distinct slowing of the heart is one component of the larger diving reflex that diverts blood to essential organs while submerged. If sufficiently chilled, the heart will stop beating, a technique that may be employed during open heart surgery. In this case, the patient’s blood is normally diverted to an artificial heart-lung machine to maintain the body’s blood supply and gas exchange until the surgery is complete, and sinus rhythm can be restored. Excessive hyperthermia and hypothermia <b>will</b> <b>both</b> result in death, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease normal function, beginning with the central nervous system.|$|E

She sings of how she is willing to sacrifice her immortality and pay the price, however hard it is, necessary to win Arindal (Wie muss ich doch beklagen). Arindal awakens and declares his joy at seeing Ada again, but she announces that he will abandon her the next day. Gernot, Gunther and Morald arrive with companions to fetch Arindal. Those who have not seen her before are struck by Ada's beauty and fear Arindal will not come. A procession of fairies {{comes out of the}} palace and Zemina and Farzana tell Ada that her father has died and she is now queen. Ada tells Arindal that they must part now but she will see him tomorrow. She asks him to swear that whatever happens he will not curse her. He swears it even though she takes back her request. She expresses her fear that they <b>will</b> <b>both</b> go under {{as a result of his}} breaking the oath.|$|E

25|$|Wegner {{has applied}} this {{principle}} to the inferences people make {{about their own}} conscious will. People typically experience a thought {{that is consistent with}} a behavior, and then they observe themselves performing this behavior. As a result, people infer that their thoughts must have caused the observed behavior. However, Wegner has been able to manipulate people's thoughts and behaviors so as to conform to or violate the two requirements for causal inference. Through such work, Wegner has been able to show that people often experience conscious will over behaviors that they have not, in fact, caused – and conversely, that people can be led to experience a lack of will over behaviors they did cause. For instance, priming subjects with information about an effect increases the probability that a person falsely believes is the cause. The implication for such work is that the perception of conscious will (which he says might be more accurately labelled as 'the emotion of authorship') is not tethered to the execution of actual behaviors, but is inferred from various cues through an intricate mental process, authorship processing. Although many interpret this work as a blow against the argument for free <b>will,</b> <b>both</b> psychologists and philosophers have criticized Wegner's theories.|$|E
