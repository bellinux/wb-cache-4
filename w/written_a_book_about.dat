25|$|Islamic {{scholarship}} in Iran {{has a long}} tradition of debate and critique. This tradition has come to pose a challenge to the constitutional order of the Islamic Republic of Iran, as a number of seminary-trained scholars have applied their critical methods to basic issues of state legitimacy, in particular the state’s right to insist on interpretive closure. For example, Dr. Mehdi Ha’iri Yazdi, the son of the late Shaykh Abdolkarim Haeri, the founding member of the Qom Theology School, has <b>written</b> <b>a</b> <b>book</b> <b>about</b> criticism of velayat-e faqıh. The regime has responded with force, convening special clergy courts to silence and imprison scholars, in violation of seminary norms of scholarly debate. These conspicuous acts of discipline seem to have backfired, as each escalating punishment has generated new critics within.|$|E

500|$|In retirement, Penfold {{has been}} {{critical}} of the FCO's attitude towards Africa, and has expressed the view that it does not give high enough priority to the continent. He stated {{in an interview that he}} felt the FCO was keen to develop experts in other areas, such as Europe and the Middle East, but [...] "Africa is the place where anybody can do it so long as they have average intelligence". Since retiring, he has taken on roles with various charities and other organisations focusing on Africa and Sierra Leone, including New Africa Analysis, the UK Association for Schools for the Blind, Sierra Leone (which supports the Sir Milton Margai School for the Blind in Freetown), and the Dorothy Springer Trust. He is considered a folk hero in Sierra Leone, and continues to speak on issues relating to Sierra Leone. He was vocal in his opposition to indictment of Samuel Hinga Norman—a pro-Kabbah militia leader during the civil war—for war crimes by the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and to the special court itself. He described the special court as an [...] "expensive and divisive piece of judicial machinery" [...] which served little purpose following the deaths of most of the prominent defendants, and believed that its continuation [...] "could undermine the fragile peace" [...] in Sierra Leone.
