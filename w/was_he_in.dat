25|$|In 1980 Adamson {{chaired the}} 'Study Commission on the Family', an {{independent}} body {{set up with}} finance from the Leverhulme Trust which looked into the effects of marital breakdown on society. The Study Commission intended itself {{to be seen as}} an unofficial Royal Commission.

25|$|Criticising the {{objective}} of double monarchy fixed by Griffith, The Republic also questioned Sinn Féinism as defined {{in the pages of}} his newspaper. As a result of his tireless efforts to republicanise Sinn Féin, it was Hobson rather than Griffith who was chosen by Clan na Gael in 1907 to tour the United States and explain the movement to the Irish-American community. So successful <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>in</b> this that when he returned to Ireland he was considered by many Americans the leader of Sinn Féin. He also became the Irish correspondent for John Devoy’s influential newspaper, the Gaelic American, and took full advantage of this position to further undermine Griffith’s authority in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Kunisada entered Utagawa Toyokuni's studio {{from a young}} age, and was {{therefore}} granted access to training from the finest masters of the age, as well as valuable connections to publishers, poets' associations, theatres and actors He began creating yakusha-e (actor images) in 1808, and this genre was to become the mainstay of his fame and fortune. So esteemed and prolific <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>in</b> this area, that he earned the epithet “Kunisada, the Portraitist of Actors (yakusha-e no Kunisada).” The Tempō Reforms of 1842, which had banned depictions of geisha, oiran courtesans and kabuki actors, began to be gradually repealed from the late 1840s, which left Kunisada free {{to return to his}} favourite medium.|$|E

25|$|On average, {{a single}} herd of cattle on a drive {{numbered}} about 3,000 head. To herd the cattle, {{a crew of}} at least 10 cowboys was needed, with three horses per cowboy. Cowboys worked in shifts to watch the cattle 24 hours a day, herding them in the proper direction in the daytime and watching them at night to prevent stampedes and deter theft. The crew also included a cook, who drove a chuck wagon, usually pulled by oxen, and a horse wrangler {{to take charge of}} the remuda, or herd of spare horses. The wrangler on a cattle drive was often a very young cowboy or one of lower social status, but the cook was a particularly well-respected member of the crew, as not only <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>in</b> charge of the food, he also was in charge of medical supplies and had a working knowledge of practical medicine.|$|E
25|$|Roche {{received}} {{the best education}} Dublin could provide, and was instructed in all the accomplishments then deemed essential to the rank and character of a gentleman. So expert <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>in</b> the various acquirements of polite life, that {{at the age of}} 16 he recommended himself to Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who offered him, gratuitously, a commission in the army. However, Roche had fallen in with a disreputable crowd who convinced him to refuse Chesterfield's offer. Further, Roche was present (and probably directly involved) when his associates attacked and killed a watchman. Compelled to leave Dublin, Roche made his way to Cork, and from there to North America. At the outbreak of the French and Indian War, Roche entered as a volunteer in one of the provincial regiments, and distinguished himself in skirmishes against the Indians.|$|E
500|$|In {{his early}} years, Sorabji took an active {{interest}} in the occult—according to Rapoport, he was a mystic—and many of his early works contain occult inscriptions. For a time, {{he was a member}} of the London Society of Psychical Research. So interested <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>in</b> occultism that he even met Aleister Crowley in 1922, an event that Sorabji found disappointing and caused him to describe Crowley as [...] "the dullest of dull dogs". His occult interests also led to his friendship with Bernard Bromage (1899–1957), an English writer on mysticism and a member of the secret order of the Fraternity of Inner Light. Bromage was one of Sorabji's closest friends for 20 years, acting as joint trustee of the Shapurji Sorabji Trust between 1933 and 1941 and producing an index to Sorabji's book Around Music. Their relationship ended abruptly in 1942.|$|E

500|$|Nimoy, in {{addition}} to his directing duties, appears {{towards the end of the}} film as Spock, but only appears in the opening credits as the director. Nimoy found the most difficult scene to direct was one in which Leonard McCoy talks to the unconscious Spock in sickbay, en route to Vulcan. Nimoy recalled that not only <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>in</b> the scene, but his eyes are closed, making it difficult to judge the quality of the shot or the actor's performance: [...] "It drove DeForest Kelley crazy. He swears that I was trying to direct him with the movement and flutter of my eyelids." [...] Nimoy was thankful the story required him to appear in a minimal number of scenes. The rapidly aging Spock, at the ages of 9, 13, 17, and 25, was portrayed successively by Carl Steven, Vadia Potenza, Stephen Manley and Joe W. Davis. Frank Welker provided Spock's screams, and Steve Blalock doubled for Nimoy, so that a total of seven actors contributed to the role.|$|E
