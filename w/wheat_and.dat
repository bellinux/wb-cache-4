5|$|By the 1870s, the OSN Company, {{owned by}} the Northern Pacific Railroad, was {{operating}} seven steamboats for transporting <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> grain from the productive Palouse region along the Snake and Columbia to lower Columbia River ports. These boats were the Harvest Queen, John Gates, Spokane, Annie Faxon, Mountain Queen, R.R. Thompson, and Wide West, {{all of which were}} built on the Columbia River. However, there were more resources along the Snake River than <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> grain. In the 1890s, a huge copper deposit was discovered at Eureka Bar in Hells Canyon. Several ships were built specifically to transport ore from there to Lewiston: these included Imnaha, Mountain Gem, and Norma. In 1893 the Annie Faxon suffered a boiler explosion and sank on the Snake below Lewiston.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1890s, Amarillo had {{emerged as one}} of the world's busiest cattle-shipping points, and its {{population}} grew significantly. The city became a grain elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in production of <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of natural gas in 1918 and oil three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings.

University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments {{as part of the}} Green Revolution.

5|$|As was {{the case}} under Justinian's predecessors, the Empire's {{economic}} health rested primarily on agriculture. In addition, long-distance trade flourished, reaching {{as far north as}} Cornwall where tin was exchanged for Roman wheat. Within the Empire, convoys sailing from Alexandria provided Constantinople with <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> grains. Justinian made the traffic more efficient by building a large granary on the island of Tenedos for storage and further transport to Constantinople. Justinian also tried to find new routes for the eastern trade, which was suffering badly from the wars with the Persians.|$|E

40|$|MIXED grain rations {{including}} <b>wheat,</b> oat <b>and</b> corn {{products have}} been {{popular in the}} Mid-West for some time. However when certain of these feeds are included in large quantity in chick rations a reduced growth rate has often resulted. Heuser et al. (1945) have shown a reduced, growth rate and decreased efficiency from the feeding of high fiber rations. Some of these rations contained bran and middlings. Mishler et al. (1946) found that when 10 percent each of <b>wheat</b> bran <b>and</b> standard <b>wheat</b> middlings re-placed corn in a simplified corn and soy-bean oil meal ration, growth was retarded and more feed was required per unit of gain. Carrick and Roberts (1947) noted that when 10 percent each of <b>wheat</b> bran <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> middlings replaced 20 percent ground yellow corn in a ration known to give rapid growth, feed efficiency and rate of growth decreased.

40|$|Background: E {{valuation}} of foods protein quality {{is of great}} importance for their biological and economical impacts. Different biological, microbiological, chemical and combined methods have been introduced and used to determine this item. Among these True Protein Digestibility (TPD) has been suggested as an appropriate method for the determination of protein quality. Considering the importance of protein quality in foods, especially in low income families, {{this study was designed}} to evaluate TPD of <b>wheat</b> flour <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> flour mixture plus soy protein in comparison with casein standard protein in Kashan in 2003. Materials and Methods: This e xperimental study was carried out on 32 male Wistar rats, aged 21 days under 4 regimens including <b>wheat</b> flour, <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> flour plus soy protein as case group, casein+methionine (standard) and protein free (basal) diets in order to determine TPD. The period of study for TPD was 9 days. To calculate TPD, nitrogen intake and fecal nitrogen were determined and TPD of the group casein+methionine with <b>wheat</b> flour <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> flour mixture plus soy protein were analyzed using t-test. Results: TPD was 93. 4 ± 2. 3, 93. 9 ± 3. 6 and 80. 3 ± 5. 9 for casein+methionin, <b>wheat</b> flour <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> flour mixture with soy (P<. 0001) respectively. The values means of food intake were 19, 48. 7, 28. 3 and 45. 4 for Protein free, casein+methionin, <b>wheat</b> flour <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> flour mixture with soy respectively. Conclusions: Wheat flour has an equal protein quality <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> flour mixture with soy a lower quality in comparison with casein. In fact TPD of wheat flour mixed with soy can be improved by increasing soy protein values, arranging appropriate strategies in soy production technology and using better kinds of flour especially Semolina...|$|R

5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, <b>wheat,</b> <b>and</b> barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that Aldermaston was inhabited in the 12th century CE, possibly extending back to 1690 BCE.

5|$|Farmers rely on weather {{forecasts}} {{to decide}} what work to do on any particular day. For example, drying hay is only feasible in dry weather.

Frosts and freezes play havoc with crops both during the spring and fall. For example, peach trees in full bloom can have their potential peach crop decimated by a spring freeze. Orange groves can suffer significant damage during frosts and freezes, regardless of their timing.|$|E
