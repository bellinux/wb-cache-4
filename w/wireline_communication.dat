The main power consumption bottleneck is the TDC that operates at the high output frequency rate. A modified version of the ADPLL architecture, that applies phase prediction and aligns the input and output clock edges by means of a digital-to-time converter (DTC), allows the operation of the phase detection entirely at the reference clock rate. To demonstrate the potential of the low-power phase prediction ADPLL architecture, two ADPLL test chips were designed, comprising a 2. 5 - 5 GHz ring DCO and a wideband 10 - 16 GHz LC-DCO respectively. The two chips make use of the same DTC-TDC pair that consists identical delay generic cells for matched DTC and TDC gain values. The ADPLLs target multiple standards of <b>wireline</b> <b>communication</b> interfaces. At its typical configuration, the ring DCO ADPLL is expected to exhibit a power consumption of 3. 9 - 5. 3 mW resulting to a FoM of - 164 dB, lower than any other reported ring-oscillator-based fractional-N PLL. The LC-DCO ADPLL power consumption varies from 10. 2 to 13. 8 mW and is the first fractional-N synthesizer among those targeting <b>wireline</b> <b>communication</b> for this range of frequencies. Additionally, this work introduces a cyclic DTC-TDC pair that can be rotated randomly in order to apply dynamic element matching of its elements and alleviate mismatch-induced spurs at low offsets of the spectrum in near-integer operation.

The data is sent from the driver chip to the receiver chip on a printed circuit board (PCB). In the GHz frequency range, the parasitic effect of various circuits along the signal path affect the quality of the signal sent. Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection, PCB traces and packaging increase the signal loss and distortion;The parasitic effect of ESD protection circuits limits the maximum bandwidth for data transmission. The current high speed driver architectures have the driver circuit directly connected to the chip pads and PCB traces. This causes the chip to be prone to ESD discharge effects. Placing large ESD devices that shunt the output driver to ground, results in their parasitic capacitances acting as low pass filters that severely limit the data transmission rate. The packaging and PCB material are investigated in this project too. An electrical model of the bonding wire is developed through MATLAB RTM and HSPICERTM;In order to increase the data rate, changes in the architecture are performed. The contribution of this project is the introduction of on chip monolithic 4 port RF transformers at the driver and receiver front-end circuits. The transformers act as ESD isolation devices because they filter the low frequency components of the ESD signals before they damage the driver. The driver is physically isolated from the chip exterior. The signal in the driver is conveyed to the traces outside the chip by transformer induction behavior. Spark gap devices are added as ESD discharge paths too.

In contrast to <b>wireline</b> data <b>communication,</b> radio frequency (RF) wireless channels have a physically limited bandwidth and error-prone communication medium. Hence {{the development of}} high-speed, cost-effective wireless LANs presents a greater challenge than wireline LANs. Real-time coding significantly enhances the network performance by improving both the effective bandwidth and the reliability of RF channels. Yet since it introduces additional hardware cost and operating power consumption as well as coding delay, any hardware coder needs to be small, low-power, reliable, and high-performance. The rapid advent of VLSI technology coupled with many advanced design tools allows computationally intensive coding algorithms to be efficiently implemented at low cost within a short design cycle. Therefore, dedicated special purpose hardware provides a cost-efficient and high-performance alternative to general purpose processors. ^ This dissertation presents new novel computational structures for widely used source coding algorithms: (1) Lempel-Ziv compression for lossless data and (2) Pyramid Vector Quantization for compressing image data. To satisfy transparent and real-time coding requirements, {{we focus on the}} design of parallel algorithms and high-performance VLSI architectures while minimizing implementation costs including area, power and design costs. High-level estimations and trade-offs are performed by looking at parallelism and pipelining of the algorithms with the aid of regular array synthesis methods. Yet, as for many search based coding algorithms, these source coding algorithms belong to a new class of regular algorithms, mainly run-time data-dependent iteration loops. We develop an algorithmic transformation to convert data-dependent regular algorithms to data-independent regular algorithms so that well-known regular array synthesis methods (46) can be applied. Using our methodology, we systematically develop new parallel algorithms and VLSI architectures for these codings to be employed in wireless LANs. Analyzing the computational structures and deriving parallel algorithms not only allows us to exploit the inherent parallelism and regularity but also allows appropriate design choices depending on VLSI cost and performance requirements. To demonstrate the correctness of our design and methodologies, we have designed a prototype VLSI chip for our Lempel-Ziv data compression architecture. Finally, we study the impact of real-time VLSI data compression on the performance and the average power consumption of the proposed IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN standard. ...|$|R
40|$|Sigma-delta {{modulators}} (SDM) {{have come}} up as an attractive candidatefor analog-to-digital conversion in single chip front ends thanks to the continuousimproving performance. The major disadvantage is the limited bandwidthdue to the need of oversampling. Therefore, extending these convertersto broadband applications requires lowering the oversampling ratio (OSR) inorder. The aim of this thesis is the investigation on the topology and structureof sigma-delta modulators suitable for wideband applications, e. g. <b>wireline</b> orwireless <b>communication</b> system applications having a digital baseband aboutone to ten MHz. It has recently become very popular to feedforward the input signal inwideband sigma-delta modulators, so that the integrators only process quantizationerrors. The advantage being that the actual signal is not distorted byopamp and integrator nonlinearities. An improved feedforward 2 - 2 cascadedstructure is presented based on unity-gain signal transfer function (STF). Theimproved signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is obtained by optimizing zero placementof the noise transfer function (NTF) and adopting multi-bit quantizer. The proposed structure has low distortion across the entire input range. In high order single loop continuous-time (CT) sigma-delta modulator, excessloop delay may cause instability. Previous techniques in compensation ofinternal quantizer and feedback DAC delay are studied especially for the feedforwardstructure. Two alternative low power feedforward continuous-timesigma-delta modulators with excess loop delay compensation are proposed. Simulation based CT modulator synthesis from discrete time topologies isadopted to obtain the loop filter coefficients. Design examples are given toillustrate the proposed structure and synthesis methodology. Continuous time quadrature bandpass sigma-delta modulators (QBSDM) efficiently realize asymmetric noise-shaping due to its complex filtering embeddedin the loops. The effect of different feedback waveforms inside themodulator on the NTF of quadrature sigma-delta modulators is presented. An observation is made that a complex NTF can be realized by implementingthe loop as a cascade of complex integrators with a SCR feedback digital-toanalogconverter (DAC), which is desirable for its lower sensitivity to loopmismatch. The QBSDM design for different bandpass center frequencies relativeto the sampling frequency is illustrated.

In this work, a digital reference-less CDR is proposed to support continuous datarate ranging from 1 Gbps to 16 Gbps. The CDR adopts an 8 GHz~ 16 GHz DCO to achieve low random noise performance. A reference-less digital frequency locking loop is included in the system as the acquisition assistance for the CDR loop. To address the difficulty of jitter and stability evaluations for bang-band CDR, a Simulink model is developed to find out the jitter transfer (JTRAN), jitter generation (JGEN) and jitter tolerance (JTOL) performances for the CDR. The prototype CDR is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. The core area is 0. 68 mm². At 16 Gbps, the CDR consumes a power of 92. 5 mW and is able to tolerate a sinusoidal jitter with an amplitude of 0. 4 UI and a frequency of 4 MHz. The second part of this dissertation develops a frequency synthesizer for multistandard wireless receivers. The frequency synthesizer is based on an analog fractional-N PLL. Optimally-coupled quadrature voltage-controlled-oscillator (QVCO), dividers and harmonic rejection single sideband mixer (HR-SSBmixer) are combined to synthesize the desired frequency range without posing much phase noise penalty on the QVCO. The QVCO adopts a new phase-shift scheme to improve phase noise and to eliminate bimodal oscillation. Combining harmonic rejection and single sideband mixing, the HR-SSBmixer is developed to suppress spurious signals. Designed in a 0. 13 -μm CMOS technology, the synthesizer occupies an active area of 1. 86 mm² and consumes 35. 6 to 52. 62 mW of power. Measurement results show that the synthesizer frequency range, the phase noise, the settling time and the spur performances meet the specifications of the wireless receivers for the above standards. For a wide range frequency synthesizer, an automatic frequency calibration circuit (AFC) is needed to select proper oscillator tuning curve before the PLL settling. An improved counter-based AFC is proposed in this dissertation that provides a more robust and faster tuning curve searching process. The proposed AFC adopts a time-to-digital converter (TDC), which is able to captures the fractional VCO cycle information within the counting window, to improve the AFC frequency detection accuracy. The TDC-based AFC is designed in a 0. 13 -μm CMOS technology. Simulation results show that the TDCbased AFC greatly improves the frequency detection accuracy and consequently for a given frequency detection resolution reduces the AFC calibration time...|$|R
