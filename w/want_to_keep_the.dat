5|$|Robert Wise was in {{post-production}} on West Side Story {{when he read}} {{a review}} in Time magazine of author Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, whom he had worked with on the 1958 film I Want to Live!. Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding {{to work on the}} adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. Wise and Gidding traveled to Bennington, Vermont to meet Shirley Jackson who told them {{that it was a good}} idea, but the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real. It was also during their visit with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested The Haunting, which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.|$|E

25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E
500|$|However, due to {{construction}} on the Queens Boulevard Line, the G train frequently terminated at Court Square even at times when the published timetable said it ran to 71st Avenue. Some riders were suspicious that the service disruptions were [...] "simply a de facto way to implement the original plan of halving G train service." [...] The original plans called for the G terminate at Court Square at all times; that plan was shelved in 2001 {{in the face of}} community opposition, but the MTA decided to implement it in 2010. An MTA spokesman said, [...] "It's not personal…. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> system up to date, you need to make sure the track and switching are all in good repair." ...|$|E

2500|$|The group’s {{choice of}} name, as they explain on a {{separate}} webpage, might have been ‘embodied cognition’ or ‘biological cognitive science.’ But the group chose ‘cognitive biology’ {{for the sake of}} (i) emphasis and (ii) method. For the sake of emphasis, (i) “We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> focus on biology because for too long cognition was considered a function that could be almost entirely divorced from its physical instantiation, to the extent that whatever could be said of cognition almost by definition had to be applicable to both organisms and machines.” (ii) The method is to “assume (if only for the sake of enquiry) that cognition is a biological function similar to other biological functions—such as respiration, nutrient circulation, waste elimination, and so on.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Therapeutic {{storytelling}} is the act {{of telling}} one's story {{in an attempt to}} better understand oneself or one's situation. [...] Oftentimes, these stories affect the audience in a therapeutic sense as well, helping them to view situations similar to their own through a different lens. [...] Noted author and folklore scholar, Elaine Lawless states, [...] "…this process provides new avenues for understanding and identity formation. [...] Language is utilised to bear witness to their lives". [...] Sometimes a narrator will simply skip over certain details without realising, only to include it in their stories during a later telling. [...] In this way, that telling and retelling of the narrative serves to [...] "reattach portions of the narrative". [...] These gaps may occur due to a repression of the trauma or even just a <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> most gruesome details private. [...] Regardless, these silences are not as empty as they appear, and it is only this act of storytelling that can enable the teller to fill them back in.|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Halfway to Sanity began in early 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, described by Rey as [...] "a dingy place in midtown." [...] For the recording process, drums, guitars, and bass were all recorded {{earlier in the}} afternoon, whereas the vocal track was always recorded {{later in the evening}} with the instrumentals already played. Rey explained that they did this because [...] "it was quicker to learn songs without any vocal, so they did." [...] Joey, however, wanted to work out [...] "how to phrase his singing" [...] and was not a fan of this method of recording. Johnny insisted that no one involved with the album would listen to Rey, not letting him make decisions that needed to made by him as the album's producer. He pointed out that Joey and Richie made it hard for the producer because they wanted to remix or change tracks. Richie, however, stated that Johnny, along with their manager Gary Kurfirst, made the album process difficult by wanting the band to spend as little money possible. He explained that he himself wanted to be more radio-friendly and promote more so they might have a hit album, but Johnny and Kurfirst didn't think it would make a difference. Richie would later recall: [...] "Why would you not want an album to be as successful as it could be? Gary Kurfirst seemed to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Ramones an underground band, I guess his thinking was, he'd profit more." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{deciding}} {{on the story}} and the main character, he would balance the characters, in terms of genders, personalities, and ages represented; when making character personalities, he used the Enneagram of Personality as reference, which classifies people into nine groups; the decision to do this came from {{the importance of the}} number [...] "9" [...] in the storyline of 999. An important thing to him when making characters was to create a mystery behind them, to make players curious about who the characters are and what their pasts are like. Another important element was the use of misdirection: by deliberately making certain characters seem like bad people, he would aim to get players to focus on them more, making it more difficult for them to see who the [...] "real bad guy" [...] is. He aimed to not give the player characters strong personalities, {{in order to make it}} easier for players to empathize with them. He chose to have the games be played from a first person perspective as he felt it makes for [...] "a stronger impact" [...] and is more interesting than a third person perspective; it was also used to limit the information that is available to the player in a realistic way, as the player only knows what they experience or are told. Because the player characters in most games can die many times, Uchikoshi felt that video game characters' deaths may be taken lightly, which he saw as a weak point in games. To combat this, he focused on trying to get players to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> story alive, rather than trying to keep the player character alive; as a result of wanting to keep the story going, players would also avoid the death of their character.|$|E
