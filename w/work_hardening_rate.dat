50|$|The {{appearance}} of necking in ductile materials {{is associated with}} geometrical instability in the system. Due to the natural inhomogeneity of the material, {{it is common to}} find some regions with small inclusions or porosity within it or surface, where strain will concentrate, leading to a locally smaller area than other regions. For strain less than the ultimate tensile strain, the increase of work-hardening rate in this region will be greater than the area reduction rate, thereby make this region harder to be further deform than others, so that the instability will be removed, i.e. the materials have abilities to weaken the inhomogeneity before reaching ultimate strain. However, as the strain become larger, the <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>rate</b> will decreases, so that for now the region with smaller area is weaker than other region, therefore reduction in area will concentrate in this region and the neck becomes more and more pronounced until fracture. After the neck has formed in the materials, further plastic deformation is concentrated in the neck while the remainder of the material undergoes elastic contraction owing to the decrease in tensile force.|$|E

The samples obtained by severe plastic deformation via hydroextrusion were initially tensed up to a given intermediate deformation, then unloaded, annealed to modify their microstructure, and once again deformed to fracture. The increase of the grain size and decrease of average dislocation density due to annealing were found responsible for the <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>rate</b> increases and the flow stress decrease in accordance with the superposition of the HallPetch and Taylor contributions. As opposed to the flow stress, the high ductility of the samples remains rather insensitive to the microstructure properties, apparently due to suppressed recovery processes as well as the unstable deformation mode at extremely low temperature. The high ductility makes it possible to compare the <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>rate</b> and the scale of jump-like plastic deformation along the stress-strain curves for samples with different microstructures. In all cases, the average amplitude of the stress jumps was observed to increase whereas the average <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>rate</b> decreases with deformation.

The {{mechanical}} properties of galvannealed dual phase steels bearing Si were investigated, {{and then the}} effect of Si on work hardening behavior during tensile deformation was discussed. Both tensile strength and yield strength were increased with increasing Si content, especially increasing ratio of tensile strength was larger than that of yield strength.

The 20 Mn steel displays superior tensile properties to steel 27 Mn, but the latter has a higher <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>rate</b> {{at the onset of}} deformation.

All samples were non-consumable arc melted, machined and sectioned for wet chemical, spectrographic, X-ray diffraction and metal-lographic analysis as well as for mechanical (compression) testing. These tests showed all alloy samples exceeded the solubility limits in each respective system. Be₄₋₅B, Be₈Mn and Be₁₂Ti were identified as the second phases in the individual systems. Beryllium-boron alloys exhibited an eutectic or peritectic reaction and the eutectic composition in the beryllium-manganese system was established at 22. 0 weight percent manganese. The samples Be / 0. 5 B, Be / 1. 0 Mn and Be / 0. 5 Ti gave yield strengths of 47, 200 psi, 56, 600 psi and 81, 250 psi respectively in compression testing. These same specimens yielded <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>rates</b> of 1. 07 x 10 ⁶ psi, 1. 3 x 10 ⁶ psi and 1. 52 x 10 ⁶ psi respectively. Long wide twins in pure beryllium were accompanied by large amounts of cross-slip. The boron sample displayed long wide twins and also very short narrow twins, no cross-slip and extensive areas with microcracks present. Shorter and narrower twins characterize the manganese specimens. The beryllium-titanium alloys exhibited extremely small twins emanating from particles of second phase Be₁₂Ti; however, the majority of the twins in this system are long, extremely narrow and are seen to be internally constricted along the length of the twin. These constrictions have been ascribed to a strain relief process which further prevented the twin from growing parallel to its shorter dimension. The near total absence of cross-slip in the three alloy systems was attributed to a lessening of the stacking fault energy as a result of increasing the solute concentration. The drop in the stacking fault energy decreases the probability for cross-slip, makes extensive deformation difficult and explains higher yield strengths and <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> <b>rates.</b> Evidence presented suggests slip occurs prior to gross twin propagation.

Annealed 304 L stainless steel bars are pre-strained to strains of 0. 15 or 0. 5 and are machined into cylindrical compression specimens.

40|$|The present work {{explores the}} {{potential}} of semi-solid heat treatment technique by elucidating {{its effect on the}} plastic behavior of 304 L SS in hot working domain. To accomplish this objective, hot isothermal compression tests on 304 L SS specimens with semi-solid heat treatment and conventional annealing heat treatment have been carried out within a temperature range of 1273 - 1473 K and strain rates ranging from 0. 01 to 1 s(- 1). The dynamic flow behavior of this steel in its conventional heat-treated condition and semi-solid heat-treated condition has been characterized in terms of strain hardening, temperature softening, strain <b>rate</b> <b>hardening,</b> and dynamic flow softening. Extensive microstructural investigation has been carried out to corroborate the results obtained from the analysis of flow behavior. Detailed analysis of the results demonstrates that semi-solid heat treatment moderates <b>work</b> <b>hardening,</b> strain <b>rate</b> <b>hardening,</b> and temperature sensitivity of 304 L SS, which is favorable for hot deformation. The post-deformation hardness values of semi-solid heat-treated steel and conventionally heat-treated steel were found to remain similar despite the pre-deformation heat treatment conditions. The results obtained demonstrate {{the potential of}} semi-solid heat treatment as a pre-deformation heat treatment step to effectively reduce the strength of the material to facilitate easier deformation without affecting the post-deformation properties of the steel...|$|R

Minor <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> occurs below 200 °C {{as indicated by the}} low values of dσ/dε and relatively low strains at ultimate strength. The value of dσ/dε also approaches zero slope rapidly after yield. At 300 °C, the material exhibited {{an increase in}} slope, indicating a higher <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> capacity. Further increase in temperature to 350 °C results in a significant increase in dσ/dε and its slope. This is indicative of a substantial increase in the <b>work</b> <b>hardening</b> capacity of the alloy. Above this temperature, the <b>hardening</b> <b>rate</b> versus equivalent flow stress is similar.|$|R
