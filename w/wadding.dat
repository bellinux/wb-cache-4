5|$|Bore: The hollow {{cylinder}} bored down {{the centre of}} the cannon, including the base of the bore or bottom of the bore, the nearest end of the bore into which the ordnance (<b>wadding,</b> shot, etc.) gets packed. The diameter of the bore represents the cannon's calibre.|$|E
5|$|To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} {{is poured}} down the bore. This {{is followed by}} a layer of <b>wadding</b> (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of windage allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the windage the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling <b>wadding</b> and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in <b>wadding.</b> The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E

5|$|Before loading, {{the cannon}} would be cleaned {{with a wet}} sponge to {{extinguish}} any smouldering material from the last shot. Fresh powder could be set off prematurely by lingering ignition sources. The powder was added, followed by <b>wadding</b> of paper or hay, and the ball was placed in and rammed down. After ramming, the cannon would be aimed with the elevation set using a quadrant and a plummet. At 45 degrees, the ball had the utmost range: about ten times the gun's level range. Any angle above a horizontal line was called random-shot. Wet sponges were used to cool the pieces every ten or twelve rounds.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Cooper {{struggled}} with health problems. As {{well as his}} ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of Blowing Wild when {{he was hit by}} metal fragments from a dynamited oil well. During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the <b>wadding</b> from the blank shell pierced his clothing. In 1955, he appeared in Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality. In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire. Like Sergeant York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.|$|E

Koehler split the carriage in two horizontally, joining the two parts with a hinge created with a spindle at the front. This allowed the gun to be depressed to an angle of between 20 and 70 degrees.

25|$|The first {{document}} {{mentioning the}} cult of the martyrs is a 1543 letter by Bishop Paweł Holszański. He described a monument – a column with a cross – that survived a major city fire that destroyed Vilnius Cathedral and Bishops' Palace in July 1530. He also attributed full recovery of severely ill Jan Andruszewicz, future Bishop of Kiev, to the intercession of the martyrs. Inspired by these events, in 1543, Holszański built a Gothic Chapel of the Holy Cross where the martyrs were allegedly buried. Two years later, Andruszewicz wrote a hymn to the martyrs which closely echoes information in the Bychowiec Chronicle. It was carved into a marble plaque and hung in the chapel. The hymn was also published in Annales Minorum by Luke <b>Wadding.</b> The chapel was restored in 1598 and eventually it grew into the Church of the Holy Cross.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to {{encircle}} the subtype of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) present in patients with chronic whiplash-associated disorders (<b>WAD)</b> and study the debut of TMD symptoms, the provoking factors and the outcome of conservative TMD treatments. The results could add to the aetiological discussion about TMD mainly as being part of chronic <b>WAD</b> pain or not. The subjects were referred patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> at a specialized rehabilitation centre where they were diagnosed using a standardized classification of <b>WAD</b> diagnosing that resulted in approximately 20 % <b>WAD</b> grade 2 and 80 % <b>WAD</b> grade 3. In Studies I and II, a total 136 individuals with chronic <b>WAD</b> {{were found to have}} a significantly higher prevalence of pain associated with TMD compared to a control group of 66 general dental patients. The symptoms debuted approximately six months after the whiplash injury and were most often provoked by stress. In Study III, the effect of a therapeutic jaw exercise (TJE) program on TMD was studied over six months in patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> and TMD, randomized to TJE (25 subjects) or not (30 subjects). TJE had no effect on TMD. In Study IV, patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> and TMD were found to have a mainly myogenous origin of TMD pain. Five months of stabilisation appliance therapy (SAT) equally resulted in an almost complete perceived reduction of jaw pain and frontal headache in patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> and TMD (n= 14) and TMD patients without <b>WAD</b> (n= 10). In the long-term, TMD was significantly lower in patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> who were treated compared to patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> and TMD who were not treated (n= 9). TMD in patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> grades 2 or 3 may be the same kind of musculoskeletal disorder as in TMD patients without <b>WAD,</b> and not primarily part of the <b>WAD</b> pain. A functional TMD examination as well as assessment of perceived stress can be recommended as part of the standardized screening procedure for patients with chronic <b>WAD</b> grades 2 and 3. Patients with symptoms and signs of TMD could be recommended SAT. Patients with symptoms of frontal headache alone should also be considered as candidates for SAT...|$|R
500|$|Sir Francis Dashwood built West Wycombe to entertain, {{and there}} has been much {{speculation}} on the kind of entertainment he provided for his guests. Judged against the sexual morals of the late 18th century, Dashwood and his clique were regarded as promiscuous; while {{it is likely that the}} contemporary reports of the bacchanalian orgies over which Dashwood presided in the Hellfire caves above West Wycombe were exaggerated, free love and heavy drinking did take place there. Dashwood often had himself depicted in portraits in fancy dress (in one, dressed as St Francis of Assisi toasting a statue of Venus), and it is his love of fancy dress which seems to have pervaded through to his parties at West Wycombe Park. Following the dedication of the West portico as the temple of Bacchus in 1771, Dashwood and his friends dressed in skins adorned with vine leaves and went to party by the lake for [...] "Paeans and libations". On another occasion, during a mock sea battle on the canal, the captain of the snow, [...] "attacking" [...] a battery constructed on the bank, was struck by the <b>wadding</b> of a gun and suffered an internal injury. Dashwood later devoted more of his time to political reform and to charitable works; he had an active political career all of his adult life; a serious occupation belied by his reputation for revelry. He died in 1781, bequeathing West Wycombe to his half-brother Sir John Dashwood-King, 3rd Baronet.|$|E
500|$|It {{has never}} been firmly {{established}} how the fire on Orient broke out, but one common account is that jars of oil and paint had been left on the poop deck, instead of being properly stowed after painting of the ship's hull had been completed shortly before the battle. Burning <b>wadding</b> {{from one of the}} British ships is believed to have floated onto the poop deck and ignited the paint. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored carcass ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air. Alternatively, Fleet Captain Honoré Ganteaume later reported the cause as an explosion on the quarterdeck, preceded by a series of minor fires on the main deck among the ship's boats. Whatever its origin, the fire spread rapidly through the ship's rigging, unchecked by the fire pumps aboard, which had been smashed by British shot. A second blaze then began at the bow, trapping hundreds of sailors in the ship's waist. Subsequent archaeological investigation found debris scattered over [...] of seabed and evidence that the ship was wracked by two huge explosions one after the other. Hundreds of men dove into the sea to escape the flames, but fewer than 100 survived the blast. British boats picked up approximately 70 survivors, including the wounded staff officer Léonard-Bernard Motard. A few others, including Ganteaume, managed to reach the shore on rafts. The remainder of the crew, numbering more than 1,000 men, were killed, including Captain Casabianca and his son, Giocante.|$|E

5000|$|A modern variant {{between the}} Foster slug and the sabot slug is the <b>wad</b> slug, {{sometimes}} called a [...] "drive key slug", {{or just a}} [...] "key slug". This {{is a type of}} shotgun slug designed to be fired through a smoothbore shotgun barrel. Like the traditional Foster slug, a deep hollow is located in the rear of this slug, which serves to retain the center of mass near the front tip of the slug much like the Foster slug. However, unlike the Foster slug, a <b>wad</b> slug additionally has a key or web wall molded across the deep hollow, spanning the hollow, which serves to increase the structural integrity of the slug while also reducing the amount of expansion of the slug when fired, reducing the stress on the shot <b>wad</b> in which it rides down a barrel. Also, unlike Foster slugs that have thin fins {{on the outside of the}} slug, much like those on the Brenneke, the <b>wad</b> slug is shaped with an ogive or bullet shape, with a smooth outer surface. The <b>wad</b> slug is loaded using a standard shotshell <b>wad,</b> which acts like a sabot. The diameter of the <b>wad</b> slug is slightly less than the nominal bore diameter, being around 0.690 inch for a 12-gauge <b>wad</b> slug, and a <b>wad</b> slug is generally cast solely from pure lead, necessary for increasing safety if the slug is ever fired through a choked shotgun. Common 12 gauge <b>wad</b> slug masses include -oz. and 1-oz. <b>wad</b> slugs, and they are loaded in a traditional shotshell <b>wad</b> intended for variously loading among -oz., 1-oz., or 1-oz. shotshells. Depending on the specific stack-up, a card <b>wad</b> is also sometimes located between the slug and the shotshell <b>wad,</b> depending largely on which hull is specified, with the primary intended purpose of improving fold crimps on the loaded <b>wad</b> slug shell that serves to regulate fired shotshell pressures and improve accuracy.|$|R
