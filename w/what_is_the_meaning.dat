2500|$|... "We want also {{samples of}} the surface water itself under {{peculiar}} conditions, for instance, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the wonderful white appearance of the sea which took place last autumn in nearly all {{the waters of the}} northern coast of England? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the occasional red appearance of the sea for many square miles? Again, how are we to devise a mesh of net that shall let go the small soles and undersized fry of other sea fish, and keep marketable fish only?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein {{supplies}} {{the response of}} an imagined interlocutor. He usually puts these statements in quotes to distinguish them from his own: [...] "But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Or Wittgenstein may indicate such a response by beginning with a long dash, as he does before the question above: —But <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the word 'five'? ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of [...] "Acher {{destroyed}} the plants"? Of him scripture says: [...] "Do not let your mouth make your flesh sin". What does this mean? Acher saw that Metatron {{happened to be}} granted authority to sit while he record the merits of Israel, and he said: [...] "We have been taught that in heaven there is no sitting.... Perhaps there are — God forbid! — two supreme powers". They brought him to Metatron and they smote him with sixty bands of fire. They said to Metatron: [...] "When you saw him, why did you not stand up before him?" [...] Then authority was granted Metatron to erase the merits of Acher. Then a heavenly voice was heard: [...] "'Repent, O backsliding children!' except for Acher." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....think of the {{following}} use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the word 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E
2500|$|Romero preached that [...] "The most {{profound}} social revolution is the serious, supernatural, interior reform of a Christian." [...] He also emphasized: [...] "The liberation of Christ and of His Church is not {{reduced to the}} dimension of a purely temporal project. It does not reduce its objectives to an anthropocentric perspective: to a material well-being or only to initiatives of a political or social, economic or cultural order. Much less can it be a liberation that supports or is supported by violence." [...] Romero expressed several times his disapproval for divisiveness in the Church. In a sermon preached on 11 November 1979 he said: [...] "The other day, one of the persons who proclaims liberation in a political sense was asked: ‘For you, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the Church’?" [...] He said that the activist [...] "answered with these scandalous words: ‘There are two churches, {{the church of the}} rich and the church of the poor. We believe in the church of the poor but not in the church of the rich.’" [...] Romero declared, [...] "Clearly these words are a form of demagogy and I will never admit a division of the Church." [...] He added, [...] "There is only one Church, the Church that Christ preached, the Church to which we should give our whole hearts. ...There is only one Church, a Church that adores the living God and knows how to give relative value to the goods of this earth." ...|$|E

6000|$|For my own part, I <b>was</b> bewildered. All <b>the</b> {{questions}} I had {{not asked}} before came crowding {{to my mind}} how. Whose child was this? Whence had he come? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of it all? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly not," [...] said Eustace. [...] "I will arrange matters so {{that you}} shall no longer sleep in our tent. But let me ask of you, Leonard, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of your conduct of yesterday?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> {{surprised}} Heyst <b>was</b> <b>the</b> non-appearance of Wang. The Chinaman {{had always}} materialized at {{the precise moment}} of his service, neither too soon nor too late.

6000|$|She was chatty as a camp bird, and saw everything, {{and wanted}} to know about it. Why were there so many empty cabins? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of all those rusty, ruined mills? Weren't there any gardens or grass? ...|$|R
