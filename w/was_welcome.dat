5|$|Before the 2009 season, Fredrikstad told Tegström {{that he was}} {{not part}} of the club's {{long-term}} plans and that he <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> to find another club. Fredrikstad turned down an offer from Stabæk to buy the striker. He did not start a single match in the pre-season, but he came on as a substitute and scored a goal against Strømsgodset in the second match of the 2009 season. Tegström spent most of the 2009 season on the bench, but in the 2009 Norwegian Football Cup tie against Ranheim, he came on as a substitute and scored two goals in the extra time.|$|E
5|$|In Oklahoma, {{moisture}} from the storm, combined with a slow-moving cold front, produced heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at 8.98inches (228mm) in Courtney. Due to below normal precipitation {{by as much as}} 5 to 10inches (127 to 255mm), flooding was localized and overall minimal. Near Medford, the rainfall lead to 2feet (0.6m) deep flooding on U.S. Highway 81, forcing its closure. The rainfall <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> in the state, and lessened the rainfall deficit.|$|E
5|$|The {{change of}} {{government}} <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> {{particularly to the}} senators, who had been harshly persecuted during Domitian's reign. As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters, Nerva publicly swore that no senators would {{be put to death}} as long as he remained in office. He called an end to trials based on treason, released those who had been imprisoned under these charges, and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane-force winds blew down trees, signs, {{and power}} lines {{in and around}} La Paz, while closer to the beach the {{hurricane}} destroyed multiple beach huts. Rough surf in the harbor of La Paz sunk one fishing vessel and grounded four others. Efforts by the Mexican Navy prevented an additional vessel and two cruise ships from being grounded. In Cabo San Lucas, effects were minimal, amounting to light winds and rain of less than 2inches (50mm). The passage of the hurricane left citizens in Todos Santos without power for around 24hours. Heavy rainfall caused severe inland flooding, destroying bridges and multiple mudslides, some of which blocked roads. Flash flooding in desert inland areas washed out roads, causing the Mexican government to restrict traffic {{through much of the}} peninsula for up to a week after the storm. Many roads remained impassable for a month after the hurricane. The closed roads and the airport in La Paz and southern Baja California left some tourists stranded. The rainfall <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> in some desert areas, where the moderate precipitation filled reservoirs. Two rescue workers died when they were swept away by the floodwaters. Six municipalities in Baja California were declared disaster areas, and by four days after landfall, the Mexican government prepared emergency funds to meet the immediate needs of the affected citizens.|$|E
5|$|In Guam, {{the threat}} of Typhoon Isa {{postponed}} a flight from Guam to Honolulu, Hawaii for 48hours. The flight was the last in , which was a multimillion-dollar humanitarian effort to transport more than 6,600Kurds in a political asylum to the mainland of the United States. The threat of the typhoon also canceled {{the first round of}} the Omega Tour golf event, which was the second professional golf tournament in the island's history. Though Typhoon Isa passed well to the south of Guam, one of its outer rainbands stalled across the island, which dropped heavy rainfall of 15–25cm (6–10in) across the island. The rainfall <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> as it occurred during the dry season, and largely contributed to rainfall at the Guam International Airport being 45% above normal from the period between January through April. The rainband also produced wind gusts that reached 86km/h (53mph) at the island's Naval Air Station; the winds resulted in sporadic power outages across the island. The typhoon caused some light damage to buildings, particularly on the south side of the island. The combination of winds and sea salt caused damage to the island's tomato, okra, cucumber, and soy bean crops.|$|E
5|$|McGinnity {{began the}} 1902 {{season with the}} Orioles. However, the {{franchise}} began to fall into significant debt. Joe Kelley, star player for the Orioles and son-in-law of part-owner John Mahon, reported that the team owed as much as $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Unable to afford that debt, Mahon purchased shares of the team from Kelley and player-manager John McGraw, who had resigned from the team and signed with the New York Giants of the NL. With this, Mahon became the majority shareholder. On July 17, 1902, Mahon sold {{his interest in the}} Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, also of the NL. That day, Freedman and Brush released McGinnity, McGraw, Kelley, Roger Bresnahan, Jack Cronin, Cy Seymour, and Dan McGann from their Oriole contracts. Brush then signed Kelley and Seymour to the Reds, while Freedman signed McGinnity, Bresnahan, Cronin, and McGann, joining McGraw, his new player-manager, on the Giants. McGinnity attempted to contact Johnson that night, offering to stay with the Orioles if he could receive Johnson's personal assurance that he <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> to stay. McGinnity did not hear back from Johnson, who had left his phone off the hook that night to avoid being contacted, and joined his teammates with the Giants.|$|E

5|$|On November 4, {{following}} the World Series, the Phillies released third base coach Steve Smith. Smith {{had been with}} the team for two years. The Phillies were expected to have the remaining coaches to return for the 2009 season. However, bench coach Jimy Williams opted not to return to the Phillies for the 2009 season, notifying the team on November 10. Charlie Manuel had expected Williams to return for the 2009 season, and was surprised that he declined. However, Williams left the team on good terms, and Manuel stated that he <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> {{to come back to the}} Phillies if he changed his mind. Left fielder Pat Burrell became a free agent at the end of the 2008 season, signing with the Tampa Bay Rays, whom the Phillies had defeated in the World Series, on January 5. The team did not tender an offer to Burrell following eight seasons. The Phillies also released outfielder So Taguchi on November 5. Taguchi had served as a pinch-hitter for the Phillies in 2008, and also replaced Burrell in left field some games. Eric Bruntlett replaced Taguchi for the latter half of the 2008 season. Relief pitcher Tom Gordon also filed for free agency, ultimately signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, when a {{garrison}} {{from all}} parties to the Laotian Civil War was agreed upon in Luang Prabang, a company from BV 11 was flown in from Boun Neua. As there were few communist troops in Phongsali Province, his switch to their side <b>was</b> <b>welcome.</b> However, he {{had to deal with}} disloyalty in his ranks. In 1962, he reportedly executed two captains for attempting a coup against him.|$|E
25|$|The {{new energy}} of Turkish rule <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> in Tunis, {{and by the}} ulama. Although the Ottomans {{preferred}} the Hanifi school of law, some Tunisian Maliki jurists were admitted into the administration. Yet the rule remained one of a foreign elite. In the countryside, efficient Turkish troops managed to control the tribes without compromising alliances, but their rule was unpopular. The rural economy was never brought under effective regulation by the central authority. For revenues the government continued to rely primarily on corsair raiding in the Mediterranean.|$|E

50|$|It {{became a}} meeting place to welcome dignitaries {{and members of the}} French royal family. On May 22, 1319, Robert, King of Naples and his wife, Sancha of Majorca, <b>were</b> <b>welcome</b> here on their way to see the relics of Robert's brother, Louis of Toulouse. Shortly after the Battle of Marignano in 1559, King Francis I of France and his wife, Queen Claude of France <b>were</b> <b>welcome</b> here by Bishop Claude de Seyssel and viguier Louis de Vento. On November 6, 1564, King Charles IX of France, his mother Queen Catherine de' Medici, and his brother, the future King Henry III of France, <b>were</b> <b>welcome</b> here.

25|$|On {{her return}} to Haworth, she met William Weightman (1814–1842), her father's new curate, who started work in the parish in August 1839. Aged 25, he had {{obtained}} a two-year licentiate in theology from the University of Durham. He <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> at the parsonage. Her acquaintance with him parallels her writing a number of poems, which may suggest {{she fell in love}} with him although there is disagreement over this possibility. Little evidence exists beyond a teasing anecdote of Charlotte's to Ellen Nussey in January 1842.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} single -535E order came in May 1988 when American Airlines ordered 50 757s powered by the -535E4 citing the engine's low noise as an important factor: {{this was the first}} time since the TriStar that Rolls-Royce had received a significant order from a US airline, and it led to the -535E4's subsequent market domination on the 757. Humorously (as reported in Air International) at the time of the announcement made by American, selection of the -535E4 was made public prior to the selection of the 757, though this <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> news to both Rolls-Royce and Boeing.|$|E
25|$|Crawford's {{first play}} to be {{performed}} by a New Theatre group <b>was</b> <b>Welcome</b> Home by the Melbourne branch in 1946. The views held on social and political problems by the New Theatre group aligned with Crawford's. Some the topics covered by other New Theatre writers included racial discrimination, war and peace, unemployment and other social problems. Some themes of Crawford's plays include the impact of military armament testing on Aboriginal society (Rocket Range), post war housing shortages (Welcome Home) and political commentary plays (Frame Up) {{just to name a}} few. Many plays were written to be entered into competitions on behalf of the New Theatre club. Crawford continued working with the New Theatre group for many years and wrote many plays that were performed by them.|$|E

25|$|The {{improvement}} at West Wemyss <b>was</b> <b>welcome,</b> but {{it remained}} {{a small and}} inconvenient harbour, {{and the absence of}} any modern facility in the area led eventually to the formation of the Leven Harbour Dock and Railway Company by Act of Parliament on 24 July 1876. As well as construction of a wet dock at Leven, the company was to build a five furlong railway from the Leven and East of Fife Railway at Leven station. The construction cost £40,000 and was completed in November 1879. The branch railway was worked by the North British Railway, which by this time had taken over the Leven and East of Fife Railway company. From the outset Leven Harbour suffered from silting and continuous dredging was required, and it was not profitable.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013, Owen {{announced}} that Take That were to begin recording their seventh studio album in 2014 and On 14 January 2014, Donald and Barlow both tweeted that Take That {{had entered the}} studio to begin recording the album, {{although it was not}} initially clear if Williams was present at these recording sessions. On 28 April 2014, Williams announced on Twitter he was to become a dad for a second time, and consequently suggested he would be unable to join Take That on their album and tour. Barlow later confirmed that Williams had left the band for a second time, although the departure was amicable and that Williams <b>was</b> <b>welcome</b> to rejoin the band in the future. Williams has since collaborated with Barlow on several projects and duet performances and indicated his interest in reuniting with the band for potential 25th anniversary commemorative events.|$|E
25|$|Many former Imperial Japanese Army {{soldiers}} {{fought with}} the Viet Minh - {{perhaps as many as}} 5,000 volunteered their services throughout the war. These Japanese stayed behind in Indochina soon after World War II concluded in 1945 out of a peak number of 50,000 - the majority of which were repatriated to Japan by the then occupying British. For those that stayed behind, fighting with the Viet Minh became a more attractive idea than returning to a defeated and occupied homeland. In addition the Viet Minh had very little experience in warfare or government so the advice of the Japanese <b>was</b> <b>welcome.</b> Some of the Japanese were ex-Kenpeitai who were wanted for questioning by Allied authorities. Giap arranged for them all to receive Vietnamese citizenship and false identification papers. Some Japanese were captured by the Viet Minh during the last months of the war and were recruited in to their ranks.|$|E
