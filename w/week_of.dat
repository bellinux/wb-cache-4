A cumulative incidence of diabetes of 100 % was noted by 40 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> age in male rats, while it was only 33. 3 % even by 65 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> age in female rats. The survival rate up to 65 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> age was 92. 9 % in male rats and 97. 4 % in female rats. Glucose intolerance was observed in male rats from 16 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> age. The clinical characteristics of the male SDT rats were (1) hyperglycemia and hypoinsulinemia (from 25 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> age); (2) long-term survival without insulin treatment; (3) hypertriglyceridemia (by 35 <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> age); however, no obesity was noted in any of the male rats.
