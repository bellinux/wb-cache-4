Tail-anchored (TA) proteins contain a single transmembrane domain (TMD) at the Cterminus, anchoring them to organelle membranes where they mediate a variety of critical cellular processes. Mutations in individual TA proteins cause a number of severe inherited disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms and signals facilitating proper TA protein targeting are not fully understood, in particular in mammals. Here, we identify additional TA proteins at peroxisomes or shared by multiple organelles in mammals and reveal {{that a combination of}} TMD hydrophobicity and tail charge determines targeting to distinct organelles. Specifically, an increase in tail charge can override a hydrophobic TMD signal and re-direct a protein from the ER to peroxisomes or mitochondria and vice versa. We demonstrate that subtle alterations in those physicochemical parameters can shift TA protein targeting between organelles, explaining why peroxisomes and mitochondria share many TA proteins. Our analyses enabled us to allocate characteristic physicochemical parameters to different organelle groups. This classification allows for the first time, successful prediction of the location of uncharacterized TA proteins. <b>We</b> <b>thank</b> <b>colleagues</b> who provided materials (see Tables S 1 -S 4) and acknowledge support from A.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from National Academy of Sciences via the DOI in this record. The concept of community is often used in environmental policy to foster environmental stewardship and public participation, crucial prerequisites of effective management. However, prevailing conceptualizations of community based on residential location or resource use are limited {{with respect to their}} utility as surrogates for communities of shared environment-related interests, and because of the localist perspective they entail. Thus, addressing contemporary sustainability challenges, which tend to involve transnational social and environmental interactions, urgently requires additional approaches to conceptualizing community that are compatible with current globalization. We propose a framing for redefining community based on place attachment (i. e., the bonds people form with places) in the context of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, a World Heritage Area threatened by drivers requiring management and political action at scales beyond the local. Using data on place attachment from 5, 403 respondents residing locally, nationally, and internationally, we identified four communities that each shared a type of attachment to the reef and that spanned conventional location and use communities. We suggest that as human-environment interactions change with increasing mobility (both corporeal and that mediated by communication and information technology), new types of people-place relations that transcend geographic and social boundaries and do not require ongoing direct experience to form are emerging. We propose that adopting a place attachment framing to community provides a means to capture the neglected nonmaterial bonds people form with the environment, and could be leveraged to foster transnational environmental stewardship, critical to advancing global sustainability in our increasingly connected world. <b>We</b> <b>thank</b> <b>colleagues</b> from the GBRMPA, University of Exeter, and CSIRO for input during the Interdisciplinary Science of Environmental Change workshop; and J.

40|$|LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Comments regarding: Lucchetti MC, Fratto G, Valeriani F, De Vittori E, Giampaoli S, Papetti P, et al. Cobalt-chromium alloys in dentistry: An {{evaluation}} of metal ion release. J Prosthet Dent 2015; 114 : 602 - 8 Dear Editor: We read {{with great interest}} the recently published article, “Cobalt-chromium alloys in dentistry: An {{evaluation of}} metal ion release” by Lucchetti et al. 1 in which the authors aimed to investigate metal ion release of Co-Cr alloy that was manufactured both by {{direct metal laser sintering}} (DMLS) and conventional casting techniques. The material method of the study is very clear and detailed for both chemical and biological corrosion. For this reason we aimed to use this methodology as a reference in one of our in vitro studies. However, when we read the article in detail we detected an error in the given formula of artificial saliva. In literature, artificial saliva is often used in many formulas for in vitro studies to simulate in vivo conditions. 2 - 5 In the Lucchetti et al. 1 article, the content of artificial saliva was formulated as: 2. 0. 10 - 2 M KCl, 1. 4. 10 - 3 M KH 2 PO 4, and 1. 5. 10 - 2 M K 2 HCO 3. The researchers indicate they used Mutlu-Sagesen et al 5 and ISO 10271 standards 6 in the material and method as reference. However, the referenced study of Mutlu-Sagesen et al 5 gave the artificial saliva as: 7. 69 g of K 2 HPO 4, 2. 46 g of KH 2 PO 4, 5. 3 g of NaCl, and 9. 3 g of KCl added to 1000 ml of distilled water. When we search the literature, the material, K 2 HCO 3, was not found in the formation of artificial saliva. Also, the pharmacists was not able to prepare artificial saliva for our study according to the formula that was given by Lucchetti et al. 1 We believe there is a typographical error in the article that needs to be corrected to prevent encountering the same problem in the future studies.

Authors’ Response Dear Editor: We are glad our paper was of interest and very sorry if a clerical error occurred in reporting the formula in the manuscript. 1, 2 Indeed, that formula cannot chemically exist, not only because some components are missing, but because K 2 HCO 3 geometry is clearly impossible for the valence bonds. <b>We</b> <b>thank</b> <b>colleagues</b> and referees for their observations and apologize to readers for any difficulty they may have encountered in trying to prepare this solution for artificial saliva.
