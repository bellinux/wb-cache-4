40|$|In this essay, I offer a {{sympathetic}} {{reading of the}} rhetoric(s) of Augustineâ€™s Confessions. First, as a historian of rhetoric I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in what Augustineâ€™s narrative {{can tell us about}} the theory and practice of rhetoric in the late classical period and the early Christian era. From this perspective, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in exploring what Augustine discloses about the rhetoric he learned in the provincial Roman schools, and taught at Carthage, Rome, and Milan. Second, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in Augustineâ€™s own work on rhetoric, especially his De Doctrina Christiana, most of which he composed during the period right before he began the Confessions. In particular, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in how the rhetorical ethics that emerges from Augustineâ€™s formal treatment of Biblical exegesis and preaching, and which distinguishes Augustineâ€™s rhetoric from that of his classical predecessors, can illuminate our interpretation of the Confessions. Finally, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in exploring how the Confessions itself works as a rhetorical textâ€” that is, as a discourse addressed to an audience for the purpose of influence. In particular, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in exploring the specific pastoral functions served by Augustineâ€™s narrative...|$|R
