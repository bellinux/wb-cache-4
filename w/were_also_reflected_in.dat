Virginia Tech earned just 34 rushing yards against the Bearcats' defense while allowing 369 yards to Cincinnati's rushing offense. Those two totals are the least-gained and most-allowed marks in Virginia Tech bowl game history.|$|E

Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where I see something that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E

2500|$|The polarised {{politics}} of the Weimar period <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> some of its films. A series of patriotic films about Prussian history, starring Otto Gebühr as Frederick the Great were produced throughout the 1920s and were popular with the nationalist right-wing, who strongly criticised the [...] "asphalt" [...] films' decadence. Another dark chapter of the Weimar period was reflected in Joseph Delmont's film Humanity Unleashed (1920). The film was an adaptation of a novel by the same name, written by Max Glass and published in 1919. The novel described a dark world consumed by disease and war. The filmmakers {{decided to take the}} story to a more contemporary context by reflecting the growing fear among the German public of political radicalization. They produced what was to become the first fictional account of the events of January 1919 in Berlin, the so-called “Spartacist Uprising”. This film is also considered one of the anti-Bolshevik films of that era.|$|E

5000|$|Hands Down is {{the tenth}} studio album by Bob James (10th studio album as {{reflected}} by the title and cover), released in 1982. This {{was a turning point}} in James career, with the tracks [...] "It's Only Me" [...] and [...] "Spunky" [...] being early exponents of electronic jazz. At the time electronica was transforming popular music in reaction to the big orchestrations of the late 1970s (prevalent on James' previous works).

Because these are so ingrained in culture, individual accomplishments cannot overcome the disadvantages that come with being in a lower status group. Thomas-Hunt and Phillips (2004) found that female leaders who held expertise were less influential than male leaders, and that having expertise actually decreased how expert others perceived them to be. These differences <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>reflected</b> <b>in</b> group performance (groups with male experts outperformed those with female experts).|$|E

50|$|A {{few days}} before the June 7 National Assembly meeting, the Secretary of State for the Colonies had {{informed}} Dr. Sceberras that the incoming governor for the islands, Lord Plumer, was to study the situation and report to London with regards to the possibility of giving the Maltese a larger say in the administration of their country.
