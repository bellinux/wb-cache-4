[...] Thus, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> into the studio for fifteen days of scheduled shooting, we didn't have to start making decisions. Because of our pre-production conferences with director of photography Floyd Crosby and art director Daniel Haller, everyone knew exactly what to do, barring any last minute inspirations on the set.|$|E
2500|$|Hal was memorialized with {{a chapter}} in the memoir written by his more famous mother, Ella Reeve Bloor, in 1940: [...] As a boy he loved the outdoors, was full of restless, eager {{vitality}} and bold curiosity. He had a startlingly vivid imagination, and an urge and talent for organizing that continued and marked his whole life. More than ordinarily shy, he forgot his shyness when engaged {{in one of his}} organizing ventures, and a flow of colorful, stirring talk would come from him so persuasive that those who heard him were completely carried away. He grew slim and tall, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> to Arden was captain of the baseball team and a leader in tennis and other games. He missed a lot of school because of his siege of tuberculosis, but he read a lot and was always able to make up two or three years of ordinary schooling in a few months of intensive study. His interest in socialism began as early as I can remember.|$|E
2500|$|The son of Peter and Carole, Slater {{was born}} in the New South Wales rural city Wagga Wagga after his parents and two elder {{siblings}} (Julian and Tracey) had emigrated from the north-eastern coast of England in 1966. They originally migrated to Launceston, Australia by boat, after deciding against moving to Canada. In Launceston, Slater's father taught agriculture and science at high school, as he had done since graduating from college. After three years in Launceston, the Slaters moved to Wagga Wagga, and Peter became a lecturer in agriculture at what is now known as the Charles Sturt University. Slater lived in Wagga Wagga for his entire childhood, eventually leaving with only fond memories. He later wrote: [...] "Wagga Wagga was a great place to grow up, for many reasons. It was a good size — it had a population of around 50,000 <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>moved</b> there — and it was in the country, with a great Australian climate. My family was always involved in sport, so from an early age it just seemed natural for me to play any game that was on offer." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} intergenerational earnings mobility in Spain correcting {{for different}} selection biases. We address the co-residence selection problem by combining information from two samples {{and using the}} two-sample two-stage least square estimator. We find a small decrease in elasticity <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> to younger cohorts. Furthermore, we find a higher correlation {{in the case of}} daughters than in the case of sons; however, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> consider the employment selection in the case of daughters, by adopting a Heckman-type correction method, the diference between sons and daughters disappears. By decomposing the sources of earnings elasticity across generations, we find that the correlation between child's and father's occupation is the most important component. Finally, quantile regressions estimates show that the influence of the father's earnings is greater <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>move</b> to the lower tail of the offspring's earnings distribution, {{especially in the case of}} daughters' earnings.

We rode slowly: and it was nearly midnight before we reached the old tomb, facing the ruined tank, in the decayed gardens where we were going to eat and drink. I was late in coming up; and before I went into the garden, I saw that the horizon to the north carried a faint, dun-colored feather. But no one would have thanked me for spoiling so well-managed an entertainment as this picnic--and a dust-storm, more or less, does no great harm.|$|E
