5|$|Because Virginia Tech had {{received}} the opening kickoff, Georgia received the ball to open the second half. Stafford was able to connect with wide receiver Mario Raley for a 24-yard gain, taking Georgia to the 50-yard line, but Virginia Tech's defense stiffened and Georgia was forced to punt. Pinned at their ten-yard line by the Georgia punt, Virginia Tech went three-and-out and <b>was</b> <b>itself</b> forced to punt.|$|E

5|$|Because of the hurricane's {{destruction}} in Central America {{and elsewhere in}} North America, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Mitch {{in the spring of}} 1999; it will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane.

5|$|Braille's {{childhood}} home in Coupvray is a listed historic building and houses the Louis Braille Museum.

In a symbolic gesture, Braille's hands were left in Coupvray, reverently buried near his home.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{the film}} was rekindled when a stage musical called Little Shop of Horrors was {{produced}} in 1982.

5|$|The {{successful}} OPP model {{became an}} inspiration for other municipalities around the country. In 1999, Khan helped to create Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP) to collaborate with Lodhran municipal committee. Learning from past experiences, the project extended its scope to the whole town instead of concentrating on low-income settlements only. The municipal partnership <b>was</b> <b>itself</b> a new initiative that ensured wider civic co-operation.|$|E

This information was compiled into the so-called “” and was dispatched to the II Corps in December 1946 by Pilecki.

5|$|Although {{mechanisation}} of the British cavalry {{was well}} advanced by 1939, {{there was still}} a 1st Cavalry Division that served in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign during the Second World War. Eventually all the cavalry regiments were mechanised and became part of the Household Cavalry and the Royal Armoured Corps. There is still one regiment that retains their horses, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which together with the Household Cavalry Regiment was formed from the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals, which <b>was</b> <b>itself</b> an amalgamation of the Royal Horse Guards (Blues) and the 1st (Royal) Dragoons.|$|E

5|$|Because of its stiffness, {{light weight}} and {{dimensional}} stability {{over a wide}} temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and aerospace industries in high-speed aircraft, guided missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Several liquid-fuel rockets have used rocket nozzles made of pure beryllium. Beryllium powder <b>was</b> <b>itself</b> studied as a rocket fuel, but this use has never materialized. A small number of extreme high-end bicycle frames have been built with beryllium. From 1998 to 2000, the McLaren Formula One team used Mercedes-Benz engines with beryllium-aluminium-alloy pistons. The use of beryllium engine components was banned following a protest by Scuderia Ferrari.|$|E
5|$|BuroHappold {{has also}} {{completed}} {{the designs of}} a number of cardboard structures, notably the Japan Pavilion for Expo 2000 in Hanover with Shigeru Ban and Frei Otto, consisting of a gridshell of paper tubes (the structure was reinforced with steel in order to comply with fire regulations, though the tubular structure <b>was</b> <b>itself</b> structurally sufficient). The firm has worked with Shigeru Ban on a number of other projects. Another design in cardboard was the Westborough School cardboard classroom in Westcliff.|$|E
5|$|Fusō sank between 03:38 and 03:50; only a {{few dozen}} men survived the rapid sinking and oil fire.

Ten crew members are known to have survived, all of whom returned to Japan. The total number of casualties is estimated at 1,620 sailors. Fusō was removed from the navy list on 31 August 1945.|$|E

5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} word on the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but <b>was</b> <b>itself</b> classified. Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|Haley's {{contribution}} to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss {{how it should be}} characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration <b>was</b> <b>itself</b> a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of its subject.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the bus {{and coach}} {{operations}} of what was then Tillingbourne Valley Services were split. The coaching unit {{was taken over by}} Lionel Rhees, previously an employee of Tillingbourne, and operated from a depot in Chilworth under the name Tillingbourne Valley Coaches. This company bought three second-hand coaches to run on excursions and private hire operations. After 14years of operation it launched a bus service between Guildford and Blackheath. Rhees died in 1953 and Tillingbourne Valley Coaches passed to his wife, who sold out to established operator Rackliffe of Guildford a year later. Rackliffe <b>was</b> <b>itself</b> taken over by Cookes Coaches in 1955, and the Blackheath service withdrawn.|$|E
