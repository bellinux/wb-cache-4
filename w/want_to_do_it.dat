So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E

25|$|The {{possible}} {{impression that}} solo divers are unsociable is often wrong. Most solo divers are normally gregarious {{and want to}} share their enjoyment of diving with others – they just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{when they get to}} the surface. The solitude they want to enjoy is during the dive. These solo divers take pleasure in this solitude and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Finally, there is the sense of freedom, of not being impeded by the need to look after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising.|$|E

500|$|Cresswell {{admitted}} {{he had not}} made the impact {{he had hoped to}} in the York first team, but ahead of 1998–99 said [...] "I've had some stick from a small number of fans, but hopefully I can prove them wrong. I will prove them wrong. This a big season for me. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for York City. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for myself." [...] After a positive start to the season, Cresswell attracted attention from other clubs, with a number of scouts attending matches to watch him play. Manager Alan Little claimed some clubs were making illegal approaches for the player, and that this was having a detrimental effect on his performances. Preston North End manager David Moyes claimed his club had a bid of more than £500,000 for Cresswell rejected, while York chairman Douglas Craig rejected this, saying a formal offer had not been received from any club. He was York's top scorer in 1998–99 with 19 goals from 42 appearances.|$|E
500|$|First Aristotle, then Cicero and Laertius each {{alluded to}} a {{connection}} between the conatus and other emotions. In their view, the former induces the latter. They maintained that humans do not wish to do something because they think it [...] "good", but rather they think it [...] "good" [...] because they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> In other words, the cause of human desire is the natural inclination of a body to augment itself in accordance with the principles of the conatus.|$|E

I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I thought it's just so over the top and silly and kind of cliched, an art student or a film student's kind of trick.

500|$|A 1937 Salt Lake Tribune article stated that, {{after the}} 1913 controversies, reproductions of September Morn were shown [...] "on {{the front page}} of every {{newspaper}} in the land". Ortiz required these newspapers to pay a charge and mention his copyright, otherwise face a penalty of $500 to $1000; Chase recalled that Vogue had been one of those charged. These newspaper reproductions, however, were sometimes censored. Fred L. Boalt of The Seattle Star, covering a local exhibit of a reproduction, explained his newspaper's rationale for such censorship: [...] "For humane as well as other reasons, [...] the Star artist has painted in a short petticoat. He didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> He suffered. But we made him do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{negative}} reception from the preceding year's ceremony, the Academy rehired Gilbert Cates to oversee {{production of the}} awards gala. However, {{in an article published}} in The New York Times, it was stated that 2005 host Chris Rock would not return to host the show. According to a statement released by his publicist, [...] "He didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in perpetuity, He'd like to do it again down the road." [...] Furthermore, many media outlets speculated that several AMPAS members felt uncomfortable with Rock's disparaging comments about Colin Farrell, Jude Law, and Tobey Maguire. Initially, Cates sought actor and veteran Oscar host Billy Crystal to host the ceremony again. However, Crystal declined the offer citing his commitment to his one-man comedy show 700 Sundays.|$|E

During that time, she claimed, [...] "I never need to do that or <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. I'm happy being in No Doubt." [...] However, after an appearance during Pharrell Williams' performance at the 2014 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Pharrell teased that the rare live appearance from Stefani was the start of a comeback effort for the singer. Shortly after her Coachella performance, Stefani performed [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] live on The Voice to further promote her upcoming role on the show.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{intended}} to be a made-for-TV film, the film's producer Kenith Trodd upgraded his original plan to a cinema feature. The original working title for the film was [...] "Falling Man". Playwright Simon Gray was commissioned to write the screenplay, and Pat O'Connor chosen to direct. In contrast to the book, which is narrated as a recollection by Birkin as an old man, the film is set entirely in the 1920s, except for a brief moment towards the end. In initial drafts of the screenplay, Gray had included a narrator, but O'Connor felt this was not the correct way to present the story:I felt that if I couldn’t do it in the present, suggesting internal pain by performance, then I wouldn’t really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at all.|$|E

[...] "I thought, well, why would you expect that you automatically could do it? Just because I was a small girl, was I {{not to be able}} to do it? It was a memorable experience because it occurred to me then that other people had a different view of what I should or shouldn't be capable of doing. I think that people should just do whatever they can do or <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> shouldn't be a matter of if they're a man or a woman.

500|$|Following {{the death}} of Epstein in August 1967, there was a vacuum in the {{management}} of the Beatles' affairs. The Beatles asked Aspinall to take over the management of Apple Corps in 1968, which had been founded in April of the same year. Aspinall later said that he only accepted the position after being asked, but did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> full-time, and would only do it [...] "until they found somebody else." [...] George Martin (The Beatles' record producer) was against the idea, as he thought that Aspinall did not have the necessary social qualifications to be able to speak to the upper class executives at EMI. Aspinall accompanied McCartney and Lennon to New York on 11 May 1968, to announce the formation of Apple to the American Media. Apple Corps had five divisions: electronics, film, publishing, records and retailing. Aspinall later spoke of the Beatles' business arrangements: ...|$|E

It's wrong. I don't think it's a good idea. But they wanted to bring in somebody else {{as the head of the}} hospital. They wanted his [...] mother to be head of the hospital and his conflicts would be with her and I just didn't think it was right. I didn't want to write it. I just didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> [...] I didn't. Someone else came in. It was a big thing with the network.

The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing things in my career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E

500|$|During the Republican presidential {{primaries}} of 2016, {{opponents of}} Trump's candidacy used Trump University to criticize him. Mitt Romney said in early March: [...] "Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as {{a degree from}} Trump University." [...] Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio raised the subject during televised debates in February and March. One debate moderator, Megyn Kelly of Fox News, pursued the issue at length. Trump responded that Trump University was [...] "a small business" [...] and student evaluations were overwhelmingly positive. He said lawsuits were a routine part of business and that he wins most of them. Of one of the class action suits he said: [...] "It's something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> out of principle." [...] Hillary Clinton used the Trump University allegations against Trump in speeches and campaign ads.|$|E
500|$|Asked in February 2017 {{if there}} would be more Audioslave reunion shows in the future, Cornell replied, [...] "It's always a possibility. I mean, we've been talking about it for at least three or four years now. We were talking about {{actually}} picking dates, and it just ended up not working out because everybody's so busy. They have another band again, they all have separate bands that they do themselves, I have Soundgarden and a solo career that's taking up a lot of time, and I just did Temple of the Dog. So, it's really honestly as simple as we end up having a window of time where it's comfortable for everybody and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> because I definitely feel like everybody's up for it." [...] On May 18, 2017, Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit after performing at a show with Soundgarden, ending the possibility of a reunion.|$|E
500|$|Actress Lana Parrilla {{believed}} that Graham helped fill a void for her character, commenting that his loss [...] "was {{not easy for}} [...] That’s why, when she crushes his heart, there’s a tear {{coming out of her}} eye. She didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but she had no choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father. I’m not saying I agree with it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do." [...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E
