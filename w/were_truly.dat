5|$|The Choiseul pigeon was {{non-migratory}} and {{is thought}} to have lived on the forest floor in lowland forests, including coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. The Choiseul pigeon is usually considered to have been endemic to the island of Choiseul in the Solomon Islands off the coast of New Guinea, where the only specimens were collected. The specimens Meek acquired were likely collected near Choiseul Bay {{in the northern part of}} the island. The last reports of the species from the indigenous population came from the Kolombangara River. It also reportedly lived on the neighboring islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita, and it is suspected that it may once have lived on Bougainville Island. However, these reports were never confirmed and must be considered anecdotal. It would be considered very unusual if the Choiseul pigeon <b>were</b> <b>truly</b> endemic to Choiseul as the island hosts no other endemic species, and the pigeon was never linked ecologically with another species on the island.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution {{began the}} Argentine War of Independence, {{although}} no formal {{declaration of independence}} was issued {{at the time and}} the Primera Junta continued to govern {{in the name of the}} deposed king, FerdinandVII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent, the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries <b>were</b> <b>truly</b> loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the declaration of fidelity to the king was a necessary ruse to conceal the true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such a radical change. A formal declaration of independence was finally issued at the Congress of Tucumán on July9, 1816.|$|E

60|$|And now, my friends, {{surely there}} is a lesson in all this for you. Do you wish to rise like David? Of course not one in ten {{thousand}} can rise as high, but we may all rise somewhat, if not in rank, yet still, what is far better, in spirit, in wisdom, in usefulness, in manfulness. Do you wish to rise so? then follow David's example. <b>Be</b> <b>truly</b> brave, <b>be</b> <b>truly</b> modest, {{and in order to}} <b>be</b> <b>truly</b> brave and <b>truly</b> modest, that <b>is,</b> <b>be</b> <b>truly</b> manly, <b>be</b> <b>truly</b> godly.

5|$|The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide {{written by}} Rebecca Silverman, {{also of the}} Anime News Network, {{expressed}} differing sentiments than that of Dong. Silverman was quick to mention {{that she had not}} previously played the game to which the series was based on. With that being said, she described the first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play. She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive. She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the Great Kantō earthquake of the 1920s. In her full series review, Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used. Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong, Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down. She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise. On the other hand, Silverman remarked that some of the characters <b>were</b> <b>truly</b> unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} learn that A Lady Writing was traveling from The National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. to Hyde Park.

A letter from the thief appears in the newspaper, telling the public that he will not give back A Lady Writing until they prove which Vermeer paintings <b>were</b> <b>truly</b> painted by him. This sparks worldwide uproar. Calder and Petra investigate as their friendship grows. Mrs. Sharpe requests police protection and it is revealed that she and Ms. Hussey were two of the three recipients of the thief's letter. Calder and Petra eventually conclude that the painting is hidden in the local Delia Dell Hall, and they sneak out and find it. They barely escape from the thief, who is later found dead from a massive heart attack on the train by the police. They learn that the man is Xavier Glitts,also known as Glitter Man,who was posing as Tommy's stepfather under the name Fred Steadman. A known art thief, he was asked to steal the painting and sell it for sixty million dollars. The other recipient of the letter is revealed to be Mr. Watch.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, rock spawned several subgenres, {{beginning}} with surf. Surf was an instrumental guitar genre {{characterized by a}} distorted sound, associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture. Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop-friendly, and harmonic sound. As their fame grew, The Beach Boys' songwriter Brian Wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the counterculture. The counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism, and was closely connected to the hippie subculture. The hippies were associated with folk rock, country rock, and psychedelic rock. Folk and country rock {{were associated with the}} rise of politicized folk music, led by Pete Seeger and others, especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York. Folk rock entered the mainstream {{in the middle of the}} 1960s, when the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan began his career. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-1960s to Bob Dylan's influence at the time. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of San Francisco. Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit, the Grateful Dead, a country and bluegrass-flavored jam band, became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture, associated with hippies, LSD and other symbols of that era. Some say that the Grateful Dead <b>were</b> <b>truly</b> the most American patriotic rock band to have ever existed; forming and molding a culture that defines Americans today.|$|E

25|$|The same 2009 study {{highlighted}} the personality differences and negotiation mind-sets {{that contributed to}} successful outcomes. Overall, individuals who are risk-averse (e.g., worried about appearing ungrateful for the job offer) tended to avoid salary negotiations or use very weak approaches to the negotiation process. On the contrary, those who were more risk-tolerant engaged in negotiations more frequently and demonstrated superior outcomes. Individuals who approached the negotiation as a distributive problem (i.e. viewing a higher salary as a win for him/her and a loss to the employer) ended up with an increased salary, but lower rate of satisfaction upon completion. Those who approached the negotiation as an integrative problem (i.e. viewing the negotiation process an opportunity to expand the realm of possibilities and help both parties achieve a “win” outcome) were able to both secure an increased salary and an outcome they <b>were</b> <b>truly</b> satisfied with.|$|E

His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It is shown that money is no longer {{the most important thing in}} his life. For one episode he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess, over everything else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him.|$|E

25|$|In 1386, the Portuguese and English {{signed the}} Treaty of Windsor. The pact of mutual support fostered a strong {{diplomatic}} {{alliance between the}} two countries (and was still valid and applicable as of 2009). Over the ensuing centuries, whenever England was in conflict with other European powers (most notably France), Portugal and its many vineyards were there to fill in the gap caused by the disruption of trade. Portuguese wine also served as a bargaining chip in English politics. In 1679, the English Parliament banned all imports of French wine as a means of limiting the tariff income of Charles II and forcing him to come to Parliament and ask them directly for funds. Charles and the English wine merchants turned again to Portugal, dramatically increasing imports of Portuguese wines from 427 tuns in 1678 to averaging over 14,000 tuns (roughly equivalent to 16 million liters or over 4million US gallons) a year by 1685. However, it is very likely that not all these imported tuns <b>were</b> <b>truly</b> Portuguese wines, as some wine merchants found their way around the French wine embargo by shipping their wares in Portuguese wine barrels with forged documentation.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{hypothesis is that}} learners {{in this type of}} task may be using a “propose-but-verify” mechanism rather than a statistical learning mechanism. Medina et al. and Trueswell et al. argue that, because Yu and Smith only tracked knowledge {{at the end of the}} training, rather than tracking knowledge on a trial-by-trial basis, it is impossible to know if participants <b>were</b> <b>truly</b> updating statistical probabilities of co-occurrence (and therefore maintaining multiple hypotheses simultaneously), or if, instead, they were forming a single hypothesis and checking it on the next trial. For example, if a participant is presented with a picture of a dog and a picture of a shoe, and hears the nonsense word vash she might hypothesize that vash refers to the dog. On a future trial, she may see a picture of a shoe and a picture of a door and again hear the word vash. If statistical learning is the mechanism by which word-referent mappings are learned, then the participant would be more likely to select the picture of the shoe than the door, as shoe would have appeared in conjunction with the word vash 100% of the time. However, if participants are simply forming a single hypothesis, they may fail to remember the context of the previous presentation of vash (especially if, as in the experimental conditions, there are multiple trials with other words in between the two presentations of vash) and therefore be at chance in this second trial. According to this proposed mechanism of word learning, if the participant had correctly guessed that vash referred to the shoe in the first trial, her hypothesis would be confirmed in the subsequent trial.|$|E
