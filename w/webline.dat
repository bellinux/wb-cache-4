40|$|Abstract: Web search {{encompasses}} {{more than}} fact retrieval; it {{is a primary}} entry point for learning. Exploratory search tasks are attempts at such learning and require cognitive, strategic, and interpretive work from the user. The pathways of such searches are likewise complex and nuanced. The present study attempts to enable the human work that goes into conducting exploratory searches to be efficiently captured and transmitted to other learners. By this method, web search expertise can transfer socially and implicitly between users instead of developing individually or through directed learning. The system we deployed uses an existing metaphor, the timeline, to structure insights from searches. We refer to these semantically meaningful representations as ‘weblines’. We deployed a live system to 81 users in three user populations. The resulting <b>weblines</b> were delineated into four types. Successful <b>weblines</b> were those that participants used to iteratively reflect upon the insights of their searches. Introduction and motivation Web search {{has emerged as a}} primary entry point to acquiring, confirming, and analyzing knowledge.

Discrimination {{and harassment}} on the Internet take many forms and can be more damaging and insidious than the face-to-face forms of abuse. This conceptual paper looks at two types of abusive online conduct that have emerged due to the proliferation of the Internet in our lives: <b>Weblining</b> and cyberbullying.

5000|$|The Vulture {{appears in}} the first arc in the Spider-Gwen solo series taking place on Earth-65 where Gwen Stacy was bitten by the {{radioactive}} spider. Vulture appears more deranged than his Earth-616 incarnation and secretes a green gaseous cloud wherever he goes. Vulture was attacking police officers while mentioning how Spider-Woman [...] "killed" [...] Peter Parker and was easily lured out by Gwen who wrote graffiti insults towards him all over the city. Once she caught his attention, both fought. As Vulture was flying away, Spider-Woman shot a <b>webline</b> {{in order to be}} carried away with him and follow him. However, Vulture used the claws in his suit to rip the web, causing Spider-Woman to fall from a great height With Spider-Woman believed dead, Vulture was captured by Kingpin's henchmen and beaten up by Matt Murdock. Vulture admitted not being certain of Spider-Woman's death {{due to the lack of}} a body. He was ordered by Matt Murdock to find evidence of her survival. Vulture attacked George Stacy in his home in order to find his connection with Spider-Woman due to her rescuing him from Aleksei Sytsevich time ago and gassed the residence. Gwen, who was on the scene, used the gas as a cover to change to her Spider-Woman suit and confront Vulture. After being shot in the shoulder by George Stacy, Vulture was forced to flee. Spider-Woman followed him where she managed to beat him even though she was under the effects of the gas. He was then left webbed to a police car.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Quality {{assurance}} {{of the image}} quality for image guided localization systems is crucial to ensure accurate visualization and localization of target volumes. In this study, the stability of selected image parameters was assessed and evaluated for CBCT mode, planar radiographic kV mode and the radiographic MV EPID mode. Methods and Materials : The CATPHAN, QckV- 1 and QC- 3 phantoms were {{used to evaluate the}} image quality parameters. The planar radiographic images were analyzed in PIPSpro™ with spatial resolution (f 30, f 40, f 50) being recorded. For OBI CBCT, High quality head Full-Fan acquisition and Pelvis Half-Fan acquisition modes were evaluated for Uniformity, Noise, Spatial Resolution, HU constancy and geometric distortion. Dose and kVp for the OBI were recorded using the Unfors RaySafe Xi system with the R/F High Detector for planar kV and the CT detector for CBCT. Dose for the MV EPID was recorded using a PTW 975 Semiflex Ion Chamber, <b>webline</b> electrometer and 1 cm SolidWater™. Results: For each metric, values were normalized to the mean and the standard deviations were recorded. Table 1 shows the standard deviation for all results. Using this, tolerances can be reported as a warning threshold of 1 σ and an action threshold of 2 σ. Table 2 shows the warning and action tolerances for the planar radiographic modalities while T able 3 and 4 show tolerance levels for the Full-Fan and Half-Fan, respectively. Conclusion : A study was performed to assess the stability of the basic image quality parameters recommended by TG- 142 for the Varian OBI and EPID Imaging systems. The two systems show consistent imaging and dosimetric properties over the evaluated time frame. [...] Cite this article as: Stanley DN, Papanikolaou N, Gutierrez AN.

50|$|According to Gerry Conway, {{who wrote}} the Spider-Mobile stories, the vehicle stemmed from a {{conversation}} between then-Marvel Comics publisher (and Spider-Man co-creator) Stan Lee and a toy company representative, who told Lee that cars were a very popular toy for children and that if Spider-Man had a car {{it would be a}} very lucrative tie-in. Conway thought that Spider-Man having a car made no sense since swinging from building to building on <b>weblines</b> was one of the character's main motifs, but Lee insisted that he introduce a car in the comics, and assured Conway that he could wreck the car as soon as possible if he wanted.|$|R
50|$|In another storyline, the Green Goblin {{once again}} replays the scenario, {{this time with}} Spider-Man's wife Mary Jane Watson-Parker. As with Gwen, Mary Jane plummets toward her death (this time from the recoil from her gun when she shoots at the Green Goblin). Learning from his {{previous}} error, Spider-Man uses multiple <b>weblines</b> and catches every major joint, saving Mary Jane from suffering the same whiplash effect that killed Gwen. A similar event occurs when Spider-Man saves Anna Maria—the girlfriend of Otto Octavius {{during a time when}} he was in Spider-Man's body—when Green Goblin uses her as a hostage and throws her off a building after learning that his true enemy has returned, Peter reflecting as he catches Anna Maria that he has learned over time to catch every joint in moments like this to limit potential whiplash.|$|R
5000|$|The film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) {{explores the}} extent of Peter's home-made suit and the suit that Stark gives him. The {{homemade}} suit {{appears to be a}} cross between the Spider-Man Noir's suit (the goggles, which have more adaptive lenses than the Stark suit) and the Scarlet Spider suits (in terms of the color scheme and use of a hoodie). The web fluid, which Peter makes in secret during chemistry class, has a design which harkens back to Marc Webb's Amazing Spider Man duology. The logos are drawn on with permanent markers. The Stark suit's full extent (each feature activated by voice command) features retractable web wings under his arms from the comics, allowing him to glide in the air; 3D holographic displays in the web shooters; a heads-up display in the mask similar to Spider-Man's webware and an artificial intelligence assistant built into the suit which Peter refers to as [...] "Karen" [...] (Jennifer Connelly), similar to Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S.; a flying drone {{in the form of the}} front spider logo, which can detach to become the drone; 576 different web combinations, including taser web (a web line which can be electrified), ricochet web (a web strand/ball that will bounce off a surface before hitting a certain target), web grenade (a disc containing webbing that will snare a specific target), rapid-fire web balls, and splitter web (two <b>weblines</b> that can fuse into one); light-up displays; voice-alteration for interrogation; spider tracers that mimic actual spiders; and a parachute in the back spider logo. The Stark-designed suit is confiscated from Peter when his eagerness to prove himself results in the destruction of a ferry during an arms deal, forcing Peter to use his original home-made suit when intercepting Adrian Toomes' raid of a jet transporting weapons from the recently-sold Stark Tower. After Peter has proven himself once again, Stark shows him a new Spider-Man suit that appears to be more heavily armoured, much like the 'Big Time' suits Peter built in Horizon Labs in the comics, as well as the iron spider suit, 'Ends of the Earth' armor from the comics, and 'Spider Man ps4' [...] suit (it's design reflects that of the original Stark-designed suit, aside from a more metallic look; spider logos that cover the chest, back, sides, and shoulders; gold highlights (most notably around the front logo); and the blue areas are darker); but Peter turns down this suit and the accompanying offer of official membership of the Avengers in favour of spending more time acting as a hero to his own neighbourhood, although Stark returns the suit he originally created to Peter with a note stating that it belongs to him.|$|R
