50|$|There {{are three}} types of whisking. Exploratory whisking occurs when animals <b>whisk</b> <b>in</b> air without contact or with only light contact. In this case, the stroke on a given whisk {{approaches}} 70°, and a total field of up to 160° may be covered as the animal slowly shifts the set point of its whisk. Such whisking is extremely regular and typically occurs with a frequency between 7 and 12 Hz and a mean of 9 Hz. Asymmetric whisking occurs when animals make contact with a large object, such as a wall, while they whisk. It also occurs if they turn their {{head to the side}} while whisking. Asymmetric whisking lasts for only one to three whisk cycles. Foveal whisking occurs when animals thrust all their vibrissae forward to palpate an object ahead of them, as occurs when they try to detect a landing {{on the far side of}} a gap. In this case the stroke is much reduced, typically to 20°. The frequency of foveal whisking is high,ranging between 15 and 25 Hz, and rats can readily switch between foveal and exploratory whisking.|$|E
40|$|The rat has {{a strong}} 6 – 9 Hz rhythm of {{electrical}} activity in the hippocampus, known as the theta rhythm. Exploratory whisking, i. e., the rhythmicmovement of the rat’s vibrissas to acquire tactile information, occurs within the same frequency range as the theta rhythm and provides a model system {{to examine the relationship}} between theta rhythm and active sensory movements. In particular, it has been postulated that these two rhythms are phase locked as a means to synchronize sensory and hippocampal processing. We tested this hypothesis in rats trained to <b>whisk</b> <b>in</b> air. Theta activity was measured via field electrodes in the hippocampus, and whisking was measured via the mystacial electromyogram. We calculated the spectral coherence between these two signals as a means to quantify the extent of phase locking. First, we found that the fraction of epochs with high coherence is not significantly greater than that expected by chance (sevenof eight animals and as a population average). Second,we found that the trial-averaged coherence is low (coherence, 0. 1) and, as an average across all animals, statistically insignificant. We further askedwhether the strengthof the theta rhythmcorrelatedwith that of whisking, independent of the lack of cycle-by-cycle coherence. We observe that the correlation is weak and insignificant (six of eight animals and as a population average). We conclude that there is no relationship between the whisking and theta rhythms, at least when animals <b>whisk</b> <b>in</b> air...|$|E

40|$|Rats use rhythmic {{movements}} of their vibrissae (whiskers) to tactually explore their environment. This “whisking ” behavior has gener-ally {{been reported to}} be strictly synchronous and symmetric about the snout, and it is thought to be controlled by a brainstem central pattern generator. Because the vibrissae can move independently of the head, however, maintaining a stable perception of the world would seem to require that rats adjust the bilateral symmetry of whiskermovements in response to headmovements. The present study used high-speed videography to reveal dramatic bilateral asymmetries and asynchronies in free-air whisking during head rotations. Kinematic analysis suggested that these asymmetricmovements did not serve tomaintain any fixed temporal relationship between right and left arrays, but rather to redirect the whiskers to a different region of space. More specifically, spatial asymmetry was found to be strongly correlated with rotational head velocity, ensuring a “look-ahead ” distance of almost exactly one <b>whisk.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, bilateral asynchronyandvelocity asymmetrywereonlyweaklydependentonheadvelocity. Bilateral phasedifferencewas found tobe independent of the whisking frequency, suggesting the presence of two distinct left and right central pattern generators, connected as coupled oscillators. We suggest that the spatial asymmetries are analogous to the saccade that occurs during the initial portion of a combined head–eye gaze shift, and we begin to develop the rat vibrissal system as a new model for studying vestibular and proprioceptive contributions to the acquisition of sensory data.

40|$|The {{sense of}} touch {{provides}} information about the texture of an object with much better resolution than the other senses. Primates perceive texture by actively moving their fingertips over an object and encoding the resulting spatiotemporal patterns of activation of mechanoreceptors in the skin. Within the primate fingertip many types of mechanoreceptors are densely packed in the skin {{making it difficult to}} study the individual components of these complex patterns. Rats' ability to discriminate texture using the whiskers is comparable to humans using the fingertips and due to its discrete array of whiskers on the facial pad the rat whisker system offers considerable advantages for studying texture coding. However, to date, very little is known about how behaving rats actively use their whiskers to extract texture information and how this information is encoded in the nervous system. Currently there are two main hypotheses on how rats perform texture discrimination using their whiskers. In one hypothesis, whisker motion across a texture is underdamped, and texture properties drive whisker resonance as the whisker moves across a surface. In this model, the systematic variation in resonance frequency across whiskers enables texture to be encoded by the differential amplitude of vibration across whiskers. In a second, alternative hypothesis, resonance is diminished due to damping and texture information is encoded in the precise motion of each whisker across the surface. Both of these hypotheses are supported by experiments performed in anesthetized animals, however to resolve this debate it is critical to examine whisker dynamics in awake animals to determine 1) to what extent whisker resonance shapes sensory input during active whisker use and 2) how whisker dynamics reflect texture properties when the whiskers are under active muscular control. Chapter 2 of this dissertation examines whisker vibrations measured in behaving animals trained to <b>whisk</b> <b>in</b> air. We show that, {{in the absence of any}} sensory stimulus, high frequency whisker vibrations are presents and that these are filtered by whisker resonance. This suggests that, in the awake behaving animal, resonance can play a role in shaping sensory responses in the whiskers. Chapter 3 shows that active palpation onto textures can induce whisker resonance. However we argue that the degree to which resonance occurs is not dependent on the spatial properties of the texture and therefore it is unlikely to be critical for texture encoding arguing against the resonance hypothesis. We present an alternative model for texture encoding based on the magnitude of stick-slip events that were found to occur during texture palpation. We also examine the role that muscles may play in causing these stick-slip events. Chapter 4 concludes by presenting preliminary results of the neural response to stick-slip events. We show that the spiking probability of a subset of neurons is greatly increased following a texture-induced slip and that the spiking probability increases with slip acceleration, as would be required for the texture encoding hypothesis presented in chapter...|$|E

40|$|Rats {{discriminate}} surface textures {{using their}} whiskers (vibrissae), but how whiskers extract texture information, {{and how this}} information is encoded by the brain, are not known. In the resonance model, whisker motion across different textures excites mechanical resonance in distinct subsets of whiskers, due to variation across whiskers in resonance frequency, which varies with whisker length. Texture information is therefore encoded by the spatial pattern of activated whiskers. In the competing kinetic signature model, different textures excite resonance equally across whiskers, and instead, texture is encoded by characteristic, nonuniform temporal patterns of whisker motion. We tested these models by measuring whisker motion in awake, behaving rats <b>whisking</b> <b>in</b> air and onto sandpaper surfaces. Resonant motion was prominent during <b>whisking</b> <b>in</b> air, with fundamental frequencies ranging from approximately 35 Hz for the long Delta whisker to approximately 110 Hz for the shorter D 3 whisker. Resonant vibrations also occurred while whisking against textures, but the amplitude of resonance within single whiskers was independent of texture, contradicting the resonance model. Rather, whiskers resonated transiently during discrete, high-velocity, and high-acceleration slip-stick events, which occurred prominently during whisking on surfaces. The rate and magnitude of slip-stick events varied systematically with texture. These results suggest that texture is encoded not by differential resonant motion across whiskers, but by the magnitude and temporal pattern of slip-stick motion. These findings predict a temporal code for texture in neural spike trains...|$|R

We present and discuss consequences of the <b>whisking</b> process <b>in</b> purely mechanical terms and hypothesize that free <b>whisking</b> <b>in</b> air sets a mechanical threshold for contact detection.
