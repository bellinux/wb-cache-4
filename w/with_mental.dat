These mentioned families should manage the crisis, but successful managing of this situation can be very strengthening element. The families <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability child manifest in different way than the families with healthy children, because the birth of child <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability intervenes {{the peace of the}} whole family. This fact can remark the family even this way, which the physical problems can appear by the parents or they can incline to risk change of their behaviour. The parents? roles also could change and exists also risk, that brothers and sister of child <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability can follow contacts with difficulties. These families have their own particularity, because the birth of child <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability means great stress for these families. The theoretic part of this work pays attention to a mental disability and its classification. Further are the welfare services available, which can families <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability child use of. It is not also left out the role of family, the importance of parental roles and brotherly and sisterly constellation. I describe style of upbringing and further I concern the particularity of family <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability child in my dissertation likewise the role of brother and sister by the child <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability. There are also stages of acceptance with the diagnosis of a mental disability and risk behaviour of parents these children <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability as results of managing critical situation described and the related physical problems. The target of dissertation is finding out if exists diametrically differences between parental roles by the care about a mental disability child and the healthy child. The intermediate target is finding out if the families <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability child are more predisposed to a presence of social pathological syndromes. The theory expects following fact that the care for a mental disability child has provided by overall in majority by mothers. Families <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability child incline to risk change of their behaviour than by the families with the healthy child. Brothers and sisters of a mental disability child do less friendly relationships than of the healthy children. The approach to quantitative study was used at all. The strategy of questionnaire: The questionnaire inquiry was performed by the 20 families with healthy children and by the 20 families <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability child. The filled questionnaires had evaluated using the elementary statistics of software programmes SPSS and Excel. I found out more conflicting relationships between brothers and sisters in the families <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability child than in the families with healthy children. Brothers and sisters of a mental disability child care more about their mental disability brother or sister than the elder brothers and sisters care about their younger ones. Likewise the brothers and sisters <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability brother or sister have less friendly relationships than the children with healthy brothers and sisters. Families with healthy children enjoy more harmonious parental care than by the families <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability child and mainly mothers do it. The grandparents act on behalf of parents with healthy children more often than in the families <b>with</b> a <b>mental</b> disability child, there exists often absence caring grandparents.

40|$|Objectives:  Comparatively {{few people}} <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness are {{employed}} despite evidence {{that many people}} within this group wish to obtain, can obtain and sustain employment, and that employment can contribute to recovery. This investigation aimed to: (i) describe the current policy and service environment within which people <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness receive employment services; (ii) identify evidence-based practices that improve employment outcomes for people <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness; (iii) {{determine the extent to}} which the current Australian policy environment is consistent with the implementation of evidence-based employment services for people <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness; and (iv) identify methods and priorities for enhancing employment services for Australians <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness through implementation of evidence-based practices. Method:  Current Australian practices were identified, having reference to policy and legal documents, funding body requirements and anecdotal reports. Evidence-based employment services for people <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness were identified through examination of published reviews and the results of recent controlled trials. Results:  Current policy settings support the provision of employment services for people <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness separate from clinical services. Recent studies have identified integration of clinical and employment services as a major factor in the effectiveness of employment services. This is usually achieved through co-location of employment and mental health services. Conclusions:  Optimal evidence-based employment services are needed by Australians <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> illness. Providing optimal services is a challenge in the current policy environment.

5|$|In 1897 Max Weber Sr. {{died two}} months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, Weber became {{increasingly}} prone to depression, nervousness and insomnia, {{making it difficult for}} him to fulfill his duties as a professor.

After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> illness was carefully described in a personal chronology that was destroyed by his wife.
