5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} values is a focus on hands-on learning. The program emphasizes use of experiential learning activities in the context of outdoor education. These help participants retain <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> about leadership generally and the eleven leadership competencies specifically. For example, participant teams can be challenged to build foot bridges, complete a hike, build a Tyrolean Traverse, cook a meal, or other practical challenges.|$|E
5|$|The script {{calls for}} five actors to portray ten {{characters}}. The two main characters are Jason, a young Canadian lawyer; and Number 18, a young female prostitute {{who claims to}} be fifteen years old {{and has been a}} prostitute for six years. The drama centers on Jason's infiltration of a brothel ring that is trafficking girls into Bangkok. Jason comes to believe that Number 18 could be a key witness to a human trafficking incident and tries to gain her trust and persuade her to testify against the ring. The victimized child in the play is known only by the number 18 to reflect how traffickers often dehumanize their victims by giving them a new name or simply a number, which in some cases is branded onto the victim's body. Waldschmidt said he hoped that She Has a Name will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn,</b> thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists.|$|E
5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn,</b> thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E

5|$|In a Schrödinger's cat-like situation, {{immediately}} {{prior to}} the start of the Nonary Game, Dio either murdered the old woman and took her place in the game, or failed to do so but was still placed into the game by her and later planted the bombs. In the timeline leading to the game's ultimate ending, Sigma defuses the bombs, while Dio is restrained and incapacitated. The remaining participants proceed to the next set of puzzle rooms. As Sigma, Phi, and Tenmyouji complete their room, they uncover a holographic message of the old woman, Akane Kurashiki, whom Tenmyouji – revealed to be the player character Junpei from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors – was seeking. Akane and Zero Sr. had developed the AB project, a project that encompassed the Nonary Game and the Ambidex Game, to train Sigma and Phi to transport their consciousnesses through time. This occurs shortly thereafter, and Phi subdues Dio before he can kill Akane. Akane explains that the game's dangerous elements were necessary to speed up one's brain to transport one's consciousness through time, and each participant was infected with Radical-6 to amplify this increase. The Nonary Game was designed so Sigma and Phi could experience multiple timelines and retain <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> in each one. Sigma and Phi's consciousnesses are then returned to the present, where they find everyone has cooperated to acquire enough points to escape.|$|E

Just before the bomb explodes, one of the aliens ejects Ian and Louise from the craft, knocking them unconscious. When they reawaken, the military is preparing to evacuate, and the craft has moved out of reach. Ian discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message, and that the writing occupies exactly one-twelfth of the space {{in which it is}} projected. Louise suggests that the full message is split among the twelve craft and that the aliens want all the nations to share <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn.</b>|$|E

25|$|Not {{knowing what}} to expect, the British schoolteachers are at first most excited about {{learning}} from and working with each other, as under no other circumstances would the three schools {{be able to come}} together and exchange ideas. Finding the same hustle bustle at 4 in the morning at the Jinnah International Airport as the plane lands in Karachi that they would at 8 pm in Birmingham kick-starts the series of experiences and discoveries that this documentary explores.

2500|$|The goal of {{the program}} is that {{participants}} would integrate <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> at Camp Rising Sun into their lives and pass it along to others. After the two months of sharing and working together, Jonas wanted campers to return to their communities the benefits they had gained. He said, [...] "We ask that the boys return to life, some day and in some way, the good they have received from it. So, we do ask a price, and its a rather high one." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Roving Outdoor Conservation School (ROCS), {{started in}} 2000, is a twenty-one day trek {{program that is}} open to males and females {{between the ages of}} sixteen and twenty-one. ROCS is an {{educational}} backpacking experience rooted in conservation and environmental science education. [...] Throughout the trek participants have lessons rooted in environmental science, visits from guest speakers, and the opportunity to work on conservation projects with the Philmont Conservation Department and the U.S. Forest Service in the Valle Vidal Unit of the Carson National Forest. While on the trail participants learn about ecology, botany, dendrology, geology, hydrology, forestry, soil science, fire ecology, environmental policy, leave no trace principles, environmental ethics, conservation techniques, and wildlife, range, and land management practices. Participants tackle conservation projects ranging from trailbuilding to meadow encroachment to timber stand improvement to erosion control to streambed restoration. [...] Participants are exposed to the land management challenges facing the West, as well as the rest of America. The program focuses on empowering participants so that they may transfer <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> on the trail to their lives back home.|$|E
50|$|When an {{educator}} differentiates by product or performance, they are affording students various ways of demonstrating <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have <b>learned</b> from the lesson or unit (Anderson, 2007; Nunley, 2006).

6000|$|Ladies, {{these are}} {{subjects}} on which I must beg to speak {{a little more}} at length, premising them by one statement, which may seem jest, but is solemn earnest--that, if the medical men of {{this or any other}} city were what the world now calls [...] "alive to their own interests"--that is, to the mere making of money; instead of being, what medical men are, the most generous, disinterested, and high-minded class in these realms, then they would oppose by all means in their power the delivery of lectures on natural philosophy to women. For if women act upon <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> in those lectures--and having women's hearts, they will act upon it-- there ought to follow a decrease of sickness and an increase of health, especially among children; a thrift of life, and a thrift of expense besides, which would very seriously affect the income of medical men.|$|E

6000|$|Such an {{expression}} of unhappiness was enough by itself to make one's eyes slide above the paper's edge to the poor woman's face--insignificant without that look, almost a symbol of human destiny with it. Life's {{what you see in}} people's eyes; life's <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn,</b> and, having learnt it, never, though they seek to hide it, cease to be aware of--what? That life's like that, it seems. Five faces opposite--five mature faces--and the knowledge in each face. Strange, though, how people want to conceal it! Marks of reticence are on all those faces: lips shut, eyes shaded, each one of the five doing something to hide or stultify his knowledge. One smokes; another reads; a third checks entries in a pocket book; a fourth stares at the map of the line framed opposite; and the fifth--the terrible thing about the fifth is that she does nothing at all. She looks at life. Ah, but my poor, unfortunate woman, do play the game--do, for all our sakes, conceal it! ...|$|E
60|$|One moonlit {{night the}} old wolf took her cubs {{to the edge}} of one of these snow-fields, where the eager eyes soon noticed dark streaks {{shooting}} hither and yon over the bare white surface. At first they chased them wildly; but one might as well try to catch a moonbeam, which has not so many places to hide as a wood-mouse. Then, remembering the grasshoppers, they crouched and crept and so caught a few. Meanwhile old mother wolf lay still in hiding, contenting herself with snapping up the game that came to her, instead of chasing it wildly all over the snow-field. The example was not lost; for imitation is strong among intelligent animals, and most of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> is due simply to following the mother. Soon the cubs were still, one lying here under shadow of a bush, another there by a gray rock that lifted its head out of the snow. As a dark streak moved nervously by one of these hiding-places there would be a rush, a snap, the pchap pchap of jaws crunching a delicious morsel; then all quiet again, with only gray, innocent-looking shadows resting softly on the snow. So they moved gradually along the edges of the great white field; and next morning the tracks were all there, plain as daylight, telling their silent story of good hunting.|$|E

40|$|Working with {{children}} from Hannah More Primary School, Bristol, I brought together their reflections {{of working on}} an intensive week long Black history project with a groups of local artists. UWE BA Photography students documented {{the activities of the}} week, which provided the visuals for the audio interviews I conducted. The children, between the ages of 6 - 11, spoke spontaneously, eloquently and without any preparation, about their experiences, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> felt about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned.</b> <b>They</b> also articulated how this learning differed from their usual curriculum, and the impact of such learning for themselves, their sense of identity, and the impact potentially for others. The project highlights the potential of teaching history and citizenship through creative methodologies, and subsequently using further creativity to disseminate the results. The work with Hannah More Primary School will continue on other projects, exploring possibilities of using creative media to communicate school values and ethos. Watch the film here - [URL]...|$|R
