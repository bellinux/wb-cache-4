500|$|Mike Portnoy {{said that}} since {{it was one of}} the more aggressive, more driving songs on the album, that the lyrics were very much a metaphor for his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. With {{everything}} he does for Dream Theater as well as his life in general, that his [...] "wheels are always in constant motion", and that he's always juggling many different projects or responsibilities for the band at the same time.

500|$|Idol was keen {{to share}} his ideas {{regarding}} the future of Cyberculture {{and its impact on}} the music industry, and was noted for his enthusiastic speculation in the future of computers throughout the promotion of the album. [...] "You're using very sort of extreme and raw ideas, but with very high level technology... it's probably <b>whats</b> <b>going</b> to be happeningor in fact, it is what is happening nowbecause that's how we made this album, Cyberpunk." [...] Some of the predictions Idol made for the future of the internet, computers, and musicians, was that it would allow for cheap and efficient recording from home; that musicians could record their music and send it to producers and fellow band members from great distances, perhaps while on tour; and that musicians would be able to directly communicate with their fans and critics. Idol also hoped that the rapid ability to do whatever he desired with the production would allow raw forms of rock music to remain relevant after the Grunge movement swept America in the early 90s. [...] " [...] can do anything... If you want the music backwards, it can be backwards in a snap. This is in a way my sort of answer to grunge. I know there's a way of using this modern technology to bring a lot of rawness back." ...|$|E
500|$|Major {{parts of}} the song [...] "Sadda Haq" [...] were shot at the Norbulingka monastery in McLeod Ganj, Dharamsala and people waving the free Tibet flag in the {{backdrop}} were shown in the song video. This triggered a dispute between Central Board of Film Certification and Imtiaz Ali when the Board asked Ali to blur the flag before the film hit the theatre, but the director refused to do it. Imtiaz Ali said, [...] "I am not concerned at all. I {{have been out of}} India for long and don’t know <b>whats</b> <b>going</b> on, but I don’t see anything controversial in the intention portrayal in the movie. The purpose of the movie is not to make any social message, its more about personal freedom rather than a geographical issue." [...] However, he had to remove the sequence from the video to get the film's censor done. Later an official from the Board stated: [...] "The Censor Board chief explained to them that all the cuts were made by the director voluntarily, and he had the option of appealing to a review board which he didn’t do. There were certain discussions between (Imtiaz) Ali and the Board regarding retaining a kiss between two actors (Ranbir and Nargis), but there have been no disagreement regarding deleting the flag from the frames." [...] The controversy sparked protests among the Tibetan diaspora in Dharamsala and Chennai. Later television broadcasts blotted out a [...] "Free Tibet" [...] banner featured in the song.|$|E
