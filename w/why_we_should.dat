25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two reasons <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, in our world today, language is by no means the only communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never just read or write; rather, we always read or write something in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text we read there are different ways in which we read depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that meet our particular purposes in reading them.|$|E

Officials in the state of Rio feared images of poverty might affect tourism and accused Jackson of exploiting the poor. Ronaldo Cezar Coelho, the state secretary for Industry, Commerce and Tourism demanded editing rights over the finished product, stating, [...] "I don't see <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have to facilitate films that will contribute nothing to all our efforts to rehabilitate Rio's image". Some were concerned that scenes of poverty and human rights abuses would affect their chances of hosting the Olympics in 2004. Others supported Jackson's wish to highlight the problems of the region, arguing that the government were embarrassed by their own failings.|$|E

AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered Here We Go Again [...] "not {{quite as much}} fun", as Lovato's debut album Don't Forget, [...] "but still fun, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like ... 'Remember December'." [...] Erlewine also named the song {{one of the best}} tracks on the album.

[...] Writer and friend Witter Bynner recalled that in , Saint-Gaudens was seriously ill with cancer, and was carried to his studio for ten minutes a day to critique {{the work of his}} assistants on current projects, including the cent. Saint-Gaudens sent Roosevelt a design in February for the obverse of the cent showing a figure of Liberty. [...] Roosevelt suggested the addition of a Native American war bonnet, stating, [...] "I don't see <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not have a conventional head-dress of purely American type for the Liberty figure." [...] In , Roosevelt instructed that the Indian design be developed for the eagle instead. [...] Saint-Gaudens was by then in declining health; he died on , 1907, without having submitted another design for the cent.|$|E

She sees, and we see exactly what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny." [...] A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film [...] "exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious" [...] and said [...] "This {{is not a matter}} of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. If you pay close attention, [...] "Somewhere" [...] will show you everything." [...] Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing [...] "the question of <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and [...] "really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time." ...|$|E

[...] Blessy Chettiar of DNA India, noted the music of the film and Farhan Akhtar's acting as highlights of the film: [...] "For all this, the storywriters use heavy doses of symbolism. Deep-sea diving at Costa Brava, sky-diving in Sevilla and the San Fermin bull run in Pamplona, not to forget the Tomatina festival in Bunyol, where Arjun finally lets go. Fears are drowned, let open in the sky and finally at the mercy of raging bulls", he wrote, giving it 3 stars. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN stated, [...] "Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara takes the light-hearted tone of a fun, all-boys road trip through Spain to give you a deep and heartfelt message on <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> live life by seizing the moment and following our hearts." [...] He also praised the performance of the cast, highlighting it as one of the main positives of the film, but points out that the film's length [...] "sucks some fun of out of the ride" [...] and gave a rating of 3.5 stars. On the contrary, Raja Sen of Rediff held that the film [...] "tried too hard to be cool" [...] and gave it 1.5/5 stars.|$|E

2500|$|Although these {{specific}} indicia of California's intent in enacting 25524.2 {{are subject to}} varying interpretation, there are two further reasons <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not become embroiled in attempting to ascertain California's true motive. First, inquiry into legislative motive is often an unsatisfactory venture. United States v. O'Brien, 391 [...] U.S. 367, 383 (1968). What motivates one legislator {{to vote for a}} statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it. Second, it would be particularly pointless for us to engage in such inquiry here when {{it is clear that the}} States have been allowed to retain authority over the need for electrical generating facilities easily sufficient to permit a State so inclined to halt the construction of new nuclear plants by refusing on economic grounds to issue certificates of public convenience in individual proceedings. In these circumstances, it should be up to Congress to determine whether a State has misused the authority left in its hands.|$|E
2500|$|The {{assassination}} of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914 initiated {{a month of}} unsuccessful diplomatic attempts to avoid war. These attempts ended with Grey's proposal for a four-power conference of Britain, Germany, France and Italy, following the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia {{on the evening of}} 23 July. Grey's initiative was rejected by Germany as [...] "not practicable". During this period, Cassar considers that; [...] "The country was overwhelmingly opposed to intervention." [...] Much of Asquith's cabinet was similarly inclined, Lloyd George writing in his memoirs; [...] "The Cabinet was hopelessly divided—fully one third, if not one half, being opposed to our entry into the War." [...] This overlooked his own opposition; on 27 July, he told a journalist; [...] "There could be no question of our taking part in any war in the first instance. He knew of no Minister who would be in favour of it." [...] Asquith himself, while growing more aware of the impending catastrophe, was still uncertain of the necessity for Britain's involvement. On 24 July, he wrote to Venetia; [...] "We are within measurable, or imaginable, distance of a real Armageddon.
