40|$|The optical {{interferometry}} {{has been widely}} explored for surface measurement due to the advantages of non-contact and high accuracy interrogation. Eventually, some interferometers are used to measure both rough and smooth surfaces such as white light interferometer and <b>wavelength</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>interferometer</b> (WSI). The WSI can measure large discontinuous surface profiles without the phase ambiguity problems. However, the WSI usually needs to capture hundreds of interferograms at different wavelength in order to evaluate the surface finish for a sample.

A halogen light source combined with an acousto-optic tuneable filter is used to generate a sequence of filtered light in a Linnik interferometer, {{which leads to a}} sequence of interferograms captured by a CCD camera. When a transparent thin film is measured, the reflection signals from both the top and bottom surfaces of the film will interfere with the reference signal. At the same time, the multiple reflection signals between the two film surfaces will also interfere with each other. Effective separation of the interference signals from each other is the key to achieving a successful measurement. By performing a frequency-domain analysis, these interference signals can be separated. An optimized Fourier transform method is used in the analysis. Measurements of the top and bottom surface finishes of the film, as well as the film thickness map, have been achieved.

There are increasing needs for measurements of such items as machined surfaces, contact lenses, paint texture, cell structure, and integrated circuit devices, to name a few.

Phase-measurement interferometry methods are limited to surfaces {{that do not have}} any discontinuities larger than one quarter of the operating wavelength. On the other hand, vertical <b>scanning</b> <b>interferometers</b> can be very effective, even though they have low height resolution compared to that of phase-measurement interferometers.

This work provides a new algorithm, which called here "PSI on the Fly" technique, as a solution for improving height resolution of vertical <b>scanning</b> <b>interferometers.</b> This dissertation begins with a review of white-light interference microscopes. The height and lateral resolutions are derived based on scalar diffraction theory. Next, various well-established. algorithms for finding a topographic map of the small object surface are discussed. The work proceeds with a discussion of the phase change upon reflection and its influence on the coherence envelope. Then phase measurement interferometry methods are reviewed. The emphasis is in errors in phase measurement resulting from using a white light source instead of a monochromatic light source as in the usual case. The following chapter describes and examines an often-observed artifact of vertical-scanning interferometry when applied to step heights. The artifact is called "bat wings" because of its appearance. The physical cause of the "bat wings" artifact is discussed through a diffraction model. The next chapter proposes an improved vertical-scanning interferometry algorithm. The method, called here "PSI on the Fly" technique, has been developed by combining regular vertical-scanning interferometry and a monochromatic phase-shifting interferometry technique. The PSI on the Fly technique improves the surface height resolution of vertical scanning interferometry to that of a phase-shifting interferometry measurement.

40|$|The {{applications}} of optical interferometry are very extensive. It {{can be used}} to measure displacement, vibration, angle, distance, pressure, refractive index and temperatures, to just name a few. As a high accuracy, high sensitivity measurement method, interferometers are normally operated in optical laboratories in which operational environments are well controlled. Any variations in temperature, air flow, air pressure and vibrations in the environment will induce errors to the measurement results, and even make a measurement impossible to conduct. In this paper, we will focus on discussions of the research conducted in our research center on the {{applications of}} optical interferometry at a shop floor environment, which is normally subjected to environmental disturbances and vibrations. There are a number of methods to reduce the influence of these noises. While controlling the measurement environment by using a vibration isolation stage and retaining a stable temperature is an effective way to reduce noise for laboratory and off-line applications, it may not be practical in manufacturing conditions, for instance, when a measurement part is too large to be mechanically insulated. In order to extend the application of interferometry to shop floor inspection, two methods can be adapted. One method is by introducing a reference interferometer and vibration compensation system to the main interferometer to compensate the environmental disturbance. Complete common-path interferometers such as the scatterplate interferometer are insensitive to noises as well. These noise reduction approaches are generally used for laser based phase shifting interferometry, for which the applications are limited to measurement of relatively smooth surfaces due to the well-known 2 π phase ambiguity problem of monochromatic interferometry. The other method is to collect all the necessary measurement data in just one data sampling. This kind of so called one shot interferometer is immune to the environmental noise and vibrations. We will discuss the above two kinds of interferometry through three case studies: the common path <b>wavelength</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>interferometer,</b> and the single shot line-scan dispersive interferometer and single point dispersed reference interferometer. These researches mainly focus on surface measurement and inspection. The methods discussed here may also be applied to other application areas depending on the optical setup of the interferometer system and the measurement objects.

40|$|Modern {{advanced}} manufacturing {{is capable of}} generating complex structures on large area substrates while maintaining high feature resolution and small defects. Examples of these products include photovoltaic cells, OLED displays, and printed sensors, manufactured at high speed on roll-to-roll (R 2 R) processes. A challenge for manufacturers {{is to ensure that}} the quality of products is not compromised by the faster manufacturing process, therefore inspection should be in-line, fast, and should meet the accuracy needs of the product. A possible candidate for nanoscale surface measurement on large areas in an industrial environment is the <b>wavelength</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>interferometer</b> (WSI) technique for its higher speed when compared to other surface topography measurement techniques. In this thesis, traceability for a WSI instrument is established, i. e. a procedure is defined to estimate the measurement uncertainty according to recent development in ISO standards for surface texture measurement. An estimation of measurement uncertainties associated with each of the metrological characteristics (MCs) and combined uncertainty is reported. It is shown that the WSI instrument is capable of measuring surface height with an uncertainty in the order of tens of nanometres. The larger uncertainty contribution is due to the linearity deviation of the vertical axis due to variable performance of the phase demodulating algorithm to fringe patterns with a large range of frequencies. And alternative method is proposed to estimate the amplification factor and the linearity deviation which are usually estimated with the step height standard (SHS) method. The amplification factor can be estimated which lower uncertainty via the wavelength standard (WS) method and the linearity deviation via the measurement of a tilted-flat. A technique variation, namely ’phase WSI’ is proposed that improves the measurement performance of the WSI. Rather than determining the conventional fringe frequency-derived height directly, the method uses the frequency to resolve the fringe order ambiguity, and combine this information with the more accurate and repeatable fringe phase derived z height. A theoretical model to evaluate the method’s performance in the presence of additive noise is derived and shown to be in good agreement with experiments. The linearity deviation is reduced by approximately an order of magnitude, reaching amplitudes of few nanometres. The measurement noise is also reduced by an order of magnitude, reaching the sub-nanometre range. A complementary technique, quadrature WSI (QWSI), is also proposed which extends the measurement range by more than double, allowing positive and negative optical path differences (OPD) to be distinguished and making accessible for measurement the range around the zero OPD position.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis is concerned with (a) the development of full-field, multi-axis and phase contrast <b>wavelength</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>interferometer,</b> using an electronically tuned CW Ti:Sa laser {{for the study of}} depth resolved measurements in composite materials such as GFRPs and (b) the development of temporal phase unwrapping algorithms for depth re-solved measurements. Item (a) was part of the ultimate goal of successfully extracting the 3 -D, depth-resolved, constituent parameters (Young s modulus E, Poisson s ratio v etc.) that define the mechanical behaviour of composite materials like GFRPs. Considering the success of OCT as an imaging modality, a <b>wavelength</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>interferometer</b> (WSI) capable of imaging the intensity AND the phase of the interference signal was proposed as the preferred technique to provide the volumetric displacement/strain fields (Note that displacement/strain fields are analogous to phase fields and thus a phase-contrast interferometer is of particular interest in this case). These would then be passed to the VFM and yield the sought parameters provided the loading scheme is known. As a result, a number of key opto-mechanical hardware was developed. First, a multiple channel (x 6) tomographic interferometer realised in a Mach-Zehnder arrangement was built. Each of the three channels would provide the necessary information to extract the three orthogonal displacement/strain components while the other three are complementary and were included in the design in order to maximize the penetration depth (sample illuminated from both sides). Second, a miniature uniaxial (tensile and/or compression) loading machine was designed and built for the introduction of controlled and low magnitude displacements. Last, a rotation stage for the experimental determination of the sensitivity vectors and the re-registration of the volumetric data from the six channels was also designed and built. Unfortunately, due to the critical failure of the Ti:Sa laser data collection using the last two items was not possible. However, preliminary results at a single wavelength suggested that the above items work as expected. Item (b) involved the development of an optical sensor for the dynamic monitoring of wavenumber changes during a full 100 nm scan. The sensor is comprised of a set of four wedges in a Fizeau interferometer setup that became part of the multi-axis interferometer (7 th channel). Its development became relevant due to the large amount of mode-hops present during a full scan of the Ti:Sa source. These are associated to the physics of the laser and have the undesirable effect of randomising the signal and thus preventing successful depth reconstructions. The multi-wedge sensor was designed so that it provides simultaneously high wavenumber change resolution and immunity to the large wavenumber jumps from the Ti:Sa. The analysis algorithms for the extraction of the sought wavenumber changes were based on 2 -D Fourier transform method followed by temporal phase unwrapping. At first, the performance of the sensor was tested against that of a high-end commercial wavemeter for a limited scan of 1 nm. A root mean square (rms) difference in measured wavenumber shift between the two of ∼ 4 m- 1 has been achieved, equivalent to an rms wavelength shift error of ∼ 0. 4 pm. Second, by resampling the interference signal and the wavenumber-change axis onto a uniformly sampled k-space, depth resolutions that are close to the theoretical limits were achieved for scans of up to 37 nm. Access of the full 100 nm range that is characterised by wavelength steps down to picometers level was achieved by introducing a number of improvements to the original temporal phase unwrapping algorithm reported in ref [1] tailored to depth resolved measurements. These involved the estimation and suppression of intensity background artefacts, improvements on the 2 -D Fourier transform phase detection based on a previously developed algorithm in ref [2] and finally the introduction of two modifications to the original TPU. Both approaches are adaptive and involve signal re-referencing at regular intervals throughout the scan. Their purpose is to compensate for systematic and non-systematic errors owing to a small error in the value of R (a scaling factor applied to the lower sensitivity wedge phase-change signal used to unwrap the higher sensitivity one), or small changes in R with wavelength due to the possibility of a mismatch in the refractive dispersion curves of the wedges and/or a mismatch in the wedge angles. A hybrid approach combining both methods was proposed and used to analyse the data from each of the four wedges. It was found to give the most robust results of all the techniques considered, with a clear Fourier peak at the expected frequency, with significantly reduced spectral artefacts and identical depth resolutions for all four wedges of 2. 2 μm measured at FWHM. The ability of the phase unwrapping strategy in resolving the aforementioned issues was demonstrated by successfully measuring the absolute thickness of four fused silica glasses using real experimental data. The results were compared with independent micrometer measurements and showed excellent agreement. Finally, {{due to the lack of}} additional experimental data and in an attempt to justify the validity of the proposed temporal phase unwrapping strategy termed as the hybrid approach, a set of simulations that closely matched the parameters characterising the real experimental data set analysed were produced and were subsequently analysed. The results of this final test justify that the various fixes included in the hybrid approach have not evolved to solve the problems of a particular data set but are rather of general nature thereby, highlighting its importance for PC-WSI applications concerning the processing and analysis of large scans...|$|E

Dual wavelength operation using two multimode laser diode sources is implemented. The concept is demonstrated by multiplexing two bulk optical Michelson interferometers. For both sensors the achieved resolution was {{of the order of}} 1 nm, with a working range of 45 mum...|$|R
5000|$|A {{white light}} scanner (WLS) is a device for {{performing}} surface height measurements {{of an object}} using coherence scanning interferometry (CSI) with spectrally-broadband, [...] "white light" [...] illumination. Different configurations of <b>scanning</b> <b>interferometer</b> {{may be used to}} measure macroscopic objects with surface profiles measuring in the centimeter range, to microscopic objects with surface profiles measuring in the micrometer range. For large-scale non-interferometric measurement systems, see structured-light 3D scanner.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to its reconstruction pipeline, a ptychography experiment involves additional I/O operations such as calibrating the detector, filtering raw data, and communicating parameters (such as X-ray <b>wavelength,</b> <b>scan</b> positions, detector distance, and flux or exposure times) to the analysis infrastructure.|$|R
40|$|We propose and {{successfully}} demonstrate a k-space linear and self-clocked <b>wavelength</b> <b>scanning</b> fiber laser source based on recirculating frequency shifting (RFS). The RFS is {{realized with a}} high speed electro-optic dual parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator operating {{at the state of}} carrier suppressed single sideband modulation. A gated short pulse is injected into an amplified RFS loop to generate the <b>wavelength</b> <b>scanning</b> pulse train. We find that the accumulation of in-band amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise over multiple scanning periods will saturate the erbium-doped fiber amplifier and impede the amplification to the pulse signal in the RFS loop. To overcome the degradation of temporal signal due to the accumulation of ASE noise over multiple scanning periods, we insert a modulated optical switch into the RFS loop to completely attenuate the in-band ASE noise {{at the end of each}} scanning period. The signal to noise ratio of the temporal pulsed signal is greatly enhanced. K-space linear and self-clocked <b>wavelength</b> <b>scanning</b> fiber laser sources in 6. 1 nm/ 7. 2 nm scanning range with 20 GHz/ 30 GHz frequency shifting are successfully demonstrated.
