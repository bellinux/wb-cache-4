5000|$|Later P6 {{implementations}} (Pentium M, Yonah) introduced [...] "Shadow Register File Architecture" [...] that {{expanded to}} 2 copies of dual ported integer architectural register file and consist with context switch (between future&retirered file and scaled file {{using the same}} trick that used between integer and floating point). It was in order to solve the register bottleneck that exist in x86 architecture after micro op fusion is introduced, {{but it is still}} have 8 entries 32 bit architectural registers for total 32 bytes in capacity per file (segment register and instruction pointer remain within the file, though they are inaccessible by program) as speculative file. The second file is served as a scaled shadow register file, which without context switch the scaled file cannot store some instruction independently. Some instruction from SSE2/SSE3/SSSE3 require this feature for integer operation, for example instruction like PSHUFB, PMADDUBSW, PHSUBW, PHSUBD, PHSUBSW, PHADDW, PHADDD, PHADDSW would require loading EAX/EBX/ECX/EDX from both of register file, though it was uncommon for x86 processor to take use of another register file with same instruction; most of time the second file is served as a scale retirered file. The Pentium M architecture still remains one dual-ported FP register file (8 entries MM/XMM) shared with three decoder and FP register does not have shadow register file with it as its Shadow Register File Architecture did not including floating point function. Processor after P6, the architectural register file are external and locate in processor's backend after retired, opposite to internal register file that are locate in inner core for register renaming/reorder buffer. However, in Core 2 it is now within a unit called [...] "register alias table" [...] RAT, located with instruction allocator but have same size of register size as retirement. Core 2 increased the inner ring bus to 24 bytes (allow more than 3 instructions to be decoded) and extended its register file from dual ported (one read/one write) to quad ported (two read/two <b>write),</b> <b>register</b> still remain 8 entries in 32 bit and 32 bytes (not including 6 segment register and one instruction pointer as they are unable to be access in the file by any code/instruction) in total file size and expanded to 16 entries in x64 for total 128 bytes size per file. From Pentium M as its pipeline port and decoder increased, but they're located with allocator table instead of code buffer. Its FP XMM register file are also increase to quad ported (2 read/2 <b>write),</b> <b>register</b> still remain 8 entries in 32 bit and extended to 16 entries in x64 mode and number still remain 1 as its shadow register file architecture is not including floating point/SSE functions.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{potential}} divergence of depth-first ray tracing [AL 09], it is nevertheless {{the most efficient}} approach on massively parallel graphics processors. Due {{to the use of}} specialized caching strategies that were originally developed for texture access, it {{has been shown to be}} compute rather than bandwidth limited. Especially with recents developments however, not only the raw bandwidth, but also the latency for both memory access and read after <b>write</b> <b>register</b> dependencies can become a limiting factor. In this paper we will analyze the memory and instruction dependency latencies of depth first ray tracing. We will show that ray tracing is in fact latency limited on current GPUs and propose three simple strategies to better hide the latencies.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} wait-free implementations of {{a regular}} read/ <b>write</b> <b>register</b> for unauthenticated data using a collection of 3 t + k base objects, t {{of which can be}} subject to Byzantine failures. We focus on amnesic algorithms that store {{only a limited number of}} values in the base objects. In contrast, non-amnesic algorithms store an unbounded number of values, which can eventually lead to problems of space exhaustion. Lower bounds on the time-complexity of read and write operations are currently met only by non-amnesic algorithms. In this paper, we show for the first time that amnesic algorithms can also meet these lower bounds. We do this by giving two amnesic constructions: for k = 1, we show that the lower bound of two communication rounds is also sufficient for every read operation to complete and for k = t + 1 we show that the lower bound of one round is also sufficient for every operation to complete...|$|E

40|$|In their {{conceptual}} framework for linguistic literacy development, Ravid 2 ̆ 6 Tolchinsky synthesize research studies from several perspectives. One of these is corpus-based research, which {{has been used for}} several large-scale research studies of spoken and <b>written</b> <b>registers</b> over the past 20 years. In this approach, a large, principled collection of natural texts (a 2 ̆ 7 corpus 2 ̆ 7) is analysed using computational and interactive techniques, to identify the salient linguistic characteristics of each register or text variety. Three characteristics of corpus-based analysis are particularly important (see Biber, Conrad 2 ̆ 6 Reppen 1998) :(1) a special concern for the representativeness of the text sample being analysed, and for the generalizability of fndings; (2) overt recognition of the interactions among linguistic features: the ways in which features co-occur and alternate; (3) a focus on register as the most important parameter of linguistic variation: strong patterns of use in one register often represent only weak patterns in other registers. Corpus studies have documented the linguistic differences among spoken and <b>written</b> <b>registers</b> in English and other languages. Further, by analyzing systematic corpora produced by students at different stages, these same techniques have been used to track the patterns of extended language development associated with literacy. Two major patterns emerge from studies in this research tradition: (1) adult written language is dramatically different from natural conversation; and (2) written language is by no means homogeneous: rather, there are major linguistic differences among <b>written</b> <b>registers.</b> Thus, the developmental acquisition of linguistic literacy requires control over the patterns of register variation, in addition to a mastery of the mechanics of the written mode...|$|R
