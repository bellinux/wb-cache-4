25|$|John F. Kelly {{was born}} in Boston, Massachusetts on June 29, 1901. He broke into the film {{industry}} in 1928 when he was cast as the chauffeur in the Fox silent film, Blindfold. He would work in two more Fox films in 1928, both directed by Irving Cummings. The first was Dressed To Kill, starring Mary Astor, where he played the supporting role of Biff Simpson; while the second was in the small role of a <b>window-washer</b> in Romance of the Underworld, again starring Astor. In 1929 he appeared in only one film, {{in the role of}} O'Farrell in the Warner Bros. film, From Headquarters, starring Monte Blue. Kelly's first appearance in a sound film, was in 1930's The Man Hunter, with its canine hero Rin Tin Tin.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show (roughly 8 years), Monk overcomes many of his phobias and some aspects of his OCD. Though he hasn't been cured of many of them, if any at all, {{he has been able to}} put them in the back of his mind when {{involved}} in case work. His most notable breakthrough is shown in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy", when Adrian is locked in a car trunk with his fellow OCD patient and personal rival, Harold Krenshaw. During the terrifying trip, both men overcome their longstanding case of claustrophobia (fear of small spaces), as well as their own differences, resulting in them becoming friends. Possibly due to this, as well as the many cases Monk has solved over the years, he is reinstated as detective first class by Stottlemeyer in the season 8 episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Badge". Though he is very excited about his reinstatement initially, Monk realizes that becoming a detective again didn't mean that he would be happier. In a session with Dr. Bell, Monk realizes he was always happy as a private detective and consultant to the SFPD as his own boss. After overcoming his fear of heights and singlehandedly capturing a killer <b>window-washer,</b> Monk turns in his badge. In the series finale, he learns that his late wife, Trudy, had given birth to a daughter before they had met. The knowledge and events of the episode lead to positive changes in his personality.|$|E

2500|$|A {{descender}} or rappel {{device is}} a friction device or friction hitch that allows rope to be payed {{out in a}} controlled fashion, under load, with a minimal effort by the person controlling it. The speed at which the abseiler descends is controlled by applying greater or lesser force on the rope below the device or altering the angle at which the rope exits the device. Descenders can be task-designed or improvised from other equipment. Mechanical descenders include braking bars, the figure eight, the abseil rack, the [...] "bobbin" [...] (and its self-locking variant the [...] "stop"), the gold tail, and the [...] "sky genie" [...] used by some <b>window-washers</b> and wildfire firefighters. Some improvised descenders include the Munter hitch, a carabiner wrap, the basic crossed-carabiner brake and the piton bar brake (sometimes called the carabiner and piton). There is an older, more uncomfortable, method of wrapping the rope around one's body for friction instead of using a descender, as in the Dulfersitz or Geneva methods used by climbers in the 1960s.|$|R

He is an adept singer and dancer.|$|E
