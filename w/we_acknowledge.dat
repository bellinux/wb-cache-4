500|$|In {{order to}} create a balance in the track listing, Lafourcade wrote [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] as a [...] "simple song" [...] about wanting to be with someone. The track was co-written by Marian Ruzzi, and was {{inspired}} by the music of the 1970s, including a chorus with answering voices, emulating musical theatre. The lyrics for [...] "Lo Que Construimos", deals with the decision to leave someone and going separate ways. [...] "Estoy Lista" [...] is a ballad about being ready to be well, and Lafourcade worked on the track in her spare time, taking a year to finish it. The last track, [...] "No Más Llorar", was written during a family reunion with her father and sister in Chile. Lafourcade wrote it about a love that could not be, her mourning and search for stability, forgiveness, and healing. In live performances, the singer dedicates the track to Mexico, to send hope through her music and help people deal with situations such as the Iguala mass kidnapping. [...] "I feel that nowadays is really important that <b>we</b> <b>acknowledge</b> the social part. We must look inward and work, see which aspects we can address to deliver something more positive to the world".|$|E

2500|$|According to Margaret Wertheim, [...] "History abounds with {{religious}} enthusiasts who have read spiritual portent into {{the arrangement of}} the planets, the vacuum of space, electromagnetic waves and the big bang. But no scientific discovery has proved so ripe for spiritual projection as the theories of quantum physics, replete with their quixotic qualities of uncertainty, simultaneity and parallelism." [...] Wertheim continues that the movie [...] "abandons itself entirely to the ecstasies of quantum mysticism, finding in this aleatory description of nature the key to spiritual transformation. As one of the film’s characters gushes early in the proceedings, 'The moment <b>we</b> <b>acknowledge</b> the quantum self, we say that somebody has become enlightened'. [...] A moment in which 'the mathematical formalisms of quantum mechanics [...] are stripped of all empirical content and reduced to a set of syrupy nostrums'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The frequentist {{view has}} its own problems. It is of course {{impossible}} to actually perform an infinity of repetitions of a random experiment to determine the probability of an event. But if only {{a finite number of}} repetitions of the process are performed, different relative frequencies will appear in different series of trials. If these relative frequencies are to define the probability, the probability will be slightly different every time it is measured. But the real probability should be the same every time. If <b>we</b> <b>acknowledge</b> the fact that we only can measure a probability with some error of measurement attached, we still get into problems as the error of measurement can only be expressed as a probability, the very concept we are trying to define. This renders even the frequency definition circular; see for example “” ...|$|E
2500|$|.....One of {{the most}} well known ways our {{tradition}} {{has been able to}} hold onto both the scientific theory of evolution as well as the concept of a purposeful creation was by reading the creation story in Genesis in a more allegorical sense. One famous medieval commentary proclaims that the days of creation, as outlined in the book of Bereshit, could be seen as representative of the stages of creation and not literal 24 hour periods. Thus each Biblical day could have accounted for thousands or even millions of years. In that way the progression according to both evolution and the Torah remains essentially the same: first the elements were created, then the waters, the plants, the animals, and finally us. Therefore, Genesis and Darwin can both be right in a factual analysis even while <b>we</b> <b>acknowledge</b> that our attitudes towards these shared facts are shaped much more strongly by the Torah – we agree how the process unfolded but disagree that it was random.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2017, in {{response}} to a question regarding the meaning of Quran Chapter 4, Surah 34, Keysar Trad president of the AFIC said a husband can beat his wife, but only as [...] "a last resort". [...] He later apologised for his statements conceding Islam does allow for this, but saying he was [...] "clumsy" [...] in the television interview, adding that he condemns all violence against women. [...] In April 2017 Hizb ut-Tahrir (Australia) produced a video in which two women discussed how to resolve marital conflicts. [...] One of the women said, [...] "a man is permitted to hit a woman as an act of discipline" [...] and described the permissive text as [...] "beautiful" [...] and [...] "a blessing". The video was strongly repudiated by Muslim leaders, with the women subsequently saying, [...] "more thought needs to be given to the question of purpose, worth and risk of sharing content online. <b>We</b> <b>acknowledge</b> our mistake in this respect in this instance".|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the War in Iraq, Buckley stated, [...] "The {{reality of}} the {{situation}} is that missions abroad to effect regime change in countries without a bill of rights or democratic tradition are terribly arduous." [...] He added: [...] "This isn't to say that the Iraq war is wrong, or that history will judge it to be wrong. But it is absolutely to say that conservatism implies a certain submission to reality; and this war has an unrealistic frank and is being conscripted by events." [...] In a February 2006 column published at National Review Online and distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, Buckley stated unequivocally that, [...] "One cannot doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed." [...] Buckley has also stated that [...] "...it's important that <b>we</b> <b>acknowledge</b> in the inner councils of state that it (the war) has failed, so that we should look for opportunities to cope with that failure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although it {{does not}} {{actually}} mention the word [...] "qualia", Thomas Nagel's paper [...] "What Is it Like to Be a Bat?" [...] is often cited in debates over qualia. Nagel argues that consciousness has an essentially subjective character, a what-it-is-like aspect. He states that [...] "an organism has conscious mental states {{if and only if}} there is something that {{it is like to be}} that organism—something it is like for the organism." [...] Nagel also suggests that the subjective aspect of the mind may not ever be sufficiently accounted for by the objective methods of reductionistic science. He claims that [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>acknowledge</b> that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective character of experience, we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue about how this could be done." [...] Furthermore, he states that [...] "it seems unlikely that any physical theory of mind can be contemplated until more thought has been given to the general problem of subjective and objective." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "As Conservative Jews, <b>we</b> <b>acknowledge</b> without apology {{the many}} debts which Jewish {{religion}} and civilization owe to {{the nations of}} the world. We eschew triumphalism with respect to other ways of serving God. Maimonides believed that other monotheistic faiths, Christianity and Islam, serve to spread knowledge of, and devotion to, the God and the Torah of Israel throughout the world. Many modern thinkers, both Jewish and gentile, have noted that God may well have seen fit to enter covenants with many nations. Either outlook, when relating to others, is perfectly compatible with a commitment to one's own faith and pattern of religious life. If we criticize triumphalism in our own community, then real dialogue with other faith groups requires that we criticize triumphalism and other failings in those quarters as well. In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, no relationship between Jews and Christians can be dignified or honest without facing up frankly to the centuries of prejudice, theological anathema, and persecution that have been thrust upon Jewish communities, culminating in the horrors of the Shoah (Holocaust). No relationship can be nurtured between Jews and Muslims unless it acknowledges explicitly and seeks to combat the terrible social and political effects of Muslim hostility, as well as the disturbing but growing reaction of Jewish anti-Arabism in the Land of Israel. But all of these relationships, properly pursued, can bring great blessing to the Jewish community and to the world. As the late Professor Abraham Joshua Heschel put it, [...] "no religion is an island." ...|$|E
