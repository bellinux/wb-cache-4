60|$|GUNN [interrupting him] I know <b>what</b> <b>youre</b> {{going to}} say, Count. Youre {{going to say}} that the whole thing seems to you to be quite new and unusual and original. The naval {{lieutenant}} is a Frenchman who cracks up the English and runs down the French: the hackneyed old Shaw touch. The characters are second-rate middle class, instead of being dukes and millionaires. The heroine gets kicked through the mud: real mud. Theres no plot. All the old stage conventions and puppets without the old ingenuity and the old enjoyment. And a feeble air of intellectual pretentiousness kept up all through to persuade you that if the author hasnt written a good play it's because hes too clever to stoop to anything so commonplace. And you three experienced men have sat through all this, and cant tell me who wrote it! Why, the play bears the author's signature in every line.|$|E

Let me tell you that except Hypatia, not one person in this house is in favor of her marrying you; and I dont believe shes happy about it herself. The match isnt settled yet: dont forget that. Youre on trial in the office because the Governor isnt giving his daughter money for an idle man to live on her. Youre on trial here because my mother thinks a girl should know what a man is like in the house before she marries him. Thats been going on for two months now; and whats the result?

I know youre getting tired of hearing me say that. But I appreciate the ovation. I appreciate the American fans voting me on the All-Century Team. Im just a small part of a big deal tonight.Gray: With the overwhelming evidence in that report, why not make that step...Rose: No. This is too much of a festive night to worry about that because I dont know <b>what</b> evidence <b>youre</b> talking about. I mean, show it to me...Gray: Well, the Dowd Report says- but we dont want to debate that, Pete.Rose: Well, why not? Why do we want to believe everything he says?Gray: You signed a paper acknowledging the ban. Why did you sign it if you didnt agree with it?Rose: It also says I can apply for reinstatement after one year, if you remember correctly. In the press conference, as a matter of fact, my statement was [...] "I cant wait for my little girl to be a year old so I can apply for reinstatement". At my press conference. So you forgot to add that clause that was in there.Gray: Well, you have reapplied. ... Youve applied for reinstatement in 1997. Have you heard back from Commissioner Selig?Rose: No, and that kind of surprises me. Its only been two years, though, and hes got a lot of things on his mind. But I hope to some day.Gray: Pete, its been 10 years since youve been allowed on the field. Obviously, the approach that you have taken has not worked. Why not, at this point, take a different approach?Rose: Well, when you say it hadnt worked, what do you exactly mean?Gray: Youre not allowed in baseball. Youre not allowed to earn a living in the game you love. And youre not allowed to be in the Hall of Fame.Rose: Well, I took that approach and that was to apply for reinstatement. I hope Bud Selig considers that and gives me an opportunity. I wont need a third chance. All I need is a second chance.Gray: Pete, those who will hear this tonight will say you have been your own worst enemy and continue to be. How do you respond to that?Rose: In what way are you talking about?Gray: By not acknowledging what seems to be overwhelming evidence.Rose: Yeah, Im surprised youre bombarding me like this. I mean Im doing an interview with you on a great night, a great occasion, a great ovation. Everybody seems to be in a good mood. And youre bringing up something that happened 10 years ago.Gray: Im bringing it up because I think people would like to see ... Pete, weve got to go, weve got a game.Rose: This is a prosecutors brief, not an interview, and Im very surprised at you. I am, really.Gray: Some would be surprised that you didnt take the opportunity.|$|R

I didnt know where I was, and I didnt know I was actually lost. It wasnt about the party at all; its about searching but not knowing <b>what</b> <b>youre</b> searching for. Theres the train motif, being on this train heading for either oblivion or salvation - and just holding on for dear life. That song came down from some mountain somewhere, because it was right after I wrote it that I sort of packed it in.|$|E

Sure, Congress are lazy bastards, but so <b>what?</b> <b>Youre</b> the top guy. Youre the president of the company. Its your responsibility to make sure everybody does well. Its the same with every company in this country, whether its a two-man company or a two-hundred-man company… [...] And thats the pussy generation—nobody wants to work." ...|$|E
