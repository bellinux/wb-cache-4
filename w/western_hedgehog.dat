40|$|The bachelor´s thesis {{monitors}} {{an effect}} of motor traffic on selected species of game. The aim of this work was to review knowledge about protection of animals on surface communications and to survey and evaluate numbers of game killed on area of interest by motor traffic. Monitoring had been provided near České Budějovice in the southern Bohemia from August 2009 to October 2009. Killed individuals were documented by members of local hunting association, and {{on the basis of}} my own observations. The most frequently killed game species were brown hare and roe deer, from the other animal species common mole and both eastern and <b>western</b> <b>hedgehog.</b> But a lot of animals might not been found, so the results can be misinterpreted. The proposal of precaution which should improve the situation {{is an important part of}} the thesis...|$|E
40|$|Hedgehogs {{from the}} genus Erinaceus are an {{important}} model organism for studying the postglacial recolonisation of Europe and the processes {{that take place in}} the secondary contact zones of their areas of distribution. In this study, five individuals of white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus roumanicus), four individuals of <b>western</b> <b>hedgehog</b> (Erinaceus europaeus) and one estimated hybrid were analysed. Geographical distribution of individuals used in the study covers the region of the Central Europe, however in the further research expansion of analsysed individuals will be needed and the whole Palearct should be sampled. The main goal was to implement novel methods in research of hedgehogs, which will enable to map the population-genomic structure of the genus Erinaceus in western Palearct. The method RADSeq (Restriction site associated DNA sequencing) enables to obtain polymorphic markers, e. g., SNPs which we used (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) across the genome. In this work it was analyzed 16382 SNPs. Using the binary data which indicates the presence and absence of SNPs for each species, hypotheses raised under classical analyzes of genetic markers from previous studies have not been fully confirmed. In further research {{it will be necessary to}} verify possible occurrence of biases connected with [...] ...|$|E
50|$|Animals {{that are}} easier to see include red fox, the {{mountain}} hare, the least weasel, the European mole, and the <b>western</b> European <b>hedgehog.</b> Dormice and red squirrel s are also quite frequently seen. Other mammals recorded in the park are the snow vole, the edible dormouse, the wildcat and the crested porcupine.|$|R
50|$|Hericium abietis, {{commonly}} known as the bear's head or the <b>western</b> coral <b>hedgehog,</b> is an edible mushroom in the tooth fungus group. It grows on conifer stumps or logs in North America, producing a cream white fruit body up to 10 - 75 cm tall and wide. It fruits from after the start of the fall rains to mid-season.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the timing of the breeding season of <b>western</b> <b>hedgehogs</b> (Erinaceus europaeus) in a rural landscape in Ireland, their courtship activity and the first appearance and possible dispersal of juveniles. Between June 2008 and June 2010, 24 hedgehogs (18 ♂ and 6 ♀) were caught and monitored by radio tracking and direct following. A preponderance of males was recorded in both adults and juveniles at the study site and the sex ratio deviated significantly from a 1 : 1 ratio. Courtship behaviour took place between April and July and occurred almost exclusively in a nine ha pasture. An individual female paired with up to seven males in a season. The first appearance of juveniles was recorded in September (2008) and July (2009). The majority (n= 22) of juvenile sightings, both alive and as road kill, occurred in July but they continued to be recorded up until November (n= 3). The presence of juveniles at the study site in October 2008 and a pregnant female being found in September 2009 indicated that late litters occur in Ireland...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of mammalian prey {{in the diet}} of two species of large gulls, the herring gull (Larus argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus), was investigated in order to quantify and compare the predation on mammals in coastal and inland colony sites. Specialised coastal nesting birds {{and a majority of}} individuals in an inland colony were found to feed on mammals frequently. The encountered mammalian prey included <b>western</b> <b>hedgehogs</b> (Erinaceus europaeus), shrews (Soricidae), voles (Cricetidae: Arvicolinae), mice (Muridae), moles (Talpa europaea), brown rats (Rattus norvegicus), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and common brown hares (Lepus europaeus). Most mammalian prey may have been obtained on inland fields, during farming activities, some may have been captured within the colonies, and some were scavenged at roadsides. Many coastal mainland colonies of gulls have recently collapsed as a result of persistent predation by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). In addition, gulls breeding along the coast in the Netherlands increasingly suffer from shortages of food (mostly marine fish and intertidal invertebrates) during chick-rearing in recent years. Inland breeding became more frequent and will further increase as a result of both factors, so that the gulls are expected to increasingly include mammals in their diet...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} of the interactions among mammalian predators that eat or compete with one another is rare, due to the ethical and logistical challenges of managing wild populations in a controlled and replicated way. Here, {{we report on the}} opportunistic use of a replicated and controlled culling experiment (the Randomised Badger Culling Trial) to investigate the relationship between two sympatric predators: European badgers Meles meles and <b>western</b> European <b>hedgehogs</b> Erinaceus europaeus. In areas of preferred habitat (amenity grassland), counts of hedgehogs more than doubled over a 5 -year period from the start of badger culling (from 0. 9 ha- 1 pre-cull to 2. 4 ha- 1 post-cull), whereas hedgehog counts did not change where there was no badger culling (0. 3 - 0. 3 hedgehogs ha- 1). This trial provides experimental evidence for mesopredator release as an outcome of management of a top predator...|$|R
50|$|As {{it comes}} to the fauna, the most notable species are Marsican brown bear, Italian wolf, red deer and roe deer. The number of bear {{population}} is recently declining, from about 100 it has fallen to about 30 in recent years, while the population of wolves is permanently increasing. Among the reclusive species there are the Eurasian lynx, the wild boar, the polecat, the badger, the otter, The pine marten, the beech marten and the chamois. The chamois live above the forest, which makes it difficult to encounter. Among the animals frequently seen there are some species such as the red fox, the red squirrel or dormouse. Other notable species are the <b>western</b> European <b>hedgehog,</b> the European mole, the wildcat, the mountain hare and the crested porcupine.There are about 60 species of mammals, 300 of birds, 40 of reptiles, amphibians and fish and they all are protected as a part of National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise.|$|R

40|$|To infer the phylogenetic {{position}} of Cretan hedgehogs, Erinaceus concolor nesiotes, we compared directly allozymic variation at 27 loci and 383 bp-long sequences of the mitochondrial cyt-b gene of eleven and three hedgehogs, respectively, collected at diverse locations in Crete with already published data of <b>western</b> and eastern <b>hedgehogs</b> (E. europaeus and E. concolor). Horizontal starch gel electrophoresis revealed 4 alleles at 2 polymorphic loci (Gpi, Acy) in Cretan hedgehogs. Indices of allozymic diversity {{were similar to}} those of regional samples of E. europaeus and E. concolor from Central Europe. A Wagner dendrogram based on pairwise Rogers distances showed that Cretan hedgehogs clustered clearly with the E. concolor from Central Europe. The cyt-b sequences of the Cretan hedgehogs revealed 3 closely related haplotypes, that were tightly connected to haplotypes of E. concolor from various provenances in the Balkans. In contrast, published haplotypes of E. concolor from Asia Minor and Palestine differed distinctly from the Cretan haplotypes. We conclude that Cretan hedgehogs originate from mainland-Greece or other places in the Balkan...|$|R
