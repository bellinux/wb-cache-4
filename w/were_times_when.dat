5|$|Generally, {{performances}} can {{be classified}} as either formal ones or informal. During formal performances adherents follow a traditional set of rules that would govern playing and it usually involved people from outside the home. Informal performances are quite the opposite. The strict rules that normally govern play are often ignored and the performers are usually between people well acquainted with one another, usually close family members. These performances usually <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> amateurs practiced on the instruments, young boys and girls gathered the instruments, substituting the kulintang with the saronay and inubab. Ensembles didn’t necessary have to have five instruments like formal performances: they could be composed of only four instruments (three gandingan gongs, a kulintang, an agung, and a dabakan), three instruments (a kulintang, a dabakan, and either an agung or three gandingan gongs) or simply just one instrument (kulintang solo).|$|E
5|$|In some areas, {{systematic}} {{attacks against}} tribespeople {{in or near}} mining districts occurred. Various conflicts were fought between natives and settlers.Miners often saw Native Americans as impediments to their mining activities. Ed Allen, interpretive lead for Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, reported that there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> miners would kill up to 50 or more Natives in one day. Retribution attacks on solitary miners could result in larger scale attacks against Native populations, at times tribes or villages {{not involved in the}} original act. During the 1852 Bridge Gulch Massacre, a group of settlers attacked a band of Wintu Indians in response to the killing of a citizen named J. R. Anderson. After his killing, the sheriff led a group of men to track down the Indians, whom the men then attacked. Only three children survived the massacre that was against a different band of Wintu than the one that had killed Anderson.|$|E

25|$|Geologically, Lake Victoria is {{relatively}} young – about 400,000 years old – and it formed when westward-flowing rivers were dammed by an upthrown crustal block. During its geological history, Lake Victoria went through changes ranging from its present shallow depression, through to {{what may have}} been a series of much smaller lakes. Geological cores taken from its bottom show Lake Victoria has dried up completely at least three times since it formed. These drying cycles are probably related to past ice ages, which <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> precipitation declined globally. Lake Victoria last dried out about 17,300 years ago, and it refilled 14,700 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Scrope v Grosvenor (1389) {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} heraldic law cases brought in England. The case resulted from the fact that two different families were using the same undifferenced coat of arms. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the composition of coats of arms was very simple. Most shields consisted of only one charge and two tinctures, and there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> two families bore the same coat of arms in the same jurisdiction. In the fourteenth century, though, cases of two unrelated families bearing the same coat of arms became less tolerated. When this happened, the monarch was usually called on to make a decision.|$|E

Afolayan {{in an interview}} with Weekend Magazine expressed that it was very stressful shooting October 1 and his previous films were incomparable to it.

He also said there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> he and the crew had just three hours of sleep in four days, but however pointed out that he had best hands on deck for the project and he is grateful for that. The film production team on set was made up of about a hundred people; Co-ordinator, Oge Ogu noted that one of the major challenges during filming was co-ordinating and managing the extras to fit into the director's vision, as the crowd often span into hundreds of people.|$|E
25|$|Music scholar Martha Hume wrote:When you shake all the {{stardust}} {{off this}} tale, {{what you must}} begin with is an uneducated child {{from one of the}} most isolated cultures in the United States who was given in marriage to a man some six years her senior, a man who was a violent and sometimes brutal alcoholic, who was similarly uneducated and without any job skills to speak of. Add to that a migration to the state of Washington, where the child had no friends or relations; the arrival of four babies; regular—and reportedly mutual—domestic violence; and an income so unstable that there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the family had nothing to eat but dandelion greens, and you have a situation that might well have led to murder.

25|$|The cafés {{and bars}} of Montparnasse were {{a meeting place}} where ideas were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés Le Dôme, La Closerie des Lilas, La Rotonde, Le Select, and La Coupoleall of which are still in {{business}} were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few centimes. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, {{and if there were}} fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, Victor Libion, would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, there <b>were</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool with envy.|$|E

But Robert Kurrle's cinematography is outstanding." [...] That same year, his camerawork on another Carewe film, an adaptation of Longfellow's Evangeline, was deemed as [...] "beautiful" [...] by the Film Daily.

500|$|The varied {{meanings}} of lesbian {{since the early}} 20th century have prompted some historians to revisit historic relationships between women before the wide usage of the word was defined by erotic proclivities.
