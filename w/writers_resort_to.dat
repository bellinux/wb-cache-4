For us, an important theoretical and methodological interpretation of  ethnic and other stereotypes was formulated by Professor Hans Hening Hahn, {{as well as other}} Central European researchers. We use the presented theoretical and methodological guidelines to analyse the stereotype of Slovakian diligence. The primary sources of the textual analysis are ethnographic travelogues and diverse literature of Slovak origin, which are  rich sources for scientific interpretation of stereotypes. <b>Writers</b> <b>resorted</b> <b>to</b> an idealization and generalization of character, physical appearance and other characteristics of the population of Ungarn and the Habsburg monarchy, and so there were constructed ethnic/national, cultural, confessional, gender, as well as other auto/heterostereotypes.

5000|$|The {{rulers of}} the Manchu-led Qing dynasty are {{particularly}} notorious for their use of literary inquisitions. The Manchus were an ethnic minority who had defeated the Han Chinese-led Ming dynasty; as such, they were sensitive to public sentiments towards them. Writers and officials usually took the stance of drawing distinctions between the Han Chinese and the Manchus; the latter were traditionally viewed as barbarians in Han Chinese culture. However, while the Manchus were in charge, <b>writers</b> <b>resorted</b> <b>to</b> veiled satire. According to Gu Mingdong, a specialist in Chinese literature and intellectual thought, the Manchus became almost paranoid about the meanings associated with the Chinese characters for 'bright' and 'clear', 'Ming' and 'Qing' respectively.One inquisition was the [...] "Case of the History of the Ming Dynasty" [...] (明史案) in 1661-1662 {{under the direction of}} regents (before the Kangxi Emperor came in power in 1669) in which about 70 were killed and more exiled.|$|R
40|$|This essay {{aspires to}} examine the use of {{transliteration}} of some words and phrases from Arabic to English in travel literature books. This has been conducted by exploring the transliterated Arabic words and phrases, and comparing the different transliterations of the same words and phrases by different writers. It investigates {{the way that the}} travel writers employ in making plural nouns, the use of the definite article (Al) (ال), and Al-tashdid (the duplication of a letter). The conclusion drawn is that travel literature <b>writers</b> <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> transliteration for three reasons; {{one of the main reasons}} is that sometimes there is no one-to-one correspondence; the second main reason suggests that transliteration avoids the loss of meaning; and the third one stems from the fact that transliteration helps to find transculturation between cultures. The contributions of this essay would be of concern to scholars, who are interested in Arabic into English transliteration, specifically in English travel literature. According to the researchers’ knowledge, this essay can be considered a leading pioneer study in the field that deals with transliteration from Arabic into English in English travel literature...|$|E

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to compare and contrast the frequency and types of hedges in Discussion sections of Environmental Sciences Research Articles (RAs) written by English Research Writers (ERWs), Iranian Research Writers (IRWs) who write in English, and Iranian Research Writers (IRWs) who write in Farsi. To this end, 60 RAs in the targeted field were selected from leading journals (20 for each group), and then the used hedges were analyzed based on Salager-Meyer (1994) taxonomy. With regard to the use of hedges in English, this study did not find any significant differences between English and Iranian authors’ writings. However, the findings revealed significant differences between English and Farsi written articles. This discrepancy can be attributed to the nature of Farsi language which might consider less hedged texts as highly validated ones. However, this is opposed to the credibility of using hedges in this field in the international academic discourse community...|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} about the search of {{identity}} by the writers from the German Democratic Republic. The author analysed in it the prose forms of opinions of seven writers representing different generations in the German Democratic Republic (H. Richter, l. von Wangenheim, M. Neumann, O. Herbert, U. Püschel, B. Wogatzki and W. Kaufmann). These opinions appeared in April 1986 in the East German literary journal "Neue Deutsche Literature". In all the utterances the autobiographical trend strikes us in which direction the authors go in order to picture the phenomenon of looking by them of the so called "one's own place" in the spiritual landscape of the divided Germany. The autobiographical record {{makes it possible for}} the above mentioned authors to present the problem of East German writer's identity in a measurable and concrete manner with reference to a given writer as human being thus making it possible for him to avoid the burden of historical motivation in relation to their own national history. Giving up the historical dimension of the problem of German identity the above mentioned <b>writers</b> <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> the geographical experience of the place of residence; to the neighbourly relations started on its basis; to the family tradition of customs in order to come from this externally experienced perspective of a given territory to the extra-territorial generalizations concerning the symbolic place of man on an equally symbolically understood earth. This kind of an all-compassing imagination of the above mentioned writers from the German Democratic Republic in their considerations on the subject of identity renders both their need of transgressing the tight territorial boundaries of their own statehood and is an example of an escape into utopia, sentimentalism and the myth of man with his brotherly, supranational earthly paradise. Thus the problem of identity of writers from the German Democratic Republic may, at least with reference to the above mentioned authors, be considered as controversial and unsolved...|$|E

50|$|From about 1559 began {{a period}} of {{decadence}} in Italian literature. Tommaso Campanella was tortured by the Inquisition, and Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake. Cesare Balbo says that, if the happiness of the masses consists in peace without industry, if the nobility's consists in titles without power, if princes are satisfied by acquiescence in their rule without real independence, without sovereignty, if literary men and artists are content to write, paint and build with the approbation of their contemporaries, but to the contempt of posterity, if a whole nation is happy in ease without dignity and the tranquil progress of corruption, then no period ever was so happy for Italy as the 140 years from the Peace of Cateau Cambrésis to the War of the Spanish Succession. This period is known {{in the history of}} Italian literature as the Secentismo.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} the autobiographism as genre dominant of notes in “Teacher’s Notes” by Ulyana Kravchenko. The actuality of the article {{is an attempt to}} discover the genre aspect of “Teacher’s Notes” that is briefly discussed {{in the context of the}} other works of writer. So it needs more thorough analysis. The article deals with the autobiographical elements in the structure of the plot and their influence on the formation of the narrator image. The prototype of protagonist is a writer itself, the proto-plot is years of her life and work as a teacher in the town of Bibrka and village of Stoky. The author fills notes with her own emotions and feelings. That is why the static components dominate in notes, for example: descriptions, lyrical digressions, reflections etc. The self-characteristic in the text plays an important role as a result of certain events or actions, also reveals the narrator internal state. The <b>writer</b> sometimes <b>resorts</b> <b>to</b> philosophical reflections that accumulate her experience. The descriptions of the interior, appearance of the heroine, leitmotiv images of books and flowers are the indirectly ways of conveying the narrator image. Consequently the paper emphasizes on the genre uniqueness of “Teacher’s Notes”, for instance: narrative in the form of personal records; first-person narration, providing true psychological portrait of the heroine; autobiographical genre dominant, coupled with network of artistic means that help to show the narrator inner world; the genre marker “notes” in the name of the second part indicates the genre affiliation of the Ulyana Kravchenko’s work...|$|R
5000|$|Reid {{and others}} who have written about bel canto in the modern period, have inevitably been going against the {{mainstream}} and thus have always been open to criticism. Pedro de Alcantara, an Alexander teacher, supports both Reid as well as Husler/Rodd-Marling, who published Singing: The Physical Nature of the Vocal Organ in 1965: [...] "The free-thinking Reid and the collaborating duo of Frederick Husler and Yvonne Rodd-Marling have put forth watertight arguments for the correct relationship of cause and effect as regards breathing and singing. Their books have proved highly controversial, yet their detractors, rather than disproving the points made by their <b>writers,</b> have <b>resorted</b> <b>to</b> ad hominem attacks such as 'He is crazy.' Alexander was fond of saying that 'it doesn't alter a fact because you can't feel it'. We can expand the dictum to say that it does not alter a fact because you cannot understand it, nor because you can not accept it." [...] When Reid's first three books were published as a Trilogy in 1975, Richard Dyer-Bennet wrote: [...] "Today's world, in all its aspects, seems to vacillate between mechanistic and mystical approaches to problems. As always, the true path lies somewhere between the extremes, and Reid indicates the path. Due partly to misinterpretation and partly simply to neglect, contemporary teachers have deserted the old, productive principles of bel canto. As author and teacher, Reid has now firmly re-established these principles and, with added insights of his own, leaves us with no excuse to again lose our way." ...|$|R

The composer has already created the score, but the poet is suffering from <b>writer's</b> block and <b>resorts</b> <b>to</b> trying to adapt previous verses he has written to the existing music. The composer and poet are interrupted when Eleonora, the prima donna hired by the Count, enters and delivers a sample of her vocal artistry. Together with the Poet and the Maestro, she acts out a scene from Giuseppe Sarti's Giulio Sabino that devolves into a grotesque parody. Eleonora exits, and the librettist and the composer again wrestle {{with the problems of}} the libretto for the new opera in which a lengthy dispute between the two men ensues. Tonina (whose character is a parody of opera buffa) enters and demands a role in the new opera. The composer and the librettist quickly concoct a vocal number for her. A quarrel then erupts between Eleonora and Tonina over which of them should sing the opera's opening aria. The scene culminates in having both sing their arias simultaneously. The composer and the librettist are able to pacify the two ladies by agreeing to a juxtaposition of the seria and buffa styles, thereby putting a conciliatory end to their quarrel.|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates Emilia Pardo Bazán’s fiction {{predicated}} {{on the idea of}} a Galician regional Gothic deriving from elements of English literary tradition and nineteenth-century Spanish costumbrismo. While the recurrent use of Gothic elements in her literary output has been acknowledged and studied by a number of scholars, my investigation aims to shed some light on the reasons why this <b>writer</b> ultimately <b>resorts</b> <b>to</b> this genre. My first level of analysis concentrates on Gothic manifestations in nineteenth-century Spanish fiction, and how Pardo Bazán adopts this genre and adapts it to her Realist and Naturalist conventions. I maintain that the primary choice for the Gothic aesthetic responds to a necessity to portray the most basic features of Galician peculiarities – its distinctive landscape and its rural Volksgeist –. In this way, Edmund Burke’s contribution to the theorization of the Sublime reveals itself to be a satisfactory resource to Pardo Bazán, who was well familiarized with the concept. The use of Gothic elements equally functions as an instrument of social criticism to raise empathy for the backwardness that Galicia suffered during the last third of the nineteenth century. Thus, while addressing the issue of women’s subordination, the author develops distinctive narrative patterns frequently associated with the so-called Female Gothic. Meanwhile, the depictions of rural characters as savage, superstitious and ignorant indicate the author’s preoccupation with the psychological processes of the Gothic and the reactions among the reading public. In depicting the plight of rural Galicia, she is actually making her readers aware of the necessity to bring this region closer to modernity, that is, to Europe. My second level of analysis focuses on the psychological dimension of the Gothic. In the exploration of such motifs as hallucinations, nightmares, uncanny locations, or hysterical attacks, Pardo Bazán’s texts call for a psychoanalytic reinterpretation of these terms. If readers of Gothic fiction seek to decipher hidden meanings within texts, I will attempt to demonstrate that a psychoanalytic approach to Pardo Bazán’s use of Gothic fiction happens to be a necessary step to the better understanding of her work. Taking all this into account, this thesis will try to show that the use of Gothic devices Pardo Bazán employs are constant throughout her literary career and help her to describe the distinctive peculiarities of Galicia while functioning as a tool of social criticism...|$|R
