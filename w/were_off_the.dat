5|$|Illyrians soon {{captured}} and later fortified Dyrrachium (modern-day Durrës, Albania) and Phoenice (which was soon liberated with a truce and a fee). While her ships <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of Onchesmos, they intercepted and plundered some Roman merchant vessels. Teuta's forces extended their operations further southward into the Ionian Sea, defeating the combined Achaean and Aetolian fleet {{in the battle}} of Paxos and capturing the island of Corcyra, which put them in position to breach the important trade routes between the mainland of Greece and the Greek cities in Italy.|$|E
5|$|The 2012–13 {{season was}} {{undoubtedly}} a low ebb {{for the club}} under Jeffrey's reign. The Blues <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pace {{for most of the}} league campaign – their season encapsulated in a 3–1 home defeat by newly promoted Ballinamallard United in October 2012. Cliftonville were the eventual champions, securing their fourth league title after defeating Linfield 3–2 at Solitude on 13 April 2013. Crusaders secured the runners-up place, leaving the Blues in third place – a distant 29 points behind the champions. The club went out of the 2013 Setanta Sports Cup after a heavy aggregate defeat in the quarter-finals, went out of the League Cup at the semi-final stage, and exited the Irish Cup in the fifth round after a replay. The club's first Irish Cup defeat in four years was also the first time in 16 years they had lost their opening tie of the competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} moved westward {{due to a}} {{high pressure}} ridge while undergoing two eyewall replacement cycles: the first was around peak intensity and was completed when the hurricane moved over cooler waters, and the second was a brief cycle shortly after the hurricane began to weaken. The last advisory was issued while the hurricane was west of Mexico, {{but it was not}} until the remnants were west of Los Angeles, California that they finally dissipated. Elida's rapid intensification and unsteady weakening after reaching its peak intensity caused large errors in the intensity forecasting of the hurricane. Although the intensity forecasts <b>were</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> track forecasts were better than usual compared to the ten-year period prior to that year.|$|E

5|$|United States v. Washington, 384 F.Supp. 312 (W.D. Wash. 1974), aff'd, 520 F.2d 676 (9th Cir. 1975), {{commonly}} known as the Boldt Decision (from the name of the trial court judge, George Hugo Boldt), was a 1974 case heard in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It reaffirmed the reserved right of American Indian tribes in the State of Washington to act alongside the state as co-managers of salmon and other fish, and to continue harvesting them in accordance with the various treaties that the United States had signed with the tribes. The tribes of Washington had ceded their land to the United States but had reserved the right to fish as they had always done, including fishing at their traditional locations that <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> designated reservations.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of the Batavian squadron was noticed by Donnelly's small blockade force, which shadowed the Batavian ships as they passed southwards down the coast of Jutland, losing sight of them at 22:00 on 11 May. Donnelly correctly guessed the Batavian force's destination, and ordered Sylph to separate, the two vessels following different courses, instructing White to proceed to Duncan's blockade fleet and meet Donnelly there if {{he was unable to}} rediscover the Batavian squadron en route. Pegasus and Sylph encountered one another shortly before 05:00 on 12 May close to Duncan's fleet south of the Texel but without having located the Batavian squadron. Argo and her consorts had sailed close to the Danish and German coasts during the night, seizing in passing a British cutter named Duke of York, travelling from Yarmouth to Hamburg. At dawn on 12 May the Batavian ships <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Batavian coast sailing southwest towards the Texel anchorage.|$|E

25|$|After evading Killigrew off Cadiz, the Toulon {{squadron}} (Château-Renault) joined Tourville's fleet on 21 June. Tourville, {{commanding the}} combined Brest and Mediterranean fleets, with 75 ships {{of the line}} and 23 fireships, sailed on 23 June into the Channel; by 30 June, the French <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Lizard. Torrington sailed from the Nore, already convinced the French would be stronger – much of the Royal Navy had been diverted to protect their maritime commerce from privateers and the Allied fleet had only 56 English and Dutch ships of the line, with 4,153 guns, against the French fleet of 4,600 guns.|$|E
25|$|The main shock on 4 September caused {{widespread}} {{damage and}} several power outages, {{particularly in the}} city of Christchurch, New Zealand's second largest city. Two residents were seriously injured, one by a collapsing chimney and a second by flying glass. One person {{died of a heart attack}} suffered during the quake, although this could not be directly linked to the earthquake. Mass fatalities were avoided partly due to there being few houses of unreinforced construction, although this was also aided by the quake occurring during the early hours of the morning when most people <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> street.|$|E
25|$|For the English and in {{particular}} Queen Elizabeth it was more about luck as to how England had been saved. However she was displeased with Essex {{for the fact that}} the Azores expedition was a failure as well as leaving England's coastline defenceless. The English had obtained vital information from the captured Spanish ships and prisoners. They were able to learn what was happening; the objectives and overall strategy of the Spanish armada as a whole within a few days, whilst the ships <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> English and Welsh coasts. Howard on his return was rewarded soon after by the Queen and was created Earl of Nottingham.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, New York executed a {{trade with the}} Memphis Grizzlies in which the Knicks acquired Darko Miličić in exchange for Quentin Richardson. The Knicks got off to their worst ten-game start in franchise history, producing nine losses, with just one win. The Knicks responded by winning nine games and losing six in December. On January 24, 2010, the Knicks suffered their worst home loss in Madison Square Garden history against the Dallas Mavericks {{in front of a}} sellout crowd. The 50-point loss was also the second-worst in Knicks franchise history.|$|E
25|$|At the {{commencement}} of the Second World War in 1939, Collishaw was promoted to Air Commodore and took over as Air Officer Commanding, No. 204 Group ("Egypt Group") in North Africa. He concentrated on strategy and tactics to neutralize the Italian air force and to gain aerial superiority in North Africa. This was a tough challenge considering that his men were flying outdated Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters and Vickers Wellesley bombers. Soon after the war started Collishaw's men <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> mark quickly, striking at an Italian airbase destroying 18 aircraft within two days of {{the commencement}} of hostilities with only three aircraft losses. He then turned their efforts to bombing harbours, ships and troops {{to hold up the}} reinforcement of North Africa. They sunk the Italian cruiser San Giorgio and blew up an ammo dump.|$|E
25|$|For 2001, Häkkinen {{pledged to}} make a {{challenge}} for the World Championship, citing inspiration from {{the birth of his}} son Hugo. He also added that he was under less pressure to compete, saying that results over the previous year increased his desire to win. The season started badly for Häkkinen: He was forced into retirement in the opening round held in Australia due to a failure with his car's suspension resulting in his car spinning violently into a tyre barrier. The McLaren cars <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pace in Malaysia, with Häkkinen managing to end at the 6th place. He retired from the following race in Brazil when his car stalled on the starting grid, Further points came at the San Marino Grand Prix. At the Spanish Grand Prix, Häkkinen looked on course to win his first victory of the season, until the final lap of the race, when his car was hampered with a clutch failure and was classified ninth.|$|E

25|$|On 18 October 2011 a hot-spot in {{a public}} square {{was found in the}} city of Kashiwa, Chiba in the Nedokoyadai district, by a {{resident}} walking with a dosimeter. He informed the city council. Their first readings <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> scale, as their Geiger-counter could measure up to 10 microsieverts per hour. Later measurements by the Chiba environment foundation reported a final result of 57.5 microsieverts per hour. On 21 October the roads around the place were sealed off, and the place was covered with sandbags three meters thick. Further investigations and check-ups were planned on 24 October 2011. These investigations showed on 23 October levels up to 276,000 becquerels radioactive cesium per kilogram of soil, 30 centimeters below the surface. The first comments of town officials on the find of 57.7 microsieverts per hour were that there could not be a link with the Fukushima disaster, but after the find of this large amount of cesium, officials of the Science Ministry could not deny the possibility that the cause could be found at the Fukushima-site.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, Morse code {{began to}} be used {{extensively}} for early radio communication, before {{it was possible to}} transmit voice. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most high-speed international communication used Morse code on telegraph lines, undersea cables and radio circuits. In aviation, Morse code in radio systems started to be used on a regular basis in the 1920s. Although previous transmitters were bulky and the spark gap system of transmission was difficult to use, there had been some earlier attempts. In 1910, the US Navy experimented with sending Morse from an airplane. That same year, a radio on the airship America had been instrumental in coordinating the rescue of its crew. Zeppelin airships equipped with radio were used for bombing and naval scouting during World War I, and ground-based radio direction finders were used for airship navigation. Allied airships and military aircraft also made some use of radiotelegraphy. However, there was little aeronautical radio in general use during World War I, and in the 1920s, there was no radio system used by such important flights as that of Charles Lindbergh from New York to Paris in 1927. Once he and the Spirit of St. Louis <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ground, Lindbergh was truly alone and incommunicado. On the other hand, when the first airplane flight was made from California to Australia in 1928 on the Southern Cross, one of its four crewmen was its radio operator who communicated with ground stations via radio telegraph.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} group of five qualifiers, where drivers waited for the optimum time to set their lap times, Bird paced the session despite having an {{oversteer}} in his car, ahead of Abt and Robin Frijns. Carroll was fourth and António Félix da Costa was off the pace and was {{the first group}}'s slowest qualifier. Vergne drove cleanly and was the fastest driver in the second group. He was ahead of Prost who lost time in the first sector and d'Ambrosio. Engel and Loïc Duval rounded out the top five. In the third group, Rosenqvist set the overall fastest lap time of any competitor in the group stages at one minute and 8.171 seconds. López was second-fastest, nearly two-tenths of a second in arrears with di Grassi third. Both Piquet and Evans <b>were</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pace and were the third group's slowest two drivers; the latter made minor contact with the barrier on his maximum power lap. In the fourth group, Heidfeld was the fastest driver, nearly-three tenths of a second in front of Turvey, who was in turn, two-tenths ahead of Sarrazin. Buemi was the first driver to venture onto the track in the fourth group but struggled on his maximum power lap with a large amount of oversteer, and Dillmann rounded out the top five qualifiers. At the end of group qualifying, the lap times set by Rosenqvist, Bird, Heidfeld, López and di Grassi were fast to enable them progression into super pole. Di Grassi clinched the second pole position of his career with a time of one minute and 8.312 seconds. He was joined on the grid's front row by López who recorded a lap time 0.001 seconds slower than di Grassi. The margin of gap was the closest in Formula E history. Rosenqvist clipped the turn nine kerb, causing him to lose momentum, and slid his car lightly driving through turn ten, restricting him to third. Heidfeld qualified fourth, and Bird struggled for pace, going one second slower than di Grassi in the first sector, to round out the top five.|$|E
