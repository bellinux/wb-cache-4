50|$|A precise {{synchronization}} of {{the rotary}} motion with the stroke movement is required {{so that the}} needle does not touch the groove channel during {{the up and down}} movement. Influencing variables for the maximum <b>winding</b> <b>speed</b> are the needle stroke, the rotation angle of the stator (number of poles), the wire diameter and the groove channel width and the helix angle of the angularly grooved stators. The mass of the wire guide and the needle support experience a high acceleration. This can lead to unwanted vibrations that {{have an effect on the}} winding quality. The lifting motion is normally generated by ball screws. During this movement, the servo drives must constantly reverse in order to reverse the direction of the needle movement.|$|E

30|$|The {{wind power}} {{prediction}} error probability distribution is very complex {{due to the}} nonlinear relationship between the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and <b>wind</b> power: when the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> {{is less than the}} cut-in wind, the wind power is 0; when the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> is between the cut-in <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and the rated <b>wind</b> <b>speed,</b> the <b>wind</b> power will be the smooth output; when the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> is between the rated <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and the cut-out wind, the wind power will maintain its maximum power; when the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> is greater than the cut-out <b>wind</b> <b>speed,</b> the <b>wind</b> power will be 0. Therefore, based on the nonlinear relationship between <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and <b>wind</b> power, the prediction distribution of wind power is complex.|$|R

To achieve this, the effect of fibre extrusion speed and fibre <b>winding</b> <b>speed</b> on the degree of alignment of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), as well as the resulting electrical properties of the cellulose/MWNTs composite fibres were systematically studied. 1 -Ethyl- 3 -Methylimidazolium Acetate (EMIMAc) was used as an environmentally benign solvent for dissolution of cellulose as well as for dispersion of MWNTs in the solution dope. To achieve good dispersion of MWNTs in the cellulose solution dope, MWNTs were non-covalently functionalized using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). This significantly improved the dispersion of MWNTs in the solution dope. The degree of alignment of MWNTs after both fibre extrusion and winding, was studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The degree of alignment of MWNTs was correlated with the electrical properties. A significant decrease in electrical conductivity accompanied the increase in degree of alignment of MWNTs when fibres were spun with higher extrusion speed. The decrease was also measured when fibres were spun with higher <b>winding</b> <b>speed</b> using a constant extrusion speed.
