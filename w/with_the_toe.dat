2500|$|If a torus is {{punctured}} {{and turned}} inside out then another torus results, with lines of latitude and longitude interchanged. [...] This is equivalent to building a torus from a cylinder, by joining the circular ends together, in two different ways: around the outside like joining two ends of a garden hose, or through the inside like rolling a sock (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> cut off). Additionally, if the cylinder was made by gluing two opposite sides of a rectangle together, choosing the other two sides instead will cause the same reversal of orientation.|$|E
2500|$|The glide step, also {{commonly}} known as the roll step, involves bringing the heel gently to the ground <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> pointed up, and then rolling forward onto the toes before lifting the foot to continue forward. [...] While marching to the rear, the weight is placed continually on the ball of the foot with the heel elevated. This style is used by both marching bands as well as drum and bugle corps. [...] The style, in comparison to high step, gives drill formations a more fluid appearance, allowing for better control of more difficult formations and various styles of music. With this control also comes the ability to perform a much broader range of tempos. Proper execution of a roll step gives a player marching at 40 beats per minute the same smooth tone as a player marching at 180. The roll step allows for much better control of the upper body, and thus better control of the air support needed for playing.|$|E

5000|$|Cramp is effectually {{prevented}} by placing <b>the</b> shoes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> just peeping {{from beneath the}} coverlet; the same is also {{prevented by}} tying the garter round the left leg below the knee.|$|R
50|$|Steppage gait (High stepping, Neuropathic gait) {{is a form}} of gait {{abnormality}} characterised by {{foot drop}} due to loss of dorsiflexion. <b>The</b> foot hangs <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> pointing down, causing <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> to scrape <b>the</b> ground while walking, requiring someone to lift the leg higher than normal when walking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sing if ye like, but I'll plug my ears, for one," [...] said {{still another}} sulky varlet, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> {{out of his}} sea-boots, while all <b>the</b> rest <b>with</b> one roar of misanthropy joined him.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's {{short of}} what I expected," [...] said Shark Dodson, kicking softly at the {{packages}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> of his boot. And then he looked pensively at the wet sides of his tired horse.|$|E
50|$|The statue {{represents}} {{a young woman}} of more than life size, standing in drapery. The weight of the body rests on the right leg, supported by a tree stump; the left leg is left free.

2500|$|Originally, he {{was born}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> of that foot fused. An {{operation}} was performed to separate <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> {{so that he could}} use them as fingers to grab, turn a page, or perform other functions. He has been able to use his foot to operate an electric wheelchair, a computer and a mobile phone. Vujicic attempted suicide but notes that he had an [...] "amazingly normal childhood".|$|R
50|$|Purpura of {{the nail}} beds usually result from trauma, with causes of toe {{involvement}} including physical pressure on <b>the</b> <b>toes,</b> {{such as that}} seen in surfboarding or windsurfing in which one must maintain balance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes,</b> or when exogenous pressure is exerted from poorly fitting shoes. Purpura beneath the nails may present similar to a melanoma, a confusion that may result if the patient does not communicate the acuteness of onset.|$|R
60|$|Less {{than sixty}} seconds passed, {{and he was}} {{pounding}} vigorously {{on the front door}} of the heavy log building. Not content with using his fist he banged away <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> of his cowhide boot.|$|E

50|$|As an {{alternative}} to the standard front split, some skaters perform a Russian split, with legs in a straddle split. The only difference between this and a split jump is the position in the air. The legs extend straight out, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> pointed. Skaters often touch their toes as part of a Russian split.|$|R
50|$|Naihanchi Shodan {{comes to}} Isshin Ryu from studies with both Chotoku Kyan and Choki Motobu (a cousin of Kyan). It is also {{considered}} one of the staples of Ryukyu Ti, and is prevalent in most forms of Karate. The Isshin Ryu version is influenced heavily by the kumite of Motobu, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> exception of <b>the</b> turned-in <b>toes</b> (Motobu preferred <b>the</b> horse-riding stance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> in a neutral position).|$|R
40|$|Humourous {{song about}} a beggar. Begging {{is the best}} trade: you can sing for your supper.

5000|$|The rhyme {{is usually}} counted {{out on an}} infant or toddler's toes, each line {{corresponding}} to a different <b>toe,</b> usually starting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> big <b>toe</b> and ending <b>with</b> <b>the</b> little <b>toe.</b> A foot tickle is usually added during the [...] "Wee...all the way home" [...] section of the last line.

50|$|An organ {{expression}} pedal {{is typically}} a large pedal, resembling an oversized automobile accelerator, either partially or fully recessed within the organ console and located either directly above {{or to the}} right of the organ's pedalboard. As the pedal is pressed forward <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes,</b> <b>the</b> volume of the sound is increased; as it is depressed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> heel, the volume is decreased. A stand alone expression pedal used with electronic keyboards, amplifiers, and effects is usually a smaller pedal made of metal or plastic that can be placed on the floor and then connected to <b>the</b> device <b>with</b> an instrument cable.|$|R
