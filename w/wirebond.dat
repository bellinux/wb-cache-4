50|$|Electrically {{connecting}} the failing pin to a ground pin produced the electric current path {{shown in figure}} 2. This electrical path strongly suggests that the current is somehow flowing through all the ground nets though a conductive path located {{very close to the}} <b>wirebond</b> pads from the top down view of the package. Based on electrical and layout analysis of the package, it can be inferred that current is either flowing through the <b>wirebond</b> pads or that the wirebonds are somehow touching a conductive structure at the specified location. After obtaining similar SSM results on the two units under test, further destructive analysis focused around the small potential short region, and it showed that the failing pin <b>wirebond</b> is touching the bottom of one of the stacked dice at the specific XY position highlighted by SSM analysis. The cross section view of one of those units is shown in figure 3.|$|E
50|$|Electric shorts in multi-stacked die {{packages}} can be {{very difficult}} to isolate non-destructively; especially when a large number of bond wires are somehow shorted. For instance, when an electric short is produced by two bond wires touching each other, x-ray analysis may help to identify potential defect locations; however, defects like metal migration produced at <b>wirebond</b> pads, or bond wires somehow touching any other conductive structures, may {{be very difficult to}} catch with non-destructive techniques that are not electrical in nature. Here, the availability of analytical tools that can map out the flow of electric current inside the package provide valuable information to guide the failure analyst to potential defect locations.|$|E

50|$|This {{is usually}} quoted as the thermal {{resistance}} from junction to {{case of the}} semiconductor device. The units are °C/W. For example, a heatsink rated at 10 °C/W will get 10 °C hotter than the surrounding air when it dissipates 1 Watt of heat. Thus, a heatsink with a low °C/W value is more efficient than a heatsink with a high °C/W value.Given two semiconductor devices in the same package, a lower junction to ambient resistance (RθJ-C) indicates a more efficient device. However, when comparing two devices with different die-free package thermal resistances (Ex. DirectFETTM MT vs <b>wirebond</b> 5x6mm PQFN), their junction to ambient or junction to case resistance values may not correlate directly to their comparative efficiencies. Different semiconductor packages may have different die orientations, different copper(or other metal) mass surrounding the die, different die attach mechanics, and different molding thickness, all of which could yield significantly different junction to case or junction to ambient resistance values, and could thus obscure overall efficiency numbers.|$|E

The major components are silicon (Si) probes, Si platform, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), polyimide flexible cable and wireless IC.

For the first time, we clearly identify cascaded resonance modes of <b>wirebond</b> transition structures with two different substrates, by the electric field distribution at the resonant frequencies. The transition between the CPW grounds of the two substrates act as a node separating the modes, and consequently forming both the mode of the entire structure and the cascade of two different resonant modes on two substrates.

40|$|Advances in CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) device {{technology}} have helped reduce typical die core sizes by shrinking the minimum transistor feature size. In {{the case of}} wirebonded devices with high IO counts, the final die size is increasingly determined by the size and layout of the IO cells and corresponding <b>wirebond</b> pads. Typical <b>wirebond</b> pad designs consist of a top-level metal {{that does not include}} any circuitry beneath the bonding region. Further, placement rules typically require the placement of ESD circuitry, buffers, and busses inside of the bond pad ring in order to avoid possible damage and reliability failures caused by wirebonding. On die with high pad counts, this exclusion area can represent a significant percentage of the die area that is not used for circuitry. This papers describes a layout technology called Bond Over Active (BOA), that was developed to utilize this “excluded ” region beneath <b>wirebond</b> pads in order to minimze die area. Two different BOA layouts are evaluated using a standard test structure. <b>Wirebond</b> assembly reliability and package stress reliability are determined. The transfer of forces from the top metal pad to the active silicon during wirebonding are predicted using mechanical simulations.

40|$|Conventional plastic {{encapsulated}} microcircuits (PEMs) {{are increasingly}} being used in harsh environments such as automotive, well-logging, aerospace and military applications. There is a need, therefore, to examine their performance and reliability at high temperatures. A commonly used first level interconnect in PEMs is the gold <b>wirebond</b> – aluminum bondpad interface. This interface {{has been found to}} have a very limited life at temperatures above 180 °C, due to intermetallic formation and subsequent corrosion. The corrosion is caused by brominated flame retardants and antimony trioxide in the molding compound. Given a set of environmental requirements, it is necessary to choose the right PEM for that set and to predict the life of the PEM based on the effect the flame retardants will have on the wirebond-bondpad interface. It is also necessary to look for better molding compound alternatives, such as environmentally-friendly halogen-free compounds, to mitigate high temperature corrosion. Thus, the focus {{of this study is to}} characterize the Br-related <b>wirebond</b> weakening process and to establish the high temperature reliability of halogen-free molding compounds.

40|$|This thesis {{research}} investigates thermal performance, parasitic extraction and wirebond/encapsulation {{reliability of}} power electronic modules. Thermal performance {{is critical to}} the power electronic modules. As such, thermal analysis {{is an important part of}} the power electronic module design process. Several cases are studied on generalized power modules with a full bridge layout. A database is built based on these results. The studies are performed using SolidWorks thermal simulation tool. The database involves several parameters such as power dissipation, maximum junction temperature, ambient temperature, convection coefficient required to cool the module, size of the baseplate, heat-sink size, substrate size, spacing between dies, and different materials that can be used for the power electronic module. Using this database, procedures to select appropriate parameters in a thermally efficient layout for the power electronic modules are illustrated using examples. It was found that, for optimum performance, ∆T (maximum junction temperature - ambient temperature) should be greater than 125 ᴼC for power modules with medium and high power dissipation. Also, for a low ∆T and high power dissipation, baseplate acts more like a thermal resistance than a heat-spreader. Hence, it is ineffective to employ base-plates for these cases. Increasing substrate size to bring down maximum junction temperature is more effective in higher power dissipation cases than those for medium or low power dissipation. Parasitic extraction for an electronic power module using a time domain reflectometry (TDR) method in the form of differential inductance waveforms was developed. These measured parasitic inductance and parasitic capacitance are compared with the parasitic parameters extracted using a Q 3 D extractor software. The accuracy of the measurement results from these two different approaches is studied in detail. Reliability of <b>wirebonds</b> in the case of encapsulated and un-encapsulated power modules were investigated by subjecting them temperature cycling from - 55 ᴼC to 250 ᴼC. It was found that the solder flux affected the reliability of the <b>wirebonds.</b> As such, it is recommended that the power connectors on the power substrate should be free of flux, as the residual solder flux can affect the nearby <b>wirebonds</b> in the power modules. As expected, the differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion between the power substrate bond wires and encapsulation affect the reliability of the <b>wirebonds.</b> Large diameter <b>wirebonds</b> tend to be stronger and can withstand the stress and strain created by the different material systems in the power electronic modules...|$|R

As a matter of fact, much of our knowledge of thermosonic flip chip bonding comes from <b>wirebonding</b> technology, where it is commonly agreed that {{the flexibility of the}} process windows in <b>wirebonding</b> decreases with the increase in ultrasonic frequency, even though the bond time and the bond temperature are usually lower under higher ultrasonic frequency.
