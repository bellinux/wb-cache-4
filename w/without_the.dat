40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{watermarking}} and ciphering color images, {{based on the}} joint use of a key-dependent wavelet transform with a secure cryptographic scheme, is presented. The system allows to watermark encrypted data <b>without</b> requiring <b>the</b> knowledge of the original data and also to cipher watermarked data <b>without</b> damaging <b>the</b> embedded signal. Since {{different areas of the}} proposed transform domain are used for encryption and watermarking, the extraction of the hidden information can be performed <b>without</b> deciphering <b>the</b> cover data and it is also possible to decipher watermarked data <b>without</b> removing <b>the</b> watermark.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel method for {{watermarking}} and ciphering color images is presented. The {{aim of the}} system is to allow the watermarking of encrypted data <b>without</b> requiring <b>the</b> knowledge of the original data. By using this method, it is also possible to cipher watermarked data <b>without</b> damaging <b>the</b> embedded signal. Furthermore, the extraction of the hidden information can be performed <b>without</b> deciphering <b>the</b> cover data and it is also possible to decipher watermarked data <b>without</b> removing <b>the</b> watermark. The transform domain adopted in this work is the Fibonacci-Haar wavelet transform. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2008 SPIE-IS&T...|$|R
