5|$|Mendelssohn wrote symphonies, concerti, oratorios, piano {{music and}} chamber music. His best-known works include his Overture and {{incidental}} music for A Midsummer Night's Dream, the Italian Symphony, the Scottish Symphony, the overture The Hebrides, his mature Violin Concerto, and his String Octet. His Songs <b>Without</b> <b>Words</b> are {{his most famous}} solo piano compositions. After {{a long period of}} relative denigration due to changing musical tastes and antisemitism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, his creative originality has now been recognised and re-evaluated. He is now among the most popular composers of the Romantic era.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn's Songs <b>Without</b> <b>Words</b> (Lieder ohne Worte), eight cycles each {{containing}} six lyric pieces (two published posthumously), remain {{his most}} famous solo piano compositions. They became standard parlour recital items even during the composer's lifetime, and their overwhelming popularity has itself caused many critics to underrate their musical value. Other composers who were inspired to produce similar pieces of their own, included Charles-Valentin Alkan (his five sets of Chants, each ending with a barcarole), Anton Rubinstein, Ignaz Moscheles, and Edvard Grieg.|$|E
5|$|The bassoon sustains its B {{from the}} final chord of the first {{movement}} before moving up a semitone to middle C. This serves as a key change from the E minor opening movement into the lyrical C major slow movement. The movement is in ternary form and is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's own Songs <b>Without</b> <b>Words.</b> The theme to the darker, middle section in A minor is first introduced by the orchestra before the violin then takes up both the melody and the accompaniment simultaneously. The tremulous accompaniment requires nimble dexterity from the soloist before the music returns to the main lyrical C major theme, this time leading towards a serene conclusion.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} religious rite for Heathens is called blót, which constitutes a ritual in which offerings are {{provided to the}} gods. Blót typically takes place outdoors, and usually consists of an offering of mead, which is contained within a bowl. The gods are invoked and requests expressed for their aid, as the priest uses a sprig or branch of an evergreen tree to sprinkle mead onto both statues of the deities and the assembled participants. This procedure might be scripted or largely improvised. Finally, the bowl of mead is poured onto a fire, or onto the earth, as a final libation to the gods. Sometimes, a communal meal is held afterward; in some groups this is incorporated {{as part of the}} ritual itself. In other instances, the blót is simpler and less ritualized; in this case, it can involve a practitioner setting some food aside, sometimes <b>without</b> <b>words,</b> for either gods or wights. Some Heathens perform such rituals on a daily basis, although for others it is a more occasional performance. Aside from honoring deities, communal blóts also serve as a form of group bonding.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Shneur Zalman {{composed}} {{a number of}} Hassidic melodies. Some accompany certain prayers, others are sung to Biblical verses or are melodies <b>without</b> <b>words.</b> Depending on the tune they are meant to arouse joy, spiritual ecstasy or teshuvah. One special melody, {{commonly referred to as}} The Alter Rebbe's Niggun or Dalet Bovos, is reserved by Chabad Hassidim for ushering a groom and bride to their wedding canopy and other select occasions.|$|E

25|$|In some Jewish communities, it is {{customary}} for the Kohanim {{to raise}} their hands and recite an extended musical chant <b>without</b> <b>words</b> before reciting the last word of each phrase. There are different tunes for this chant in different communities. Aside from its pleasant sound, the chant is done so that the congregation may silently offer certain prayers containing individual requests of God after {{each of the three}} blessings of the Kohanim. Because supplications of this nature are not permitted on Shabbat, the chant is also not done on Shabbat. In Israel, though, this chanting is not the custom.|$|E
25|$|Brodovitch {{released}} {{a book of}} these photographs in 1945, titled simply Ballet, through a small New York publisher. The book contains 104 photographs of several ballets and is divided into eleven segments, one for each ballet performance. On the contents page, Brodovitch introduces each chapter in a typographic style that emulates {{the feel of the}} dance it is describing. He photographed with a Contax 35mm camera, no flash, and with a slow film speed. The blurred figures of the dancers allow the viewer to not only feel the music, but also to follow the line of the dancer's limbs mid-step. The images beautifully capture the atmosphere on-stage, the frenzied behind-the-scenes action backstage, and the magical moments of the ballet. By bleeding the blurred, grainy pictures off the pages and into the gutters, he communicated the emotional impact of the dance <b>without</b> <b>words.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of his career, Barenboim concentrated on music of the classical era, as well as some romantic composers. He made his first recording in 1954. Notable classical recordings include the complete cycles of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert's piano sonatas, and Mozart's piano concertos (in the latter, taking part as both soloist and conductor). Romantic recordings include Brahms's piano concertos (with John Barbirolli), Mendelssohn's Songs <b>Without</b> <b>Words,</b> and Chopin's nocturnes. Barenboim also recorded many chamber works, especially in collaboration with his first wife, Jacqueline du Pré, the violinist Itzhak Perlman, and the violinist and violist Pinchas Zukerman. Noted performances include: the complete Mozart violin sonatas (with Perlman), Brahms's violin sonatas (live concert with Perlman, previously in the studio with Zukerman), Beethoven's and Brahms's cello sonatas (with du Pré), Beethoven's and Tchaikovsky's piano trios (with du Pré and Zukerman), and Schubert's Trout Quintet (with du Pré, Perlman, Zukerman, and Zubin Mehta).|$|E

25|$|Music-specific neural {{networks}} {{exist in the}} brain {{for a variety of}} music-related tasks. It has been shown that Broca's area is involved in the processing of musical syntax. Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability {{to tell the difference between}} tonal and atonal music and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch. The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct {{neural networks}} also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders him/her unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented <b>without</b> <b>words.</b> However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds. The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system. Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.|$|E
500|$|Ward began {{engraving}} on Song <b>Without</b> <b>Words</b> {{while working}} on his longest wordless novel, Vertigo (1937), which took two years to complete. [...] McNeer was pregnant with their second child and the couple were facing the same anxieties as the book's protagonist, and having worked through these issues they carried through the birth of daughter Robin. [...] Into adulthood Robin kept a wall of her home decorated with prints from Song <b>Without</b> <b>Words.</b>|$|E
500|$|Ward {{returned}} to the themes of Song <b>Without</b> <b>Words</b> in Hymn for the Night, a retelling {{of the birth of}} Christ in Nazi Germany.

500|$|Six moments musicaux (French for [...] "Six Musical Moments"; , Shest’ muzykál’nykh moméntov), Op.16, [...] {{is a set}} of solo piano pieces {{composed}} by the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff between October and December, 1896. Each Moment musical reproduces a musical form characteristic of a previous musical era. The forms that appear in Rachmaninoff's incarnation are the nocturne, song <b>without</b> <b>words,</b> barcarolle, virtuoso étude, and theme and variations.|$|E
500|$|Dedicated to Madame Léon Blum, {{the tenth}} barcarolle stays more closely within {{conventional}} tonality than its predecessor, [...] "with a certain sedate gravity... the monotony appropriate to a grey evening" [...] (Koechlin). The melancholy theme {{is reminiscent of}} Mendelssohn's Venetian themes from Songs <b>Without</b> <b>Words,</b> but is developed in a way characteristic of Fauré, with [...] "increasingly animated rhythms and, at certain points, excessively complex textures" [...] (Nectoux).|$|E

500|$|The wordless novel [...] is {{a silent}} {{narrative}} {{made up of}} prints of 139engraved woodblocks. [...] Each image moves the story forward by an interval Ward chooses to maintain story flow. [...] Ward wrote in Storyteller <b>Without</b> <b>Words</b> (1974) that too great an interval would put too much interpretational burden on the reader, while too little would make the story tedious. [...] Wordless novel historian David A. Beronä likens these concerns with the storytelling methods of comics.|$|E
500|$|Printed from twenty-five woodcut blocks, {{the book}} was first {{released}} in 1918 by Édition de Sablier, a Swiss publishing house of which Masereel was a co-sponsor.
