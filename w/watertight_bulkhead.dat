500|$|Although a {{recommendation}} {{had been made}} while the ships were still under construction to extend the superstructure out {{to the sides of}} the ship to improve their stability and habitability, this was not acted upon until they were refitted during the 1880s. This refit also strengthened the breastwork and upper decks, added another <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> as well as a false keel. Four quick-firing 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns were added on the breastwork for torpedo boat defence as well as five machine guns and several searchlights.

500|$|Iron Duke recommissioned {{two months}} later and was {{assigned}} as the guardship at Hull. During the First Reserve Squadron's summer cruise on 1 September, she was en route with three other ironclads between Dublin and Queenstown (now Cobh). In a thick fog, the ship accidentally rammed her sister, Vanguard, off Kish Bank, in Dublin Bay. Iron Duke had her bowsprit wrecked, but was otherwise little damaged. Her ram, however, had torn a [...] hole in Vanguards side. The ram also damaged the <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> between Vanguards engine and boiler rooms which flooded both compartments and prevented her crew from using her steam-powered pumps. The ship sunk in a little over an hour after all of the crew abandoned ship.|$|E
500|$|On January 19, 1880, Jeannette's hull was {{breached}} by the ice, and {{she began}} to take in water rapidly. [...] De Long [...] prepared to abandon ship, but she was saved by the actions of Nindemann and Sweetman, who waded into the freezing water in the hold and staunched the inflow by stuffing whatever materials were available into the breaches. [...] Melville used elements of the discarded Edison apparatus to build a mechanical pumping system, and the problem was largely resolved by {{the construction of a new}} <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead.</b> De Long noted in his journal that the efforts of Nindemann and Sweetman were at least worthy of recommendation for the Medal of Honor.|$|E
50|$|The heroism of Captain Harvey, {{who died}} after having {{ensured that the}} {{passengers}} would be first to abandon the ship, was praised by Victor Hugo, who also recommended that London and South Western Railway equip its ships with <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> sufficient life jackets, and floating lights.|$|R

They were shaped like truncated cones which matched the trajectories of descending shells and thus lessened their protective value. The conning tower was [...] thick, reduced to 300mm below the upper deck. The funnel uptakes were protected by 50mm of armour. The upper deck was [...] thick while the middle deck consisted of [...] plates of KNC on 25mm of nickel-steel over the armoured citadel.

500|$|The {{main battery}} turrets and {{ammunition}} magazines {{were also the}} subject of intense scrutiny; among the tests conducted was a trial to see how fast the magazines could be flooded—the result was 12 minutes. The gunnery school HMS Excellent ran loading trials on the main battery guns. It {{was found that the}} guns could be prepared to fire in 23 seconds, 13 seconds faster than in the s. The ship's <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> and underwater protection systems also particularly interested the inspection team; they paid close attention to the ship's pumping and counter-flooding equipment. Commander W M Phipps Hornby, who lived on board Baden for weeks during the examination, wrote to the naval historian Arthur Marder in 1969 that it was his [...] "considered opinion—which I know coincided with that of others engaged on the same job—that, considered as a fighting machine, anyhow on balance the Baden was markedly in advance of any comparable ship of the Royal Navy".|$|E

This was based on that done for her sister Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya, but was even more extensive. Her rear superstructure was enlarged and a new structure was built just forward of it which required the repositioning of the mainmast forward. This did not leave enough room for a derrick, as was fitted in Marat, and two large booms were fitted to handle aircraft while the existing boat cranes remained in place. The mast had to be reinforced by two short legs to handle the weight of the booms and their loads. Her false bow was reworked into a real forecastle like those fitted to her sisters. All twenty-five of her old boilers were replaced by a dozen oil-fired boilers originally intended for the s. The space saved was used to add another inboard longitudinal <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> that greatly improved her underwater protection.|$|E
500|$|There {{were other}} {{considerable}} advancements in hydraulic engineering and nautical technology during the Song dynasty. The 10th-century {{invention of the}} pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal, which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges. There was the Song-era innovation of <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships. If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water. The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal-like structure. Stern-mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship. In the Song period, the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in {{a wider range of}} water depths. The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction. David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement [...] " [...] them more reliable" [...] for anchoring ships.|$|E
500|$|There {{were plenty}} of {{descriptions}} in Chinese literature of {{the time on the}} operations and aspects of seaports, maritime merchant shipping, overseas trade, and the sailing ships themselves. In 1117, the author Zhu Yu wrote not only of the magnetic compass for navigation, but also a hundred-foot line with a hook that was cast over the deck of the ship, used to collect mud samples {{at the bottom of the}} sea in order for the crew to determine their whereabouts by the smell and appearance of the mud. In addition, Zhu Yu wrote of <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> compartments in the hulls of ships to prevent sinking if damaged, the for-and-aft lug, taut mat sails, and the practice of beating-to-windward. Confirming Zhu Yu's writing on Song dynasty ships with bulkhead hull compartments, in 1973 a [...] long, [...] wide Song trade ship from c. 1277 was dredged from the water near the southern coast of China that contained 12 bulkhead compartment rooms in its hull. Maritime culture during the Song period was enhanced by these new technologies, along with the allowance of greater river and canal traffic. All around there was a bustling display of government run grain-tax transport ships, tribute vessels and barges, private shipping vessels, a multitude of busy fishers in small fishing boats, along with the rich enjoying the comforts of their luxurious private yachts.|$|E

500|$|Gangut {{was laid}} up on 9 November 1918 {{for lack of}} {{manpower}} and was renamed Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya (: October Revolution) on 27 June 1925 while she was being refitted. She was recommissioned on 23 March 1926 and began a partial reconstruction on 12 October 1931, incorporating the lessons from the earlier modernizations of her sisters Marat and Parizhskaya Kommuna. The tubular tower-mast of Marat {{was replaced by a}} larger and sturdier structure with a KDP-6 fire control director, equipped with two [...] Zeiss rangefinders positioned on top. The aft superstructure was enlarged and a new structure was built just forward of it, with another KDP-6 director surmounting it, which required the repositioning of the mainmast [...] forward. This did not leave enough room for a derrick, as was used on Marat, so two large boat cranes were mounted {{on each side of the}} mainmast. Her funnel was curved to the rear rather than angled like Marat. Each turret received Italian [...] rangefinders and their roof armor was increased to [...] in thickness. A new forecastle was fitted, much like that Marats, to improve seakeeping. Six [...] 34-K anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added, three on the roofs of the fore and aft turrets. All twenty-five of her old boilers were replaced by a dozen oil-fired boilers originally intended for the [...] Izmail. The space saved was used to add another inboard longitudinal <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> that greatly improved her underwater protection. Her original Pollen Argo Clock mechanical fire-control computer was upgraded with a copy of a Vickers Ltd fire-control computer, designated AKUR by the Soviets, as well as a copy of a Sperry stable vertical gyroscope. These changes increased her displacement to [...] at full load and her overall length to [...] Her metacentric height decreased to [...] from her designed [...] as a result of her enlarged superstructures.|$|E
500|$|Parizhskaya Kommuna was {{refitted}} in 1928 {{in preparation}} for her transfer to the Black Sea Fleet {{the next year and}} she was given an open-topped false bow to improve her sea-keeping ability. However, while en route through the Bay of Biscay, she was caught in a heavy storm that damaged the bow and she was forced to put into Brest for repairs. Marat {{was the first of the}} class to be reconstructed between 1928 and 8 April 1931. Her superstructure was enlarged, her guns were replaced, the turrets overhauled, the anti-aircraft armament augmented and the fire-control equipment modernized. Her boilers were converted to burn only fuel oil and this produced enough steam that the forward three boilers could be removed and the boiler room was turned into anti-aircraft magazines and control spaces. The forward funnel was angled to the rear and extended to try to keep the exhaust out of the gunnery spaces and the bridge. She was also given a false bow, but hers had a solid top that turned it into a forecastle. Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya was the next ship to be rebuilt and profited from the experiences of her sister's modernization between 1931 and 1934. All twenty-five of her old boilers were replaced by a dozen oil-fired boilers originally intended for the [...] Izmail. The space saved was used to add another inboard longitudinal <b>watertight</b> <b>bulkhead</b> that greatly improved her underwater protection. The rest of her modernization was along the same lines as Marats, except that the latter's tubular foremast was replaced by a sturdier semi-conical mast, a new aft structure was built in front of the rear conning tower which caused the mainmast to be moved forward, her forward funnel was curved to the rear to better keep the bridge clear of exhaust gases and the thickness of her turret roofs was increased to [...] Parizhskaya Kommuna began her two-stage reconstruction in 1933 along the lines of Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiyas modernization. Major differences were that her guns and turrets were improved to increase their rate of fire to about two rounds per minutes and to extend their range, she was the first ship of the class to receive light anti-aircraft guns and her forward funnel was given a more sinuous curve to direct its exhaust gases away from the forward superstructure. She completed these alterations in 1938, but was returned to the dockyard from December 1939 through July 1940 to receive a new armored deck and anti-torpedo bulges which cured her stability problems and greatly increased her underwater protection at a modest cost in speed.|$|E
