For instance, Jiirgen Habennas (1994) has pronounced that the "nation-state in Europe is in a terminal state. " The Czech President, Vaclav Havel, has stated that national sovereignty is an outmoded concept in European politics. Indeed, in 1988, the Danish Prime Minister, Paul Schluter, called the nation-state the twin of the industrial society and, therefore, an outworn structure soon to be extinct. And the German Prime Minister, Gerhard Schroeder, has proposed a federated United States of Europe {{that would have a}} directly elected governinent exercising authority over all constituent countries (New York Times 1 May 2001 : AI). The idea of a united Europe flexing its muscles to limit American economic and diplomatic power has widespread support among elite groups (Wallace and Wallace 2000). Even in 1991 and 1992, when substantial popular opposition to the Maastricht Treaty arose and a sense of crisis loomed within the European Union (EU), a survey found that more than 90 % of the elites in every country favored moving further toward political union (Karlheinz Reif, personal communication).

2500|$|He has refined the {{explanation}} by shifting to {{the example of}} a [...] "Movitype" [...] screen, often used for advertisements and announcements in public places. A Movitype screen consists of a matrix—or [...] "raster" [...] as the neuroscientists prefer to call it (from the Latin rastrum, a [...] "rake"; think of the lines on a TV screen as [...] "raked" [...] across)—that is made up of an array of tiny light-sources. A computer-led input can excite these lights so as to give the impression of letters passing from right to left, or even, on the more advanced forms now commonly used in advertisements, to show moving pictures. Maund's point is as follows. It is obvious that there are two ways of describing <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing.</b> We could either adopt the everyday public language and say [...] "I saw some sentences, followed by a picture of a 7-Up can."

One could ask the electronics engineer to provide us with a computer print-out staged across the seconds that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> watching it of the point-states of the raster of lights. This would no doubt be a long and complex document, with the state of each tiny light-source given its place in the sequence.

40|$|When {{you hear}} the word "{{homeless}} " what comes to your mind? When you see {{out of the side}} of your eye a person holding a sign asking for money, what goes through your mind? Do you wonder if the homeless person is an addict or even crazy? Do you wonder if the person holding the sign is a scammer trying to prey on people's sympathy? Or do you feel compassion, but just are not sure how to help? These are all questions I have at one time or another thought. And while it is good to question what you see, I also think it is good to take the time to learn about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> and do something to help. It may be true that some people are homeless due to poor choices or that some people try to scam others. But if you think about it, how humbling it is to hold a sign and ask strangers for help, you will find yourself giving that homeless person the benefit of the doubt.
