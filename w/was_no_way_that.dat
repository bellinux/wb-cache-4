5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War, Waddington was {{appointed}} chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the Ministry of Food. His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats. When the war concluded, he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of money had been altered. The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944, Waddington and the manager of another fat storage firm shared £1,600 between them which should have gone to the latter's company when the price paid by the Ministry for storage increased. Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director at the family firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter, or that he was in any way responsible.|$|E
25|$|The Winter War {{also helped}} reaffirm the Swedish position. Aid to Finland {{had been as}} much about aiding a {{neighbour}} as about neutralising the public opinion calling for active intervention in the war. It also helped to establish the political priorities before the events of 9 April 1940, when Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. The goal was now fixed on keeping Sweden out of the growing European conflict; {{if they had not}} gone to war to defend Finland, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they would do it for Norway.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Bleichrodt {{was held}} by the Allies on war crimes charges {{pertaining}} to {{the sinking of the}} City of Benares. Bleichrodt was accused of sinking the ship with the full knowledge that it had been transporting evacuees. He reaffirmed the German position that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> he or the crew of the submarine could have known who was on board. It was upheld and he was acquitted. However, Bleichrodt refused to apologise to the survivors, despite several crew members of U-48, including the radio operator, expressing their shock and regret once the facts became known.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack started being {{composed}} before production {{had even}} begun, {{and is a}} notable departure from the band's previous works, as Daft Punk put more emphasis on orchestral elements rather than relying solely on synthesizers. [...] "Synths are a very low level of artificial intelligence," [...] explained member Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, [...] "whereas you have a Stradivarius that will live for a thousand years. We knew {{from the start that}} there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> {{we were going to do}} this film score with two synthesizers and a drum machine." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the first}} film was commended for leaving the shark to the {{imagination}} until {{two thirds of the}} way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because the dramatic [...] "first image of it coming out of the water" [...] in {{the first film}} could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's Hitchcockian suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.|$|E
500|$|The court {{considered}} that Thomas had been regularly informed by {{all those who}} had interrogated him that {{the degree to which}} he cooperated would determine what happened to him, and that given their position as authority figures, Thomas would have readily perceived that they had the ability to change his situation; indeed, none of the interviewers had done anything to dispel the idea that {{they would be able to}} help Thomas. The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family. Particularly, after Thomas expressed happiness at seeing the photographs, one of the interviewers took them away, saying [...] " [...] might give you another look at that later", comments which were [...] "calculated, if not intended, to remind the applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does my head in every time I see it." ...|$|E

2500|$|William Langewiesche, an {{aviation}} journalist, said: [...] "n {{the case of}} the Egyptians, they were following a completely different line of thinking. It seemed to me that they knew very well that their man, Batouti, had done this. They were pursuing a political agenda that was driven by the need to answer to their higher-ups in a very pyramidal, autocratic political structure. The word had been passed down from on high, probably from Mubarak himself, that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> Batouti, the co-pilot, could have done this. For the accident investigators in Egypt, the game then became not pursuing the truth but backing the official line." ...|$|E

D'Amico stated [...] "'Falling Down' is like the epitome of 40 Below Summer. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> it wasn't {{going to make the}} album. 'Jonesin' is a sick twisted tale that we just wanted to tell. It's a true story. 'Sideshow' is like the anthem. It always gets the crowd going. 'Rejection'… I don't know. It's just a pretty heavy song so it made it." [...] The song [...] "Power Tool" [...] was one of the earliest pieces of music written by the band.

[...] "And there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> I could ever change {{the way that we}} started last season where I came into the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time. It was a really emotional thing and it wasn't something that we could really explore a whole lot of. So, I think it was a hard place for people to accept as I came in. I wasn't bubbly and happy. You know?" [...] Quinn is introduced in season 7 when she moves back to Tree Hill after her marriage breaks down.|$|E
2500|$|Sprites {{are very}} much like elves, but they have wings and green skin. Most males are flirts, who {{believe that they are}} 'God's gift to women'. Their {{favorite}} pastime is flying and some have been recorded to try to fly to the moon, but it is doubtful that they succeeded. They have limited healing abilities, in book 2 it was said [...] "Sprites can magic away a wart, but gaping wounds are beyond them.". They also possess the gift of tongues. Injuring the wings of a sprite can be potentially fatal, as the sprites main blood vessels are located there. [...] Sprites have the fastest reflexes of any type of fairy, as mentioned in book 2 [...] "Even if Foaly had the reaction of a sprite, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> he could draw up all of his hooves before the plasma shock blasted him right out of his specially modified swivel chair". There is a type of sprite called the water sprite which has batlike wings. A notable sprite is Chix Verbil, a flirtatious, nervous character, who was present in the Fowl Manor siege, was injured by the goblins in book 2, and also allowed Mulch access to his starter chip in book 4. Another famous sprite is Unix, Turnball Root's right-hand fairy. Unix had his wings removed in a fight with a troll.|$|E

He said [...] "It's an ongoing message we're trying to put out that the internet can be a dangerous place. Silas could be grooming up to 200 girls, waiting for just one to let down their guard - and that's where Jenny comes in." [...] Jenny realises that Silas is not a [...] "harmless pensioner" [...] after she looks through his bag, which contains a rope, a knife and some gloves.
