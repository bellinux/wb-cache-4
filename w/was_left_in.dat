5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over the Catholic Church in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|Another Yorkist {{army was}} {{dispatched}} north in November under the joint {{command of the}} earls of Warwick and Worcester, and Sir Ralph Grey. They besieged the castle, which surrendered that Christmas. Percy <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> charge of Dunstanburgh as part of Edward IV's attempts at reconciliation, but the next year he once again switched sides, returning the castle to the Lancastrians. Percy died at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor in 1464, and the Earl of Warwick reoccupied the castle that June following a short siege.|$|E
5|$|Barbette {{continued}} to perform until the mid-to-late 1930s. Most sources report {{the year as}} 1938, while others as early as 1936 and as late as 1942. The end of Barbette's performing career is attributed {{to a number of}} causes including a fall, pneumonia, polio, or some combination of the three. All generally agree that whatever the cause, Barbette <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> extreme pain and in need of surgery and extensive rehabilitation to allow him to walk again.|$|E

5|$|During {{most of his}} {{own life}} {{conservationism}} wasn't yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views—except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the industrialized world.|$|E
5|$|During the 20s, Sejanus {{gradually}} accumulated {{power by}} consolidating his influence over Tiberius and eliminating potential political opponents, including the emperor's son Drusus Julius Caesar. When Tiberius withdrew to Capri in AD 26, Sejanus <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> {{control of the}} administration of the empire. For a time the most influential and feared citizen of Rome, Sejanus suddenly fell from power in AD 31, the year his career culminated with the consulship. Amidst suspicions of conspiracy against Tiberius, Sejanus was arrested and executed, along with his followers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 640s, the Irish monk Fursey, having {{spent a year}} as a hermit, left East Anglia for Gaul. His monastery at Cnobheresburg (identified by some with Burgh Castle) <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the hands of his half-brother, Foillan. In 651, shortly after his departure, the heathen threat he had {{foreseen}} became a reality, when Foillan and his community were driven out by Penda's forces and Anna, who encountered Penda at Cnobheresburg, was exiled.|$|E

5|$|Following Michael VIII Palaiologos' reconquest of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantine Empire <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> a grave position. There {{was plenty}} of talk among the Latin states of the Greek {{mainland}} and other regions of retaking Constantinople for the Latin Empire whilst to the north the main threat came from Serbian expansion into the Balkans by king Stefan Uroš I. What was once a strong frontier under the Komnenian dynasty at the Danube river now threatened Constantinople itself.|$|E
5|$|Following Walt Disney's passing, Wolfgang Reitherman {{continued}} as both producer {{and director of}} the features. The studio began the 1970s with the release of The Aristocats, the last film project to be approved by Walt Disney. In 1971, Roy O. Disney, the studio co-founder, died and Walt Disney Productions <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the hands of Donn Tatum and Card Walker, who alternated as chairman and CEO in overlapping terms {{for the rest of the}} decade. The next feature, Robin Hood (1973), was produced with a significantly reduced budget and animation repurposed from previous features. Both The Aristocats and Robin Hood were minor box office and critical successes.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{complicated}} marital {{situation and}} his high-handed {{dissolution of the}} monasteries angered the Pope and Catholic rulers throughout Europe, which increased England's diplomatic isolation. In 1544 Henry had agreed to attack France together with Emperor CharlesV, and English forces captured Boulogne at great cost in September, but soon England <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the lurch after Charles had achieved his objectives and brokered a separate peace.|$|E

In early 1911, Justice and Vérité were used with {{success in the}} Navy's {{experiments}} with wireless telegraphy. Later that year, in September, Liberté was destroyed by a huge explosion in her forward propellant magazines. Several nearby warships were damaged by debris, including the battleship République. The explosion aboard Liberté killed some 250 officers and men. The wreck <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> Toulon until 1925, when it was raised and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, MDSHA {{discovered}} the bridge's rarity while conducting a bridge inventory. The inventory also found premature deterioration of its supports due to galvanic corrosion involving the steel bearing pads and aluminum girder structure. Because repairing the structure {{would have been}} extremely difficult, MDSHA decided to build a replacement bridge immediately {{to the west of}} the aluminum bridge; the new bridge opened in 2004 along with a slight relocation in MD32 on both sides of the bridge. The aluminum bridge was added to the state's Historic Bridge Registry and <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> place as a historic landmark after MD32's new bridge over the Patapsco River opened.|$|E
5|$|Like other Spanish liberals, Goya <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> a {{difficult}} position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.|$|E

5|$|London {{was also}} full of black powder, {{especially}} {{along the river}} front. Much of it <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the homes of private citizens {{from the days of}} the English Civil War, as the former members of Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army still retained their muskets and the powder with which to load them. Five to six hundred tons of powder was stored in the Tower of London. The ship chandlers along the wharves also held large stocks, stored in wooden barrels.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{opponents of the}} Bedell plan had a very {{different}} view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill {{was an example of}} the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251-174.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Japanese pilots {{returned}} {{with tales of}} a stunning victory. It was reported that practically the whole U.S. Third Fleet had been sunk and that the American carrier force <b>was</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> shambles. Though {{some members of the}} IJN command were initially skeptical of such reports, this narrative was carried forward by members of the cabinet until it reached Emperor Hirohito. He congratulated the Navy and Army for their success. Newspapers in particular trumpeted these claims, repeating adnauseam that the U.S. task force was broken and in retreat. Even those unconvinced members of the IJN, up to and including Toyoda, believed some kind of victory had been achieved off Formosa.|$|E
