25|$|The {{confusion}} over {{the origins of}} the name led over the years to variant spellings such as Kaatskill and Kaaterskill, both of which are also still used: the former in the regional magazine Kaatskill Life, the latter as the name of a mountain peak and a waterfall. The supposed Indian name for the range, Onteora ("land in the sky"), was actually created by a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the mid-19th century to drum up business for a resort. It, too, persists today as the name of a school district and as the name of a Boy Scout summer camp (Onteora Scout Reservation).|$|E

Range had led in {{the primary}} for {{a seat on the}} commission in the 1965 election, but lost to a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> the run-off by a small margin after her race was made an issue in the election. Range was the first black person to serve on the Miami City Commission. She twice won reelection on her own. Later she was the first black person appointed to head a Florida state agency.|$|E
50|$|Betty Jean Owens is an African American {{woman who}} was brutally raped by four <b>white</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> Tallahassee, Florida in 1959.

This severe of a sentencing had not occurred for <b>white</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the South accused of raping black women previous to Owens' case. For example, {{in the case of}} Recy Taylor, who was gang raped by six <b>white</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> Alabama, the <b>men</b> were never found guilty of any charges and released from jail with minimal fines.|$|R

25|$|In 2000, a {{young man}} accosted Romalis in the medical {{building}} where he works and stabbed him. The doctor was not seriously injured. The criminal was not identified. Several witnesses had seen the attacker waiting for some time before Romalis arrived and even used a restroom in a pharmacy that opens onto the lobby. They described him as a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> his 20s or 30s wearing a dark grey or black sweatsuit with a hood. When Romalis arrived, the attacker stabbed {{him in the back}} of the lower left ribcage. The man escaped through the parking lot of the building. A parking valet, Jesse Brouwer, chased the attacker for more than a block without success. News reports stated that about an hour before the stabbing, police were called to another clinic, Everywoman's Health Centre because of aggressive anti-abortion protesters on the lawn of the house next door. Three white men, two of whom had not been there before, were trying to intimidate women entering the clinic. The staff became so concerned about the level of intimidation that they called police. After police talked to them, the three men left about noon. Romalis was stabbed just before 1 p.m.|$|E
500|$|As Obama {{lived in}} Hyde Park, a more {{affluent}} neighborhood {{with a higher}} percentage of White voters {{than the rest of the}} district, the narrative of the race became [...] "the Black Panther against the professor" [...] Obama frequently came off as uptight. Rush criticized Obama: [...] "Barack Obama went to Harvard and became an educated fool. We’re not impressed with these folks with these Eastern elite degrees. Barack is a person who read about the civil-rights protests and thinks he knows all about it." [...] Trotter said, [...] "Barack is viewed in part to be the <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> blackface in our community." [...] Though the Chicago Tribune endorsed Obama, many, including local officials, President Bill Clinton, and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic Party nominee for President, endorsed Rush.|$|E
500|$|Mob {{violence}} was prevalent in Kentucky during Brown's tenure as governor. From 1892 to 1895, there were fifty-six lynchings in the state. During one notable incident, a Cincinnati judge refused to extradite {{a black man}} suspected of shooting a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky. The judge's decision was based on his opinion that the accused {{was likely to be}} the victim of mob violence if returned to Kentucky. In disputing the judge's decision, Governor Brown attempted to justify some of the violence that had occurred in the state's past, declaring [...] "It is much to be regretted that we have occasionally had mob violence in this Commonwealth, but it has always been when the passions of the people have been inflamed by the commission of the most atrocious crimes." ...|$|E

It contained a fictionalisation of actual events on the frontier. One of the stories {{in the book is}} that of Roland Grantley, a pastoral property owner, and his overseer [...] "Darkie", also a <b>white</b> <b>man.</b> <b>In</b> this account, Grantley and Darkie shoot a group of Aboriginal people in response to attacks on shepherds and the killing of stock. The story says that 10–12 Aboriginal people were killed in the massacre, and many more wounded. The bodies are burnt. The police investigate, and Darkie, not wanting to implicate his employer, flees the district on Grantley's prize horse, using his bush skills to elude his pursuers. He swims the horse across the mouth of the Murray River, then finds passage on a whaling ship off Kangaroo Island. This account, while using fictional names, essentially retold basic known facts of the case against Brown.|$|E
500|$|The defense {{sought to}} {{cast doubt on}} the {{identity}} of the body pulled from the river. They said it could not be positively identified, and they questioned whether Till was dead at all. The defense also asserted that although Bryant and Milam had taken Till from his great-uncle's house, they had released him that night. The defense attorneys attempted to prove that Mose Wright—who was addressed as [...] "Uncle Mose" [...] by the prosecution and [...] "Mose" [...] by the defense—could not identify Bryant and Milam as the men who took Till from his cabin. They noted that only Milam's flashlight had been in use that night, and no other lights in the house were turned on. Milam and Bryant had identified themselves to Wright the evening they took Till, Wright said he had only seen Milam clearly. Wright's testimony was considered remarkably courageous. It may have been {{the first time in the}} South that a black man had testified to the guilt of a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> court -- and lived.|$|E
500|$|Their {{action was}} {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference on 29 April 1963. The following day they claimed that none of the city's West Indians were using the buses and that many white people supported them. In an editorial, the Bristol Evening Post pointed out that the TGWU opposed apartheid in South Africa and asked what trade union leaders were doing to counteract racism in their own ranks. When reporters questioned the bus company about the boycott, the general manager, Ian Patey, said: [...] "The advent of coloured crews would mean a gradual falling off of white staff. It is true that London Transport employ a large coloured staff. They even have recruiting offices in Jamaica and they subsidise the fares to Britain of their new coloured employees. As a result of this, the amount of white labour dwindles steadily on the London Underground. You won't get a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> London to admit it, but which of them will join a service where they may find themselves working under a coloured foreman? ... I understand that in London, coloured men have become arrogant and rude, after they have been employed for some months." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the film lead Koreyoshi Kurahara and Nobuo Yamada to write and direct a couple more {{original}} scripts, where Kurahara was primarily known for his adaptations of novels. This included the follow-up Black Sun (1964) which again featured Tamio Kawachi, who reprised his role from The Warped Ones, as did several of the other actors, {{and a lot of}} jazz music. In it, Kawachi's Akira shelters a black G.I., Gil, played by Chico Rolands, who goes A.W.O.L. after killing a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> a bar fight. The film explores the two men's friendship and race relations. It was also the first reversal on rashamen-themed films, post-war, often American-Japanese co-productions focusing on friendships or romances between a Japanese and an American. Rashamen films were intended as to promote goodwill between the two nations but were generally less well received in Japan, seen as unrealistic or patronizing. Film historian Tadao Sato described Black Sun as the first film of this sort where Japanese pity Americans instead of the reverse as Akira's preconceptions of black Americans are undone. Mark Schilling characterized Kawachi as bringing an [...] "explosive energy" [...] to the film and Roland a [...] "piping screech of fear and desperation." [...] Acclaimed American jazz musician Max Roach contributed to the score.|$|E
500|$|... "Coming Home" [...] is a downtempo {{hip-hop and}} pop song, that {{opens with a}} [...] "simple piano intro" [...] and a [...] "delicate vocal verse from Skylar Grey". It was written by Diddy, Skylar Grey, Jay-Z, J. Cole, and Alex [...] "da Kid" [...] Grant, and {{produced}} by Jay-Z and Grant. When speaking to Kid about what he wanted, Diddy said, [...] "I want a beat {{that makes me feel}} like a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> a basement in Atlanta". Diddy later called [...] "Coming Home" [...] a gift from Jay-Z and Kid. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by EMI Music Publishing, the song was written in the key of D major with a time signature of common time and a tempo of 69 beats per minute. It follows the basic chord progression of GDBmFm. [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV noted that the concept and theme of the song were similar to events in Diddy's life, [...] "referencing mistakes he has made in the past and that he wants to put behind him." [...] Rodriguez also noted the song's tribute to The Notorious B.I.G, in the line [...] "I miss you, B.I.G." [...] The chorus features vocals from the group's female members, Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richard, as well as background vocals from fellow Bad Boy Records recording artist Cassie. The trio use a vocal range of A3A4. Grey also sings some of the vocals, predominately during the song's opening chorus.|$|E
