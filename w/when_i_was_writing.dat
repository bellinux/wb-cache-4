Bannon has said she knows {{the concerns of the}} women who are uncomfortable with the themes of her books: [...] "I can understand that; they weren't there. To them some of it looks negative and some of it looks depressing. Although I didn't feel that way. I always felt excited <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> them." ...|$|E

500|$|Jam and Lewis {{also asked}} the boy band 98 Degrees to join Carey and Joe on the track, as they wanted male harmonies. Carey talked about the {{collaboration}} {{in an interview with}} MTV. [...] "It's like <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> 'One Sweet Day'. It really cried out for a group to be singing with me and for a strong male-female thing in terms of going back and forth, vocally. So you know, we just naturally came together." [...] The vocals were recorded at Capri Digital Studios, Capri, Italy and Avatar Studios, New York City. The track was mixed by Supa Engineer Duo at Right Track Recording and mastered by Herb Powers.|$|E

I've done lot of soul searching and I just felt in a romantic mood <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> for [...] so that's what I wrote about... I decided that I {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E

I was picturing one of his movies, {{and one of the}} female characters. I have a whole thing worked out. All Quentin has to do is show up with a camera. I can't afford a director's fee." [...] However, when asked about the video, Tarantino said, [...] "I don't know. I've been asked to direct commercials and music videos, Madonna and Jay-Z wanted me to direct their videos, but I refused. I'm not interested, just as I'm not interested in commercials. If it's not to make movies, I don't want to be on set." ...|$|E

5000|$|The establishment’s {{assessment}} of Dhasal’s political, {{as opposed to}} his artistic achievements may differ drastically, but for the writer they are inextricably linked. In an interview in 1982 {{he said that if}} the aim of social struggles was the removal of unhappiness, then poetry was necessary because it expressed that happiness vividly and powerfully. Later he stated, [...] "Poetry is politics." [...] Dhasal adheres to this principle in his private life. He told the photographer Henning Stegmüller, [...] "I enjoy discovering myself. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> happy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> a poem, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> happy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> leading a protest of prostitutes fighting for their rights." ...|$|R

500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{with his}} female fans in mind, and later stated {{that when he}} wrote the song, {{he knew it would}} be a success: [...] "A {{musician}} knows hit material. Everything has to feel in place. It fulfills you and it makes you feel good. That's how I felt about 'Billie Jean'. I {{knew it was going to}} be big <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> it." [...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E

She stated that there were seven major cast members in the series, whom she {{referred}} to as The Big Seven, and she named Lynch as one of the seven members, along with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felton, Matthew Lewis, and Bonnie Wright. Rowling has said that, of all the actors in the film series, Lynch has had the most influence on how her character was subsequently written. In 2012, she told Charlie Rose that when composing the final books, [...] "I saw her. [...] got in my head. I even heard her voice <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> Luna." ...|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Bono was {{influenced}} by the work of Delmore Schwartz when writing the lyrics of [...] "Acrobat", to whom the song is dedicated. The title of one of his short stories, In Dreams Begin Responsibilities, is quoted in the final verse. Bono noted the book [...] "was on my mind <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> the words... It's hard to wrap the book up in a few lines, but Delmore Schwartz is kind of a formalist... I'm the opposite. I'm in the mud as a writer, so I could do with a bit of , and that's why I enjoy him." [...] The song was developed from a riff guitarist The Edge developed during a soundcheck in Auckland, New Zealand, on the Lovetown Tour in 1989. He noted that the beat is unusual for a U2 song, saying it [...] "was the jumping off point, to try and do something with an unusual beat." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Japanese {{lexicographer}} Tom Gally (1999) {{analyzes the}} Daijisen,This dictionary seems {{in many ways}} a clone of Daijirin. Not only is the same Tokyo University professor listed as editor - though {{it is important to note}} that the names appearing on the covers of Japanese dictionaries often have little relation to the people who actually did the work; one case in point being Koujien, even the most recent editions of which list as editor one 新村出 Shinmura Izuru, who has been dead since 1967 - but the definitions in Daijisen follow closely those of Daijirin as well. It also follows Daijirins practice of putting the contemporary meanings first in its definitions. The two chief differences Ive noticed are that Daijisen has color pictures while Daijirin uses line drawings - a rather obvious difference - and that the example sentences and phrases in Daijisen are more often typical of the contemporary language rather than citations from classical literature. This latter point makes Daijisen my first choice <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> Japanese and <b>I</b> want to check how words are used in context.|$|R
500|$|... "PRAY" [...] {{was written}} by Omar Martinez and Adam Messinger and Nasri Atweh of The Messengers. While Bieber was being interviewed by Ryan Seacrest on his radio show, Bieber talked about the songs initial writing stating the song was {{influenced}} by Michael Jackson, Bieber elaborated, [...] "It's a very uplifting song, very motivational. It definitely comes from the heart. It's very beautiful. I definitely thought of Michael [...] 'Man in the Mirror' <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> it." [...] The song was released as a CD single in Germany on December 3, 2010. [...] "Pray" [...] is a mid-tempo song that uses a [...] "world-music beat" [...] as a backing. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Group, [...] "Pray" [...] is set in common time with a tempo of 80 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major with Bieber's vocal range spanning from the low-note of F3 to the high-note of B4. The song follows in the chord progression of B/GB/FEB.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole and was produced by Lifehouse and Jude Cole at Ironworks Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with The San Bernardino Sun, Wade talked about making songs on the album and said, [...] "This time around it was not about having any preconceived notions. It was about letting the tape machine roll and getting the music down spontaneously." [...] When asked about {{the message of the}} song, Wade said, [...] "I think the main message of this song, at least for me personally <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> the lyrics, is just how difficult it can be to be in a relationship. Sometimes, you do things to disappoint the other person. Letting someone down and trying to repair a relationship that you feel is kind of slipping through your hands a bit." [...] "Whatever It Takes" [...] was originally released with the band's fourth studio album, Who We Are, on June 18, 2007 and was officially solicited as a single to mainstream radio on November 13, 2007.|$|E
500|$|During {{a writing}} session at McCartney's house in north London, Lennon and McCartney {{fine-tuned}} the lyrics, using {{an approach that}} author Howard Sounes likens to the cut-up technique popularised by William Burroughs. [...] "I didn't copy the accident," [...] Lennon said. [...] "Tara didn't blow his mind out, {{but it was in}} my mind <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> that verse. The details of the accident in the song—not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene—were similarly part of the fiction." [...] McCartney expounded on the subject: [...] "The verse about the politician blowing his mind out in a car we wrote together. It has been attributed to Tara Browne, the Guinness heir, which I don't believe is the case, certainly as we were writing it, I was not attributing it to Tara in my head. In John's head it might have been. In my head I was imagining a politician bombed out on drugs who'd stopped at some traffic lights and didn't notice that the lights had changed. The 'blew his mind' was purely a drugs reference, nothing to do with a car crash." ...|$|E

Look it over again, and examine into the motives, the seeds, from which any one sentence sprung--I have not the slightest feel of humility towards the public--or to anything in existence,--but the eternal Being, the Principle of Beauty, and the Memory of great Men. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> for myself for the mere sake of the moment's enjoyment, perhaps nature has its course with me--but a Preface <b>is</b> <b>written</b> to the Public; a thing I cannot help looking upon as an Enemy, and which I cannot address without feelings of Hostility.

500|$|Bill Janovitz of Allmusic {{describes}} the music as beautiful, with folk guitar chord changes and a somber melody, while the chorus, with its line [...] "and it's all over now, Baby Blue" [...] has a heartbreaking quality to it. Like other Dylan {{songs of the}} period, such as [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the lyrics of [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] bear the strong influence of Symbolist poets such as Arthur Rimbaud. Lines such as [...] "take what you have gathered from coincidence" [...] reflect the I Ching philosophy that coincidence represents more than mere chance. The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, with not a snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song. It had always been one of my favorites, Baby Blue... 'When first I met my baby/she said how do you do/she looked into my eyes and said/my name is Baby Blue.' [...] It was one of the songs I used to sing back in high school. Of course, I was singing about a different Baby Blue." ...|$|E
500|$|Although xx {{had been}} highly {{anticipated}} by XL, the album's success exceeded expectations in the press. McDonald said their direction and sound {{would have been}} entirely different had expectations been higher. Croft was [...] "baffled" [...] by the acclaim given to what she viewed as an album they had made [...] "for themselves". Sim had mixed feelings about its success and believed it could affect his songwriting in the future: [...] "This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so many people will. I might feel I {{have to be a}} bit more private." [...] At the Mercury Prize ceremony, he said the time since its release has [...] "felt like a haze", but that the event serves as [...] "a moment of clarity". In their acceptance speech, the band announced they would use the £20,000 prize money to build their own studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album Coexist. When Coexist debuted in September 2012, xx was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on NMEs list of the top 500 albums of all time and named the 74th greatest debut record by Rolling Stone, who found its music radical as [...] "an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence" [...] during popular music's period of maximalism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the song came when Thomas visited Allen Toussaint's parents' house in New Orleans. Sat at the piano Toussaint {{composed}} many of his early songs. Toussaint later stated [...] "I remember <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> 'It's Raining,' she was sitting right there, and it began raining outside," [...] he said. [...] "I just wrote that song then and handed it {{over to her and}} sung a little bit of it, just to show her the melody, and it fit like a gown." [...] Toussaint captured solitude that remains possible in a depths of a rain sodden night.|$|E

5000|$|I {{had tried}} to cast Lance Henriksen on The X-Files several times, {{he had always been}} either {{unavailable}} or uninterested. Anyway I remained a fan of his, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in bed working in Vancouver and <b>I</b> realized he <b>was</b> working there too. So I found out where he <b>was</b> staying and <b>wrote</b> a personal note, had a fan slip it under his door, and said that I'd tried to get him on the show and hoped to work with him in the future.

I always planned that these kinds of things would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels at the time I was writing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, she {{formed a}} folk rock band named The Breeders with her sister. She {{then became a}} {{prolific}} songwriter, as she {{found it easier to}} write songs than cover them. Deal later commented on her songwriting output: [...] "I got like a hundred songs when I was like 16, 17 ... The music is pretty good, but the lyrics are just like, OH MY GOD. We were just {{trying to figure out how}} blue rhymes with you. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> them, they didn't have anything to do with who I was." [...] The Deals bought microphones, an eight-track tape recorder, a mixer, speakers, and amps for a bedroom studio. According to Kelley, they [...] "had the whole thing set up by the time we were 17". They later bought a drum machine [...] "so it would feel like we were more in a band".|$|E

The New Progressives toured the UK, American and Australia to promote the record, with guest appearances from other musicians where possible. [...] "You aren't supposed {{to have all the}} answers when you're 15 - that's not what life is like. Life, to me, is about growth, it's about where we begin and who we become, and to that end I think my music is very true to me, and to the mood that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> it. I'm not the most popular artist in the world, but I sing about real things, about issues that people, quite understandably, don't want to deal with.

But <b>I</b> think that <b>is</b> why <b>I</b> keep my fans without doing lots of publicity and promotion, because I sing about things that, if you get it, make a connection.
