The exorcists' main weapon against the Noah Family are sentient holy artifacts called Innocence. Innocence comes {{in a variety of}} forms, varying from everyday objects such as boots to grandfather clocks, to weapons such as swords and guns; regardless of their form, each Innocence possesses unique offensive and supportive abilities and will only work for the wielder of their choosing. Out of the 109 Innocence hidden and scattered throughout the world, {{one of them is the}} master Innocence; whichever side obtains this Innocence first <b>will</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> war. In contrast to the Innocence, the Noah Family's weapons are derived from a power source known as Dark Matter. Dark Matter, grants the Noah superpowers, along with the ability to create and control demons.|$|E

25|$|An {{intuitive}} {{explanation is}} that, if the contestant initially picks a goat (2 of 3 doors), the contestant <b>will</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> car by switching {{because the other}} goat {{can no longer be}} picked, whereas if the contestant initially picks the car (1 of 3 doors), the contestant will not win the car by switching (Carlton 2005, concluding remarks). The fact that the host subsequently reveals a goat in one of the unchosen doors changes nothing about the initial probability.|$|E
25|$|Repeated plays {{also make}} it clearer why {{switching}} is the better strategy. After the player picks his card, it is already determined whether switching <b>will</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> round for the player. If this is not convincing, the simulation {{can be done with}} the entire deck. (Gardner 1959b; Adams 1990). In this variant, the car card goes to the host 51 times out of 52, and stays with the host no matter how many non-car cards are discarded.|$|E

25|$|Big Brother is a {{television}} reality game show {{based on an}} originally Dutch TV series {{of the same name}} created by producer John de Mol in 1997. The series follows a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, who are living together in a custom-built home under constant surveillance. The HouseGuests are completely isolated from the outside world and can have no communication with those not in the house. The contestants are competing for a $500,000 grand prize, with weekly competitions and evictions determining who <b>will</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> show. The series takes its name from the character in George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984). The series launched on July 5, 2000 to a successful start, though ratings and critical reaction continued to grow increasingly negative. This led to the second season being a revamp of the show, featuring a more competition-based challenge. The series has since continued to be a hit for CBS, and is the second longest-running adaptation of the series to date, after the Spanish adaptation.|$|E
25|$|Students {{from each}} house enter into annual {{competitions}} in sport, music and drama versus the other houses, where pupils represent their house. Examples {{of these are}} the house netball, house football, house rugby, house lacrosse, house hockey, house tennis, house rounders, house dance, house choir, house instrumental, and many others. There are also house plays which are written by year 12 students (aged 16 and 17) and performed by year 10 students (aged 14 and 15). The winning house in each competition is awarded {{a certain number of}} points, which are accrued during the academic year. The house with the most points {{at the end of the}} year <b>will</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> House Championship. Junior/Senior House Colour Awards, in the form of ties, are awarded at the end of Years 10 and/or 12 to students who excel in a certain field, either academic or extracurricular. The ties are distinct from the normal school tie, consisting solely of the colour of the wearer's house. Girls were once given sashes instead of ties but this practice fell out of favour with the students and so they were awarded ties just as their peers were.|$|E
