5|$|On December 13, 2012, Holtz {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} become the head coach for the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs. His first season, 2013, was a down year, as he finished well below expectations at 4–8. However, 2014 <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> big turnaround. Holtz's Bulldogs went on to finish first in C-USA West at 9–5 with a 35–18 win over Illinois in the Heart Of Dallas Bowl. In 2015, the Bulldogs continued their success finishing 9–4 and winning the New Orleans Bowl over Arkansas State, 47–28.|$|E
5|$|Toy Story {{has spawned}} three sequels: Toy Story 2 (1999), Toy Story 3 (2010), and Toy Story 4, to be {{released}} in 2019. Initially, the first sequel to Toy Story {{was going to be a}} direct-to-video release, with development beginning in 1996. However, after the cast from Toy Story returned and the story was considered to be better than that of a direct-to-video release, it was announced in 1998 that the sequel <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> theatrical release.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for these new requirements, Fort Lewis began to receive new corps support units which {{were coming out}} of Europe. One of these was the 7th Engineer Brigade which was inactivated on 16 January 1992 and immediately reactivated as the 555th Engineer Group. On 16 February 1992 the 210th Field Artillery Brigade, also from Europe, was activated. In 1997, the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade moved to Fort Bliss, Texas, to join other air defense brigades. The corps and Fort Lewis <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> reshuffling of units {{in and out of the}} area through 2000. Plans were drawn up for emergency operations for I Corps should a major conflict emerge in the Pacific region. Plans exist for I Corps to rapidly deploy in defense of Japan or South Korea.|$|E
5|$|One {{scene that}} von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence {{depicted}} a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is {{too embarrassed to}} examine the teeth {{of a young woman}} and Potter has to take over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was used instead.|$|E
5|$|After {{narrowly}} surviving {{a vote of}} {{no confidence}} by 17 votes to 14 {{at a meeting of}} the party's Executive Committee in Glasgow on 16 May 2015, Murphy announced that he would step down as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in June. Stating that he wanted to have a successor in place by the summer, he confirmed that he would no longer be standing for a seat in the Scottish Parliament. Before relinquishing the leadership role, Murphy drew up proposals for a number of party reforms, including the adoption of a one-member, one-vote ballot for future leadership contests. His resignation took effect on 13 June after his reforms had been provisionally accepted by Labour's executive committee. A timetable was also set out that <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> new leader elected on 15 August, while Gray was appointed as acting leader. Dugdale and Macintosh stood in the contest to choose Murphy's successor; Dugdale was subsequently elected as Scottish Labour's new leader with a 72% share of the vote. At the same time, Rowley became her deputy.|$|E

5|$|This is a {{relatively}} peaceful event, nothing akin to a supernova, which the Sun {{is too small to}} undergo as part of its evolution. Any observer present to witness this occurrence <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> massive increase in the speed of the solar wind, but not enough to destroy a planet completely. However, the star's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos, causing some to collide, others to be ejected from the Solar System, and still others to be torn apart by tidal interactions. Afterwards, all that will remain of the Sun is a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, 54% its original mass but only the size of the Earth. Initially, this white dwarf may be 100times as luminous as the Sun is now. It will consist entirely of degenerate carbon and oxygen, but will never reach temperatures hot enough to fuse these elements. Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool, growing dimmer and dimmer.|$|E
25|$|Although Unruh's {{prediction}} that an accelerating detector <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> thermal bath is not controversial, {{the interpretation of}} the transitions in the detector in the non-accelerating frame is. It is widely, although not universally, believed that each transition in the detector is accompanied by the emission of a particle, and that this particle will propagate to infinity and be seen as Unruh radiation.|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s {{there was}} a concern that Mysen and Eidsberg <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{shrinking}} population.

This led to a major change in the traffic pattern on the Eastern Østfold Line. Mysen became the end of train services, with the extensions to Sarpsborg closed down in 1986. At the same time NSB made more intensive its commuter service.|$|E

The reforms commenced during early 2009, in which air armies were succeeded by commands, and most air regiments becoming airbases.
