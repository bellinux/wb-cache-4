We’ve grown, and we’ve gotten to a size where we don’t just do educational programs, we do a lot more outreach and a lot more policy and working with other organizations. I also believe the libertarian movement has changed. It’s become less influenced by Rothbard, less influenced by the anarchist, crazy {{for lack of a better}} word, wing of libertarianism. As a consequence, because we’re bigger and doing more things and because libertarianism has become more reasonable, we are doing more work with them than <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> But I don’t think ideologically anything of substance has changed at the Institute.|$|E

The aliens soon supply Earth with cheap unlimited power, boundless supplies of food, and a device that disables all modern armies by suppressing all explosions, and they begin work on drugs for prolonging life. As a further token of friendship, they allow humans to visit their home planet via ten-year [...] "exchange groups".|$|E

At much, much, higher altitudes than many orbital ones maintained by satellites, altitude begins to become a larger and larger factor and speed a lesser one. At lower altitudes, due to the high speed required to remain in orbit, air friction is a very important consideration affecting satellites, much more than in the popular image of space. At even lower altitudes, balloons, with no forward velocity, can serve many of the roles satellites play.|$|E

A relatively unremarkable closing to HIMSA's gi-normously dramatic career, {{there appears to be no}} acrimony or unpleasantness, simply the end of a blistering, phenomenal, tumultuous era of the metal that HIMSA permeated into the modern musical landscape.

50|$|The {{following}} is a quote from the Jacksonville Historical Commission from an unknown member of the parish, possibly the pastor, and thought to be written during the 1960s, during {{the beginning of the}} parish's decline:"The Parish Church with Rectory and small Hall (converted house) are located at the corner of Edison Avenue and Crystal Street on a piece of property donated by the Clark family, formerly of the Parish, about 300' by 215' or approximately 1.5 acres. There are only about five or six families who live within blocks, in fact miles, of the church which is in the most deteriorated and unsafe part of the Parish. There are a few blacks in the vicinity who come occasionally but attend mostly St. Pius church, for the blacks, run by Josephine Fathers. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two or three years had several incidents on the property itself in the way of shooting, mugging, stealing and damaging of property as well as considerable harrassment sic by unfriendly neighbors, many of them on the mug lists.

We have no liturgical functions here at night for no one would dare attend. We ourselves are in constant danger."During the latter half of the 20th century, the area declined economically, crime increased, and parish membership began to decrease accordingly.|$|E

Now we extend the debate to social issues. However, corporate social responsibility tends to be much more controversial than improving environmental performance. Social responsibility requires us to look at ethics, stakeholder accountability and our own value systems. There will often be contradictory positions taken on some social issues and stakeholders will not always agree with each other. One starting point that seems productive however is to see corporate social responsibility in the context of human rights.

In this paper, we present a preliminary design, based around a micronet core, of an asynchronous Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) architecture. A TRANSLATOR module converts the CISC instructions into ones which are native to the micronet datapath, called the milliops instructions. This translation can be accomplished either in hardware, as in Intel's x 86 architectures, or in software, {{in the style of}} Transmeta's Crusoe architecture. The design environment enables C programs targeted at the CISC architecture, to be executed on a RTL model of the micronet core, and its execution and power consumption can be visualised over space and time. This allows a systematic study of the effect of compiler and architectural optimisations of micronet-based CISC processors, on the performance of application benchmarks...|$|E

40|$|Extract] Biodiversity {{is being}} lost at an ever {{increasing}} rate (Butchart et al., 2010), {{leading to the}} degradation of ecosystems services to levels that threaten human well-being. There are significant global efforts to address this situation: spending on conservation in 2006 by major international organizations and non-governmental organizations was, for example, estimated to reach $ 2 billion per annum (Halpern et al., 2006), a level that has likely to have increased since that study was published. Yet, this is {{a drop in the}} ocean as compared to the requirement of over $ 76 billion per annum to protect threaten species and the sites they occupy (McCarthy et al., 2012). Given that we cannot continue to unsustainably use natural resources as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2003), better ways of protecting biodiversity have to be found, and quickly. In particular, there is clear consensus that better informed decisions are urgently needed about what needs to be conserved; where, how and why. The answer to all of these questions requires evidence; science is the source of much of that evidence...|$|E

This research project is still in progress, but an important early stage has been a theoretical analysis, based on the Cognitive Dimensions of notations (CDs) framework, that has provided guidance regarding what kinds of programming might be feasible using such an interface. This is a novel use of the CDs framework, insofar as it does not aim to evaluate a specific kind of interface, but rather investigates what kinds of interface we might imagine making. We believe this to be a valuable perspective for the design of non-WIMP interfaces and other ubiquitous computing innovations. 1...|$|E
