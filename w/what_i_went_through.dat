500|$|According to Aguilera herself, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] {{talks about}} her abusive childhood. She revealed, [...] "I think going through <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> {{at a young age}} [...] the abuse that went on in my {{household}} [...] did affect me a lot. Domestic violence is a topic that is very hush-hush in society". Aguilera recalls the domestic violence of her childhood as she sings, [...] "He took his anger out on her face, she kept all of her pain locked away". Nick Levine for Digital Spy said that [...] "Oh Mother" [...] is a [...] "retread" [...] of [...] "I'm OK", a song with the same topic from Aguilera's 2002 album Stripped.|$|E
500|$|After {{concluding}} her California Dreams Tour, Perry {{stated that}} {{she intended to}} [...] "live a little" [...] before recording any new material that was [...] "worth listening to". When ex-husband Russell Brand left her on December 30, 2011, she felt devastated and contemplated suicide. Perry revealed to Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to record a [...] "darker" [...] album than her previous records. She stated: [...] "It was inevitable, after <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through.</b> If I had a time machine and could go back in time, I would. But I can't, so, you'll discover another part of me." [...] To Interview, she mentioned that she aspired to include a more acoustic vibe to the record.|$|E
500|$|<b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through,</b> only I {{will ever}} know. My knee cap {{completely}} {{turned to the}} right, a ball of blood forming on my leg and the bone that broke, {{without being able to}} move my body. And the pain, a pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. The surgeon placed a big support [...] in my leg, because the bone had moved so much. Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats , there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant my leg was full of blood. I'm just grateful that the artery was untouched.|$|E
30|$|Clinician 1 : Cultural {{differences}} {{between parents and}} children. My parents don’t understand <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through.</b> And sometimes <b>I</b> say, “My son {{says the same thing}} to me. But have you understood your parents sometimes?” Or I say, “I see it because I see it in my kids, too.” And then validate their frustrations.|$|R
5000|$|Rick Ross is a Christian, {{and in an}} {{interview}} with Corey [...] "Coco Brother" [...] Condrey on Lift Every Voice, he indicated that [...] "I had told myself at one point no matter <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through,</b> <b>I</b> never question God." [...] In addition, Ross indicated that he prays every time he goes on stage to perform.|$|R
5000|$|Human Rights Watch {{responded to}} these {{statements}} on 16 May 2016. Belkis Wille stated that [...] "In fact, this two-week trip {{was the fourth}} I had made to Yemen {{since the beginning of}} the war in March 2015. Given <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> to get into Yemen, al-Assiri’s statement was laughable". She stated that on each of her visits to Yemen during this time period her passport has been confiscated, with no reason being given. She claims that this indicates that the coalition know that she is visiting Yemen.|$|R
2500|$|Production {{lasted a}} year and 39 episodes. [...] After this first series was over, one {{interviewer}} asked McGoohan {{if he would have}} liked the series to continue, to which he replied, [...] "Perhaps, {{but let me tell you}} this: I would rather do twenty TV series than go through <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> under that Rank contract I signed a few years ago and for which I blame no one but myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams told MTV {{that she}} couldn't [...] "wait {{for the world}} to hear [...] new solo album", {{describing}} it as [...] "fresher", [...] "more inspirational", and [...] "more on the secular side". Furthermore, she stated [...] "whether it's gospel or not, I wrote about it", therefore expecting [...] "some of her gospel fans to be a little upset" [...] but wanted to [...] "keep it real". She also discussed one of the album's [...] "primary themes" [...] – [...] "what it's like to be in love" [...] – explaining [...] " [...] mistakes you make when you're in love and how they affect your life" [...] after saying [...] "I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them." [...] In describing the album during another interview, this time for GospelCity, Williams said [...] "these songs are just about the real me" [...] and that she [...] "just wrote from [...] heart" [...] before acknowledging that [...] "it didn't turn out to be as 'gospel-ly' as some would have liked", but [...] "the stuff" [...] that's on the album [...] "is stuff [...] went through". Williams then said [...] "this whole album is about God's love and me". After being asked [...] "Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do You Know, as they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?", Williams responded [...] "That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way. I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through,</b> I know God is taking me to another level. I had people around me that were not going where I was going – I had to release them from my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|Duane averted {{his face}} a moment, hesitated till the {{swelling}} left his throat, and then said, [...] "It's worth <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> to-day to hear that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{you don't}} display your wonted sagacity,' {{returned}} Arthur coolly. 'You little know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> on your account. If {{you had been}} sound-winded, you would have saved me no end of persecution.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{might have}} pitied this {{deformed}} woman--such {{a longing for}} love broke suddenly through the menace of her eyes. But then <b>I</b> thought of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>gone</b> <b>through,</b> and my heart set like flint.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you were}} a good general, and so for the matter of that was Bes. Oh! <b>what</b> agonies <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> while the fight hung doubtful. My heart was on fire, yes, I seemed to burn for----" [...] and she stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Norris," [...] she said, [...] "forgive me if I am disagreeable, {{but think}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> {{to get that}} paper. Think how I have hoped that it might mean {{everything}} to you, perhaps to us." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wonder if}} you can imagine <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through,</b> the eagerness with which I looked forward to a letter from you, just a word or two would have {{satisfied}} me, how anxiously I expected each post, and my despair when day after day went by.|$|E
6000|$|... "Right!" [...] exclaimed Dorn, with a queer laugh. Every day now {{he showed}} signs of {{stronger}} personality. [...] "Lenore, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> has confused my {{sense of right and}} wrong. Some day perhaps it will all come clear. But, Lenore, all my life, if I live to be ninety, I shall hate Germans." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Better drown herself than do as I have done. Only {{think what}} there is before me. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> is nothing to it. Of course <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> back to the Islands. Where else am I to live? Who else will take me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was an impudent old man, and that's the truth," [...] {{said the}} Duchess;--"and {{he has always}} been my {{thorough}} detestation. But if you only knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> to get rid of him,--and all on account of Trumpeton Wood,--you'd send me every brush taken in the Brake country during the next season." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'YOU OLD WRETCH--I won't say Yes or No till I {{have had}} a long, long look at my glass first. If you had any real regard for anybody but your wicked old self, you would know that the bare idea of marrying again (after <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>through)</b> is an idea that makes my flesh creep.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nothing {{hitherto}} {{has been}} equal to it! said Laura. 'There was {{the misery of}} his silence, and the anxiety that you, dearest, freed me from, then no sooner was that over than this was confided to me. Think what I felt when Eva put me in mind {{of a time when}} I argued in favour of some such concealment in a novel! No, you can never guess <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through,</b> knowing that he would think me weak, blameable, unworthy!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] Mrs. Wix concurred; [...] "the whole point's {{our being}} together. While you're waiting, before you act, for her ladyship {{to take some}} step, our {{position}} here will come to an impossible pass. You don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> with her for you yesterday--and for our poor darling; but it's not a thing I can promise you often to face again. She cast me out in horrible language--she has instructed the servants not to wait on me." ...|$|E
60|$|He drained what {{remained}} of the bottle, took down the lanthorn, and left me sufficiently terrified to reflect upon my situation, which I found desperate enough, my dears. I have no words to describe <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> in that vile, foul-smelling place. My tears flowed fast when I thought of my grandfather and of the dear friends I had left behind, and of Dorothy, whom I never hoped to see again. And then, perchance 'twas the rum put heart into me, I vowed I would face the matter show this cut-throat of a Griggs a bold front. Had he meant to murder me, I reflected, he had done the business long since. Then I fell asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "It needs {{philosophy}} to support <b>what</b> <b>I</b> 've <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> this week," [...] said Ferrand, shrugging his shoulders. [...] "On Wednesday last, when I received your letter, I had just eighteen-pence, {{and at once}} I made a resolution {{to come and see}} you; on that sum I 've done the journey. My strength is nearly at an end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And--and I {{never would}} listen to you and Mary about poor Ida. I let her idle and dress, and read all those novels, and {{it is out of}} them she got that monstrous notion. You little know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> with that girl, Frank, so {{different}} from the other two. Oh! if I could only begin over again!' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was just}} {{beginning}} to doze when she heard a voice quite close to her, which made her jump. 'O lovely princess, if you only knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> to find you!' The princess jumped out of bed screaming, 'The lion! the lion!' but her friends thought it was a nightmare, and did not trouble themselves to get up.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This one can. Henry, listen! You {{remember}} how ill and worn out I {{was when you}} met me first at that farm? Do you know why it was? It was because I had been slaving away for years {{at one of those}} places where you go in and pay five cents to dance with the lady instructresses. I was a lady instructress. Henry! Just think <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through!</b> Every day having to drag a million heavy men with large feet round a big room. I tell you, you are a professional compared with some of them! They trod on my feet and leaned their two hundred pounds on me and nearly killed me. Now perhaps you can understand why I'm not crazy about dancing! Believe me, Henry, the kindest thing you can do to me is to tell me I must never dance again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it if I frighten you," [...] she resumed; [...] "I {{must tell}} you plainly that I don't like the prospect. In the first place, the sooner we two are parted--oh, only for a while!--the better for you. After <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through,</b> last night--no, I {{am not going to}} enter into any particulars; I am only going to repeat, what I have said already--don't trust me. I mean it, Carmina! Your generous nature shall not mislead you, if I can help it. When you are a happy married woman--when he is farther removed from me than he is even now--remember your ugly, ill-tempered friend, and let me come to you. Enough of this! I have other misgivings that are waiting to be confessed. You know that old nurse of yours intimately--while I only speak from a day or two's {{experience}} of her. To my judgment, she is a woman whose fondness for you might be turned into a tigerish fondness, on very small provocation. You write to her constantly. Does she know what you have suffered? Have you told her the truth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was as if}} Madame Carré, in pursuance of her {{inflamed}} {{sense that}} the art was everything and the individual nothing save as he happened to serve it, had said: [...] "Well, if she will have it she shall; she shall know what she's in for, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through,</b> battered and broken in as we all have been--all who are worthy, who have had the honour. She shall know the real point of view." [...] It {{was as if she}} were still beset with Mrs. Rooth's twaddle and muddle, her hypocrisy, her idiotic scruples--something she felt all need to belabour, to trample on. Miriam took it all as a bath, a baptism, with shuddering joy and gleeful splashes; staring, wondering, sometimes blushing and failing to follow, but not shrinking nor wounded; laughing, when convicted, at her own expense and feeling evidently that this at last was the high cold air of art, an initiation, a discipline that nothing could undo. Sherringham said he would see her home--he wanted to talk to her and she must walk away with him. [...] "And it's understood then she may come back," [...] he added to Madame Carré. [...] "It's my affair of course. You'll take an interest in her for a month or two; she'll sit at your feet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why? Do {{you think}} that, after <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>through,</b> <b>I</b> {{was shocked at}} seeing you kill three of those wretches? Two months ago I suppose I should have thought it dreadful, but those two months have changed us altogether. Think {{of what we were}} then and what we are now. There remain only you, Mrs. Hunter, myself, and your letter said, Mr. Wilson. Is he the only one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes,--without {{thinking}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have to <b>go</b> <b>through.</b> I'm {{not going}} to throw myself at Lord Rufford's head so as to lose my chance here;--but we'll go {{and see how the}} land lies. Of course you'll go, mamma." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I own it, I own it,' he went on, slowly; 'the {{change is}} more than skin-deep now. One can't <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> these last few terrifying days, Sheila, unchanged. They have played the devil with my body; now begins the {{tampering}} with my mind. Not even Danton knows how it will end. But shall I tell you why you won't, why you can't answer me that one question--him or me? Shall I tell you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{first man}} {{will never get}} used to it. That college will become a madhouse. You must think of some other mode of letting them pass their last year. Make them drunk, so that they shall not {{know what they are}} doing. Drug them and make them senseless; or, better still, come down upon them with {{absolute}} power, and carry them away to instant death. Let the veil of annihilation fall upon them before they know where they are. The Fixed Period, with all its damnable certainty, is a mistake. I have tried it and I know it. When I look back at the last year, which was to be the last, not of my absolute life but of my true existence, I shudder as I think <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through.</b> I am astonished at the strength of my own mind in that I did not go mad. No one would have made such an effort for you as I made. Those other men had determined to rebel since the feeling of the Fixed Period came near to them. It is impossible that human nature should endure such a struggle and not rebel. I have been saved now by these Englishmen, who have come here in their horror, and have used their strength to prevent the barbarity of your benevolence. But I can hardly keep myself quiet as I think of the sufferings which I have endured during the last month." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heaven forgive me!" [...] he went on, [...] "but I {{could almost}} laugh at myself, at this solemn moment, for having spoken and acted just now {{so much like}} a fool! Denied his words, did he? Poor old man! they say sense often comes back to light-headed people just before death; {{and he is a}} proof of it. The fact is, Gabriel, my own wits must have been a little shaken--and no wonder--by <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> last night, and what I have come home to this morning. As if you, or anybody, could ever really give serious credit to the {{wandering}} speeches of a dying old man! (Where is Perrine? Why did you send her away?) I don't wonder at your still looking a little startled, and feeling low in your mind, and all that--for you've had a trying night of it, trying in every way. He must have been a good deal shaken in his wits last night, between fears about himself and fears about me. (To think of my being angry with you, Gabriel, for being a little alarmed--very naturally--by an old man's queer fancies!) Come out, Perrine--come out of the bedroom whenever you are tired of it: you must learn sooner or later to look at death calmly. Shake hands, Gabriel; and let us make it up, and say no more about what has passed. You won't? Still angry with me for what I said to you just now? Ah! you'll think better about it by the time I return. Come out, Perrine; we've no secrets here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> in that interval. But even [...] in its utmost agony--even in those terrible throes that love must [...] suffer {{before it can be}} disembodied of selfish desire--my love for [...] you sufficed to {{withhold}} me from suicide, without the aid of any [...] other motive. In the midst of my egoism, I yet could not bear to [...] come like a death-shadow across the feast of your joy. I could not [...] bear to forsake the world in which you still lived and might need [...] me; {{it was part of the}} faith I had vowed to you,--to wait and [...] endure. Maggie, that is a proof of what I write now to assure you [...] of,--that no anguish I have had to bear on your account has been [...] too heavy a price to pay for the new life into which I have entered [...] in loving you. I want you to put aside all grief because of the [...] grief you have caused me. I was nurtured in the sense of privation; [...] I never expected happiness; and in knowing you, in loving you, I [...] have had, and still have, what reconciles me to life. You have been [...] to my affections what light, what color is to my eyes, what music [...] is to the inward ear, you have raised a dim unrest into a vivid [...] consciousness. The new life I have found in caring for your joy and [...] sorrow more than for what is directly my own, has transformed the [...] spirit of rebellious murmuring into that willing endurance which is [...] the birth of strong sympathy. I think nothing but such complete and [...] intense love could have initiated me into that enlarged life which [...] grows and grows by appropriating the life of others; for before, I [...] was always dragged back from it by ever-present painful [...] self-consciousness. I even think sometimes that this gift of [...] transferred life which has come to me in loving you, may be a new [...] power to me.|$|E
5000|$|Robinson says [...] "I wasn't there, {{as far as}} {{the whole}} situation, I just know I wasn't on the boat, and I don't want to get involved. I don't want my name brought up because of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> just <b>went</b> <b>through</b> and <b>what</b> I'm still going through. So for my name to be brought up like that is just crazy and upsetting, because I don't want anyone looking at me because I {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{could not}} help it,' said Gilbert; then as her lip curled with contempt, and her eye spoke disappointment, he cast himself on the ground, exclaiming, 'Oh, if you knew how I have been mixed up with others, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>through,</b> you would pity me. Oh, Maurice, don't cry, when I would give worlds to be like you. Why do you let him cry? why don't you tell him what a brave noble boy he is?' ...|$|R
