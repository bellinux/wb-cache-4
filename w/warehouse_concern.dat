Data warehousing is a new technology that structure data to simplify the phases of the decision support process. This paper discusses experience gained while building and implementing a data <b>warehouse</b> <b>concerning</b> an audit by a South African government institution to obtain knowledge about science and technology resources available nationally. The data warehouse was created by using the data contained in ve operational relational databases. The use of the soft systems methodology during the data warehouse development life cycle ensured continued stakeholder participation. The results obtained indicate that a data warehouse implementation simpli es information generation when compared to the data reporting features of an operational database system. Also, the data warehouse produced an integrated, historic source of information about the subjects included therein.

40|$|Good {{knowledge}} of spatial data applications leads to successful business organizations. In {{the event of}} natural disasters such as earthquakes, interoperability between different organizations is necessary for fast and efficient action of different stakeholders. There were many occurrences of discrepancies amongst appraisersâ€™ damage evaluations after the 1998 and 2004 Bovec municipality earthquakes, which consequently led to additional work in data processing. In such cases, building a coordinated data warehouse can greatly assist solving these problems. Implementing a data warehouse is {{made possible by the}} ETL process, which extracts, transforms and loads data. The basic functions of the spatial ETL tool are exchanging information in the geographical information system (GIS) between different users, and the ability to transparently use the given data. A newly made data warehouse also provides users an overview of the chronological developments for each building, and offers land planners the basis for the design of municipal spatial plans. In this thesis, a unification of non-homogenous data warehouses, collected from various institutions with the ETL process, is accomplished. To achieve this, the spatial ETL tool FME Desktop is used in ArcGIS, which allows entry of different data formats into the software environment and contains a rich collection of converters that enable the transformation of data and their delivery to the final data warehouse. The applicability of the newly made data <b>warehouse</b> <b>concerning</b> the 2004 Bovec earthquake is then examined. ArcGIS analytical tools are used to assess the impact and effect geological basis have on the damage done buildings. An inquiry trough descriptive and locational attributes and an analysis of the suitability of soil for construction are made. The flexibility of the spatial ETL tool is demonstrated in this study, which also {{turns out to be a}} strong tool for editing and analyzing spatial data. The effect the geological basis has on the amount of the estimated damage is, in view of the data regarding the damage to buildings and in respect of other factors (such as the year of construction and building materials used) taken into account only for the aforementioned earthquake, therefore, confirmed with relatively low reliability. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe study {{a problem}} that occurs {{at the end of}} a {{logistic}} stream in a <b>warehouse</b> and which <b>concerns</b> the timetabling of the sorting slots that are used to accommodate the prepared orders before they are dispatched. We consider a set of orders to be prepared in a certain number of preparation shops over a given time horizon. Each order is associated with the truck that will transport it to the customer. A sorting slot is an accumulation area where processed orders wait to be loaded onto a truck. For a given truck a known number of sorting slots is needed from the time the first order for this truck begins to be prepared, right up until the truckâ€™s scheduled departure time. Since several orders destined for different trucks are processed simultaneously, and since the number of sorting slots is limited, the timetabling of these resources is necessary to ensure that all orders can be processed over the considered time horizon. In this paper we describe the general industrial context of the problem and we formalize it. We state that some particular cases of the problem are polynomially solvable while the general problem is NP-complete. We then propose optimization methods for solving the problem...|$|R
40|$|Batch {{management}} systems are traditionally {{composed of two}} subparts, one assuring the creation and configuration of the recipes, and the other assuring {{the execution of the}} recipes, i. e., driving the equipments to make a product. By reducing the total time needed for producing a product, the market can be reached quicker and more money can (hopefully) be earned. Time to market is an important key competitive performance indicator. So, how can time to market be reduced? The execution part of the batch management system must obviously work efficiently, but this alone will not be enough. Personnel, materials, scheduling and maintenance information sent from the ERP system must also be managed in an efficient way. The problem is that traditional batch {{management systems}} are not intended to or capable of handling this information. Neither are they intended to handle information <b>concerning</b> <b>warehouses,</b> packaging or material receiving. Rather than extending the batch management system beyond its core role, the importance of the MES system and its capabilities should be stressed. An approach based on the ideas and models presented in ISA S 95 is believed to be successful. Dedicated cross industry components manage the functions that are decidedly non-batch. Similar to a traditional batch management system that coordinates and synchronizes the recipe execution, a MES system should do the same for the functions of the components. Applying this approach, the batch management system can truly work {{in the context of the}} supply chain!!...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} carried out towards Sandvik Mining and Construction (SMC) at a {{production}} unit in KÃ¶ping. SMC KÃ¶ping produces and supplies rock drilling and rock cutting tools to customers globally. SMC KÃ¶ping have experienced that their warehouse management does lack in functionality, causing an uncertainty in actual stock balance and a problem to locate articles. For SMC KÃ¶ping {{it is crucial to}} have well functioning warehouse management to secure the internal and external flow of material, and to face their competitors. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze and develop the current warehouse management at SMC KÃ¶ping. The thesis will deliver proposal for improvements of the layout and the handling of the current warehouse area. The improvements are to secure a flow of materials to and from the warehouse, with enhanced internal and external material deliveries as a result. To make the purpose of the thesis achievable a set of sub objectives have been formulated as follows: - Describe relevant theory, <b>concerning</b> <b>warehouse</b> layout, operational methods and warehouse management systems. - Describe the field of operation at SMC KÃ¶ping concerning flow of materials and information, but also regarding warehouse layout, operational methods and warehouse management systems. - With the help of benchmarking describe how warehouse layout, operational methods and warehouse management systems serve at other organizations. - Develop recommendations that will improve the flow at SMC KÃ¶ping by changing the layout, routines and operational methods at the existing warehouse. - Together with the personnel at SMC KÃ¶ping improve and refine the recommended change of layout and establish it. The study is a case study conducted on site at Sandvik Mining and Construction in KÃ¶ping during a time period of four months. The data collection has been executed through observations, interviews and a benchmarking with three external organizations. Careful measurements have been conducted to enable the creation of bluprints, which has enabled the authors to give recommendations that were practically achievable. A success factor throughout this study has been the involvement of personel at SMC KÃ¶ping when developing the given recommendations.

40|$|A data {{warehouse}} {{is a single}} data store, where data from multiple data sources is integrated for online business analytical processing (OLAP) of an entire organisation. The rationale being single and integrated is to ensure a consistent view of the organisational business performance independent from different angels of business perspectives. Due to its wide coverage of subjects, {{data warehouse}} design is a highly complex, lengthy and error-prone process. Furthermore, the business analytical tasks change over time, which results in changes in the requirements for the OLAP systems. Thus, data warehouse and OLAP systems are rather dynamic and the design process is continuous. In this thesis, we propose a method that is integrated, formal and application-tailored to overcome the complexity problem, deal with the system dynamics, {{improve the quality of}} the system and the chance of success. Our method comprises three important parts: the general ASMs method with types, the application tailored design framework for data warehouse and OLAP, and the schema integration method with a set of provably correct refinement rules. By using the ASM method, we are able to model both data and operations in a uniform conceptual framework, which enables us to design an integrated approach for data warehouse and OLAP design. The freedom given by the ASM method allows us to model the system at an abstract level that is easy to understand for both users and designers. More specifically, the language allows us to use the terms from the user domain not biased by the terms used in computer systems. The pseudo-code like transition rules, which gives the simplest form of operational semantics in ASMs, give the closeness to programming languages for designers to understand. Furthermore, these rules are rooted in mathematics to assist in improving the quality of the system design. By extending the ASMs with types, the modelling language is tailored for data warehouse with the terms that are well developed for data-intensive applications, which makes it easy to model the schema evolution as refinements in the dynamic data warehouse design. By providing the application-tailored design framework, we break down the design complexity by business processes (also called subjects in data <b>warehousing)</b> and design <b>concerns.</b> By designing the data warehouse by subjects, our method resembles Kimball's "bottom-up" approach. However, with the schema integration method, our method resolves the stovepipe issue of the approach. By building up a data warehouse iteratively in an integrated framework, our method not only results in an integrated data warehouse, but also resolves the issues of complexity and delayed ROI (Return On Investment) in Inmon's "top-down" approach. By dealing with the user change requests {{in the same way as}} new subjects, and modelling data and operations explicitly in a three-tier architecture, namely the data sources, the data warehouse and the OLAP (online Analytical Processing), our method facilitates dynamic design with system integrity. By introducing a notion of refinement specific to schema evolution, namely schema refinement, for capturing the notion of schema dominance in schema integration, we are able to build a set of correctness-proven refinement rules. By providing the set of refinement rules, we simplify the designers's work in correctness design verification. Nevertheless, we do not aim for a complete set due to the fact that there are many different ways for schema integration, and neither a prescribed way of integration to allow designer favored design. Furthermore, given its Â°exibility in the process, our method can be extended for new emerging design issues easily...|$|R
