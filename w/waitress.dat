2500|$|In her 1991 {{study of}} <b>waitresses</b> in Philadelphia, Paules {{examines}} how these workers assert control and protect their self identity during interactions with customers. In restaurant work, Paules argues, workers' subordination to customers is reinforced through [...] "cultural symbols that originate from deeply rooted assumptions about service work." [...] Because the <b>waitresses</b> were not strictly regulated by their employers, waitresses' interactions with customers were {{controlled by the}} <b>waitresses</b> themselves. Although they are stigmatized by the stereotypes and assumptions of servitude surrounding restaurant work, the <b>waitresses</b> studied were not negatively affected by their interactions with customers. To the contrary, they viewed their ability to manage their emotions as a valuable skill {{that could be used}} to gain control over customers. Thus, the Philadelphia <b>waitresses</b> took advantage of the lack of employer-regulated emotional labor in order to avoid the potentially negative consequences of emotional labor.|$|R

5|$|Victoria Wood as Seen on TV is a British comedy sketch series {{starring}} comedian Victoria Wood, with Julie Walters, Celia Imrie, Duncan Preston, Susie Blake and Patricia Routledge. The {{show was}} televised on BBC Two between 1985 and 1987 and included sketches that became {{famous in the}} United Kingdom; these included one-offs like <b>Waitress</b> (popularly known as Two Soups), in which Walters, as an elderly <b>waitress,</b> takes far too long to deliver two bowls of soup, and regular features like Acorn Antiques (a parody of low-budget soap opera), as well as musical performances by Wood including her best-known number, The Ballad of Barry and Freda ("Let's Do It").|$|E
25|$|Though Paules {{highlights}} the positive consequences of emotional labor {{for a specific}} population of <b>waitresses,</b> other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the <b>waitressing</b> industry. Through eighteen months of participant observation research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that casino <b>waitresses</b> are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace. Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous tipping system, both casino owners and customers control waitresses' behavior and appearance for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the <b>waitresses</b> have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management {{makes it difficult to}} change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.|$|R
