In the present game, the object hidden, or the cache as it is called by the trappers, is a small splint of wood, or other diminutive article that may be concealed in the closed hand.

40|$|Surprisingly {{little of}} Yeatsian {{scholarship}} {{deals with the}} cluster of images that forms {{one of the basic}} building blocks of the poet's philosophical system, water and its related imagery. This thesis intends to remedy this neglect. The centrality of water imagery {{stems from the fact that}} Yeats had identified both himself and the Irish people (his subject, as he was trying to build a national body of symbols) with water. Water [...] sea, lake, ice, well [...] and its related imagery [...] moon, water birds, fish and dolphins, blood and alcohol as related liquids [...] pervades the poetical and dramatical work of Yeats. Water imagery is one half of the system that provided Yeats with his subjects, a religion of opposites; the other half is absence of water or fire. Water and fire, wet and dry, the Moon and the Sun symbolize Yeatsian opposites that either unite (Unity of Being) or clash (opposite characters or ages). In the late works, when Yeats concentrates on the Great Wheel, water and fire are fixed as a key concept of the gyre, its poles. All the images that had been paired with or related to water or the absence of water in the earlier works (stone, garden, tree, bird, woman) converge as correspondences for the two poles, each feeding off the other (the clashing opposites are alternate aspects of the one reality that is the gyre). The imagery is crunched around the wet and <b>dry</b> <b>poles</b> of the Great Wheel, making water imagery and its eloquent absence essential to understanding Yeats's symbolism...|$|R

So far, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on the effectiveness of dry ledges combined with fencing for a wide diversity of vertebrates. The main goal of this study is to evaluate how the presence of dry ledge affect culvert use for Mediterranean mesocarnivores (red fox Vulpes vulpes, stone marten Martes foina, European badger Meles meles, European otter Lutra lutra and common genet Genetta genetta). Between January and March 2008, <b>wooden</b> <b>dry</b> ledges were placed in 15 of 32 surveyed culverts. Additionally 100 meters of small mesh size and buried fences were installed along each side of all culverts. During one year we used video surveillance and track-plates to detect crossing events over seven consecutive nights per season in each monitored culvert. We evaluate the relative importance of dry ledges on culvert use and compare the number of road-kills within a 100 m buffer radius around the culverts before and after fence installation and culverts that were never fenced (control culverts). Although different species responded to culvert features differently, the presence of dry ledges was the most relevant feature explaining crossing events, in particular, for stone martens and genets. The fencing used did not reduce mammals road-kill prevalence. Our results imply that in order to improve culvert use, road managers should take into account the placement of ledges on culverts that remain flooded most of the year (more than 3 cm of water-depth). We also suggest exploring the role of ledge size and construction materials to increase the likelihood of being used by foxes and badgers. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Wooden poles are {{frequently}} used {{for power and}} telecommunication lines. After creosote preservation the durability is secured for many decades. This study is related to a Norwegian plant where such poles are produced using Scots pine. Prior to the preservation process the poles have to be dried to a moisture content below the fibre saturation point everywhere in the pole. This is done outdoors in open stacks of poles, i. e. as air-drying. A problem {{is caused by the}} difficulties to determine when the target moisture content has been reached. The inventory of <b>drying</b> <b>poles</b> represents considerable value in a company's balance sheet and risk of downgrading. Knowledge of drying times during the annual seasons has been insufficient, and no efficient method is known for accurately observing the MC through the various parts of the poles. Thus, there is risk both for keeping higher inventory than optimal and for treating poles that would not be dried sufficiently. It was thus investigated whether a simulation model could be used for this determination. Climate data- temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and rain- as daily averages from a national weather station in the same area is used for defining the drying conditions. The moisture migration within the poles is described as a diffusion process, taking into account that the cross section contains both sapwood and heartwood with quite different properties. Diffusion coefficient values are selected based on experience from sawn timber simulation models. The main issue is to determine the interaction between poles and the surrounding weather. Poles in a small stack were individually weighed several times during a half-year period and the drying rate thus determined. These experimental results were used for tuning of the model. Problems encountered in this tuning process are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the effect of various dehydration techniques on the nutritional quality of mango (Mangifera indica L.) products. In {{the first phase of the}} study, nutritional characteristics of fresh immature mango of different varieties were determined. The results revealed that maximum TSS, protein, non-reducing sugar, K and Cu were recorded in variety Langra. Whereas, maximum moisture, ash, fat, total sugar, reducing sugar and Mn were observed in variety Sindhri, however, variety Chaunsa showed higher vitamin C, Mg and Cr content. It was further observed that variety Desi was rich in minerals such as Na, Ca, Zn and Fe with maximum acidity. In the second phase of the study mango powder was prepared from different mango varieties using different drying techniques. The results of mango powder prepared with-peel showed that variety Chaunsa had significantly higher moisture and vitamin C content, whereas TSS, total sugar, reducing sugar, Ca, K, Mg, Cu were higher in without peel powder in variety Chaunsa than other varieties. Among the drying methods, maximum moisture was retained in <b>wooden</b> glass <b>drying</b> method (12. 88 %), whereas, maximum TSS, ash, protein, vitamin C and non-reducing sugar were observed in mango powder dried under cabinet drying method. Moreover, the majority of the minerals were found in maximum quantity in mango powder <b>dried</b> under <b>wooden</b> glass <b>drying</b> method. During the third phase of the study the unripe and ripened mangoes of different varieties were picked from various tree positions viz. top, middle and bottom. The results revealed that during ripening period the TSS was increased in all the varieties. It was further observed that maximum moisture (85. 28 %) and total sugar (29. 36 %) was observed in ripened Chaunsa mangoes. The higher Vitamin C content (26. 34 mg 100 g- 1) was found in ripened Langra mangoes than other varieties. The unripe variety Desi had the highest acidity (0. 47 %) as compared to other unripe and ripened mango varieties. It was also observed that minerals were significantly higher in unripe than ripened mangoes, Na, Ca and Zn were higher in variety Desi, Mg, Fe, Cr and Mn were maximum in variety Chaunsa, whereas, variety Sindhri and Langra were rich in K and Cu, respectively. Among the mangoes picked from different tree positions, moisture, TSS, reducing sugar, non-reducing sugar, ash, acidity, vitamin C, Na, Ca, Fe, Mg, Cr and Mn were higher in mangoes picked from top tree position as compared to middle and bottom positions. In the last phase of the study, the slices were prepared from mangoes of different varieties obtained from top, middle and bottom tree positions using different drying methods. It was reflected that the mango slices of variety Chaunsa prepared from top tree position mangoes, had the highest pH, ash, TSS and vitamin C content. It was further observed that moisture content was highest (12. 88 %) in slices of mangoes of variety Sindhri obtained from top tree position and <b>dried</b> under <b>wooden</b> glass <b>drying</b> method. However, total sugar, reducing and non reducing sugars were significantly higher in slices of variety Chaunsa obtained from top tree position, whereas, Ca content of variety Desi was higher in cabinet drying method in slices prepared from top tree position than all other varieties. Cabinet drying method resulted in higher quantities of K (819. 60 mg kg- 1), Mg (78. 64 mg kg- 1), Zn (2. 62 mg kg- 1), Fe (6. 86 mg kg- 1), Cu (5. 92 mg kg- 1), Cr (1. 02 mg kg- 1) and Mn (3. 22 mg kg- 1) as compared to open sun <b>drying</b> and <b>wooden</b> glass <b>drying</b> methods. The sensory evaluation of mango powder prepared under cabinet dehydration method proved to be better from variety Desi without peel than other varieties investigated, while mango slices of variety Chaunsa prepared from top tree position under cabinet dehydration resulted in better quality than other varieties and drying methods. It was concluded from the present study that cabinet dehydration method proved to be better in the preparation of mango powder and slices than other two drying methods. The study further confirmed that mango powder and slices prepared from variety Chaunsa were superior in quality and all other nutritional characteristics than other varieties. Similarly, mango slices prepared from top tree position were better in quality than those made from middle and bottom tree positions...|$|R
