On {{the basis}} of the {{analysis}} of winding drive system’s technological requirements of multi-wire cutting system and the characteristics of torque motor, the article proposes a scheme of wrap wheel with torque motor control to overcome the deficiency of the general control motor driven wrap wheel. In determination process of winding system parameter, it provides the selective calculation methods and the control strategy of the torque motor. According to processing materials, we get tension values, and then calculate the output torque, and choose a suitable torque motor and determine the control strategy. Then the design process of winding drive system finishes. Adopting the torque motor as wrap wheel control motor can make <b>wrap</b> <b>device</b> to meet the system requirements. Meanwhile it can simplify the structure of <b>wrap</b> <b>device,</b> and make the cutting-process runs smoothly...|$|E

Individuals with lymphoedema, venous ulceration and lipoedema often require long-term compression therapy to prevent and manage problems such as chronic ulceration and skin changes, persistent swelling and shape distortion.

Peripheral nerve injuries may involve intraneural and extraneural scar formation and affect nerve gliding planes, sometimes leading to complex clinical presentations. All of these pathological entities involve pain {{as the main}} clinical symptom and can be subsumed under the term “painful scar neuropathy”. The authors review the literature on treatment approaches to peripheral nerve scar neuropathy and the outcomes of neurolysis‑associated procedures and propose a simple classification and a therapeutic approach to scar neuropathy.

40|$|Meaningful, {{reusable}} applications {{built on}} top of ubiquitous and networked devices will be slow to materialize as long as device APIs vary widely, communication protocols are not standardized, and programming support is limited and in-consistent.

We start addressing this issue by provid-ing a model for devices, based on input and output ports, that allows for a set of common interfaces to represent a range of devices. Further, we provide a solution to the bootstrapping problem, providing a general means to bridge the adoption gap for a new API for the Internet of Things. We borrow both the name, accessor, and several key design concepts from a recent proposal by Latronico et. al, for our interface layer that <b>wraps</b> currently non-conforming <b>devices</b> with the standard interface.

5000|$|At first, {{there was}} a very {{positive}} reaction to Pulvermacher. Early in 1851 Pulvermacher gave Golding Bird, a well known London physician with an interest in electrotherapy, a sample of the machine with which to experiment. Bird was impressed enough with it that he later gave a representative of the Pulvermacher Company a testimonial as a letter of introduction to physicians in Edinburgh. Bird thought that the battery would make a useful source of portable electricity and could be used for treating patients with some forms of paralysis in their homes. Contemporary equipment was not very portable, {{and in the case of}} friction machines required skilled operators to keep going. By October 1851 Bird felt that he had tested the device sufficiently to give it a glowing article in The Lancet. But even at this early stage there were signs of disquiet. Even as he wrote the favourable report in The Lancet Bird felt the need to level criticism at the Pulvermacher Company's London agent, one C. Meinig, for promoting the device as a [...] "universal panacea" [...] for almost any imaginable complaint in the company's advertisements. Bird was a tireless opponent of quack practitioners, and was particular quick to criticise medically unqualified electrical treatment, as he felt this was a reason professional acceptance of his own work in electrotherapy was being held back. The quack practitioner market was the very sector that the Pulvermacher Company's unrestrained claims were aimed at. Nevertheless, Bird was gracious enough to specifically exclude Pulvermacher himself from responsibility for these [...] "injudiciously puffed" [...] claims.By April 1853 the situation had become very acrimonuous.

40|$|Implantable and {{wearable}} bioelectronics {{provide the}} ability to monitor and modulate physiological processes. They represent a promising set of technologies that can provide new treatment for patients or new tools for scientific discovery, such as in long-term studies involving small animals. As these technologies advance, two trends are clear, miniaturization and increased sophistication i. e. multiple channels, wireless bi-directional communication, and responsiveness (closed-loop devices). One primary challenge in realizing miniaturized and sophisticated bioelectronics is powering. Integration and development of wireless power transfer (WPT) technology, however, can overcome this challenge. ^ In this dissertation, I propose the use of coupled resonator WPT for bioelectronics and present a new generalized analysis and optimization methodology, derived from complex microwave bandpass filter synthesis, for maximizing and controlling coupled resonator based WPT performance. This newly developed set of analysis and optimization methods enables system miniaturization while simultaneously achieving the necessary performance to safely power sophisticated bioelectronics. As an application example, a novel coil to coil based coupled resonator arrangement to wirelessly operate eight surface electromyography sensing <b>devices</b> <b>wrapped</b> circumferentially around an able-bodied arm is developed and demonstrated. ^ In addition to standard coil to coil based systems, this dissertation also presents {{a new form of}} coupled resonator WPT system built of a large hollow metallic cavity resonator. By leveraging the analysis and optimization methods developed here, I present a new cavity resonator WPT system for long-term experiments involving small rodents for the first time. The cavity resonator based WPT arena exhibits a volume of 60. 96 x 60. 96 x 30. 0 cm 3. In comparison to prior state of the art, this cavity resonator system enables nearly continuous wireless operation of a miniature sophisticated device implanted in a freely behaving rodent within the largest space. ^ Finally, I present preliminary work, providing the foundation for future studies, to demonstrate the feasibility of treating segments of the human body as a dielectric waveguide resonator. This creates another form of a coupled resonator system. Preliminary experiments demonstrated optimized coupled resonator wireless energy transfer into human tissue. The WPT performance achieved to an ultra-miniature sized receive coil (2 mm diameter) is presented. Indeed, optimized coupled resonator systems, broadened to include cavity resonator structures and human formed dielectric resonators, can enable the effective use of coupled resonator based WPT technology to power miniaturized and sophisticated bioelectronics. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inadvertent {{hypothermia}} {{is common}} in patients undergoing surgical procedures with a reported prevalence of perioperative hypothermia ranging from 50 % to 90 %. Hypothermia within the perioperative environment may have many undesired physiological effects {{that are associated with}} postoperative morbidity. There are different options for treating and/or preventing hypothermia within the adult perioperative environment, which include active and passive warming methods. This systematic review was undertaken to provide comprehensive evidence on the most effective strategies for prevention and management of inadvertent hypothermia in the perioperative environment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to identify the most effective methods for the treatment and/or preventions of hypothermia in intraoperative or postoperative patients. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adult patients ≥ 18 years of age, who underwent any type of surgery were included in this review. Types of interventions included were any type of linen or cover, aluminium foil <b>wraps,</b> forced-air warming <b>devices,</b> radiant warming devices and fluid warming devices. This review considered all identified prospective studies that used a clearly described process for randomisation, and/or included a control group. The primary outcome of Interest was change in core body temperature. REVIEW METHODS: Two independent reviewers assessed methodological validity of papers selected for retrieval and any disagreements were resolved through discussion. RESULTS: Nineteen studies with a combined 1451 patients who underwent different surgical procedures were included in this review. Meta-analysis was not possible. Forced-air warming in pregnant women scheduled for caesarean delivery under regional anaesthesia prevented maternal and foetal hypothermia. Intravenous and irrigating fluids warmed (38 – 40 °C) to a temperature higher than that of room temperature by different fluid warming devices (both dry and water heated) proved significantly beneficial to patients in terms of stable haemodynamic variables, and higher core temperature {{at the end of the}} surgery. Water garment warmer was significantly (P 0. 05) effective than forced-air warming in maintaining intraoperative normothermia in orthotopic liver transplantation patients. Extra warming with forced air compared to routine thermal care was effective in reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections and postoperative cardiac complications. Passive warming with reflective heating blankets or elastic bandages wrapped around the legs tightly were found to be ineffective in reducing the incidence or magnitude of hypothermia. CONCLUSION: There are significant benefits associated with forced-air warming. Evidence supports commencement of active warming preoperatively and monitoring it throughout the intraoperative period. Single strategies such as forced-air warming were more effective than passive warming; however, combined strategies, including preoperative commencement, use of warmed fluids plus forced-air warming as other active strategies were more effective in vulnerable groups (age or durations of surgeries).

40|$|Flexible endoscopy, a {{procedure}} during which an operator pushes a semi-rigid endoscope through a patient’s gastrointestinal tract, {{has been the}} gold-standard screening method for colon cancer screening (colonoscopy) for over 50 years. Owing to the large amounts of tissue stress that result from the need for transmitting a force {{to the tip of}} the endoscope while the <b>device</b> <b>wraps</b> through the bowel, implementing a front-actuated endoscopy system has been a popular area of research [1]. The pursuit of such a concept was accelerated by the advent of ingestible capsule endoscopes, which, since then, have been augmented by researchers to include therapeutic capabilities, modalities for maneuverability, amongst other diagnostic functions [2]. One of the more common approaches investigated has been the use of magnetic fields to apply forces and torques to steer the tip of an endoscope [3]. Recent efforts in magnetic actuation have resulted in the use of robot manipulators with permanent magnets at their end effectors that are used to manipulate endoscopes with embedded permanent magnets. Recently, we implemented closed loop control of a tethered magnetic capsule by using real-time magnetic localization and the linearization of a magnetic wrench applied to the capsule by the actuating magnet [4]. This control was implemented in 2 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) in position (in the horizontal plane) and 2 DoF in orientation (panning and tilting). One DoF in position is lost owing to the tethered capsule being actuated in air and thus lacking a restoring force to counter the high field gradient. The 3 rd orientation DoF is lost owing to the axial symmetry of the permanent magnet in the capsule; this prevents the application of torque in the axial direction and thus controlled roll and introduces a singularity in the capsule’s actuation. Although another dipole could be used to eliminate this singularity, this would complicate both the actuation and localization methods. In this manuscript, we consider the consequences of the embedded magnet (EM) being radially offset {{from the center of the}} capsule while being manipulated by an external actuating magnet (AM). We have developed a tethered capsule endoscope that contains a cylindrical EM (11. 11 mm in length and diameter) with a residual flux density of 1. 48 T that is offset by 1. 85 mm from the center of the capsule; a distance that is less than 10 % of the capsule diameter. Our investigation into the topic results from repeated observation of the capsule’s preference to align such that the internal magnet is closest to the actuating magnet (AM). The AM is a cylindrical magnet (101. 6 mm in length and diameter) with a residual flux density of 1. 48 T that is mounted at the end effector of a 6 DoF manipulator, as seen in Figure 1. In this manuscript, we evaluate the torqueing effects of the presence of this magnet offset with the goal of determining whether the torque effect is negligible, or impacts capsule motion and thus can potentially be used for the benefit of endoscope manipulation. A concept schematic of this effect is shown in Figure 2. A discussion of how to use this torque is beyond the scope of this manuscript. To the authors’ knowledge, the use of such concept in permanent-magnet based control has not been investigated...|$|R
