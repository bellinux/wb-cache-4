50|$|Operation Frantic {{began with}} 325th Reconnaissance <b>Wing</b> <b>flights</b> from England and Italy in late May 1944, and a photo lab and {{reconnaissance}} detachment {{with a few}} F-5 Lightnings were based at Poltava. Bombing runs (FRANTIC-1) began from Italy (15th Air Force) on 2 June 1944, returning four days later. The concept of operations was for American aircraft to use England (8th Air Force), Italy, and the Ukrainian bases as vertices of a triangular bombing campaign against Axis targets in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.|$|E
50|$|The bus {{and coach}} station {{is next to}} the railway station from where National Express {{operates}} coach services to London Victoria Coach Station (taking around 9 hours) via Heathrow Airport. Local bus services run by First South West connect Penzance with most major settlements in Cornwall, including Truro, St. Ives, St Just, St Buryan, Land's End and also Plymouth in Devon. A ferry service operates between Penzance Harbour and the Isles of Scilly. The Scillonian III, carries both foot-passengers and cargo. Sailing time is about 2 hours and 40 minutes. For 49 years, Penzance Heliport had a helicopter route to the Isles of Scilly run by British International, but this ended on 1 November 2012 due to rising costs and falling passenger numbers. The company had sought to sell its current base, and relocate elsewhere in West Cornwall to raise funds, although no suitable site was found in time to save the service. A bus service run by the Skybus Airline Service connects with Land's End Airport for fixed <b>wing</b> <b>flights</b> (15 minutes) to the Isles of Scilly. The buses leave from the railway station, near the taxi rank, rather than the bus station.|$|E

40|$|Flapping <b>wing</b> <b>flight</b> {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied {{in the field of}} entomology, resulting in observations on the methods of lift production, high manoeuvrability and efficient flight for various natural flyers in differing flow regimes and leading to significant developments in biomimetic theories regarding flapping wing MAVs. In addition, advances in aerodynamic modelling methods have given insight into the un-steady 3 -dimensional flow that characterises typical flapping <b>wing</b> <b>flight.</b> Therefore, before attempting to model a flapping wing MAV and analyse its stability, it is beneficial to consider previous studies carried out. The paper examines hover capable flapping <b>wing</b> <b>flight</b> as presented in previous work. The kinematics and aerodynamics seen in nature and the resulting control methods are explored. The paper additionally looks at existing modelling methods used to study the aerodynamics and overall vehicle behaviour of a hypothetical MAV with an aim to introduce the terminology and specifics of MAV flight, as well as give {{a brief description of the}} work done to date in flapping wing modelling. The paper ends by examining methods used to analyse stability of flapping wing models and demonstrates the suitability of bifurcation and continuation methods in determining stability behaviour of flapping <b>wing</b> <b>flight</b> dynamics models...|$|R

5|$|Composite {{materials}} make up 43% of the airframe, and the proprotor blades {{also use}} composites. For storage, the V-22's rotors fold in 90 seconds and its wing rotates to align, front-to-back, with the fuselage. Due to {{the requirement for}} folding rotors, their 38-foot diameter is 5 feet less than optimal for vertical takeoff, resulting in high disk loading. Most missions use fixed <b>wing</b> <b>flight</b> 75% {{or more of the}} time, reducing wear and tear and operational costs. This fixed <b>wing</b> <b>flight</b> is higher than typical helicopter missions allowing longer range line-of-sight communications for improved command and control.|$|R
