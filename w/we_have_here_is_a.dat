Others followed later, including Nattuvanar Appaswamy and his dancer wife Kantimati, who had studied with Kannusamy and Vadively, {{two members of the}} Tanjore Quartet. After the death of Appaswamy in 1939, Kantimati and their son, Guru Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar, left Baroda to teach in Lucknow, and then worked in the film industry in South India until Sayajirao's successor, Pratapsinhrao Gaekwad recalled the family to Baroda in 1949 to teach in the Music Department in the Kalavan Palace, later absorbed into the Maharaja Sayajirao University (Gaston 1996: 158-160). Later Guruvarya Shri Kubernath Tanjorkar established his own Institute, the Tanjore Dance Music & Art Research Centre at Baroda with his son Guru Shri Ramesh Tanjorkar and Guru Smt. Leela R. Tanjorkar (Kubernath Tanjorkar's family is devoted to Bharatnatyam dance now including their grandsons Rajesh and Ashish). So what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tradition of very distinguished Bharatanatyam dancers and teachers, members of a family considered an offshoot of the Tanjore Quartet bani (stylistic schools; Gaston 1996: 159), already established in Gujarat by the time Mrinalini set up her own academy. Yet {{there is a sense that}} what she did was not new.|$|E
500|$|Empire {{gave the}} film five stars out of five, commenting, [...] "You'll be lost for words." [...] Lisa Kennedy of the Denver Post gave the film full marks for its humane qualities and craftsmanship: [...] "It is an intelligent, winning drama {{fit for a}} king – {{and the rest of}} us", she said. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars, commenting that [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{superior}} historical drama and a powerful personal one." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave four stars out of five, stating, [...] "Tom Hooper's richly enjoyable and handsomely produced movie... is a massively confident crowd-pleaser." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E

5000|$|Steve Barton from Dread Central {{awarded the}} film {{two and a}} half out of five, writing, [...] "If you’re looking for a true crime version of Gein’s story, look elsewhere.

500|$|On a mixed note, Toure of Rolling Stone {{stated that}} the album's [...] "few sublime moments {{outweigh}} the lackluster album around them," [...] further praising [...] "Prettyman" [...] for being [...] "a roaring up-tempo number" [...] but panning [...] "Undisputed" [...] and [...] "Hot Wit' U" [...] for being [...] "the worst of his nineties work". Eamon Sweeney from Hot Press was also mixed in his review, stating that it [...] "would be hard to name another artist who can produce such a perfect soundtrack", but found at times that the singer [...] "ha lost his magic". Similarly, Robin Rothman of Village Voice enjoyed the collaborations, but opined that they would [...] "be better described as augmentations". In a very negative review, a critic from NME stated [...] "To paraphrase Woody Allen, genius is like a shark; it has to move forward or it dies. And what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> patchily impressive, fleetingly satisfying, but very, very dead shark". In a list compiled by staff members from Stereogum ranking the singer's albums out of thirty positions, they listed Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic at number 25. The site's consensus stated that among the album's tracks, his cover of [...] "Everyday Is a Winding Road" [...] was the only highlight.|$|E

2500|$|A more mixed review from Karina Longworth of The Village Voice said: [...] "We get {{a fairly}} typical Hollywood {{flattening}} of history, with powerful villains and disenfranchised heroes." [...] Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail, giving the film {{two out of}} four stars, said: [...] "Typically, this sort of film is an earnest tear-jerker with moments of levity. Instead, what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> raucous rib-tickler with occasional pauses for a little dramatic relief." [...] Referring to the film as a [...] "big, ole slab of honey-glazed hokum", The New York Times noted that [...] "save for Ms. Davis's, however, the performances are almost all overly broad, sometimes excruciatingly so, characterized by loud laughs, bugging eyes and pumping limbs." ...|$|E

5000|$|Dread Central {{gave the}} movie 4 stars and wrote that [...] "Be My Cat takes meta-filmmaking to mind-bending levels and plays out like an arthouse snuff film. Simply calling it unique is an understatement.

6000|$|The Note-Books {{show that}} the plan of an English romance, turning upon {{the fact that an}} {{emigrant}} to America had carried away a family secret which should give his descendant the power to ruin the family in the mother country, had occurred to Hawthorne as early as April, 1855. In August of the same year he visited Smithell's Hall, in Bolton le Moors, concerning which he had already heard its legend of [...] "The Bloody Footstep," [...] and from that time on, the idea of this footprint on the threshold-stone of the ancestral mansion seems to have associated itself inextricably with the dreamy substance of his yet unshaped romance. Indeed, it leaves its mark broadly upon Sibyl Dacy's wild legend in [...] "Septimius Felton," [...] and reappears in the last paragraph of that story. But, so far as we can know at this day, nothing definite was done until after his departure for Italy. It was then, while staying in Rome, that he began to put upon paper that plot which had first occupied his thoughts three years before, in the scant leisure allowed him by his duties at the Liverpool consulate. Of leisure there was not a great deal at Rome, either; for, as the [...] "French and Italian Note-Books" [...] show, sight-seeing and social intercourse took up a good deal of his time, and the daily record in his journal likewise had to be kept up. But he set to work resolutely to embody, so far as he might, his stray imaginings upon the haunting English theme, and to give them connected form. April 1, 1858, he began; and then nearly two weeks passed before he found an opportunity to resume; April 13th being the date of the next passage. By May he gets fully into swing, so that day after day, with but slight breaks, he carries on the story, always increasing in interest for us who read as for him who improvised. Thus it continues until May 19th, by which time he has made a tolerably complete outline, filled in with a good deal of detail here and there. Although the sketch is cast {{in the form of a}} regular narrative, one or two gaps occur, indicating that the author had thought out certain points which he then took for granted without making note of them. Brief scenes, passages of conversation and of narration, follow one another after the manner of a finished story, alternating with synopses of the plot, and queries concerning particulars that needed further study; confidences of the romancer to himself which form certainly a valuable contribution to literary history. The manuscript closes with a rapid sketch of the conclusion, and the way in which it is to be executed. Succinctly, what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> romance in embryo; one, moreover, that never attained to a viable stature and constitution. During his lifetime it naturally would not have been put forward as demanding public attention; and, in consideration of that fact, it has since been withheld from the press by the decision of his daughter, in whom the title to it vests. Students of literary art, however, and many more general readers will, I think, be likely to discover in it a charm all the greater for its being in parts only indicated; since, as it stands, it presents the precise condition of a work of fiction in its first stage. The unfinished [...] "Grimshawe" [...] was another development of the same theme, and the [...] "Septimius" [...] a later sketch, with a new element introduced. But the present experimental fragment, to which it has been decided to give the title of [...] "The Ancestral Footstep," [...] possesses a freshness and spontaneity recalling the peculiar fascination of those chalk or pencil outlines with which great masters in the graphic art have been wont to arrest their fleeting glimpses of a composition still unwrought.|$|E
