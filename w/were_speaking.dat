5|$|By the 12th century, Islam was the {{dominant}} {{religion in the}} Middle East. It is not certain, however, {{if it was the}} religion of the majority outside the Arabian Peninsula. Arabic was the language of high culture and of the urban population, although other languages dating to pre-Islamic rule were still being used to a certain extent. Most Egyptians <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> Arabic by the time the Ayyubids took power there.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scenes}} where the Sherpas <b>were</b> <b>speaking,</b> the show staff {{went to great}} lengths to find translations. Originally, the {{producers}} of the film adaption of the book Into Thin Air were contacted to help. The film producers were shocked at the trouble the Simpsons staff were going to, and replied that they had simply made up translations in the film. The staff then had to consult various experts by telephone.|$|E
5|$|Bok began {{a ten-year}} period of slavery {{at the hands}} of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to {{pastures}} in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father {{was not going to be}} able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him.|$|E

5|$|Fàbregas {{was fitted}} with a {{protective}} mask after breaking his nose in a collision with Charlie Adam during the reverse fixture on 4 April. Eight days later, he scored the only goal {{of the game in}} the 88th minute in a victory over Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. On 3 May, the day before his 28th birthday, he won his first Premier League title at the ninth attempt, following a 1–0 home win over Crystal Palace. During the penultimate game of the season, away at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion, Fàbregas was shown the red card and booed off by fans for deliberately kicking the ball at Chris Brunt's head while players <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> to referee Mike Jones. On appeal, the suspension for this red card was cut from three matches to one.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} of The Hills begins with Whitney Port {{becoming}} Lauren's boss, after being promoted within Teen Vogue. On their first day returning to work, Lauren informs Whitney of false speculation regarding a sex tape involving {{herself and her}} ex-boyfriend Jason Wahler. Lauren comments that she has not spoken with Heidi since she moved into an apartment with Spencer, and the women become suspicious of her possible involvement with the rumors. Meanwhile, Heidi and Spencer are planning their housewarming party; Spencer plans on inviting several of his friends, while Heidi was only planning on inviting Lauren, Whitney, and Audrina Patridge. Visiting Audrina at Epic Records unannounced, she delivers invitations for Audrina and Lauren. Audrina accepts the invitations, although later tells her co-worker that she believes that Heidi and Spencer <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> badly of Lauren and were responsible for spreading the sex tape rumors.|$|E
5|$|Okabe did {{not want}} to use {{traditional}} lyrics, as he felt they would clash with the design of the world in the game, and wanted to use a variety of languages to represent the open nature of the game's world. He also {{did not want}} easily recognizable lyrics to be sung in the background while the characters <b>were</b> <b>speaking,</b> and for any noticeable words to instead evoke emotions in the player. Evans only knew English, Japanese, and French when she began the project; she listened to the other languages on YouTube to learn the rhythms and sounds of the languages and then mixed and changed them. Okabe largely allowed Evans to decide how to integrate the lyrics with the early forms of the songs, and as he usually did not know where the songs would be used in the game gave her only light direction as to the emotional tone for the songs. The composers often would modify the songs in later revisions to follow how Evans had sung for that song.|$|E

25|$|What {{he has got}} to {{understand}} is that we <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because of yesterday.

25|$|Alexander II's reign {{brought a}} policy of {{establishing}} schools in every parish: 400 rural schools were founded in the 1860s in Bessarabia, but the Orthodox Church insisted everything be taught in Russian, whereas neither priests (who were teachers in most villages) nor pupils <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> it. Thus, by the 1880s only 23 schools remained.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, when a {{false belief}} {{involves}} a value judgment, {{it is only}} considered a delusion if it is so extreme that it cannot be, or never can be proven true.

25|$|Pidgin Delaware {{was used}} by both Munsee and Unami Delawares in {{interactions}} with speakers of Dutch, Swedish, and English. Some non-Delaware users of the pidgin were {{under the impression that}} they <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> true Delaware. Material cited by William Penn as being from a Delaware language is in fact from Delaware Pidgin, and he was apparently unaware of the difference between real Delaware and Pidgin Delaware.|$|E
25|$|The Norwegian {{commentator}} for NRK was Synnøve Svabø.

25|$|The {{most popular}} trance {{lecturer}} {{prior to the}} American Civil War was Cora L. V. Scott (1840–1923). Young and beautiful, her appearance on stage fascinated men. Her audiences were struck by the contrast between her physical girlishness and the eloquence with which she spoke of spiritual matters, and found in that contrast support for the notion that spirits <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> through her. Cora married four times, and on each occasion adopted her husband's last name. During her period of greatest activity, she was known as Cora Hatch.|$|E
25|$|The Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005 (Cth) was {{introduced}} into the Australian House of Representatives on 2 November 2005 by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Kevin Andrews. The Australian Labor Party claimed it was not provided with enough copies of the Bill when it entered the House and mounted a campaign against the Bill in the House throughout the day. During Question Time, Opposition members continually interjected while Government members <b>were</b> <b>speaking,</b> leading the Speaker (and later the Deputy Speaker) to remove 11 of them.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptians slowly {{adopted the}} Arabic {{language}} as a written language following the Arab-Muslim conquest of Egypt in the 7th century AD. Up until then, they <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> either Greek or Egyptian in its Coptic form. For more than three centuries, there existed a period of Coptic-Arabic bilingualism in Lower Egypt. This trend would last for many more centuries in the south. Arabic may have been already familiar to Egyptians through pre-Islamic trade with Bedouin Arab tribes in the Sinai Peninsula, and the easternmost part of the Nile Delta. Egyptian Arabic seems to have begun taking shape in Fustat, the first Islamic capital of Egypt, and now part of modern-day Cairo.|$|E

25|$|During {{several points}} in the Stammheim trial, the {{microphones}} were turned off while defendants <b>were</b> <b>speaking,</b> they were often expelled from the hall, and other actions were taken. It was later revealed that the conversation they had between them as well with their attorneys were recorded. Finally it was reported by both the defendants' attorneys {{and some of the}} prison's doctors, that the physical and psychological state of the prisoners held in solitary confinement and white cells was such that they couldn't attend the long trial days and defend themselves appropriately. By the time the Stammheim trial began in early 1975, some of the prisoners had already been in solitary confinement for three years.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} in {{determining}} whether the Cimbri <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> a Celtic or a Germanic language is {{that at this time}} the Greeks and Romans tended to refer to all groups to the north of their sphere of influence as Gauls, Celts, or Germani rather indiscriminately. Caesar seems {{to be one of the}} first authors to distinguish the two groups, and he had a political motive for doing so (it was an argument in favour of the Rhine border). Yet, one cannot always trust Caesar and Tacitus when they ascribe individuals and tribes to one or the other category, although Caesar made clear distinctions between the two cultures. Most ancient sources categorize the Cimbri as a Germanic tribe, but some ancient authors include the Cimbri among the Celts.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they <b>were</b> <b>speaking</b> to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
