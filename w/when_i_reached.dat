25|$|In 1959, Cruyff's {{father died}} from a heart attack. His father's death had {{a major impact on}} his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, “My father died when I was just 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept {{stronger}} over me that I would die at the same age and, when I had serious heart problems <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to help my father, kept me alive.” Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats. His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.|$|E
500|$|Tavevele Noa was {{the sole}} male {{athletic}} competitor to compete for Tuvalu at the London Olympics {{at the age of}} 20. He had not taken part in any previous Olympic Games. Noa qualified for the Games by using a wildcard after competing in an event on Tuvalu's main island and was selected {{to take part in the}} men's 100 metres dash. In an interview before the Games he said he was looking to competing in the Olympics and felt nervous but aimed to establish a new personal best time. Noa was drawn in the second heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing sixth out of seven runners, with a time of 11.55 seconds. He finished ahead of Timi Garstang of the Marshall Islands (12.81 seconds) but behind Palau's Rodman Teltull (11.06 seconds) in a heat led by Jurgen Themen from Suriname (10.55 seconds). Overall Noa finished 72nd out of 76 participants and did not advance to the later stages after being 0.75 slower than the slowest athlete in his heat who progressed. After his event he stated: [...] "My race was not good, my aim was to get 10 seconds. The start of my race was good but then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> 60 meters, I let it down." ...|$|E
500|$|With [...] over [...] {{still to}} travel before the {{relative}} safety of Hut Point, Crean and Lashly began hauling Evans on the sledge, [...] "eking out {{his life with}} the last few drops of brandy that they still had with them". On 18 February they arrived at Corner Camp, still [...] from Hut Point, with [...] {{only one or two}} days' food rations left and still four or five days' man-hauling to do. They then decided that Crean should go on alone, to fetch help. With only a little chocolate and three biscuits to sustain him, without a tent or survival equipment, Crean walked the distance to Hut Point in 18hours, arriving in a state of collapse to find Atkinson there, with the dog driver Dmtri Gerov. Crean reached safety just ahead of a fierce blizzard, which probably would have killed him, and which delayed the rescue party by a day and a half. Atkinson led a successful rescue, and Lashly and Evans were both brought to base camp alive. Crean modestly played down the significance of his feat of endurance. In a rare written account, he wrote in a letter: [...] "So it fell to my lot to do the 30miles for help, and only a couple of biscuits and a stick of chocolate to do it. Well, sir, I was very weak <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> the hut." ...|$|E

[...] Another of his critics was Franklin Foer of The New Republic, who first noted Cockburn's response: To be fair, Cockburn doesn't exactly endorse these theories. Rather, by noting that all of these Jewish conspiracy stories are [...] "sloshing around the news," [...] Cockburn seems merely to be pointing out that, hey, anti-Semitic ideas are still out there today — so why the shock that [...] endorsed them 30 years ago?
