5|$|Among moths with deimatic behaviour, the {{eyed hawkmoth}} (Smerinthus ocellatus) {{displays}} its large eyespots, moving them slowly {{as if it}} were a vertebrate predator such as an owl. Among butterflies, the peacock butterfly Aglais io is a cryptic leaf mimic <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> closed, but displays 4 conspicuous eyespots when disturbed, in a display effective against insectivorous birds (flycatchers).|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight progress is rather indirect. Their flight pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> curved and tail pointing down.|$|E
5|$|Green Wings {{title is}} said to have come from a small plastic green man <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> that was in {{executive}} producer Peter Fincham's top pocket, and fell on Pile's desk. Fincham claimed it was not his, so Pile kept it. This plastic man appears {{at the end of the}} credits on every show.|$|E
40|$|Physical, mechanical, and {{chemical}} properties of Shorea robusta seed <b>with</b> <b>wing,</b> seed without wing, and kernel were investigated {{in the present}} work. The physico-chemical composition of sal oil was also analyzed. The physico-mechanical properties and proximate composition of seed <b>with</b> <b>wing,</b> seed without wing, and kernel at three moisture contents of 9. 50 % (w. b), 9. 54 % (w. b), and 12. 14 % (w. b), respectively, were studied. The {{results show that the}} moisture content of the kernel was highest as compared to seed <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> and seed without wing. The sphericity of the kernel was closer to that of a sphere as compared to seed <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> and seed without wing. The hardness of the seed <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> (32. 32, N/mm) and seed without wing (42. 49, N/mm) was lower than the kernels (72. 14, N/mm). The proximate composition such as moisture, protein, carbohydrates, oil, crude fiber, and ash content were also determined. The kernel (30. 20 %, w/w) contains higher oil percentage as compared to seed <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> and seed without wing. The scientific data from this work are important for designing of equipment and processes for post-harvest value addition of sal seeds...|$|R

50|$|Wing {{loading of}} parachutes is {{measured}} similarly {{to that of}} aircraft, comparing exit weight to area of parachute fabric. Typical wing loading for students, accuracy competitors, and BASE jumpers is less than 5 kg per square meter - often 0.3 kilograms per square meter or less. Most student skydivers fly <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> loading below 5 kg per square meter. Most sport jumpers fly <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> loading between 5 and 7 kg per square meter, but many interested in performance landings exceed this wing loading. Professional Canopy pilots compete <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> loading of 10 to over 15 kilograms per square meter. While ram-air parachutes <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> loading higher than 20 kilograms per square meter have been landed, this is strictly the realm of professional test jumpers.|$|R

5|$|Three {{of the six}} prion {{species have}} bills filled with lamellae, which act as filters to sift {{zooplankton}} from the water. Water is forced through the lamellae and small prey items are collected. This technique is often {{used in conjunction with}} a method known as hydroplaning where the bird dips its bill beneath the surface and propels itself forward <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> and feet as if walking on the water.|$|E
5|$|When a mouse {{or other}} prey is spotted, the kite drops silently onto it, feet-first <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> raised high; {{sometimes}} in one long drop to ground level, {{more often in}} two or more stages, with hovering pauses at intermediate heights. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. Prey can either be eaten in flight or carried back to a perch. Birds will have a favoured feeding perch, beneath which accumulate piles of pellets or castings.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} at its roosting site, {{an angry}} barn owl lowers {{its head and}} sways it from side to side, or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak. A defensive attitude involves lying {{flat on the ground}} or crouching <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> spread out.|$|E

40|$|The {{equations}} of {{the ultimate}} strength for a column <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> walls in both sides which have been generally used, are not always estimated with accuracy, {{as compared to the}} ultimate strength for rectangular columns, because of the complicated section of the column. Moreover, those equations have been applied to columns <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> wall in one side. The sections of the columns <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> walls in both sides are symmetric, whereas those columns with in one side are unsymmetric. Accordingly, it is assumed that these two types of columns are different in failure patterns and deformation behaviors. The object {{of this paper is to}} investigate the strength and deformation behaviors of the four types of concrete columns <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> wall in one side, and to present a satisfactory equation {{of the ultimate}} strength for the columns wkth wing wall in one side. ...|$|R
40|$|In the Low Speed Wind Tunnel (LST) of DNW {{detailed}} wake {{surveys were}} made behind an aircraft model (ALVAST) using a rake with 5 -hole probes. Different model configurations were considered including a body <b>with</b> <b>wing,</b> a body <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> and a Through Flow Nacelle (TFN) {{and a body}} <b>with</b> <b>wing</b> and a low-powered CRUF (Counter Rotating Ultra-high-bypass Fan).

The spanwise distributions of lift, viscous drag and induced drag are presented...|$|R
5|$|Biggs and Wedge, {{inspired}} by two Star Wars {{characters of the}} same name, appear in numerous titles as minor characters, sometimes as comic relief. The later titles in the series feature several males with effeminate characteristics. Recurring creatures include Chocobos and Moogles. Chocobos are large, often flightless birds that appear in several installments {{as a means of}} long-distance travel for characters. Moogles, on the other hand, are white, stout creatures resembling teddy bears <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> and a single antenna. They serve different capacities in games including mail delivery, weaponsmiths, party members, and saving the game. Chocobo and Moogle appearances are often accompanied by specific musical themes that have been arranged differently for separate titles.|$|E
5|$|Breeding is {{normally}} from late May to August, {{but may be}} significantly earlier in northwest Africa or western Pakistan. Returning males arrive about {{two weeks before the}} females and establish territories which they patrol <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> held in a V-shape and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Fights may take place in flight or on the ground. The male's display flight involves a similar wing and tail position with frequent wing clapping as he follows the female in a rising spiral. If she lands, he continues to display with bobbing and fluttering until the female spreads her wings and tail for copulation. Mating occasionally takes place on a raised perch instead of the ground. In good habitat, there may be 20pairs per square kilometre (50per square mile).|$|E
5|$|Horses are {{frequently}} seen in television, films and literature. They are sometimes featured {{as a major}} character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories. Both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products. The horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, {{in a variety of}} poses and equipment. The mythologies of many cultures, including Greco-Roman, Hindu, Islamic, and Norse, include references to both normal horses and those <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon the horse to draw the chariots of the Moon and Sun. The horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar.|$|E

5|$|In {{the court}} case, {{it was also}} cited that the design for winged {{toasters}} was not original and that the Berkeley Systems' design was itself derived from the Jefferson Airplane album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland, which also used flying toasters adorned <b>with</b> <b>wings.</b> Berkeley argued that the firm {{was unaware of the}} previous artwork until 1991, and that the album cover's toasters had clocks in addition to their wings. Jefferson Airplane later sued Berkeley Systems in turn {{for the use of the}} same flying toaster emblem. The rock group lost the case as they did not trademark the album cover at the time of publication.|$|E
5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} flies solitarily, <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> held in a {{dihedral}} position. It glides at a low altitude over wetlands while locating food, and perches on {{fence posts}} or on other low perches. When flying, it travels alone and is rarely found in groups. The flight of the lesser yellow-headed {{is an example of}} static soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings. This vulture rarely soars high in the air, preferring low altitudes. This bird is believed to be somewhat migratory in response to the changes in water level where it lives. The lesser yellow-headed vulture, like other New World vultures, has the unusual habit of urohidrosis, in which it urinates or defecates on its legs to cool them by evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} dry, open country with some trees and small bushes, such as heaths, forest clearings or newly planted woodland. The male European nightjar occupies a territory {{in spring and}} advertises his presence with a distinctive sustained churring trill from a perch. He patrols his territory <b>with</b> <b>wings</b> held in a V and tail fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Wing clapping also occurs when the male chases the female in a spiralling display flight. The European nightjar does not build a nest, and its two grey and brown blotched eggs are laid directly on the ground; they hatch after about 17–21 days and the downy chicks fledge in another 16–17 days.|$|E
