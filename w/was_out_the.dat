5|$|In 194849, Ray, who {{had made}} only 190 runs {{at an average of}} 21.11 in his debut season, was not {{selected}} for a single match, while Merv's only first-class outings were two matches for a second-choice team against Tasmania while the leading players were participating in Shield fixtures at the same time. Mick was selected as an opener for Victoria’s first three Shield matches, and played with Neil in these matches. However, he struggled and made only 91 runs at 15.16 and was then dropped. In six innings, the two brothers batted together only twice, even though they batted in successive batting positions; Mick's poor form meant he was usually the first batsman out, bringing his younger brother to the crease. In the first match of the season, against Queensland, Mick was the first wicket to fall on each occasion. In the second match, the brothers shared partnerships. In the first innings, Neil came in at 1/8 and the Harveys put on 39 runs before Merv <b>was</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> second innings proceeded similarly as Neil came in at 1/31 and 40 runs were added before the older Harvey fell. In the third match of the season, Mick was out for 4 and 12 before Neil came in and was subsequently dropped.|$|E

25|$|Webster {{became the}} captain of Cricket Australia XI for the 2017–18 JLT One-Day Cup. In the first match of the cup against South Australia he scored 121, his first List A century to help lead Cricket Australia XI to just the second win in the team's history. His 229-run {{partnership}} with Jake Carder was the fourth-highest second-wicket partnership {{in the history of}} Australia's domestic List A competition. He was named the player of the match for his efforts. He again top scored for Cricket Australia XI against Western Australia with 52, but after he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> team suffered a major batting collapse and lost comprehensively by 9 wickets. He was Cricket Australia XI's top run scorer for the cup with 247 runs at an average of 41.16.|$|E

25|$|From there, the {{situation}} deteriorated for Zimbabwe. Chris Mpofu injured {{his leg and}} had to go off the field, leaving only three bowlers, whom Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori attacked with venom. Both reached their centuries in less than 100 balls, Vettori smacking twenty fours and two sixes in his 127 before finally being bowled by Streak. Vettori had enjoyed a slice of luck - having inside edged onto his leg stump, the bail refused to fall down, and Vettori made a further 60. By the time he <b>was</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> score had exploded to 432 for 9 - helped by Shane Bond's blitzing 41. At stumps on day one, New Zealand were 452 for 9, and comfortably back in the drivers' seat, as Zimbabwe were left to rue all the poor deliveries in the evening session - which had yielded 213 runs.|$|E
25|$|For the 2005 Ashes series, {{three players}} – Bell, Graham Thorpe and Kevin Pietersen – {{were in the}} running for two spots in the team, and Bell and Pietersen were {{preferred}} to Thorpe. Before the first Test at Lord's, Bell's test average was 297, rising to 303 just before he <b>was</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> sixth highest average at any point of a player's career of all time. Bell failed {{in the first two}} matches, at Lord's and Edgbaston, but in the third Test at Old Trafford he overcame early struggles against Shane Warne to post a half-century in each innings. However, he only scored six runs in four innings in the fourth and fifth Tests, including a pair at the Oval, leaving him with a batting average for the series of only 17.10, by far the lowest of the English batsmen. He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 2006 New Year Honours. Despite England winning the Ashes back and being appointed MBE, Bell has since described the 2005 Ashes as a low point during which he doubted himself.|$|E
25|$|Wild Cat Exchanged for Crown Prince (狸貓換太子): Bao Zheng {{met a woman}} {{claiming}} to be {{the mother of the}} reigning Emperor Renzong. Dozens of years prior, she had been Consort Li, an imperial concubine of Emperor Zhenzong's, before falling out of favour for supposedly giving birth to a bloody dead wild cat. In reality, the jealous Consort Liu had plotted with eunuch Guo Huai (郭槐) to secretly swap Li's infant with a skinned wildcat minutes after the birth and ordered palace maid Kou Zhu to kill the baby. However, Kou gave the baby to chief eunuch Chen Lin (陳琳), who secretly brought the child to the Eighth Prince, a younger brother of Emperor Zhenzong. Kou was later tortured to death by Guo when Consort Liu began to suspect that the infant had survived. The child was raised by the Eighth Prince as his own son and was subsequently selected to succeed Emperor Zhenzong, who had died heirless. Due to the passage of time, gathering evidence was a challenge. With the help of a woman dressed as Kou's ghost, Bao dressed himself as Yama, lord of Hell, to play on both Guo's fear of the supernatural and guilt, thereby extracting his confession. When the verdict <b>was</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> emperor was reluctant to accept Consort Li. Bao then admonished the emperor and ordered that he be beaten for lack of filial piety. The emperor's Dragon Robe was beaten instead. Emperor Renzong eventually accepted his mother and elevated her as the new empress dowager.|$|E

25|$|Even in the non-international tour matches, Lawry's {{team could}} not escape controversy. The next match against South Zone at Bangalore {{generated}} more allegations of cheating. Australia's reserve wicketkeeper Ray Jordon claimed that Alan Connolly had bowled Prasanna. Prasanna disagreed but eventually walked after Jordon repeatedly insisted that he <b>was</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> Australians then had an altercation {{in the dressing room}} after some members accused Jordon of cheating, asserting that the delivery had missed the stumps. Lawry scored 120 in the first innings, his only century of the tour, as his colleagues collapsed to be all out for 195. This gave South a 44-run lead and they declared at 6/255 on the final day. Australia needed to bat for only two hours on the final day to salvage a draw, but a collapse had them at 8/90 with an hour left with Lawry still at the crease. Gleeson came out to bat and talked with both umpires at length before taking guard; he later claimed to teammates that he had threatened to hit the umpires in the head if they gave him out. Gleeson then padded every ball away without attempting a shot, but every leg before wicket appeal was rejected. In an attempt to waste time, Lawry pulled away from the wicket when a woman in a colourful sari walked into front of the sightscreen, leading to allegations that he had insulted Indian womanhood. In any case, the crowd expressed dismay at the Australian tactics by rioting and throwing rocks at the players. The match ended early because of the crowd trouble and Australia avoided being the first international team to lose to an Indian zone.|$|E
25|$|England added just 25 more {{runs for}} their last two wickets {{at the start}} of Day 2, Hilfenhaus {{trapping}} Anderson LBW for 0 in the second over of the day (ending his 54 innings sequence without a duck), before dismissing Broad for 37. Shane Watson and Simon Katich took Australia to 66/0 before rain forced lunch to be taken three minutes early, with the resumption of play delayed until almost 14:30. After lunch the Australian openers lasted just two overs before the start of a massive Broad-inspired batting collapse. First to fall was Watson, LBW on 34, then Ricky Ponting was deceived by a cutter from Broad and played onto his own stumps for just eight runs. Michaels Hussey and Clarke were next to go, Hussey LBW for a duck, before Clarke was caught low at short extra cover by Jonathan Trott. After a spell in which Broad took four wickets for just eight runs, Swann returned to the attack and immediately took the wicket of Marcus North, although replays subsequently showed that the Australian number 6 got an inside edge to the ball before it struck his pad. Katich reached his half-century in the 37th over of the innings, but <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> very next ball, caught by Alastair Cook at short leg. Broad completed his five-wicket haul in the 39th over, bowling Brad Haddin to give him wicket-to-wicket figures of 5/19 and leave only the Australian bowlers to dismiss. Swann took the next two wickets – albeit that of Stuart Clark was given incorrectly – leaving it to Flintoff to bowl Hilfenhaus and end the Australian innings for 160 runs. The English openers returned to the crease and put on 27 before Cook edged North to first slip for just nine. Mitchell Johnson then combined well with Simon Katich at short leg for the next two wickets, Katich catching Bell low before Johnson thumped a bouncer into Collingwood, looping the ball up for Katich to catch easily, leaving the home side at 39/3. Nevertheless, Strauss and Trott recovered well to take England into the third day at 58/3.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, {{the first}} stretch of M-115 was {{designated}} from Frankfort to Benzonia. Beginning in the mid-1930s, construction of M-115 began from central to northwestern Lower Michigan. [...] In 1936, an earthen highway was opened between {{the south side}} of Cadillac to M-66, with additional sections west of Mesick and northwest of US10. By the end of the year, the state was paving the earthen section, completed a gravel highway near Mesick and opened an earthen section in Clare County. The section from Copemish to northwest of Mesick was opened as an earthen highway the next year. Construction started in early 1938 to connect Benzonia to Copemish, and before the year <b>was</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> Michigan State Highway Department started work to fill in the gap between M-66 and the highway north of US10 in Clare County.

40|$|<b>Being</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop <b>is</b> a form {{of partial}} ostracism that leads to lower need {{satisfaction}} (Jones, Carter-Sowell, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 2009). Research has shown that people experience lower need satisfaction when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop on pop culture (Iannone, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, in preparation). Five studies expanded on previous research by exploring theoretical issues and potential boundary conditions. Study 1 developed a new method and explored theoretical foundations of being <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop on pop culture - whether being unfamiliar makes people feel worse or whether being familiar makes people feel better. This study also looked at whether {{people need to be}} told that others recognize the pop culture stimuli. Study 2 explored whether the feeling of failure associated with feeling <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop can be eliminated, or whether they coexist. Studies 3 - 5 explored potential boundary conditions of being <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop on pop culture: who people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop from, what people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop on, and when people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop. These studies replicated previous findings of lower need satisfaction when <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop on pop culture while also demonstrating that 1) being unfamiliar with pop culture makes people feel worse rather than being familiar with pop culture making people feel better 2) failure and feeling <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop may coexist and 3) individuals feel bad regardless of who they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop from, what they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop on, and when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> loop. These findings suggest that being unfamiliar with pop culture may be extremely negative, as no factors seem to ameliorate the negative effects...|$|R

2500|$|By {{the early}} 8th century, {{notwithstanding}} the shrinking {{territory of the}} empire, Constantinople remained the largest and the wealthiest city of the entire world, comparable only to Sassanid Ctesiphon, and later Abassid Baghdad. The population of the imperial capital fluctuated between 300,000 and 400,000 as the emperors undertook measures to restrain its growth. The only other large Christian cities were Rome (50,000) and Salonika (30,000).

The New York Times report of the incident described how the monument provided a play area for neighborhood children: [...] " [...] score of children, white and black, who live in the neighborhood were using the granite coping of the walls leading to the crypt as a sort of 'chute the chutes.' The color line was sharply drawn. The slope of one side was used by the negro children while the slope of the other side amused the whites. The children of neither hue were concerned with the crime.
