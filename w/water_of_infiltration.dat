This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the permeable pavement constructed topdown by porous asphalt, compacted natural grading base materials, in-situ soil blended with coarse sand, and geotextile with crushed gravel. The permeable pavement was paved on the field testing site where it was installed a rainfall simulation device to control the intensity of rainfall. The coefficient of permeability and water content for each layer were collected {{as well as the}} volumetric <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>infiltration</b> and surface run-off. Test results show that the permeability of surface layer was degrading severely after nine years in service, while base and subbase remained functional. While rainfall simulation of 124 mm/hr performed, the permeable pavement can retain 0. 2139 m 3 of water with infiltration and surface run-off measured by 0. 4665 m 3 and 0. 1413 m 3, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to compare the rate <b>of</b> <b>infiltration</b> and {{cumulative}} infiltration in permanent grassland (PG) and in arable land {{over the course of the}} 2011 growing season. The measurement <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>infiltration</b> into soil was conducted via ponded infiltration method based on the use of two concentric cylinders in field conditions. Kostiakov equations were applied to evaluate the ponded infiltration. Based on field measurements, the dependence <b>of</b> <b>infiltration</b> rate (v) on time (t) was determined and also the dependence <b>of</b> cumulative <b>infiltration</b> (i) on time (t). In order to determine physical properties of soil and carry out a grain size analysis, intact soil samples of plough layer from the depths of 10, 20 and 30 [*]cm were collected using Kopecký cylinders along with individual infiltration attempt in each measurement carried out on experimental plots. In order to assess the <b>infiltration</b> capacity <b>of</b> soil on experimental plots, four measurements were conducted, each with three repetitions. Infiltration attempts were held on May 12, June 28, August 24 and October 6, 2011. On average, a faster water infiltration into soil and a higher cumulative infiltration during the 2011 growing period were detected in arable land. The soil’s initial water content has proven to be the crucial factor affecting the rate <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>infiltration</b> into soil in case of PG; in case of arable land, it was bulk density indicating the soil’s compaction. The PG showed a more balanced course <b>of</b> <b>infiltration</b> rate and cumulative infiltration values during the growing season.

Aero-infiltrometer was used to measure both the variations of f and θ at three natural soil sites to contribute to operational water management issues and soil texture identification.

For the pure Brownian motion without any dynamical load, we find two water molecules per nanosecond flux, while the flux induced by the unidirectional motion can be several times enhanced, depending on the external force. The Brownian motion {{is similar to the}} physical mechanism of osmotic pressure, and the unidirectional motion shows great performance that has huge applications for reverse osmosis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{potential}} for application of GIScience techniques {{and technologies is}} increasingly being realized by a multitude of diverse domains. This paper reports on one such application {{in the domain of}} building diagnostics, a subfield of the broader economic sector of building construction. A pressing issue in building diagnostics is the detection <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>infiltration,</b> a condition that can cause significant damage to the structure of the home and the health of its inhabitants. One source <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>infiltration</b> stems from the failure of the home’s chimney pan, a flashing used externally on the chimney for the purpose <b>of</b> diverting rain <b>water</b> away from the chimney flue while allowing smoke to escape from the fireplace. The possibility of remotely detecting chimney pan failure as a proxy for water infiltration in residential structures is discussed. A model with multiple variants is offered that uses a combination of remote sensing and GIS methods to detect and extract the locations of failed chimney pans. The feasibility of implementing this model is then addressed, describing both technical and ethical impediments to successful remote monitoring of chimney pan failure. Of the variants, remote detection of chimney pan reflectance using high-resolution aerial photography in a suburban context appears to be the most promising possibility...|$|R

Zhang Abstract: The Gouhou Dam was a concrete-faced rockfill dam {{built in a}} steep canyon that collapsed in 1993 due to internal erosion during the initial reservoir filling. In this paper, the process <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>infiltration</b> into the originally un-saturated rockfill dam is studied using three-dimensional saturated–unsaturated seepage theory. The three-dimensional characteristics of seepage through the dam bounded by steep abutments, the effect of material anisotropy, {{and the effect of}} rockfill stratifications are studied. The three-dimensional results are compared with those from two-dimensional anal-yses. The three-dimensional simulations show that seepage water flows faster and the hydraulic gradients are greater near the abutment boundary in the dam. As such, the evolution of the seepage failure in the three-dimensional cases is faster than that in the two-dimensional analyses, and the two-dimensional analyses will underestimate the risk of seep-age failure, particularly near the abutment boundary. If the materials in the dam were uniform, the reservoir water would infiltrate into the dam along a downward flow path towards the riverbed, and not exit from the surface on the downstream slope. Increasing the horizontal coefficient of permeability of the rockfill increases the infiltration velocity...|$|R
