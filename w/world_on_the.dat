5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the <b>world</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> categories of thought.|$|E
5|$|A Harry Potter themed {{attraction}} at a Universal Studios park or a Disney {{park was}} rumored in 2003. However, {{the rights to}} the Harry Potter franchise had been acquired by Warner Bros., who denied all the rumors. In 2001, Time Warner used this license to construct and operate the Harry Potter Movie Magic Experience at Warner Bros. Movie <b>World</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Gold Coast, Australia. The attraction was a small indoor walkthrough featuring many re-creations of locations in the first two movies. After two years of operation this attraction was removed.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside <b>world</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed {{on the western side}} {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E

5|$|James Fleming {{has written}} {{about the use of}} the postmodern {{tradition}} in 1602, and how this is employed; as a means to respond to the post-9/11 world in which the comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 <b>world.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological grounding to the text - a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario World was a {{critical}} and commercial success, hailed {{as one of the}} greatest video games of all time. It sold over 20 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling game on the SNES. It has been re-released multiple times, first as part of the 1994 compilation release Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario <b>World</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> SNES, and on the Game Boy Advance as Super Mario Advance 2 in 2002. It was later re-released as a Virtual Console title for the Wii, Wii U and New Nintendo 3DS consoles. The popularity of the game also inspired a short-lived animated television series and a direct sequel, Yoshi's Island, which was released in 1995.|$|E

5|$|The picture {{painted by}} the few and {{scattered}} {{references to the}} Cretan emirate from the Muslim <b>world,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, is of an ordered state with a regular monetary economy and extensive trade links, and {{there is evidence that}} Chandax was a cultural centre of some importance. The survival of numerous gold, silver, and copper coins, of almost constant weight and composition, testifies to a strong economy and a high living standard among the population. The economy was strengthened by extensive trade {{with the rest of the}} Muslim world, especially with Egypt, and by a booming agriculture: the need to sustain an independent state, as well as access to the markets of the Muslim world, led to an intensification of cultivation. It is also possible that sugar cane was introduced to Crete at the time.|$|E
