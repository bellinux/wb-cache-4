500|$|When Reba McEntire {{made her}} Grand Ole Opry debut on September 17, 1977, she almost {{did not make}} it in the door after a guard at the Opry gate missed her name on the night's list of performers. Her parents and older sister, Alice, drove 1,400 miles round trip from their Oklahoma home to see {{what turned out to be}} Reba's three-minute {{performance}} that night. Her act was cut from two songs to just one—"Invitation to the Blues"—because of a surprise appearance from Dolly Parton. McEntire was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry on January 17, 1986.

6000|$|Strether {{thought of}} it serenely. [...] "Yes; <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> little Bilham had shown me what's {{expected}} of a gentleman. Little Bilham had lied like one." ...|$|R
60|$|DR. JONATHAN. And {{it will be}} {{a better}} one <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|ASHER. You're in {{the army}} now, my boy. You can help me again <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|DEARTH. Alas, I am unavoidably detained. You {{will find}} {{me in the}} garden <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|LARRY. That was {{extremely}} improvident of her. [Beginning to reflect] But look here: <b>when</b> were <b>you</b> drunk? You were sober enough <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from the Round Tower with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{long are}} you going to remain at the Hall, Dick? <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>you</b> said {{something}} about going out West with your father to look up that mining claim in Colorado." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry {{they ever}} tried, M. Chapeau; but I {{remember}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> after taking Saumur, {{you told me}} {{the war was over}} then. You used to think that a great thing." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. You are a dear. Have a nice ride, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> I {{shall be}} all right.|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> {{from the}} wars {{it must be}} so {{delightful}} to you to flirt with the ladies again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Boltwood! Looking splendid, sir! New man! William Street {{better look}} to its laurels <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> {{and get into}} the game!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you remember,' said Merton, 'that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from [...] "The Seven Hunters," [...] you {{reported}} that the fishermen had a silly story of seeing a dragon flying above the empty sea?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{can they}} take you, if you won't go? And {{if you should}} go, what good would it do, if you were only to find me here <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> {{just the same as}} you left me?" ...|$|R
60|$|NORA [embarrassed]. Oh, only idle curiosity. I {{wanted to}} know whether you found Ireland--I mean the country part of Ireland, of course--very small and backwardlike <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to it from Rome and Oxford and all the great cities.|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy grinned. [...] "Then I {{guess the}} way that dam will grow will astonish you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> again. Where're you going to?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he agreed, {{a trifle}} dryly, [...] "I suppose there are. However, I shall {{probably}} have gone away <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; perhaps, dear boy. But I {{could not}} begin alone; {{it is so}} long since I rode. Perhaps <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from Ireland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Master. Still, oil {{is of no}} use {{without a}} lamp, or a soul without a body, at least here {{underneath}} the sun, or so we were taught who worship the Grasshopper. But, Master, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from all your hunting, what happened then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did," [...] {{said his}} father. [...] "You {{were out of}} the door before I quite {{realized}} what was going on, and it didn't seem altogether wise to commence talking <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> but that's not the point. You haven't answered my question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of the shortest, Sir Percy! Faith! how it {{must have}} altered! Was it three years ago or four that you saw me for one hour in Paris, {{on your way to}} the East? <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> two years later you had not {{forgotten}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] said Barringford philosophically. [...] "Those beans will grow, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> {{this way}} ag'in ye can pick 'em, Henry." ...|$|E

6000|$|Muriel {{was silent}} for a few moments, and then remarked: [...] "Self-denial such as you practised deserves a reward, and I met Mrs. Dalton while you were away.

6000|$|... "Oh--I have a secret. I {{was crazy}} to tell <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> That's why I was so silly about everything. I kept holding my secret back--gloating over it. But when Lassiter came I got an idea--that changed my mind. Then I hated to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How was I to know, Mr. Stebbing? You {{started off}} without a word to me, and all <b>you</b> told me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> was {{that the young man}} said he had posted the letter to his sister. I should like to know why he could not send it himself to the proper place!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right, lad. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> {{from your}} first trip, {{you can join}} the lodge, if you like. I and my girls are members." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That ain't the question," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "She's got {{a home and}} money. It don't matter about looks; and, wot's more, she ain't bound to keep you. If you take my advice, you won't dream of letting her know you run away from her. Say you was cast away at sea, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> years {{afterwards}} <b>you</b> couldn't find her." ...|$|R
6000|$|When the old king {{heard the}} news he welcomed him as a son, and made ready a feast, and all the court sat down.

6000|$|... "One moment, Grizel," [...] {{he said in}} a hard {{voice that}} filled her with apprehension. [...] "There must be no second mistake. In saying that love, and love alone, brought you back, you are admitting, are you not, that you were talking wildly about loss of pride and honour? You did the loveliest thing you have ever done <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back.</b> If I were you, my {{character}} would be ruined from this hour--I should feel so proud of myself." ...|$|R
