5000|$|Ziryab {{is said to}} have {{improved}} the Oud (or Laúd) by adding a fifth pair of strings, and using an eagle's beak or quill instead of a <b>wooden</b> <b>pick.</b> Ziryab also dyed the four strings a color to symbolize the Aristotelian humors, and the fifth string to represent the soul. [...] He {{is said to have}} created a unique and influential style of musical performance, and written songs that were performed in Iberia for generations. He was a great influence on Spanish music, and is considered the founder of the Andalusian music traditions of North Africa.|$|E
50|$|Bronze disease {{ranges from}} vivid green to pastel green. It is {{commonly}} {{present in all}} colours in this range due to the series of reactions that cause it and {{there may also be}} tiny, possibly microscopic, blue crystals. Bronze disease typically affects isolated patches of the object in severe cases being a visibly and tactilely raised bloom of microscopic crystals as well as being associated with pitting. The patches of bronze disease can be scraped off the surface using a fingernail or a <b>wooden</b> <b>pick.</b> These properties are all in comparison with verdigris, which is normally a duller shade, uniform across the whole of the affected object, and cannot be scratched off with wood or fingernails. Unlike bronze disease, verdigris serves to protect the metal.|$|E

They seized the poor simpleton and carried him to their master.|$|R
50|$|Each {{guitar pick}} {{made of wood}} has its own unique {{properties}} and signature sound {{as a result of}} differences in density, hardness and cellular structure. Most wood picks produce a warmer tone than plastics or metals. To withstand the rigors of picking and strumming only the hardest woods are used for picks—including hardwoods like African Blackwood, Bocote, Cocobolo, Lignum vitae, Rosewood, and Zebrawood. While the thick and sometimes rough edge of a <b>wooden</b> <b>pick</b> may create a fair amount of drag at first, wooden picks are generally easy to break in and may even do so quicker than plastic picks. After a couple of hundred strokes, the metal guitar strings wear down the edge and create a smoother pass over the strings.|$|E
5000|$|The sarod {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have descended from the Afghan rubab, a similar instrument originating in Central Asia and Afghanistan. Many scholars of Indian classical music believe that sarod {{is a combination of}} the ancient Chitra veena, the medieval Rabab and modern Sursingar. Some scholars even contend that a similar instrument may have existed about two thousand years ago in ancient India during the ages of the Gupta kings. In fact, a Gupta period coin depicts the great king Samudragupta playing a Veena, which many believe to be the precursor of the Sarod.The origin of most of the present Indian classical instruments along with the Sitar, Sarod and others lie in the ancient Indian instruments. They had the practice of adding the word Veena to every instrument like the Rudra Veena, Gayatri Veena, Saraswati Veena, Chitra Veena, Sarda Veena etc.The shape and appearance of the present Indian musical Instruments like the Sitar and Sarode with the decorated domes are exactly like the ancient musical instruments the Veenas. The Sarod originated from Sarda Veena, modified with time.There is a small Indian musical instrument also like a small sarod named Dotara which is quite ancient.As in the case of everything the present is only related to the ancient period, the origin of the present Indian musical instruments are related to the musical instruments of the past, the several Veenas..(Pg 6, Indian musical Instruments written by Sarodia Abanindra Maitra) [...]The present Indian Traces of similar Rabab style instruments can also be found in southern India, especially in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, where it is known as the Swarbat. The folk Rabab, an instrument popular in north India, had a wooden fingerboard, its strings were made of silk, cotton or gut, and it was played with a <b>wooden</b> <b>pick.</b> In history, reference is also made to a Sharadiya Veena from which the name Sarod may have been derived.|$|E

Various retained foreign bodies reported; are tooth fragments, root canal filling material, burs, sewing needles, broken tips of probes and elevators, <b>wooden</b> tooth <b>picks,</b> piece of glass, blades of grass, a tooth brush bristle, fish bone, hair, piece of straw or grass, portion of fingernail, spike of wheat, thorn and chicken pinfeather, surgical gauze. Some times these foreign bodies get infected and spontaneously come out through draining sinus. But very rarely {{it is possible}} that some might remain in the soft tissue and go unnoticed, causing persistent pus discharge, trismus, granuloma and osteomyelitis. This article describes three cases of retained wooden foreign bodies in cheek, parotid gland and tongue with their diagnosis and management...|$|R

In the present case, a 13 -year-old patient reported with complaints of pain {{and a history of}} inserting a foreign object into the root canal of the left central incisor. On examination the foreign body was found to be a stapler pin which was projecting 5 millimeters from the apical foramen. Foreign bodies discovered from the root canal have varied from radiolucent objects like <b>wooden</b> tooth <b>picks</b> or tooth brush bristles to radioopaque materials like paper pins, needles, pencil leads etc. In the present case, despite our best efforts, the patient did not agree to undergo any treatment except for the extraction of the left central incisor...|$|R

50|$|He {{is said to}} {{have been}} a weaver and the {{supposed}} house he lived is now converted to a temple. His wife's name is Vaasuki.There are lots of legends about the pair Thiruvalluvar and Vaasuki. Two of them are: 1) Once Vaasuki Ammaiyar was fetching water from well and Thiruvalluvar called her and she left the water and ran in immediately, but the water pot stayed in mid air. Such was her austerity and dedication towards her husband Thiruvalluvar; 2) Thiruvalluvar used to sit every day for meal with a cup of water and a <b>wooden</b> tooth <b>pick.</b> He did this to pick any grain of rice spilled out from his leaf when Vaasuki Ammaiyar served food. It was said that Thiruvalluvar could not even pick a grain of rice every day. Such was the dedication in serving meal by Vaasuki Ammaiyar.Thiruvalluvar may have spent part of his life in Madurai because it was under the Pandiya rulers that many Tamil poets flourished. There is also the recent claim by Kanyakumari Historical and Cultural Research Centre (KHCRC) that Valluvar was a king who ruled Valluvanadu in the hilly tracts of the Kanyakumari District of Tamil Nadu.|$|R
50|$|Railway {{electrification}} as a {{means of}} traction emerged {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century, although experiments in electric rail have been traced back to the mid-nineteenth century. Thomas Davenport, in Brandon, Vermont, erected a circular model railroad on which ran battery-powered locomotives (or locomotives running on battery-powered rails) in 1834. Robert Davidson, of Aberdeen, Scotland, created an electric locomotive in 1839 and ran it on the Edinburgh-Glasgow railway at 4 miles per hour. The earliest electric locomotives tended to be battery-powered. In 1880, Thomas Edison built a small electrical railway, using a dynamo as the motor and the rails as the current-carrying medium. The electric current flowed through the metal rim of otherwise <b>wooden</b> wheels, being <b>picked</b> up via contact brushes.|$|R
50|$|At The Nightrise headquarters, a <b>wooden</b> sampan <b>picked</b> {{up by the}} typhoon smashes {{into the}} Chairman's office and {{ironically}} kills the Chairman. Meanwhile, Lohan's men kill {{all but one of}} the Old Ones' agents, who is wounded but hides. Scott and Pedro travel through the door and the last Old One agent aims at Jamie, but Scott pushes him out of the way and the bullet hits Scarlett in the head, rendering her unconscious. Without Scarlett to hold the typhoon back, it unleashes its full strength on them and disintegrates the temple. Jamie and Scott, Richard and Scarlett, Pedro, and Matt and Lohan dash through the door moments before the temple is destroyed, escaping the typhoon. Then the storm finally abates, revealing Hong Kong completely destroyed (although all the pollution was swept away). All of the Five are separated all over the world with their partners, due to having no preassumed destination decided between all of them, also it is said that since the door collapsed as they were going through it, one final trick was played on them. Meanwhile, Chaos, the King of the Old Ones, prepares to commence the war to conquer the planet and wipe out humanity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{grasshoppers}} did {{not return}} {{in the spring of}} 1878 and they had not stayed long enough to lay their eggs the previous summer. In fact there has not been grasshopper plague in Minnesota or the Midwest since 1877. [...] The masses in Maria Hilf continued as promised and the farmers began to rebuild their farms which afforded bountiful harvests the very next year. The original chapel was destroyed June 28, 1894, by a tornado. [...] The <b>wooden</b> chapel was <b>picked</b> up and smashed into a grove of trees where, for over a hundred years, those twisted trees stood as a reminder of the tragedy. Everything had been ruined except for the statue of the Virgin Mary which lay unharmed in the rubble of the chapel. [...] The hill would stand vacant for fifty-eight years.|$|R
5000|$|Later {{that night}} Richard, Matt and Jamie travel by boat to Hong Kong and {{come under attack}} by the Hong Kong police (under {{the control of the}} Old Ones) after they are betrayed by the captain. In the struggle, Matt loses Richard and Jamie, {{arriving}} in Hong Kong alone. He sees people dying in the street because of the pollution, and recognizes several of the Old Ones' servants. Matt makes his way to Wisdom Court, where Scarlett's father now resides. Once there Matt lets himself be captured by the Chairman after being betrayed by a despondent Paul Adams, attempting to barter him for Scarlett. However, Adams is killed and Matt is taken to the same cell as Scarlett in Victoria Prison where they share their experiences. Matt reveals that his being captured was in fact a plan he had made with her father. He knew {{that the only way to}} get near her was to be caught, so he had contacted Lohan and his men earlier, telling them of his plan, and then Scarlett's father had agreed to call Nightrise in order to turn in Matt, even at expense of his own life. Matt also explained that he knew the Old Ones would think it was amusing to see two of the Five briefly imprisoned in the same room, before they were imprisoned in different rooms in different sides of the world. Because their powers are strengthened when together they begin to think of escaping. The meaning of [...] "Signal One" [...] is then explained. It is part of the Hong Kong Observatory warning system on the intensity of typhoons. To the Chinese, typhoons are also known as the dragon's breath, explaining the dragon Scarlett had been dreaming of in the Gatekeeper's dream world. She has the ability not just to predict, but to control weather conditions. It is also revealed that Scarlett knew of the typhoon and the power it would bring. Richard and Jamie find Lohan and he bands together his men to rescue Scarlett and Matt under cover of the rising storm Scarlett has made and take the prison, where he followed Matt to when he was being captured. The impending storm is creeping higher up the scale. Jamie knows that Scott will be able to feel the danger Jamie is in, and that he will try and use the door that leads to the Tai Shan Temple, which will undoubtedly be guarded. The group, along with Scarlett, who diverts the storm from them while it destroys everything around them, run to the temple to kill the guards protecting it before Scott arrives, which would result in his death or capture. At The Nightrise headquarters, a <b>wooden</b> sampan <b>picked</b> up by the typhoon smashes into the Chairman's office and ironically kills him; a fortune teller foretold that his death would involve a boat. Meanwhile, Lohan's men kill all but one of the Old Ones' agents, who is wounded but hides. Scott and Pedro travel through the door and the last Old One agent aims at Jamie, but Scott pushes him out of the way and the bullet hits Scarlett in the head, rendering her unconscious.

5000|$|Bob Justin (born 1941) is an American {{outsider}} artist from New Jersey. After {{being forced}} into retirement in 1991 by illness, {{he began to}} liquidate an old tool collection and other property at local flea markets. During this time he returned to a childhood penchant for finding imagery in everyday objects. By combining various antique found objects, or {{what he calls the}} refuse of society, he would create what he calls “critters”, animal or human faces or forms set forth in found object wall masks or standing sculptures. [...] Justin’s style, as described by an Assistant Curator from the New Jersey State Museum, Alison Weld, ranges from the minimal to obsessive and expressionistic, and thus his pieces vary from obsessively adorned objects to simple spare masks and sculptures. But for later bronze works and oil finger paintings his art is all constructed from found objects. The more heavily adorned pieces are often covered with memorabilia {{in the style of the}} traditional “southern memory pot”. His simpler pieces, particularly his wall masks, have been described, by Joseph Picard of the Home News Tribune, as showing a heavy West African influence. Regardless of the style, his found art sculptures are almost always metaphors for the figure or face which project an unpretentious human quality. It is these secondary images Justin perceives in the everyday item which the artist states as the source of his vision that forms the artwork, and which has been called his muse. Justin displayed his first such piece, a combination of an antique <b>wooden</b> chair and <b>pick</b> axe head called “Texas Longhorn”, by his table at the flea market on a whim and was surprised when someone offered to purchase it as it was not for sale. But prodded by the buyers insistence and necessity he sold it. Other pieces followed and so did more buyers. One of these buyers was Dorothy Spencer, the Curator for the Arts America Project for the USIA. Her interest resulted in several of Mr. Justin’s work being shown on an international tour under the Arts America Program of the United States Information Agency. Soon after other pieces of his work were shown by a local gallery. This led to his work being discovered by noted collector and board member of the American Museum of Folk Art, Christina Johnson, of the Johnson and Johnsons. Her collecting of Justin’s art soon brought the notice of the wider art world and various awards and honors. At this time Justin’s work also led him to be introduced to renowned sculptor Isaac Witkin, among other luminaries in the art world. Witkin and Justin became friends and remained close, with Witkin becoming a mentor to Justin, until Mr. Witkin’s death in 2006. Subsequently, Justin’s work received yet broader attention, including a one-man show in the prestigious Eisenhower Hall Theater of the United States Military Academy of West Point New York and a one-man show in the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton and showings in the important Outsider Art Fair, sponsored by the American Museum of Folk Art, New York, New York and the influential Laumeir Sculpture Park, St. Louis, Missouri. Currently, public collections of his work exist in the permanent collections of the Plainsboro Township, New Jersey municipal buildings, Bloomfield College, Bloomfield, New Jersey, the American Cyanamid Corporation, West Windsor, New Jersey, and the permanent collection of the New Jersey State Museum, Trenton, New Jersey and at the artist's website, bobjustin.com.|$|R
