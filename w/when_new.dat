5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre {{for social and}} {{cultural}} activity in the region, <b>when</b> <b>new</b> institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{returned}} to Moesia in August 86. He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia, and transferred three additional legions to the Danube. In 87, the Romans invaded Dacia once more, this time {{under the command}} of Tettius Julianus, and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at the same site where Fuscus had previously perished. An attack on the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa was forestalled <b>when</b> <b>new</b> troubles arose on the German frontier in 89.|$|E

5|$|Endometrial cancer forms {{when there}} are errors in normal endometrial cell growth. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts <b>when</b> <b>new</b> cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These {{abnormal}} cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively.|$|E
5|$|In Opposition, Thatcher {{wanted to}} prevent the {{creation}} of a Scottish assembly. She instructed Conservative MPs to vote against the Scotland and Wales Bill in December 1976, which was successfully defeated, and then <b>when</b> <b>new</b> Bills were proposed she supported amending the legislation to allow the English to vote in the 1979 referendum on devolution.|$|E
5|$|In early 1908 the {{brothers}} {{also agreed to}} a contract with a French company.

5|$|In {{pressurized}} water reactors a variable concentration of boronic acid in the cooling water {{is used to}} compensate the variable reactivity of the fuel: <b>when</b> <b>new</b> rods are inserted the concentration of boronic acid is maximal, and then reduced during the lifetime.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{computer}} users and manufacturers were becoming {{concerned about the}} rising cost of programming. A 1959 survey had found that in any data processing installation, the programming cost US$800,000 on average and that translating programs to run on new hardware would cost $600,000. At a time <b>when</b> <b>new</b> programming languages were proliferating at an ever-increasing rate, the same survey suggested that if a common business-oriented language were used, conversion would be far cheaper and faster.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{additions}} to the DRR occurred in March 1956 <b>when</b> <b>new</b> covered shelters were built on each end of Frontierland Station's depot building.

5|$|Russian {{migration}} to the peninsula continued into the 16th century, <b>when</b> <b>new</b> settlements such as Kandalaksha and Porya-Guba were established. Kola was first mentioned in 1565. In {{the end of the}} 15th century, the Pomors and the Sami people were forced into serfdom, mostly by the monasteries. Monastery votchinas greatly expanded during the 17th century, but were abolished in 1764, when all of the Kola Peninsula peasants became state peasants.|$|E

After achieving a last (16th) place in the 2013 World Baseball Classic, their ranked dropped to 13, which is the lowest rank Australia ever got. The highest rank they have achieved was 9th.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only <b>when</b> <b>new</b> moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.|$|E

Similarly, some exotic weapons and items can only be used after being researched. OSA agents effectively have a separate weapons tree available to them. Psionic powers can be learned, such as invisibility, fireballs, and teleportation.|$|E
5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{remained a}} strong influence though, and <b>when</b> <b>new</b> breweries were set up, the outcry led to the Welsh Sunday Closing Act in 1881, an act that forced the closure of public houses in Wales on a Sunday. Wales' passion for beer remained; the Wrexham Lager Beer Company opened in 1881, as the first lager producer in Britain. The Felinfoel Brewery {{made a deal with}} the local tin works and became the first brewery in Europe to put beer in cans.|$|E

5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An {{example of this}} is his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of the}} voices of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling <b>when</b> <b>new</b> groups of singers join in.
