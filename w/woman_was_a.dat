5|$|In {{almost all}} {{versions}} of the tale, Ila wants to live as a man, but in the Skanda Purana, Ila desires to be a woman. The king Ela (Ila) entered Parvati's grove at Sahya mountain and became the woman Ilā. Ilā wished to remain a woman and serve Parvati (Gauri) and Ganga, the goddess of the Ganges river. However, the goddesses dissuaded {{him and told him}} that life as a <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> curse and full of sorrow. Ilā bathed in a sacred pool and returned as Ela, bearded and deep-voiced.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of the powerful meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær <b>Woman</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> victim of ritual sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{some of the}} Norse gods {{were capable}} of {{changing}} sex at will, for example Loki, the trickster god, frequently disguised himself as a woman.

25|$|Although Baker {{claimed that}} his {{relationship}} with the <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> love-affair which had not yet been consummated, the outcry surrounding the incident led to a series of accusations of impropriety on Baker's part, including the admissions by several female members of the community that they had had affairs with Baker before or during his tenure as abbot.

25|$|Despite good {{ratings for}} the series, ABC stalled on picking up the show for a second season. This was because Wonder <b>Woman</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> period piece, being set in the 1940s, which made the set, clothing, automobiles, etc. more {{expensive}} to produce. While ABC had not yet committed, the show's production company Warner Bros. listened to an offer from rival network CBS. While ABC continued to make up its mind, CBS agreed {{to pick up the}} series on condition that the setting be changed from World War II (the 1940s) to the modern day (the 1970s). Changing the title to The New Adventures of Wonder Woman, the series was moved away from international intrigue to a more conventional police/detective action-type show that was more common in the 1970s.|$|E

500|$|PopMatterss [...] Nathan Wisnicki said Morrison's lyrics {{were less}} pretentious than {{previous}} {{work because of}} L.A. Womans [...] "more conventional blues". David Quantick from BBC Music attributed the record's success to [...] "a stripped-down yet full sound, a developed mysticism tied tightly to the band's brand of rock, and confidence born of having been a functioning unit for several years". In his 1994 book The Complete Guide to the Music of The Doors, Peter K. Hogan describes the album as an expansion on the style from Morrison Hotel, but in a more coherent form.

When the two split up, at Frank's instigation, he admitted to her that he was gay. He was still closeted publicly. According to Frank, he [...] "realized it was crazy" [...] to try to have a romance with someone he cared for but was not compatible with due to his homosexuality. [...] "That was the last effort to avoid being gay," [...] Weisberg quotes Frank as saying. Frank never again dated a woman.|$|E
500|$|Although few Virginia records survive {{from that}} era, 19known {{witchcraft}} cases {{were brought in}} the colony during the 17thcentury, {{all but one of}} which ended in acquittal. The one conviction was a 1656 case of a man convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to 10 stripes and banishment from the county. There were no executions for witchcraft in Virginia. Nonetheless, as late as in 1736, Virginia's justices of the peace were reminded that witchcraft was still a crime, and that first offenders could expect to be pilloried and jailed for up to a year. In 1745, John Craig, a Presbyterian minister in Augusta County, made assertions of witchcraft after his child and several of his animals died, and was in response accused of using evil arts to divine who was responsible. Neither he nor those who accused him brought their claims to court to face [...] "unsympathetic magistrates", though prosecution for witchcraft was still possible in Virginia. The last Virginia witchcraft trial took place in 1802 in Brooke County, which is now in West Virginia. In that case, a couple claimed that a <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> witch, an accusation ruled slanderous.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the start}} of Queen Victoria’s reign in 1837, the ideal shape of the Victorian <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long slim torso {{emphasised}} by wide hips.

Along with the bodice was a long skirt, featuring layers of [...] worn underneath to create fullness; while placing emphasis on the small waist. To contrast the narrow waist, low and straight necklines were thus used.|$|E
