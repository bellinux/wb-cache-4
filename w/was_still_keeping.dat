500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sheffield University Paper in May 1965, Dylan explained the change that had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting [...] "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level." [...] In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] specifically during {{an interview}} with Margaret Steen for The Toronto Star: [...] "I was in my New York phase then, or at least, I was just coming out of it. I <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>keeping</b> the things that are really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are." [...] As Dylan stated to Nat Hentoff at the time that [...] "My Back Pages" [...] and the other songs on Another Side of Bob Dylan were written, [...] "There aren't any finger pointing songs ... Now {{a lot of people are}} doing finger pointing songs. [...] You know, pointing to all the things that are wrong. [...] Me, I don't want to write for people anymore. You know, be a spokesman." ...|$|E

The news that the US Navy <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>keeping</b> a close watch on Russia's ports and bases came barely a week before a scheduled summit between the presidents of both countries. At that time, the US government was trying to improve relationships with Russia, especially by supporting Yeltsin's reforms. During the meeting, {{which took place in}} Canada, Clinton promised that he would conduct a review not only of the incident itself, but of the policies [...] "of which the incident happened to be an unintended part." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Ghana (then Gold Coast) {{was under}} colonial rule, a few {{citizens}} {{complained about the}} practice, but the colonial masters turned their heads. [...] They derided him as [...] "the blind {{man who wants to}} help others see". [...] The colonial government did investigate the practice at Atigo shrine near Battor from 1919 to 1924. [...] The investigating District Commissioner, W. Price Jones, called it [...] "a pernicious habit of handing girls over to the fetish", but for economic reasons, decided not to interfere. [...] As a result of that inquiry, shrine slaves held at the Atigo shrine were told they could return home if they wished. [...] Soon after, the colonial government ignored another complaint that the shrine <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>keeping</b> trokosi. After that, the practice slid back into secrecy and was not brought to the public consciousness again until 1980.|$|E

[...] McCloud specified that he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>keeping</b> an eye on things that needed to happen for the infinite canvas to take off, saying that [...] "the notion of Web applications being as robust as desktop applications has placed us closer to that hope that we may finally {{be able to create}} those spaces in a seamless way online. Right now, it's very difficult to do that." [...] In {{an interview}} in 2014, McCloud said that [...] "without a reliable financial structure to support these experimental webcomics, {{a lot of people just}} turn away and get a real job, or start doing three-panel gag strips. Those have an economic model that works." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nicolae Iorga's {{involvement}} in political disputes {{and the cause}} of Romanian irredentism became a leading characteristic of his biography during World War I. In 1915, while Romania <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>keeping</b> neutral, he sided with the dominant nationalist, Francophile and pro-Entente camp, urging for Romania to wage war on the Central Powers as a means of obtaining Transylvania, Bukovina and other regions held by Austria-Hungary; to this goal, he became {{an active member of the}} Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians, and personally organized the large pro-Entente rallies in Bucharest. A prudent anti-Austrian, Iorga adopted the interventionist agenda with noted delay. His hesitantation was ridiculed by [...] hawkish Eugen Lovinescu as pro-Transylvanian but anti-war, costing Iorga his office in the Cultural League. The historian later confessed that, like Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu and the National Liberal cabinet, he had been waiting for a better moment to strike. In the end, his [...] "Ententist" [...] efforts were closely supported by public figures such as Alexandru I. Lapedatu and Ion Petrovici, as well as by Take Ionescu's National Action advocacy group. Iorga was also introduced to the private circle of Romania's young King, Ferdinand I, whom he found well-intentioned but weak-willed. Iorga is sometimes credited as a tutor to Crown Prince Carol (future King Carol II), who reportedly attended the Vălenii school.|$|E

He had encamped the night before on this stream; they found the embers of the fire by which he had slept, and the remains of a miserable wolf on which he had supped. It was evident he had suffered, like themselves, the pangs of hunger, though he had fared better at this encampment; for they had not a mouthful to eat.|$|E

The tentative propitiations of his proposal to make things up had entirely disappeared, he was evidently in a far profounder rage with her than he had been overnight. Snagsby too, that seemly domestic barometer, looked extraordinarily hushed and grave. She made a greeting-like noise and Sir Isaac scrunched [...] "morning" [...] up amongst a crowded fierce mouthful of toast. She helped herself to tea and bacon and looking up presently discovered his eye fixed upon her with an expression of ferocious hatred....|$|E
60|$|Once more I had the Dawn {{under my}} own orders; and, could I keep the frigate out of gun-shot, I cared very little for Mons. Le Gros. At first, the privateersmen {{supposed}} that, in filling away, I merely intended {{to further their}} views; but, no sooner did they perceive the ship standing on to leeward of the passage, than the truth seemed to flash on their befogged faculties. This {{was not until the}} depth of water was ascertained to be sufficient for their purposes; and such a flourishing of tarpaulins and greasy caps as succeeded, I had not witnessed for many a day. All these signals and calls, however, were disregarded; but away went the Dawn, with her yards just rounded in a point, with the wind fairly abeam, coasting along as near the islands as I thought it at all prudent to venture. As for the frigate, she <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>keeping</b> her luff, in order to get far enough to windward to make sure of her prey. At this moment, the two ships might have been a league asunder.|$|E
60|$|For {{some days}} after his seizure Lady Harman was glad {{to find in the}} stress of his necessities an excuse for {{disregarding}} altogether the crisis in the hostels and the perplexing problem of her relations to Mr. Brumley. She wrote two brief notes to the latter gentleman breaking appointments and pleading pressure of business. Then, at first during intervals of sleeplessness at night, and presently during the day, the danger and ugliness of her outlook began to trouble her. She was still, she perceived, being watched, but whether that was because her husband had failed to change whatever orders he had given, or because he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>keeping</b> himself minutely informed of her movements, she could not tell. She was now constantly with him, and except for small spiteful outbreaks and occasional intervals of still and silent malignity, he tolerated and utilized her attentions. It was clear his jealousy of her rankled, a jealousy that made him even resentful at her health and ready to complain of any brightness of eye or vigour of movement. They had drifted far apart from the possibility of any real discussion of the hostels since that talk in the twilit study. To re-open that now or to complain of the shadowing pursuer who dogged her steps abroad would have been to precipitate Mr. Brumley's dismissal.|$|E

60|$|At {{ten o'clock}} at night Pearson dropped lightly from the stockade on the side {{opposite}} to the gate, as he knew that, if the Indians were there, {{this would be the}} point that they would be watching; then, crawling upon his stomach, he made his way slowly down to the lake. Entering the water and stooping low, he waded {{along the edge of the}} bushes for a distance of a mile; then he left the water and struck into the forest. Every few minutes he could hear the discharge of the rifles at the house; but, as before, no answering shots were heard. Treading very cautiously, he made a wide détour and then came down again on the clearing at the end furthest from the lake, where the Indians had been last seen moving about. All <b>was</b> <b>still.</b> <b>Keeping</b> among the trees and moving with great caution, he made his way, for a considerable distance, along the edge of the clearing; then he dropped on his hands and knees and entered the cornfield, and for two hours he crawled about, quartering the ground like a dog in search of game. Everywhere he found lines where the Indians had crawled along to the edge nearest to the house, but nowhere did he discover a sign of life. Then, still taking great care, he moved down toward the house and made a circuit of it a short distance outside the stockade; then he rose to his feet.|$|E
6000|$|That settled it. Kirkham was the name; and we {{went out}} to seek for the owner of it. There was no trouble about that, for Bermuda is not large, and is like the earlier Garden of Eden, in that {{everybody}} in it knows everybody else, just {{as it was in the}} serpent's headquarters in Adam's time. We easily found Miss Kirkham--she that had been the blooming girl of a generation before--and she <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>keeping</b> boarders; but her mother had passed from this life. She settled the date for us, and did it with certainty, by help of a couple of uncommon circumstances, events of that ancient time. She said we had sailed from Bermuda on the 24th of May, 1877, which was the day on which her only nephew was born--and he is now thirty years of age. The other unusual circumstance--she called it an unusual circumstance, and I didn't say anything--was that on that day the Rev. Mr. Twichell (bearing the assumed name of Peters) had made a statement to her which she regarded as a fiction. I remembered the circumstance very well. We had bidden the young girl good-by and had gone fifty yards, perhaps, when Twichell said he had forgotten something (I doubted it) and must go back. When he rejoined me he was silent, and this alarmed me, because I had not seen an example of it before. He seemed quite uncomfortable, and I asked him what the trouble was. He said he had been inspired to give the girl a pleasant surprise, and so had gone back and said to her-- ...|$|E

[...] She had, in her {{compressed}} state, another pause, and {{it made her feel}} as if she were immensely resisting. Strange enough was this sense for her, and altogether new, the sense of possessing, by miraculous help, some advantage that, absolutely then and there, in the carriage, as they rolled, she might either give up or keep. Strange, inexpressibly strange--so distinctly she saw that if she did give it up she should somehow give up everything for ever. And what her husband's grasp really meant, as her very bones registered, was that she SHOULD give it up: it was exactly for this that he had resorted to unfailing magic. He KNEW HOW to resort to it--he could be, on occasion, as she had lately more than ever learned, so munificent a lover: all of which was, precisely, a part of the character she had never ceased to regard in him as princely, a part of his large and beautiful ease, his genius for charm, for intercourse, for expression, for life. She should have but to lay her head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make it definite for him that she didn't resist. To this, as they went, every throb of her consciousness prompted her--every throb, that is, but one, the throb of her deeper need to know where she [...] "really" [...] was. By the time she had uttered the rest of her idea, therefore, she <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>keeping</b> her head and intending to keep it; though she was also staring out of the carriage-window with eyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen, indistinguishable, perhaps, happily, in the dusk. She was making an effort that horribly hurt her, and, as she couldn't cry out, her eyes swam in her silence. With them, all the same, through the square opening beside her, through the grey panorama of the London night, she achieved the feat of not losing sight of what she wanted; and her lips helped and protected her by being able to be gay.
