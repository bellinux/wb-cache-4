5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and <b>William</b> <b>Cohen</b> (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E

5|$|On 11 March 1976, SAC {{headquarters}} {{announced that}} the 42d Bombardment Wing would be inactivated, citing the poor condition of Loring's facilities. In 1976, {{it was estimated that}} Loring needed up to $300 million in facilities improvements. Between 1976 and 1979, considerable debate took place over the strategic importance of Loring, resulting in a reversal of the Air Force decision to close Loring. When the decision to keep Loring AFB open was made in 1979, Congress committed itself to upgrading Loring's facilities. After 1981, nearly $300 million in military construction and operations and maintenance funds were spent to upgrade the facilities. Congressman Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts and Senator <b>William</b> <b>Cohen</b> of Maine were firm supporters of the base during the time when it was proposed to be closed.|$|E

The {{settlement}} included two houses, and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980, with Senators <b>William</b> <b>Cohen</b> and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen. McCain's children did not attend, and several years would pass before they reconciled. John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family's assets under her name; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns.|$|E

500|$|National Security Advisor Sandy Berger called President Bill Clinton at 5:35 AM on August 7 {{to notify}} {{him of the}} bombings. That day, Clinton started meeting with his [...] "Small Group" [...] of {{national}} security advisers, which included Berger, CIA director George Tenet, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno, Defense Secretary <b>William</b> <b>Cohen,</b> and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Hugh Shelton. The group's objective was to plan a military response to the East Africa embassy bombings. Based on electronic and phone intercepts, physical evidence from Nairobi, and interrogations, officials soon suspected bin Laden as the perpetrator of the attacks. On August 8, the White House asked the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a targets list; the initial list included twenty targets in Sudan, Afghanistan, and an unknown third country, although it was narrowed down on August 12.|$|E
500|$|On April 26, Governor Longley and Attorney General Brennan finally {{sat down}} with Tureen and the tribal {{negotiating}} committee.

In August, however, Bell informed Judge Gignoux that he would not proceed against the fourteen large private landowners. And, in September, Bell asked for a six-month delay before prosecuting the claim against the state.

500|$|Clark {{started the}} bombings codenamed Operation Allied Force on March 24, 1999, on orders {{to try to}} enforce U.N. Resolution 1199 {{following}} Yugoslavia's refusal of the Rambouillet Agreement. However, critics note that Resolution 1199 was a call for cessation of hostilities and does not authorize any organization to take military action. Secretary of Defense <b>William</b> <b>Cohen</b> felt that Clark had powerful allies at the White House, such as President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who allowed him to circumvent The Pentagon in promoting his strategic ideas. Clark felt, however, {{that he was not}} being included enough in discussions with the National Command Authority, leading him to describe himself as [...] "just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States". This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was not initially invited to a summit in Washington, D.C., to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, despite being its supreme military commander. Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit, but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops, and Clark agreed.|$|E
