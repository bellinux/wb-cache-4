5|$|Australian {{demographic}} trends {{will put}} pressure on the ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and health programs. As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.|$|E

5|$|The lane is a {{restricted}} {{area in which}} players can stay for only {{a limited amount of}} time. On all levels, a team on the offensive (in possession of the ball) is prohibited to stay inside the lane for more than three seconds; after three seconds the player will be called with a three-second violation which <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a turnover.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{cavities}} {{incorporated into a}} mould will directly correlate in moulding costs.

Thus, this paper will review various types of rainfall models which have been used in modelling rainfall occurrence, rainfall amount or combination of both rainfall occurrence and rainfall amount...|$|R
5|$|While racing opponents, {{the player}} must {{successfully}} manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. There {{are two types}} of buoys: red colored, which must be passed on the right side, and yellow buoys, which must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game's HUD will light, allowing the player's Jet Ski to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> the loss of all the player's accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five buoys {{over the course of a}} race <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys for more than five seconds will also result in disqualification.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the latest}} debt {{sustainability}} analysis published by the European Commission in October 2012, the fiscal outlook for Spain, if assuming the country will stick to the fiscal consolidation path and targets outlined by the country's current EDP programme, <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> a debt-to-GDP ratio reaching its maximum at 110% in 2018—followed by a declining trend in subsequent years. In regards of the structural deficit the same outlook has promised, that it will gradually decline {{to comply with the}} maximum 0.5% level required by the Fiscal Compact in 2022/2027.|$|E
5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E

5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E
5|$|Credit Information: The {{use of the}} Lebanese Identity Card can {{enable the}} banks in the Republic of Lebanon to easily {{establish}} persons credit-worthiness from the Credit Referencing Agencies any time they apply for a loan. This may lead drastically to the reduction in bank rates on loans since the banks can establish whether they are already servicing a loan from another bank which <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> {{a reduction in the}} incidents of bad debts.|$|E
5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using {{the rotation of the}} Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E

5|$|Federal DUI law {{differs from}} New Jersey law {{in that there}} are no {{mandatory}} minimum jail sentences, irrespective of the number of previous DUI convictions, and plea bargaining is allowed. A federal DUI conviction <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> unexpungeable criminal record. Federal courts cannot suspend a driver's license, but may notify the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission of a DUI conviction. In federal enclaves that are under the jurisdiction of other federal departments (e.g. Fish and Wildlife Service), it is unclear if drunk driving could be prosecuted since the Assimilative Crimes Act is inapplicable, and there is no federal law defining DUI on those properties.|$|E
5|$|Future {{projects}} <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> numerous changes. A full interchange will {{be constructed}} between Wellington County Road34 and Maltby Road; the intersection {{with the former}} will become an overpass while the latter will be closed, with Maltby Road terminating at a cul-de-sac {{on both sides of}} the expressway. Further north, a partial-access diamond interchange will be built at Downey Road/ Kortright Road West, with ramps from the northbound lanes and to the southbound lanes and the crossroad run beneath the expressway.|$|E
5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> higher launches.|$|E

A significant deficit <b>will</b> <b>result</b> <b>in</b> spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E
