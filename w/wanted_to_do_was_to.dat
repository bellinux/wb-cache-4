5|$|The marine {{artist and}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was {{confusion}} rather than concealment, but disagreed about {{the type of}} confusion to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate a ship's type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer's position.|$|E

He lies to Danny by telling him he cares for Liz, hoping that Danny [...] will end it with Liz, which he does. After Sue returns from a night of partying, Tracy tells her that all he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be a father figure to her. Liz enters Tracy's {{dressing}} room—with the mustache intact—to take Sue back to the writers' room, as Liz {{had been looking for}} her. At the end, Tracy wonders if he can go through his experience with Sue if he has a daughter, to which Kenneth says he thinks he can.|$|E
500|$|Tallahatchie County Sheriff Clarence Strider, who {{initially}} positively identified Till's body {{and stated that}} the case against Milam and Bryant was [...] "pretty good", on September 3 announced his doubts that the body pulled from the Tallahatchie River was that of Till. He speculated that the boy was probably still alive. Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a cadaver stolen by T.R.M.Howard, who colluded to place Till's ring on it. Strider changed his account after comments {{were published in the}} press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying, [...] "The last thing I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> defend those peckerwoods. But I just had no choice about it." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's climatic battle {{sequence}} {{takes place}} through the nine worlds {{by the use}} of portals. Visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison said, [...] "We ended up calling this 'time toffee', so as you punch through from one realm to another it's almost like cling film or a slightly gelatinous membrane you have to pass through. It bends a little bit then rips and spits the person out. The other thing we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make sure it was quite fast from an editorial point of view. In the fight scenes there are times when Thor and Malekith are portaling all over the place, quite frankly. We made sure we always kept up the momentum and never stopped the fight. It was a way of making sure the audience weren't conscious there was an effect going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki was {{inspired}} to create The Wind Rises after reading a quote from Horikoshi: [...] "All I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make something beautiful". Several scenes in The Wind Rises were inspired by Tatsuo Hori's novel , in which Hori wrote about his life experiences with his fiancée before she died from tuberculosis. The female lead character's name, Naoko Satomi, was borrowed from Hori's novel [...] The Wind Rises continues to reflect Miyazaki's pacifist stance, continuing the themes of his earlier works, despite stating that condemning war was not {{the intention of the}} film. The film premiered on July 20, 2013, and received critical acclaim; it was named Animation of the Year at the 37th Japan Academy Prize, and was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 86th Academy Awards. It was also commercially successful, grossing ¥11.6 billion (US$110 million) at the Japanese box office, becoming the highest-grossing film in Japan in 2013.|$|E
500|$|The cold winters drove Marquis to {{consider}} yet another change of career (Whitehall {{is at an}} elevation of 4360ft); he applied to the United States Veteran's Bureau. Meanwhile, he continued writing. He expanded his Indian diary into {{a book on the}} Cheyenne; he also wrote short stories and an article on [...] "Reviewing the Story of Custer's Last Battle", the first of his many publications on this subject. In April 1923, he moved to Alberton, where he continued to practice medicine, and published a short story [...] "Buffalo Heart, Indian Policeman", printed in The Youth's Companion, a leading literary magazine. In June, this success, and the better climate in Alberton, led him to turn down a job offer from the Veteran's Bureau and put most of his effort into work on his Cheyenne book. In May 1924 he had a second story, [...] "The Guest of the Tribe", published in The Youth's Companion. However, Marquis was never really comfortable writing fiction. What he really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> write non-fiction about the Custer battle, and to do that he needed to be nearer to the scene. The opportunity came in June 1925 when the agency physician for the Crow Reservation suggested to him that there was room for another physician to set up practice there. In August, he set up a medical practice in Lodge Grass on the Crow Reservation.|$|E

500|$|Kirchherr, Voormann and Vollmer {{were friends}} who had all {{attended}} the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voormann became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where {{he had his own}} room. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called the Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard this new music called Rock n' Roll before, having previously listened to only Trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them." ...|$|E
500|$|Takei {{declared}} {{it was not}} a decrease on the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a [...] "fatigue" [...] he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans' wishes. In the author's opinion, Shaman King was being [...] "normalized" [...] by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical shōnen aspects and losing its originality. In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the final he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine in {{the end of the year}} or in the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or [...] "Perfect Edition"), concluding with the [...] "true ending" [...] to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official Kanzen-Ban website, in addition to the print editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008, with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, [...] "After making the readers [...] so much for this, the last thing I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> disappoint them". He thought the ending was a [...] "huge responsibility". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something [...] "fun," [...] as it was different from scratch.|$|E

Fasanella himself lamented the decline in the {{relevance}} of his work. [...] "It's over. What I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> paint great big canvases about the spirit we used to have in the movement and then go around the country showing them in union halls.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the album, and its title track, is a {{reference}} to Robert Louis Stevenson novella The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

It's like when Paul said, 'The things I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>are</b> the things I don't do, and the things I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>are</b> the things that I do.'" ...|$|R

Oprah revealed that Thicke's initial appearance garnered a strong reaction, noting that people called the show {{to say that they}} didn't know he would be on. Oprah explained, [...] "So what I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> accommodate {{all of the people who}} missed it the first time...

2500|$|Limestone Lad was {{scheduled}} to be offered for sale as a three-year-old gelding at Tattersalls Ireland in June 1995, but was withdrawn from the auction after the auctioneer's vet found that he had an abnormal heartbeat. The gelding was officially trained throughout his racing career by James Bowe, although the day-to-day handling was managed by his son Michael on the family farm which was also home to 60 cattle and 150 sheep. Commenting on the process of training the horse Michael Bowe said [...] "Everything you taught him, you had to do it slowly and carefully - but once he picked it up he would die or do it. He was so genuine, all he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> please you". [...] He was often subjected to demanding schedules, with few breaks: Bowe explained the strategy by saying [...] "He is happiest racing frequently and the more you take him racing the more he likes it".|$|E
2500|$|Aware {{that child}} stars are often unable to {{successfully}} continue their careers into adulthood, Foster became a full-time student at Yale in fall 1980, and her acting career slowed {{down in the}} following five years. She later stated that going to college was [...] "a wonderful time of self-discovery", and changed her thoughts about acting, which she had previously thought was an unintelligent profession, but now realised that [...] "what I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> act {{and there was nothing}} stupid about it." [...] She continued making films on her summer vacations, and during her college years appeared in O'Hara's Wife (1982), television film Svengali (1983), John Irving adaptation The Hotel New Hampshire (1984), French film The Blood of Others (1984), and period drama Mesmerized (1986), which she also co-produced. None of them were however successful, and Foster struggled to find work after graduating in 1985. The neo-noir Siesta (1987), in which she appeared in a supporting role, was a failure. Five Corners (1987) was a moderate critical success and earned Foster an Independent Spirit Award for her performance as a woman whose sexual assaulter returns to stalk her. In 1988, Foster made her debut as a director with the episode [...] "Do Not Open This Box" [...] for the horror anthology series Tales from the Darkside, and in August appeared in the romantic drama Stealing Home (1988) opposite Mark Harmon. It was a flop, with film critic Roger Ebert even [...] "wondering if any movie could possibly be that bad".|$|E
