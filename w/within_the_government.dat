5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for the worse. Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Evita set her {{sights on}} earning {{a place on}} the ballot as {{candidate}} for vice-president. This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and her increasing powers <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> According to the Argentine Constitution, the Vice President automatically succeeds the President in the event of the President's death. The possibility of Evita becoming president in the event of Juan Perón's death was not something the military could accept.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the US Navy was growing rapidly.

However, this rapid growth was not universally supported either <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> or within the Navy. Compromises between powerful groups were frequently necessary to get funding.|$|E

5|$|Benedict Arnold then {{applied to}} {{accompany}} General Carleton, {{who was going}} to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere. Other attempts all failed to gain positions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> or the British East India Company {{over the next few years}} and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service. His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the {{government}} was involved in launching Gutt's monetary reform plan {{as well as the}} disarming of the resistance as part of the transition to stability. A major crisis emerged <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> over the refusal of the Front de l'Indépendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Armés (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and disarm. Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from {{the government}}, and the party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm the resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms.|$|E
5|$|Gorbachev began {{a period}} of {{internal}} economic restructuring, known as perestroika, and agreed {{to a series of}} summits with the American president. Matlock was instrumental in preparing Reagan for his first summit with Gorbachev, arranging for specialists <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> to write a “Soviet Union 101” course of 21 papers on Russia for Reagan to study. Matlock also participated in a mock summit, playing the role of Gorbachev, allowing Reagan to practice the encounter in advance.|$|E

Building upon the Sui legal code, he issued a new legal code that subsequent Chinese dynasties would model theirs upon, as well as neighboring polities in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. The earliest law code to survive was the one established in the year 653, which was divided into 500 articles specifying different crimes and penalties ranging from ten blows with a light stick, one hundred blows with a heavy rod, exile, penal servitude, or execution.|$|E

It is responsible for promoting government policies on women, and protecting women’s rights <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations {{of those who had}} testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E

5|$|After D-Day, Allied troops {{crossed the}} Belgian {{frontier}} on 1 September 1944. German forces {{did little to}} oppose the liberating forces, which by 4 September were in control of Brussels, although the last occupied parts of Belgian territory were only liberated in February 1945. On 8 September 1944, the government in exile returned to Brussels and was greeted with general indifference. Although the King {{was no longer in}} the country, his Political Testament was presented to the returned Government as he had wished, and was soon circulated publicly. At the same time, a copy was presented to the British king, George VI, and was seen by the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. The text reignited the divisions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> which had been largely hidden since earlier in the war.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} {{publication}} of the Commentaries, Blackstone's chances of judicial appointment remained slim. While he was old enough, experienced enough and widely respected, the presence of Lord Camden as Lord Chancellor and Blackstone's lack of aristocratic patrons at the time hindered his chances. In January 1770, however, Lord Grafton's government began to fall, with Camden resigning on 17 January and Solicitor-General John Dunning, following him. George III appointed Lord North as Prime Minister, and North picked Charles Yorke as Lord Chancellor. Yorke's death on 20 January, after holding the position for less than three days, left several important legal positions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> open. As such, Blackstone, now MP for Westbury, was apparently approached to become Solicitor-General; he refused, not wanting to deal with the complicated duties attached to the position.|$|E
5|$|Greatly {{concerned}} about the growing partisanship <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> and the detrimental impact political parties could have on the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington struggled throughout his eight-year presidency to hold rival factions together. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party. In spite of his efforts, debates over Hamilton's economic policy, the French Revolution, and the Jay Treaty deepened ideological divisions. Those that supported Hamilton formed the Federalist Party, while his opponents coalesced around Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and formed the Democratic-Republican Party. While criticized for furthering the partisanship he sought to avoid by identifying himself with Hamilton, Washington is nonetheless considered by scholars and political historians {{as one of the}} greatest presidents in American history, usually ranking in the top three with Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.|$|E
