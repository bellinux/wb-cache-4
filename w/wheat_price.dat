40|$|Factors {{affecting}} U. S. <b>wheat</b> <b>prices</b> {{are changing}} due, in part, to farm policy's reduced role in price determination. Such changes have prompted {{a review of}} existing price forecasting equations for U. S. wheat.

50|$|In the 1920s, {{the most}} disconcerting {{economic}} issue was declining farm profits. From 1900-1920, American farmers had prospered while European agriculture suffered serious disruption due to World War I, therefore prices soared. Beginning in 1919, Europeans closed their markets by implementing tariff barriers. This period of American agricultural prosperity due to rising demand concluded {{by the early}} 1920s. While American farms continued to grow due to previous wartime price and technological advances, European demand for American farm products declined and prices plummeted. <b>Wheat</b> <b>price</b> fell from $2.50 to under a dollar a bushel by late 1921. Many farmers found themselves unable to meet their loan repayments. Additionally, overproduction was depressing the profitability of the agriculture industry. With falling prices (due to low demand) and overproduction, farmers faced a serious problem.The Emergency Tariff raised duties on most imported agricultural products, such as corn, wheat, sugar, wool, meat and more.|$|E

5000|$|The Flour War {{refers to}} a wave of riots arising from April to May 1775, in the northern, eastern, and western parts of the Kingdom of France. It {{followed}} an increase in grain prices, and subsequently bread prices, because police withheld grain from the royal stores in addition to poor harvests in the summers of 1773 and 1774. This revolt, remarkable in its scale, was settled by <b>wheat</b> <b>price</b> controls (before the supply recovered) and the intervention of troops. The wheat rebellion during the Ancien Régime manifested a social and political crisis. These events {{can be interpreted as}} a reaction against the edict from Turgot, which liberalized grain commerce on September 13, 1774; indeed, this liberalization appeared contrary to a [...] "moral economy", as some people were hoarding flour in order to drive up prices. This shortage of flour broke the principle that required the king to ensure the security of his subjects and their food supply.|$|E
50|$|In 1877 {{the price}} of British-grown wheat {{averaged}} 56 shillings and 9 pence a quarter {{and for the rest}} of the nineteenth century it never reached within 10 shillings of that figure. In 1878 the price fell to 46 shillings and 5 pence. In 1886 the <b>wheat</b> <b>price</b> decreased to 31 shillings a quarter. By 1885 wheat-growing land declined by a million acres (4,000 km²) (28½%) and the barley area had dwindled greatly also. Britain's dependence on imported grain during the 1830s was 2%; during the 1860s it was 24%; during the 1880s it was 45%, (for wheat alone during the 1880s it was 65%.) The 1881 census showed a decline of 92,250 in agricultural labourers in the ten years since 1871, with an increase of 53,496 urban labourers. Many of these had previously been farm workers who migrated to the cities to find employment, despite agricultural labourers' wages being higher than those of Europe. Agriculture's contribution to the national income was about 17% in 1871; by 1911 it was less than 7%.|$|E
5000|$|Brougham {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Edinburgh, the eldest son of Henry Brougham (1742-1810), of Brougham Hall in Westmorland, and Eleanora, {{daughter}} of Reverend James Syme. The Broughams had been an influential Cumberland family for centuries. Brougham was educated at the Royal High School and the University of Edinburgh, where he chiefly studied natural science and mathematics, but also law. He published several scientific papers through the Royal Society, notably on light and colours and on prisms, and at the age of only 25 was elected a Fellow. However, Brougham chose law as his profession, and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1800. He practised little in Scotland, and instead entered Lincoln's Inn in 1803. Five years later he was called to the Bar. Not a wealthy man, Brougham turned to journalism as a means of supporting himself financially through these years. He was {{one of the founders of}} the Edinburgh Review and quickly became known as its foremost contributor, with articles on everything from science, politics, colonial policy, literature, poetry, surgery, mathematics and the fine arts. In the early 19th century, Brougham, a follower of Newton, launched anonymous attacks in the Edinburgh Review against Thomas Young's research that proved light was a wave phenomenon that exhibited interference and diffraction, attacks that slowed acceptance of the truth for a decade until François Arago and Augustin-Jean Fresnel championed Young's work. Another example of Lord Brougham's scientific incompetence is his attack against Sir William Herschel (1738-1822). The story is described by Pustiĺnik and Din. Herschel, as Royal Astronomer, found a correlation between the observed number of sunspots and wheat prices. This met with strong and widespread rejection, even ridicule - as a [...] "grand absurdity" [...] - by Lord Brougham. Herschel had to cancel his next publications of these results. 70 years later, the English economist W.S. Jevons discovered 10-to-11-year intervals between wheat high prices - in agreement with the 11-year cycle of solar activity, discovered at those times. Miroslav Mikulecký, J. Střeštík and V. Choluj found by cross regression analysis shared periods between climatic temperatures and wheat prices as 15 years for England, 16 years for France and 22 years for Germany. Pustiĺnik and Din believe they have found a direct evidence of the causal connection between <b>wheat</b> <b>price</b> bursts and solar activity.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wheat</b> <b>price</b> {{forecasts}} {{are very}} important for traders, farmers and politicians as well. However, only quite accurate price predictions can guide these groups towards making the best decisions. Therefore the well-known <b>wheat</b> <b>price</b> projections of both the OECD and the FAPRI from 1996 on are tested for their predictive accuracy using Theil's inequality coefficient. Despite {{the fact that both}} models could not foresee the price peak which occurred in February 2008, their predictions offer more accurate values than a naive prediction of no price change. Nevertheless, precise price forecasts cannot be expected by the models of the OECD and the FAPRI since some short-run effects such as inappropriate weather are not predictable. Thus, our own econometric model is developed taking the previous price development, the stocks-to-use-ratio and the crude oil price into account. In comparison to the projections of both institutions the model, with rather simple assumptions, was able to generate forecasts more accurately. In a simulation study which takes different crude oil price levels and stochastic effects of the world wheat consumption and the average yields per hectare into account, the possible <b>wheat</b> <b>price</b> range is shown as large. Therefore, price predictions can only inform about general longrun trends. [...] <b>wheat</b> <b>price</b> forecasts,predictive accuracy,Theil's inequality coefficient...|$|E
