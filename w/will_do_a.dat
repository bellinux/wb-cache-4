25|$|Typical {{gameplay}} in The Bouncer {{consists of}} the player fighting groups of enemies using hand-to-hand combat techniques. Occasionally, one of the AI controlled bouncers <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> taunt, prompting a button-press to activate a team attack ("Trinity Rush") which damages all enemies on screen. However, the Trinity Rush is ineffective against some bosses. In some instances, the player will also be tasked with activities other than fighting, such as running {{through a series of}} hallways to avoid being caught in a flood, finding a keycard, or fooling enemies into thinking the player is one of them. In general, a gameplay segment ends when the player has either defeated all of the enemies in the area, has defeated a boss enemy, or has achieved a set goal.|$|E

In 2009, an article in the BBC News singled out the Glass Spider Tour's innovative set and marriage of music and theatre as an inspiration to later acts, including Britney Spears, Madonna, U2 and others. Stage designer Willie Williams said the Glass Spider Tour was a template for those acts: [...] "There will be one set of costumes and they <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> few songs, then there will be another big scene change and {{move on to the next}} thing. Bowie crossing rock 'n' roll with Broadway [...] was where that began."

Thus, there was some consensus {{that he did not have}} the speed to play wide receiver in the National Football League and that he did not work on his speed. It was also said that he [...] "Lacks soft hands and <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of double-catching and body-catching. Has a lot of drops for a featured No. 1 receiver." ...|$|E

500|$|Critic Jim DeRogatis {{describes}} Vedder's vocals as a [...] "Jim Morrison-like vocal growl." [...] Greg Prato of AllMusic said, [...] "With his hard-hitting {{and often}} confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also {{became one of}} the most copied lead singers in all of rock." [...] Vedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", [...] "Better Man") to social and political concerns ("Even Flow", [...] "World Wide Suicide"). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, [...] "Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> power chord thing, and I fit into all that." ...|$|E

As Hurley and Sawyer rush to her, she says something barely audible. She is soon pronounced dead. Hurley and Sawyer try to recount what Nikki said {{before she died}} {{and come to the}} conclusion that she said, [...] "Paulo lies", although she actually said [...] "paralyzed". Sawyer and Hurley begin an investigation and find Paulo lying lifeless in the jungle. Sawyer finds a walkie talkie in Nikki and Paulo's tent, and concludes they were working with the Others, due to the similarity. Hurley does not think the Others are near their camp, but Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) reminds them that she was abducted nearby (unaware that it was Charlie who grabbed her). Sawyer tries to calm them down and says he <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> perimeter sweep. Meanwhile, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), who feels guilty, confesses to Sun that it was he who attempted to kidnap her. Sawyer returns, having found the diamonds, and the other survivors accuse him of being the killer because Desmond saw him arguing with Nikki just that morning. He gives the diamonds to Sun, but she later confronts him about kidnapping her and returns the diamonds because [...] "they're worthless here." [...] The survivors then hold a funeral for Nikki and Paulo, where Sawyer pours the pouch of diamonds into the grave. Nikki's eyelids open just as Hurley and Sawyer are filling the grave, burying her and Paulo alive.|$|E

[...] Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, that what drew him to the film is that he loves how [...] "these people shouldn't {{be in the same room}} let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family".|$|E
