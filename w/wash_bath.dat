This work investigates the impact of ultrasonic scouring on fibre entanglement caused during the scouring process. Levels of fibre entanglement were quantified by measuring fibre length using OFDA 4000 after carding. A significant reduction in fibre entanglement after ultrasonic scouring was observed and this was due to a reduced fibre migration in the <b>wash</b> <b>bath</b> when compared with the mechanical agitation seen in conventional scouring process. Fibre cuticle scale damage resulting from the ultrasonic irradiation may also have contributed to the reduction in fibre entanglement. A reduced level of fibre entanglement from ultrasonic wool scouring leads to a reduction in fibre breakage during carding...|$|E
40|$|The process-engineering {{solutions}} {{developed for}} the regeneration of pickling and washing baths in hot-dip galvanising units were implemented, tested and optimised using appropriate equipment. Zinc was separated from pickling fluid (hydrochloric acid) by the membrane electrolytic process. At {{the core of the}} system is an electrolysis tub to which electrodes are fitted. A separately installed direct-current source supplies the required electrode current (700 amps). The zinc collecting on the cathode is removed periodically with a sultable tool. The entry of acid in the <b>wash</b> <b>bath</b> is prevented by electrodialysis. The equipment used for this is of compact design and consists of several easy to use modules. The main process component, the membrane stack, is connected to a direct-current source (150 amps) through which the contaminated wash water passes. Filters with back-wash function ensure the required media purity. Pumps and a control console complement the system. Both systems operate in a by-pass set-up (2. 5 m" 3 /h) optionally in automatic or manual mode. Full enclosure prevents corrosion, media-exposed parts are covered with plastic (PP). (orig.)

40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} of pea and fababean spun proteins {{has been}} studied by SEM and TEM {{as a function of}} dope pH and <b>washing</b> <b>bath</b> salt concentrations. The textural properties {mechanical resistance, moisture content) and diameter of the fibres have been determined. Spinning was only possible when dope pH was higher than 11. An increase in dope pH from 11. 5 to 13 induced a shear strength increase whereas the moisture content and the diameter of the fibres decreased. The structure of the fibres became more compact and changed from an aggregate of spherical particles to a tridimensional network. When dope pH was equal to 12. 6, the increase in <b>washing</b> <b>bath</b> salt content from 2 to 10 % NaCl produced more compact fibres. At high dope pH, the protein aggregates were dissociated and the polypeptide chains were unfolded, which favoured the lining up of the macromolecules during the spinning process and increased the protein -protein interactions in the fibres. High salt concentration in the <b>washing</b> <b>baths</b> produced a salting out effect which probably also enhanced the chain-chain interactions. Contrary to previous studies, protein strand orientation along the fibre axis and a double cortex-core structure have been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The myometrium {{contractility}} {{throws the}} function of cell’s receptors and signal transducers’ is a research area for observations in vitro and in vivo. There are many of agents which can affect cell’s response to different irritations. The phases of menstrual period, pregnancy, drugs, etc. {{are some of the}} agents who can affect myometrium function. The contractility usually is the result of capture one cell receptor, following of activation G proteins intracellular system, entrance of extra cellular Ca++ and its connection with kalmoduline, release of intracellular Ca++ with finally activation of myosin. Also important is the local release and action of prostaglandins, estrogens level etc. On the other hand, cell relaxation is the result of irritation which after its capture from cell receptor inactivates the G proteins intracellular system, increase cAMP levels in cell and release prostacykline. Because of these, comes inactivation membranes Ca++ channels and cell Ca++ goes back to cells storage. Oxytocin and cocaine throw the activation of special receptors and signal transducers provoke myometrium contraction. Ritodrine HCl and Atosiban provoke myometrium relaxation. In our study tried the investigation of effectiveness and the way of action Ritodrines and Atosibans after effect of Cocaine and Oxytocin together and separate.

40|$|Bluetongue (BT), {{a disease}} that affects mainly sheep, causes {{economic}} losses owing to not only its deleterious effects on animals but also its associated impact on the restriction of movement of livestock and livestock germplasm. The causative agent, bluetongue virus (BTV), can occur in the semen of rams and bulls {{at the time of}} peak viraemia and be transferred to a developing foetus. The risk of the transmission of BTV by bovine embryos is negligible if the embryos are washed according to the International Embryo Transfer Society (IETS) protocol. Two experiments were undertaken to determine whether this holds for ovine embryos that had been exposed to BTV. Firstly, the oestrus cycles of 12 ewes were synchronised and the 59 embryos that were obtained were exposed in vitro to BTV- 2 and BTV- 4 at a dilution of 1 x 102. 88 and 1 x 10 3. 5 respectively. In the second experiment, embryos were recovered from sheep at the peak of viraemia. A total of 96 embryos were collected from BTV-infected sheep 21 days after infection. In both experiments half the embryos were washed and treated with trypsin according to the IETS protocol while the remaining embryos were neither washed nor treated. All were tested for the presence of BTV using cell culture techniques. The virus was detected after three passages in BHK- 21 cells only in one <b>wash</b> <b>bath</b> in the first experiment and two unwashed embryos exposed to BTV- 4 at a titre of 1 x 10 3. 5 . No embryos or uterine flush fluids obtained from viraemic donors used in the second experiment were positive for BTV after the standard washing procedure had been followed. The washing procedure of the IETS protocol can thus clear sheep embryos infected with BTV either in vitro or in vivo. How to cite this article: Venter, E.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine (i) whether Chlamydia abortus would adhere to or penetrate the intact zona pellucida (ZP-intact) of early in vivo-derived caprine embryos, after in vitro infection; and (ii) the efficacy of the International Embryo Transfer Society (IETS) washing protocol for bovine embryos. Fifty-two ZP-intact embryos (8 - 16 cells), obtained from 14 donors were used in this experiment. The embryos were randomly divided into 12 batches. Nine batches (ZP-intact) of five embryos were incubated in a medium containing 4 x 10 (7) Chlamydia/mL of AB 7 strain. After incubation for 18 hours at 37 degrees C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2, the embryos were washed in batches in 10 successive baths of a phosphate buffer saline and 5 % fetal calf serum solution in accordance with IETS guidelines. In parallel, three batches of ZP-intact embryos were used as controls by being subjected to similar procedures but without exposure to C. abortus. The 10 wash baths were collected separately and centrifuged for 1 hour at 13, 000 x g. The washed embryos and the pellets of the 10 centrifuged wash baths were frozen at - 20 degrees C before examination for evidence of C. abortus using polymerase chain reaction. C abortus DNA was found in all of the infected batches of ZP-intact embryos (9 / 9) after 10 successive washes. It was also detected in the 10 th wash fluid for seven batches of embryos, whereas for the two other batches, the last positive <b>wash</b> <b>bath</b> was the eighth and the ninth, respectively. In contrast, none of the embryos or their washing fluids in the control batches were DNA positive. These results report that C abortus adheres to and/or penetrates the ZP of in vivo caprine embryos after in vitro infection, and that the standard washing protocol recommended by the IETS for bovine embryos, failed to remove it. The. persistence of these bacteria after washing makes the embryo a potential means of transmission of the bacterium during embryo transfer from infected donor goats to healthy recipients and/or their offspring. Nevertheless, the detection of C abortus DNA by polymerase chain reaction does not prove that the bacteria found was infectious. Further studies are required to investigate whether enzymatic and/or antibiotic treatment of caprine embryos infected by C abortus would eliminate the bacteria from the ZP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Doctoral thesis {{deals with}} {{professional}} laundry care process and reduction of energy intensity {{and use of}} other operational commodities used in the process. Professional laundry care process is a specific energy intensive process; its purpose is to re-establish original properties of the now dirty laundry so that it may fulfil its functions again. This is basically a recycling and regeneration process comprising many sub-operations. Key operation is washing of the laundry in a <b>washing</b> <b>bath,</b> which removes impurities from the laundry. This thesis describes the most common technology of impurities removal, which is washing in a hot <b>washing</b> <b>bath</b> in cooperation with mechanical work and detergents. However, all of the described procedures may also be applied on alternative technologies, such as ozone washing, washing with low-temperature enzymes and ultrasound. Water is applied in all these technologies as a soaking agent. Water must have appropriate properties and must {{be removed from the}} laundry after the washing process in subsequent operations (drying, ironing, and pressing). Theoretical introduction of the thesis describes professional laundry care process in detail, and continues with mathematical modelling of the process and its main sub-operations (washing, drying) using mass and heat balance, and data acquisition and their application in research and development. Thesis further describes design of information system on the basis of relational database controlled by web application. This system enables to organize data and information from various sources – measured experimental data, data concerning measurement devices, operational records of machines, etc. Thesis further proposes how to evaluate and reduce energy intensity of a process. Descriptions are validated by examples and case studies. Key section of the thesis is a chapter describing experimental infrastructure. This infrastructure integrates several instalments of laundry equipment and is a fully functional operation of industrial laundry facility with 500 kg/shift capacity, which serves as a model of energy intensive process. Sophisticated infrastructure and data acquisition system allows measuring wide spectrum of physical entities and examining factors influencing energy intensity of processes, and relationships between these factors as well as effectiveness of various savings measures in real life facilities...|$|R

40|$|Title: Horticultural Assessment Scheme: insight in {{prevalence}} {{and distribution of}} microbial contamination to evaluate water management in fresh produce processing industry. Introduction: Microbial food safety is a global concern. Particularly, fresh produce is increasingly involved in some outbreaks. Many food borne illnesses are related with contamination during the postharvest processing (e. g. washing, chilling). The source and contamination level of the used water {{is an important issue}} that influences the degree of contamination at all stages in the chain. Purpose: The purpose is to present the concept of a ‘Horticultural Assessment Scheme’ as systematic approach in sampling and analysis in order to obtain a helicopter view on microbial quality, hygiene and safety level of products and processes in a company. It may help to identify bottlenecks in management of food safety and water. Methods: A Horticultural Assessment Scheme (HAS) is developed to assess the level of microbiological quality of leafy vegetables during postharvest processing. HAS is a procedure that defines the identification of critical sampling locations, the selection of microbiological parameters, the assessment of sampling frequency, the selection of sampling method and method of analysis, and finally data processing and interpretation. Results: The results of the HAS showed that (a) neither Salmonella nor L. monocytogenes were detected in the frame of this sampling plan. It turned out that the (b) total psychrotrophic aerobic count is perceived to be, neither for the fresh produce samples nor for the water or environmental samples, a good indicator of overall microbial quality and good practices during production and processing. And (c) if {{there is a lack of}} refilling the water and high product/water ratio’s, a fast build up of E. coli and transfer to the end product occurs. Significance: The results obtained by analysis of hygiene indicator E. coli along with the information obtained on the ratio of the product/water used in the <b>washing</b> <b>baths</b> and frequency of refilling water enabled to evaluate water management in these two companies involved in production of pre-packed cut fresh produce. The companies need to validate their water management and optimize the process to guarantee a proper water quality from the start until the end of the process. However, the difficulty about a proper water management is the lack of guidelines on acceptable microbial contamination in wash water, product/volume ratio and frequency of refilling fresh water to <b>washing</b> <b>baths...</b>|$|R

Herein we investigated the influence of the post-self-assembly <b>washing</b> <b>baths</b> on the structural, mechanical and thermal properties of these fibres. The surface morphology and the inter-fibre packing were similar for every treatment. The overnight incubation in isopropanol yielded fibres with the highest temperature and energy of denaturation (p < 0. 013).

Rehydration of the fibres resulted in increased fibre diameter (p < 0. 006) and reduced stress (p < 0. 001), force (p < 0. 001) and modulus (p < 0. 002) values for every treatment. In the dry state, the alcohol-treated fibres were characterized by the highest stress (p < 0. 002) values; whilst in the wet state the Tris–HCl-treated fibres were the weakest (p < 0. 006). For every treatment, in both dry and wet state, a strong and inverse relationship between the fibre diameter and the stress at break was observed.

40|$|The textile {{washing process}} {{involves}} basically three stages: (1) removing the soiling from the substrate, (2) suspending the soling removed in the <b>washing</b> <b>bath</b> and (3) preventing redeposition of the soiling onto the substrate {{from which it}} has just been removed. In fact, soiling removed from the substrate may have deposited on it {{to a greater or}} lesser extent during the detergent process, as unwanted phenomenon that can be avoided using appropriate polymers. Preventing the redeposition of impurities is especially important during the washing of synthetic fibres with a compact crystal structure such as polyester or acrylics. The primary purpose of this work was to assess the performance of a polyethylene glycol polyester copolymer used as a detergent additive to prevent redeposition of solid impurities during the washing of standard polyester and acrylic fabrics in terms of the zeta potential of the fabrics. The copolymer was used in combination with the anionic surfactant, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, the non-ionic surfactant fatty alcohol ethoxylate with 7 mol E. O. or both in variable proportions. The soiling used as a solid impurity in the washing process was carbon black.
