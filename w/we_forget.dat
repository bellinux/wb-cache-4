25|$|Léonce Perret {{began his}} career as a {{relatively}} undistinguished stage actor. He was recruited to the film industry by the Gaumont Film Company. His numerous short films gained significant accolade in French cinematography. Until his emigration to the United States in 1917, he was a fixture of the Gaumont Film Company. On American soil, he produced several popular films, the most notable being Lest <b>We</b> <b>Forget</b> (N'oublions jamais) in 1918.|$|E

60|$|This {{was indeed}} a novel and {{interesting}} sight to us. We had now been so long on shore that <b>we</b> had almost <b>forgotten</b> the appearance of breakers, for there were none within the lagoon. But now, as we stood beside the foam-crested billow of the open sea, all the enthusiasm of the sailor was awakened in our breasts; and as we gazed on the widespread ruin of that single magnificent breaker that burst in thunder at our feet, <b>we</b> <b>forgot</b> the Coral Island behind us, <b>we</b> <b>forgot</b> our bower and the calm repose of the scented woods, <b>we</b> <b>forgot</b> all that had passed {{during the last few}} months, and remembered nothing but the storms, the calms, the fresh breezes, and the surging billows of the open sea.|$|R
25|$|Shortly afterwards, he {{directed}} Lest <b>We</b> <b>Forget,</b> which showed {{the world the}} image of a heroic and wounded France. The postwar propaganda was released in 1918 and was enormously successful in France. Its release shortly preceded the signing of the armistice that ended World War I. This film and other film successes during that year supplied Perret with enough money to start his own production company: Perret Pictures, Inc., which was affiliated with the distributor Pathé Exchange.|$|E
25|$|Longhorn fans {{created a}} 45–35 {{campaign}} to remind {{voters in the}} AP and Coaches' polls that Texas beat OU 45-35 on a neutral field. Sophomore Austin Talbert created a Facebook group titled Texas did beat OU 45–35, lest <b>we</b> <b>forget.</b> and senior Matt Parks created a website titled Better Consider the Scoreboard. The campaign raised over $7,500 to have 20,000 45-35 signs printed for the Texas A at Texas game {{and to have a}} plane bearing the message Texas 45 OU 35 — settled on a neutral field fly over ESPN GameDay prior to the Oklahoma at Oklahoma State game. Excess proceeds were donated to the UT Orange Santa program and the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer research. The Daily Texan printed an additional 5,000 to 30,000 signs.|$|E
25|$|In 1936 the War Memorial Drive {{was planted}} with 75 poplars, {{each with a}} cross at the foot and a plaque honouring {{individual}} Old Newingtonians who died during World War II. The trees were replaced by a new avenue of trees in 1966 and the plaques were replaced by a tablet on a plinth with the inscription: Lest <b>We</b> <b>Forget</b> – This plaque was dedicated on 24September 1966, to mark the planting of trees alongside the War Memorial Drive by the Old Newingtonians' Union to restore those originally planted by the Union on 29February 1936. By this act Old Newingtonians remember those Old Boys who gave {{their lives in the}} service of God, King and Country, and whose names are recorded on the War Memorial of the School. Fifty of the original plaques remain in the archives collection. In 1979 the War Memorial Drive was realigned and replanted and the 1966 plinth was moved to the Millner Gates end of the drive.|$|E

500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|Following Mora's death, WIDECAST {{suspended}} beach patrol operations. [...] "We can’t risk {{human lives}} for this project," [...] Chacón said. [...] "But {{this is probably}} the exact result that the killers were hoping for." [...] Many volunteers quit the project after Mora's death, leaving the organization 200 people short staffed. [...] Organizations such as WIDECAST depend heavily on foreign volunteers. According to Chacón, the future of his organization will be in jeopardy if the situation continues. Aimee Leslie, who oversees sea turtle efforts for the World Wildlife Foundation called the situation [...] "a critical point for conservation" [...] in Costa Rica and [...] "a national security issue. [...] She said that conservation efforts were already difficult without being scared for one's life. Lizano said she was in negotiations with the police for armed escorts on future patrols, but vowed to continue to work even if they refused. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> about this beach, then Jairo died for nothing," [...] she said.|$|E
500|$|We paid our {{shilling}} at the gate, {{and then}} we saw for the first time, that the entrance, {{if there had been}} any magic about it at all, was now decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after night we had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (<b>we</b> <b>forget</b> even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple! ...|$|E

[...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "It takes everything that's made Pixar shorthand for animation excellence -- strong characters, tight pacing, spot-on voice casting, a warm sense of humor and visuals that are pure, pixilated bliss -- and carries them to the next stage." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "The truest measure of the movie is that eventually <b>we</b> <b>forget</b> we're watching a bunch of vehicles with faces and start to think of them as individual characters. It's quite an accomplishment, and perhaps one only possible by Pixar." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "What's surprising about this supremely engaging film is the source of its curb appeal: It has heart." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's the latest concoction from the geniuses at Pixar, probably the most inventive of the Computer Generated Imagery shop -- and the film's great fun, if well under the level of the first Toy Story." [...] Jessica Reaves of the Chicago Tribune gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying [...] "While it's a technically perfect movie, its tone is too manic, its characters too jaded and, in the end, its story too empty to stand up to expectations." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "While Cars may cross the finish line ahead of any of 2006's other animated films, it's several laps behind its Pixar siblings." ...|$|E

She was saved by Thompson and vividly remembered that tragic day, [...] "We don't say <b>we</b> <b>forget.</b> We just try not to think about the past, but in our hearts we keep a place to think about that".

2500|$|Sociologist Susie Scott {{challenged}} the interpretation {{and treatment of}} shyness as being pathological.

[...] She explores the idea that [...] "shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual", and concludes that, to some extent, [...] "we are all impostors, faking our way through social life". One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: [...] "Sometimes I want to take my cue from the militant disabled lobbyists and say, 'hey, it's not MY problem, it's society's'. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys are probably more sensitive, and nicer people, than 'normals'. I shouldn't have to change: society should adapt to meet my needs." ...|$|E
