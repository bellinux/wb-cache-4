5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} Grace (played by Debra Messing) impulsively {{accepting}} a marriage proposal from her boyfriend Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.) despite {{that the two}} have only {{known each other for}} a short time. They get married and tell their friends about the news, despite Grace's best friend Will's (Eric McCormack) unease about the <b>whole</b> <b>idea.</b> Grace and Leo decide to host a wedding reception for themselves, but at the festivity, Grace learns unsettling details about Leo, which gives her reason to wonder if she has made a mistake.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Will's (Eric McCormack) apartment, Grace and Leo reveal to their friends, Will, Jack (Sean Hayes), and Karen (Megan Mullally), {{that they have}} gotten married. The friends' reactions to the news are not positive; in particular, Grace's gay best friend Will is uneasy about the <b>whole</b> <b>idea.</b> Leo and Grace, however, assure Will {{that they will have}} a wedding reception in honor of him, which improves Will's relationship with both Grace and Leo.|$|E

The need for it just can't be escaped. Even when everything that it is possibly to do by way of building new roads and expanding public transport has been done, there would still be, in the absence of deliberate limitation, more cars trying to move into, or within our cities than could possibly be accommodated.|$|E

25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> was to play the {{saxophone}} and I really wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause we were really great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E
25|$|Episode 32 of MythBusters {{investigates the}} urban legend of an {{affordable}} jet pack or rocket pack {{that can be}} built from plans purchased on the Internet. Extensive modifications {{were made by the}} MythBusters team due to vagueness in the plans and because of the infeasibility of the specified engine mounting system. The jet pack produced by the MythBusters had two ducted fans powered by ultralight-type piston engines. (Fans complained that the use of piston engines destroyed the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> of the pack's being truly based on jets, by which, presumably, they meant self-contained gas turbines.) They found it was not powerful enough to lift a person off the ground, and was expensive to build. The plans specified a Rotax 503 ultralight engine, but they intended to use the more powerful and lighter Rotax 583 engine before a similar lighter unnamed engine was substituted.|$|E

25|$|When her great-uncle's sole heir, Sarah Lockwood Winchester, {{the widow}} of his son William Wirt Winchester, died in September 1922, part of the multi-million dollar estate was left to Olive Winchester. Additionally, Winchester was the {{beneficiary}} of 25% of a substantial estate of her maternal great uncle, Levi Merrick Stewart (born December 10, 1827 in Corinna, Maine; died May 3, 1910 in Minneapolis, Minnesota). Following these inheritances, in 1922 Winchester provided the funds to build a home for Wiley at Northwest Nazarene College. According to Ingersol, Throughout her tenure at Northwest Nazarene, Winchester taught her specialties: Biblical language and literature. But she also grew interested in the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> of religious education in the local church, and at Northwest Nazarene she developed and taught the initial courses in religious education. She spurred further interest in that emerging discipline by contributing frequent articles on religious education to church papers and curriculum resource manuals.|$|E
25|$|Until the Middle Ages, {{the peak}} area of Karkonosze {{remained}} untouched; {{the first people}} to explore it were treasure hunters looking for gold, and shepherds. Already in the 18th century ascents to the Sněžka/Śnieżka were fairly common, albeit the forms of organised tourism appeared {{in the second half of}} 19th century, along with railway access to Jelenia Góra, Szklarska Poręba and Karpacz. Before the rush time for Karkonosze, Śnieżka was climbed amongst others by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In that period many shepherd's huts were built, called in German Baude and bouda in Czech. Some of them were developed later in mountain huts, which exist even now, e.g. Lucni Bouda. Due to the industrial revolution and the period of prosperity (which corresponds to Victorian times in England) tourism and hiking became popular. This was about the time, when the whole network of roads and trails, altogether ca 300km, was constructed in both Silesian and Bohemian parts of the mountains. The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> was conceived, implemented and managed by two mountain clubs, Austrian Riesengebirgenverein and German Riesengebirgenverein. All the main paths and trails, including these in the alpine area, had been constructed before World War I. The trail, later dubbed Polish-Czech Friendship Trail, was completed before the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the upper zones of the range were a busy tourist region with numerous huts and other facilities.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} idea {{to explain}} the greater prevalence of diabetes in more northerly populations was suggested by Moalem et al. who noted that recent animal research has uncovered {{the importance of the}} generation of elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives as a physiological means for cold adaptation. High concentrations of these substances depress the freezing point of body fluids and prevent the formation of ice crystals in cells through supercooling, thus acting as a cryoprotectant or antifreeze for vital organs as well as in their muscle tissue. They consequently suggested that factors predisposing to elevated levels of glucose, glycerol and other sugar derivatives may have been selected for, in part, as adaptive measures in exceedingly cold climates. The authors suggest that this cryoprotective adaptation would have protected ancestral northern Europeans from the effects of suddenly increasingly colder climates, such as those believed to have arisen around 14,000 years ago and culminating in the Younger Dryas. A major issue with this <b>whole</b> <b>idea,</b> however, is that glucose, gycerol and sugar derivatives only become useful as cryoprotectants as the body temperature falls to the point where tissues are at risk of freezing – which is below 0 oC. Since no human ever survived a period of hypothermia with a body temperature less than 10 oC, because of heart failure, there is no possibility that this could ever have provided any selective advantage in our past history – no matter how cold the external temperature was.|$|E

40|$|Teacher {{roles in}} {{contemporary}} American {{schools should be}} more closely aligned to hermeneutics as the study of meaning (interpretation/understanding). A marriage between Platonic notions of interpretation {{and the quest for}} meaning with the interpretive theories of Friedrich Schleiermacher, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Hans-Georg Gadamer is suggested. Schleiermacher argues that understanding cannot focus primarily on parts (words) without considering the effect the parts may have on the <b>whole</b> (<b>ideas).</b> In addition, von Humboldt contended that meaning is coproduced by the speaker and listener and is woven with cultural threads. He also believed that historians must unite Separate historical components into a unified aggregate. For Dilthey, the task of hermeneutics, and interpreters, is to unite the past with the present through reconstruction. Gadamer explored the notion of how language forms th...|$|R

40|$|My diploma thesis shows {{patterns}} of alternation by bilingual children between their two mother tongues, Czech and English. The patterns are studied {{in two different}} types of language alternations; code-switching, meaning switching between language codes in <b>whole</b> <b>ideas</b> and discussed topics, and code-mixing, meaning inserting a word or phrase in language A into speech in language B. The code-switching and code-mixing types and patterns were studied on basis of 12 recordings and observations of a class of pre-school children during one morning of English school activities per week and 14 recordings and observations of a following year class of first-year school children during their after-school English activities. All children attended state education, pre-school nursery and the following year Czech state primary schools. Most of the children's parents are a combination of a Czech and an immigrant from an English-speaking country (with three exceptions) and they both speak with the children exclusively in their respective native languages. By studying the {{patterns of}} children's alternation between the languages, I also analyse how socialisation through the use of two languages influences social competences.
