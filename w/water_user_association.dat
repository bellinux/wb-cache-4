40|$|We {{examine the}} {{development}} of irrigation management in northern China using data from village and household panels. During the past decade, reform-oriented institutions, such as <b>water</b> <b>user</b> <b>associations</b> and contracting, have largely replaced the traditional institution of collective management in village-level irrigation systems. A feature unique to China is that <b>water</b> <b>user</b> <b>associations</b> and contractors are provided with monetary incentives to save <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>user</b> <b>associations</b> have not yet achieved the broad-based participation of farmers that some advocates consider as a primary goal for forming the associations. Many village leaders serve also as the leaders of <b>water</b> <b>user</b> <b>associations,</b> thus possibly reducing opportunities for receiving operational input and policy direction from farmers. However, we observe improved performance of irrigation systems managed by <b>water</b> <b>user</b> <b>associations,</b> relative to collective management, in terms of maintenance expenditures, the timeliness of water deliveries, and the rates of fee collection. Performance has improved also in systems managed by contractors, although not as substantially {{as in the case}} of <b>water</b> <b>user</b> <b>associations.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of water scarcity is the water consumption in the agriculture sector. Therefore, optimizing water consumption and applying an optimal management in the agriculture sector is necessary. The implementation of a participatory {{management of water resources}} in the rural areas and the creation of <b>Water</b> <b>User</b> <b>Association</b> (WUA) can be a successful approach towards this management. That requires the continuity of the management, the comprehensive participation of farmers, and the exploitation of water resources; however, this action needs to understand the factors affecting the behavior of consumers. Thus identifying the factors influencing farmers’ intentions towards participation in WUA is essential. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify factors affecting farmers' intentions towards participation in <b>water</b> <b>user</b> <b>association,</b> by theory of planned behavior (TPB). There are 21 agriculture water pumping stations active in Lorestan Province. Farmers at each agriculture water pumping stations make up a <b>Water</b> <b>User</b> <b>Association.</b> The population of this study consisted of all WUAs in western Iran (N = 1990), and through a proportional stratified random sampling technique farmers were selected (N = 133) from the population. Moreover, the validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by a panel of experts. The reliability of the questionnaire was calculated at pre-test stage for different parts of the questionnaire ranging from 0. 83 until 0. 91. The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 20 software. The results revealed that there were effective variables including subjective norm, attitude, and extension training courses which contributed to the importance of participation in the water management, and that the educational level of farmer was a controlled variable that could affect farmers' attitudes towards participating in Water User Association; these factors could explain 53 % of farmers' participation totally...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we use {{insights}} from institutional bricolage and actor network theory {{to make sense of}} an Andean <b>water</b> <b>user</b> <b>association</b> (WUA) and its bricoleurs in the Region of Ayacucho, Peru. Rather than being designed and clearly defined, we see natural resource institutions as continuously performed and patched together, through heterogeneous elements and practices, by those that live, experience and enact these institutions every day and by those who make sense of them. We present three cases, three supra-community efforts to secure water livelihoods, in which the Ayacucho <b>water</b> <b>user</b> <b>association</b> is enacted differently. Similar actors and practices like, water law, local customs, water bodies, and ecological services are performed in alternate ways for diverse purposes. It is this range of co-existing performances or enactments and the fluidity of actors and bricoleurs which enables an institution to adapt and adjust. We hold that an Andean WUA can be a bureaucratic imposition, but in many ways the WUA is something else too: a strategic ally; a prerequisite for subsidy consideration, a marketplace for exchanging goods and services and more. In the setting of the contemporary Peruvian Andes, the durability of natural resource institutions can be understood through the fluidity and multiplicity of performances and purposes.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} of a pricing rule for irrigation water with two variables: the volume consumed by the farmer and the volume he/she reserves before the plantation.

We show too how farmers are incited to restrain their use of water.

Therefore, it compares favorably to other classical water pricing methods...|$|E
