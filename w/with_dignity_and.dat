5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal like animals. This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> a sense of communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E
5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war {{to be able to}} avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but to}} reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E

5|$|There are no {{international}} conventions on flying the flag, but protocol {{adopted by a}} large number of countries have such similarities as to suggest lines of commonly accepted practice. In general two areas of exposure are identified: national and international events. In both cases it is generally followed practice that national flags displayed in a group should be of equal size and each hoisted on its own flagstaff, of equal height, or on separate ropes if fixed on yardarm. The flag is flown from sunrise to sunset, except in case of bad weather; exhibition at night is permitted provided it is adequately illuminated. The flag is raised and lowered vividly and with solemnity; it is always treated <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> should never be allowed to touch the ground or water. Vertical hoist is transformationally identical to horizontal hoist (i.e. the flag is rotated 90 degrees).|$|E

25|$|While Lina is {{believed}} to have been marked for death upon arrival (and immediately after sent to the gas chamber), her brother survived the camp conditions for a few more months. He befriended two Jewish doctors, Moscovici and Klein, with whom he spent his free moments engaged in passionate discussions about philosophy and literature. As was later attested by a survivor of the camp, the poet himself was among the 700 inmates selected for extermination on October 2, 1944, when the Birkenau subsection outside Brzezinka was being evicted by SS guards. He was aware of impending death, and reportedly saw it as ironic that it came so near to an expected Allied victory. After a short interval in Block 10, where he is said to have awaited his death <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> courage, he was driven to the gas chamber and murdered. His body was cremated, along with those of the other victims.|$|E
25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for <b>with</b> <b>dignity.</b> <b>And</b> the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
25|$|During {{training}}, conscripts woke {{up between}} 5-6 am and training lasted for 10-12 {{six days of}} the week. Much of the training was done by rote and consisted of instruction. Before 1941 training had lasted for six months, but after the war, training was shorted to a few weeks. After finishing training, all men {{had to take the}} Oath of the Red Army which read: I______, a citizen of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics, entering into the ranks of the Red Army of the Workers and Peasants', take this oath and solemnly promise to be a honest, brave, disciplined, vigilant fighter, staunchly to protect military and state secrets, and unquestioningly to obey all military regulations and orders of commanders and superiors.I promise conscientiously to study military affairs, in every way to protect state secrets and state property, and to my last breath to be faithful to the people, the Soviet Motherland, and the Workers-Peasants' Government.I am always prepared on order of the Workers and Peasants Government to rise to the defense of my Motherland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; and as a fighting man of the Red Army of Workers and Peasants', I promise to defend it bravely, skillfully, <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> honor, sparing neither my blood nor my life itself for the achievement of total victory over our enemies.If by evil intent I should violate this, my solemn oath, then let the severe punishment of Soviet law and the total hatred and contempt of the working classes befall me. Tactics were based on the 1936 training manual and the revised edition of 1942. Small unit movements and how to build defensive positions were laid out in a manner that was easy to understand and memorize. The manuals had the force of law and violations of the manuals were legal offenses. Soviet tactics always had the platoons attacking in the same way with the platoons usually broke into four sections occupying about 100 yards on average. The only complex formation was the diamond formation with one section advancing, two behind and one in the rear. Unlike the Wehrmacht, the Red Army did not engage in leap-frogging of sections with one section providing fire support to the sections that were advancing, and instead all of the sections and platoons attacked en masse. The other only variation was for the sections to “seep” into a position by infiltration.|$|E

Hemingway sets the events in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] that shape the Adams persona. Young believes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] holds the [...] "master key" [...] to [...] "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career". Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in existentialism: if [...] "nothingness" [...] is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death <b>with</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>and</b> courage live an authentic life.
