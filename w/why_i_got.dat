Edmonds provoked further criticism after tweeting {{to a man}} with kidney cancer, lymph node metastases and psoriatic arthritis that [...] "Scientific fact-disease is caused by negative energy. Is it possible your ill health is caused by your negative attitude? #explore." [...] The following day, Edmonds appeared on ITV's This Morning television revealing {{that he had been}} diagnosed with prostate cancer in November 2013.

2500|$|Rosenqvist was {{confused}} over his ten-second time penalty for his pit stop release which saw him narrowly avoid hitting his teammate Heidfeld, saying he realised his teammate was entering the pit lane and applied his brakes to enable his teammate to overtake him: [...] "I feel like I was always behind {{and it was}} not really my fault. That's why I'm a bit confused <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the penalty." [...] Mahindra was also fined €1,500 for unsafely releasing Heidfeld from his garage and into the path of Piquet. Dilbagh Gill described Heidfeld's rise up the field to finish in tenth place as a [...] "master class in wheel-to-wheel racing" [...] and said his team would look forward to preparing for the season's remaining races. Heidfeld called the result [...] "bittersweet" [...] as he stated his strong form meant had his sensor problem emerged in qualifying he could have finished in a higher position. Rosenqvist said with his team's strong pace in the two Berlin races, he believed he could further increase his advantage over Prost in the Drivers' Championship: [...] "It was a very long and tough weekend! We kept our heads together and had a near-perfect run. We had a really, really solid car. We are the ones to watch at the moment - it’s a bit of a game changer!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Speaking of the 1968 Astral Weeks recording, Morrison told David Wild with Rolling Stone: [...] "It {{received}} no promotion, from Warner Bros.—that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> never <b>got</b> {{to play the}} songs live. I {{had always wanted to}} play the record live and fully orchestrated—that is what this is all about. I always like live recording and I like listening to live records too.

'Tis like the poet says: [...] "Forgotten are our friends {{that we have}} left behind; in the hollow lettuce-land we will live and lay reclined." [...] You better go on, Clancy. I'll stay, I guess. It's too early and cold, and I'm sleepy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I did not, for the sanitarium {{people did}} not notify us that he had gotten away. I suppose they thought he would stay near the {{institution}} {{and that they would}} be able to get him again. I can't imagine what brought him away out here, excepting that I went to see him once, when he was somewhat better, and I told him about Oakdale and our school. I knew he called himself the King of Sumatra, and that is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> interested in the wild man as soon as I heard you mention that name. Then, when the handkerchief was found, I was sure the man was my uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's twenty-two since I first enlisted. I served {{eight years}} in the infantry. I don't know why I am telling you this, but somehow I have taken a fancy to you. I was uncomfortable in the {{regiment}}. It does not matter <b>why.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my stripes twice, and had to give them up or I should have been put back for drinking. Then I left the regiment without asking leave. I was three or four years knocking about at home; but I had no trade and found it hard to get work, so at last I enlisted again. I was thirty then, but looked years younger than I was. Of course I had shaved off my moustache and put on a smock-frock when I went to enlist, and I gave my age as twenty-two. No one questioned it. I chose the cavalry this time, because I knew that if I entered an infantry regiment again they would spot me as an old soldier at once; but as it was all new in the cavalry I managed to pass it off, and now I have had ten years' service, the last six of them as sergeant. And as I gave up drink years ago I have a good character in the regiment, and when a steady non-commissioned officer was wanted for this business I had the luck to be chosen. Officers coming, lad!" ...|$|E
60|$|There was Matthew, for instance, the oldest. When he arrived, {{he was to}} Maude {{a never-ending}} miracle, she would have his crib brought into her room, and I would find her leaning over the bedside, gazing {{at him with a}} rapt {{expression}} beyond my comprehension. To me he was just a brick-red morsel of humanity, all folds and wrinkles, and not at all remarkable in any way. Maude used to annoy me by getting {{out of bed in the}} middle of the night when he cried, and at such times I was apt to wonder at the odd trick the life-force had played me, and ask myself <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> married at all. It was a queer method of carrying on the race. Later on, I began to take a cursory interest in him, to watch for signs in him of certain characteristics of my own youth which, in the philosophy of my manhood, I had come to regard as defects. And it disturbed me somewhat to see these signs appear. I wished him to be what I had become by force of will--a fighter. But he was a sensitive child, anxious for approval; not robust, though spiritual rather than delicate; even in comparative infancy he cared more for books than toys, and his greatest joy was in being read to. In spite of these traits--perhaps because of them--there was a sympathy between us. From the time that he could talk the child seemed to understand me. Occasionally I surprised him gazing at me with a certain wistful look that comes back to me as I write.|$|E
60|$|June 19.--Scribbled away lustily. Went to the P.H. Wrote when I came home, {{both before}} and after dinner--that's all, I think.
