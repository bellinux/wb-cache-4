40|$|International audienceListeria monocytogenes is a {{foodborne}} pathogen {{of major}} concern {{for public health}} in industrialised countries. Since L. monocytogenes carriage by pigs at the herd level could be a primary source for carcass contamination, control measures should be designed to reduce the L. monocytogenes load at the pre-harvest stage. For this purpose, an exploratory analytical survey {{was carried out in}} 2000 - 2001 in 93 French farrow-to-finish pig farms concerning L. monocytogenes contamination in pigs before they left for the slaughterhouse. On each farm, the L. monocytogenes status of a batch of contemporary fattening pigs housed in the same room was assessed on faecal material samples taken by means of gauze swabs wiped on the perianal region of the pigs. Fourteen percent of the batches studied had at least one contaminated sample and were therefore classified as L. monocytogenes contaminated batches. Two logistic regression models were used to assess the association between managerial and hygiene practices and the risk of L. monocytogenes contamination of the batch {{at the end of the}} finishing period on the whole data set ($n = 93 $) and in the <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> farms only (n = 57). <b>Wet</b> <b>feeding</b> during the fattening period was identified as a risk factor for L. monocytogenes contamination. Risk factors related to the introduction of L. monocytogenes in pig facilities were identified for both the general and <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> farm data sets. Poor care paid to hygiene on the farms was found to increase the risk of being infected (boots cleaning, change room presence). When the duration of the empty period prior to the introduction of growing pigs was less than one day in the fattening section, the risk of L. monocytogenes contamination was significantly increased. For <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> farms, a distribution pipeline cleaning procedure including disinfection was found to be associated with a higher risk of contamination than no cleaning or a procedure consisting of rinsing with water only...|$|E
40|$|It is {{possible}} to affect the feed costs in different ways. By steeping or fermentation the digestibility of the feed is improved for the animals with a natural process in the <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> system Steeping means that the feed is soaked some hours before feeding. This process activates enzymes and improves the digestibility of for example phosphorus in the feed {{and make it more}} accessible to the animal. <b>Wet</b> <b>feeding</b> can be fermented or not. Fermentation means that the feed has been soaked for a certain length of time so that a biological process is started. Fermentation can be either spontaneous or controlled. In the case of spontaneous fermentation, only the existing bacterial culture affect the acid composition in the wet feed. Controlled fermentation means that a bacterial culture is added to promote lactic acid production and to reduce pH. Residues must not remain in the feed lines because it will continue to ferment. The microbiological activity will then reduce the feed content of amino acids, for example lysine is consumed up to 10 % before the feed reach the animal, resulting in an impaired growth in the animals. Wet feed should have a pH between 4, 5 to 5. If this value is exceeded, you can get problems with microbiological activity and growth of harmful bacteria. This can cause diarrhea and death in the herd. When using methods as steeping or fermentation, the result is positive for both the animals and the environment. Phosphorus is a substance which, when spreading manure, may not exceed the allowed amount of 22 kg per hectare. In order to affect the food cost, you need to know how much energy the animal utilize from the feed. Therefore a system for energy evaluation of the feed, that is as accurately as possible is important. For this reason, the Swedish pig production recently has changed energy evaluation system from metabolic energy to net energy. In the previous system, the energy in protein feeds was overestimated and the sows' ability to utilize energy in fiber better than growing pigs was not taken into account. Within the new system there is two ways of calculating the energy value, sows and boars have one, and growing pigs up to 150 kg have another. The {{purpose of this study was}} to study if pig farmers think they have sufficient knowledge of their feeding system to use all the features, and if they themselves can overcome the errors that may occur. To investigate what the pig farmers think about the usability of their <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> programs, a questionnaire with questions on that topic was designed. People within the pig industry was contacted and asked for suggestions on 20 farms that could participate in the study. Ten farms with 100 sows, and 10 with over 200 sows in the herd were selected. The farms were situated in Värmland, Västra Götaland, Halland and Skåne. Telephone interviews with the selected farms, with the questionnaire as a basis, were made. A total of 13 questionnaires were fully answered. Of the interviewed farmers, four of them had experience from several manufacturers of <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> systems. Eleven had sometime called support for help with the feeding system and many of these farmers commented that it was in this way they have learned how to solve problems with the feeding system. Twelve had a manual, but five of these manuals were not fully translated into Swedish or were written in another language. The general conclusion is that the feeding systems are reliable, as long as the user monitor, that there is feed enough. The results of the survey show that most farmers, even those that have a new <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> system, think it is difficult to find solutions to problems by means of using the manual. This is surprising and should have been improved over the years, especially since new feeding systems have more features...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{stress can}} induce {{hyperthermia}} in poultry. A reduction in heat load {{can be achieved}} by increasing the possibilities for dissipation, decreasing the level of heat production or by changing the thermal production pattern within a day. Strategies to reduce the negative effects of heat stress can be based on a specific feeding strategy, such as restricted feeding. Feed that is offered long enough before a hot period can ameliorate the harmful effects of high temperature. Another strategy may be to use choice feeding from different feed ingredients, rich in protein or in energy. With such self-selection, the chicken may adjust its intake of individual components, allowing the bird to optimise the heat load associated with the metabolism of the ingested nutrients. Additional promising strategies involve offering a choice between feeds with a different feed particle size or structure. A large particle size contributes {{to the development of the}} gastro-intestinal tract (GIT), especially the gizzard and the caeca. A large gizzard will maximize the grinding process and potentially ease digestion down the GIT, thereby reducing heat production associated with digestive processing. Also <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> may be profitable under heat stress conditions as well. Feeding wet diets may facilitate an increased water intake and larger particle sizes can limit water excretion in droppings, resulting in more water being available for evaporation during panting, hence cooling the bird. In conclusion, these feeding strategies may help to reduce heat production peaks, facilitate evaporative activity and/or decreases the heat load, resulting in beneficial effects on performance and health of the bird kept in more tropical areas worldwide...|$|E

In Experiment 2, diets containing 0, 15 and 30 % wDDGS with no enzyme were compared; further, the 30 % wDDGS diet was supplemented with enzymes (protease or β-mannanase). Water intake per pen was monitored beginning at 7 d. There was no effect of dietary treatment on overall feed intake (FI) and body weight (BW). Total feed conversion ratio (FCR) (P< 0. 05; 0 - 72 d) was significantly improved for birds fed 30 % wDDGS regardless of enzyme treatment compared other dietary treatments. There were trends for higher water intake (mL/b/d) with 30 %P+ diets as compared to the other diets. The higher water intake may be a factor of the higher fiber in this diet, but it was exacerbated by only the protease enzyme. Experiment 3 evaluated the effect of extrusion (EX) and an enzyme cocktail (E; 0. 5 g/kg) on wDDGS. Diets containing 0, 15 and 30 % wDDGS with/without enzyme were tested; further, the 15 and 30 % wDDGS with/without EX and E were compared. There was no effect of EX or E on BW and FI. Feeding higher WDDGS (30 %) depressed performance, but an improved NR and AME was recorded. In Experiment 4, a small study was conducted to evaluate if <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> (WF; 1. 2 mL water: 1. 0 g feed) of diets with 30 % wDDGS would impact turkey poult performance. The WF significantly improved BW, FI and FCR. It is apparent from these studies that high levels of WDDGS were not detrimental to overall performance. The high levels of wDDGS with no loss of production would result in a higher demand of wDDGS for use in turkey diets. Overall, we saw no improvements in performance with individual supplementation of protease, β-mannanase or an enzyme cocktail. Neither was extrusion of wDDGS beneficial. Voluntary feed consumption is improved when diets are wetted before feeding...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of early feed restriction (FR) with <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> on size of small intestine, blood lipids and performance parameters in broilers from d 1 to 42. A total of 160 one-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly allocated to 4 treatments with 4 pens per treatment and 10 chickens per pen, in a fully randomized 2  ×  2 factorial arrangement, two feeding arrangement; providing feed ad libitum (Full Fed) or FR by 50 % between days 6 to 12, and feed in either wet or dry form (wet form, 1. 2  g water per 1  g dry feed). Body weight and feed intake of broiler chickens were determined at d 0, 21, and 42, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calculated. At d 42, two birds per replicate were euthanised for determination of carcass weight, organ weight and length, and also for blood parameters, which included high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol and triglycerides (TG). The broilers fed wet form irrespective of FR throughout had superior body weight gain and carcass weight compared with birds fed dry diets at d 22 and 42 (P <  0. 05). The wet form with FR significantly showed lower FCR compared with the wet form and ad libitum at d 1 to 21 (P <  0. 05). The broilers fed wet form had significantly increased HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol and decreased TG (P <  0. 05). In conclusion, wet form can improve performance growth and blood parameters, and the FR birds were able to attain normal market body weight at d 42, which suggests that growth compensation occurred...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the effect of raw anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus L.) as <b>wet</b> <b>feed</b> on growth performance and production cost of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss W.) reared in net pen during winter season in the Black Sea. The fish with an initial body weight of 100 g were hand fed to apparent satiation with only raw anchovy, only pellet and anchovy/pellet combination over 58 days. Final mean body weight of the groups fed anchovy and anchovy/pellet were significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than that of the group fed with only pellet. However, no difference was found between the groups fed anchovy and anchovy/pellet combination. Raw anchovy was well accepted than the pellet by the fish during the low water temperature. The use of raw anchovy as <b>wet</b> <b>feed</b> made positive effect on the production cost. In conclusion, by-catch anchovy must be evaluated as a supplemental diet to the pellet for rainbow trout, especially over a period of low water temperature in the Black Sea...|$|R

40|$|Diet {{structure}} and conformation during the starter phase {{play an important}} role in the functional development of the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract of broiler chicken, in particular the foregut segment.   Feed structure has a significant effect on the development of the foregut segments in broiler chickens. The development of the gastro-intestinal tract in chickens is aimed to adapt and to develop in line with the body in order to meet animal's demands for production traits and it should avoid the GI tract malfunction and improper GI tract development. These can be done by changing (alternating) feed properties and in feeding strategies during the starter phase. Chicken's diet components may be treated in order to enable the crop, the proventriculus - gizzard system to function optimally. Thus they will optimize feed digestion and utilisation. Therefore, the focus of this thesis was: 1) To understand the impact of changes in feed properties like technological treatments on broiler's performance. The technological changes in feed were made to induce differences in structure (particle sizes) and appearance (solid or liquid diets) of the feed and how this feed during the starter phase (0 - 3 weeks of age) influences the development and functioning of the foregut (crop and proventriculus); 2) To develop a feeding regime which optimizes foregut development and function of the foregut segment during starter phase and to see if there is a lasting effect on the following period, in other words, whether there is a carry over effect on performance of broilers during the grower phase. It has been shown that the starter period is critical for GI tract development. Feeding coarse diets during the starter phase improves the functional development of the proventriculus -gizzard system. <b>Wet</b> <b>feeding</b> improves feed intake and, as a consequence, broiler performance. Feeding a wet and coarsely ground diet provides a large improvement in feed intake, feed conversion and body weight gain, showing the most pronounced effects during the starter phase of broiler's life...|$|E
40|$|The Autonomous Province of Vojvodina is an Autonomous Province in Serbia, {{containing}} about 27 % of {{its total}} population according to the 2002 Census. Contribution of renewable energy sources in total energy consumption of Vojvodina contemporary amounts to less than 1 %, apropos 280 Â GWh/year. By combining of methods of introduction of new and renewable sources, systematic application of methods for increasing of energetic efficacy, {{as well as of}} introduction of the new technologies, percentage of contribution of the non-conventional energy sources in Vojvodina could be increased to as much as 20 %. This paper presents the potential of development of bioethanol production in Vojvodina. Production of bioethanol on small farms can be successfully applied for processing of only 30 Â kg of corn per day, with obtaining of crude ethanol in the so-called "brandy ladle" and use of lygnocellulosic agricultural wastes as an energy source. In a case of construction of a larger number of such plants, the only possible solution is seen in the principle of construction of the so-called "satellite plants", which will on small farm produce crude ethanol, with obtaining and consumption of stillage for animal feeding, and consumption of agricultural wastes as energetic fuels. If stillage is to be used as feed in <b>wet</b> <b>feeding,</b> it is estimated that, because of restrictions established by the magnitude of animal farm, the upper limit of capacity of such enterprises that process is at some 10 - 15 Â tons of corn per day, and production of 3000 - 3500 Â hL of absolute ethanol per day. In such a case, for animal feeding necessary is to have herd with 1300 - 1700 of milking cows or 5000 - 25, 000 heads of sheep and/or pigs. Technological model of separate grain processing ad bioethanol production from dextrose hydrolysates of starch is interesting for countries possessing plants for bioethanol production from molasses and plants for cereals processing into starch and dextrose hydrolysates of starch.

Foram utilizados 32 leitões Large White x Landrace, desmamados aos 21 dias, submetidos, durante a fase inicial I (21 a 42 dias de idade), a 8 tratamentos correspondentes à combinação dos fatores: forma de apresentação da ração (seca e úmida), tipo de ração (sem e com edulcorante) e água de consumo (sem e com edulcorante). Foram avaliados a ocorrência de diarréia até o 10 º dia pós-desmame, o ganho diário de peso (GDP), o consumo diário de ração (CDR) e a conversão alimentar (CA) até os 90 kg de peso vivo. O consumo diário de água (CDA) foi avaliado na fase inicial I. O delineamento foi em blocos ao acaso, com arranjo fatorial 2 ³, com quatro repetições, sendo as médias comparadas pelo teste de Tukey e a incidência de diarréia pelo teste de qui-quadrado. Foram observadas diferenças (P 0, 05). O experimento demonstrou que os tratamentos dirigidos na fase pós-desmame são insuficientes para melhorar os resultados até os 90 kg de peso vivo. An {{experiment was}} conducted to evaluate the <b>wet</b> <b>feeding</b> and water and rations with sweetener for piglets weaned {{and its effects on}} performance at 50 kg live weight. Thirty two Large white x Landrace, castrated male piglets weaned at 21 days and allocated during the initital phase 1 (21 to 42 days of age) were used in 8 treatments that were combinations with different types of diet (dry and wet), sweetener in the diet (with and without) and two types of drinking water (with and without sweetener). Diarrhea incidence at 10 days after weaning, daily weight gain, daily ration intake and feed convertion up to 90 kg were evaluated. Daily water intake was evaluated during the initial phase I. A randomized block design to study the factorial 2 ³ arrangement was used, with four replications. Means were compared by the Tukey test and diarrhea incidence by the chi-square test. The results showed significant differences (P 0. 05) between factors up to 90 kg live weight.

40|$|Membrane {{technology}} {{can be used for}} both post combustion carbon dioxide capture and acidic gas sweetening and dehydration of natural gas. These processes are especially suited for polymeric membranes with polyether functionality, because of the high affinity of this species for both H 2 O and CO 2. Here, both crosslinked polyethylene glycol diacrylate and a polyether-polyamide block copolymer (PEBAX 2533 ©) are studied for their ability to separate CO 2 from CH 4 and N 2 under single and mixed gas conditions, for both dry and <b>wet</b> <b>feeds,</b> as well as when 500 ppm H 2 S is present. The solubility of gases within these polymers is shown to be better correlated with the Lennard Jones well depth than with critical temperature. Under dry mixed gas conditions, CO 2 permeability is reduced compared to the single gas measurement because of competitive sorption from CH 4 or N 2. However, selectivity for CO 2 is retained in both polymers. The presence of water in the feed is observed to swell the PEG membrane resulting in a significant increase in CO 2 permeability relative to the dry gas scenario. Importantly, the selectivity is again retained under <b>wet</b> <b>feed</b> gas conditions. The presence of H 2 S is observed to only slightly reduce CO 2 permeability through both membranes...|$|R
