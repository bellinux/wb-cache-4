5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>open</b> the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E
25|$|As magma {{nears the}} surface and its {{pressure}} decreases, gases escape. This process is much like what happens <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>open</b> a bottle of fizzy drink and carbon dioxide escapes. Sulfur dioxide {{is one of the}} main components of volcanic gases, and increasing amounts of it herald the arrival of increasing amounts of magma near the surface. For example, on May 13, 1991, an increasing amount of sulfur dioxide was released from Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. On May 28, just two weeks later, sulfur dioxide emissions had increased to 5,000 tonnes, ten times the earlier amount. Mount Pinatubo later erupted on June 12, 1991. On several occasions, such as before the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the 1993 Galeras, Colombia eruption, sulfur dioxide emissions have dropped to low levels prior to eruptions. Most scientists believe that this drop in gas levels is caused by the sealing of gas passages by hardened magma. Such an event leads to increased pressure in the volcano's plumbing system and an increased chance of an explosive eruption. A multi-component gas analyzer system (Multi-GAS) is an instrument package used to take real-time high-resolution measurements of volcanic gas plumes. Multi-GAS measurements of CO2/SO2 ratios can allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] condemns male chauvinism by {{addressing}} hurtful myths about female inferiority, with Madonna commenting on female role-playing in society. During the pre-chorus, Madonna sings: [...] "Strong inside but you don't know it / Good little girls they never show it / <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>open</b> up your {{mouth to speak}} / Could you be a little weak?", she sings. The Village Voices Phil Dellio found the song [...] "the perfect answer record to The Virgin Suicides (where boys indeed stand {{on the side of}} the street looking uncomprehendingly on girls), thanks in no small part to the gossamer-like synthesizer percolating in the background. Jon Pareles of The New York Times called it [...] "Madonna's quasi-feminist statement," [...] while Eamon Sweeney of Hot Press noted that the song [...] "is similar in tone and texture to the Natalie Imbruglia smash ‘Smoke’." ...|$|E

60|$|Rollo {{was half}} {{inclined}} to ask Mr. George {{to put some}} specimens into the Guide Book; {{but he did not}} ask him, because he knew that Mr. George did not like to have dried plants in the Guide Book. Such specimens between the leaves of a book interfere very much with the convenience of using it, by dropping out <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>open</b> the book, or impeding the turning of the leaves.|$|E

60|$|Still, let us hold otherwise, {{though we}} grow grey {{and know the}} world for what it is.

[...] "I had {{intended}} to, but you were sleeping so quietly, and everything was so still, that I went off and slept, as soundly as you have done, until within {{half an hour of}} the time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> your eyes; but I am sure that I should have awoke at once, had you moved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>open</b> the box the rustles will escape, {{whether you}} are wearing a silk dress or not," [...] said the man, seriously. Then he picked up another box. [...] "In this," [...] he continued, [...] "are many {{assorted}} flutters. They are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day, {{when there is no}} wind. You, sir," [...] turning to the Wizard, [...] "ought to have this assortment. Once you have tried my goods I am sure you will never be without them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She had {{a little}} present for me on my birthday," [...] Amelius explained--"a purse of her own making.

'You have my heart's dearest wishes for your happiness; think of me sometimes, Amelius, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>open</b> your purse.' If you had been in my place, could you have told her to go away, when she said that, and put her gift into your hand? Not if she had been looking at you at the moment--I'll swear you couldn't have done it!" ...|$|E
60|$|One day Bob is importuned to give {{two feet}} {{off from his}} library for a closet in the bedroom, but resists like a Trojan. The next morning, being mollified by private {{domestic}} supplications, Bob yields, and my wife rubs out the lines of yesterday, two feet come off the library, and a closet is constructed. But now the parlor proves too narrow,--the parlor wall must be moved two feet into the hall. Bob declares this will spoil the symmetry of the latter; and, {{if there is anything}} he wants, it is a wide, generous, ample hall to step into <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>open</b> the front door.|$|E
50|$|Four {{years before}} the {{publication}} of the first Narnia book, Lewis had written as follows on the experience of reading really good poetry for the first time:...I did not in the least feel that I was getting in more quantity or better quality a pleasure I had already known.

5000|$|The [...]303 variant {{equipped}} the Hawker Hurricanes {{delivered to}} Soviet Air Forces, during the Great Patriotic War. Soviet airmen compared them to Soviet ShKAS {{in terms of}} reliability: [...] "But they often failed due to dust," [...] recalled pilot Nikolai G. Golodnikov. [...] "We tackled the problem gluing percale on all the machine-gun holes, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> fire, bullets went right through. The machine guns became reliable then. They were of low efficiency when fired from distances of 150-300m." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say nothing," [...] I replied, [...] "till {{you have}} heard the first story. Shut up the paper-case till that time, and then decide <b>when</b> <b>you</b> will <b>open</b> it again to write to your aunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps {{it really}} did say the dear things that love writes. Perhaps it was aghast at {{the way she was}} {{treating}} it. Dear letter! Her mouth smiled to it, but her hands remained afraid. As she stood irresolute, smiling, and afraid, she was a little like her mother. I have put off as long as possible saying that Grizel was ever like her mother. The Painted Lady had never got any letters while she was in Thrums, but she looked wistfully at those of other people. [...] "They are so pretty," [...] she had said; [...] "but don't open them: <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>open</b> them they break your heart." [...] Grizel remembered what her mother had said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'One gets used {{to these}} things,' said Ethelberta quietly. 'I {{should have been}} in bed certainly, had I not {{particularly}} wished to use this opportunity of meeting you before you go home to-morrow. I could not have come to Sandbourne to-day, because we are leaving to return again to Rookington. This is all that I wish you to take to mother--only a few little things which may be useful to her; but you will see what it contains <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>open</b> it.' She handed to Picotee a small parcel. 'This is for yourself,' she went on, giving a small packet besides. 'It will pay your fare home and back, and leave you something to spare.' ...|$|E

Do not ask the reason; and if you love my father, try to prevent any one from seeking me. I could not bear my life at Florence. I cannot bear to tell any one why. Help to cover my lot in silence. I have asked that my bridal chest should be sent to you: <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>open</b> it, you will know the reason. Please to give all the things that were my mother's to my cousin Brigida, and ask her to forgive me for not saying any words of parting to her.|$|E
5000|$|... ‘You didn’t let me {{open your}} hand in the beginning, and even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> did, <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> it very slowly - that shows that you don’t trust easily,’ he said. ‘You’re too closed as a person. Open up, you’ll enjoy life more.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am Captain Marryat, sir, of the Company's {{service in}} Madras; and was {{captured}} {{three months ago}} by these pirates. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> attacked the place, yesterday, I arranged to effect a small diversion; and {{with the assistance of}} these five native officers, of my soldier servant, here, and these ten men of the merchant service, we have, I hope, been able to do so. The native officers disabled the greater portion of the guns, during the night; and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> fire this morning we seized this inner work, which is also the magazine, and opened fire upon the rear of the sea defences. By dint of our guns, and of menaces to blow up the place if they assaulted it, we kept them at bay until their flag was hauled down." ...|$|R

[...] "This way," [...] he said excitedly, when she would have gone into the kitchen, and he flung {{open the door of}} what had been his warping-room. The warping-mill was gone--everything that had been there was gone. What met the delighted eyes of Elspeth and Tommy was a cozy parlour, which became a bedroom <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> that other door.
