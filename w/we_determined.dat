2500|$|The {{effects of}} the Caloris impact on the map area are not {{immediately}} apparent. No Caloris ejecta are evident, and most structural trends appear to be unrelated to this impact. However, near the west border of the map are two groups of large, overlapping craters centered at –31°, 183° and –49°, 182°. These groups appear to have formed simultaneously, as no specific stratigraphic sequence is evident. On the basis of crater clusters of similar appearance in the lunar highlands, which have been interpreted as Imbrium and Orientale basin secondaries (Schultz, 1976; Wilhelms, 1976b; Eggleton, 1981), these crater groups are interpreted to be Caloris Basin secondaries. Following the terminology developed by McCauley and others (1981) we have assigned them to the Van Eyck Formation, Secondary-Crater Facies. These secondaries overlie Dostoevskij ejecta and thus confirm that basin as pre-Caloris. <b>We</b> <b>determined</b> a reference crater density for Caloris in the Shakespeare quadrangle in order to correlate basin ages to that stratigraphic datum.|$|E
