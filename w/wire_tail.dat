A landing skid extended {{over most of the}} length of the nacelle. Aft of the nacelle, the fuselage was an uncovered converging Warren girder structure carrying the tail surfaces and braced laterally by wires to the mid-span wing points. The fin was very small but carried an almost rectangular rudder which extended to the fuselage keel via a cut-out in the elevators. The tailplane was straight tapered, with a swept leading edge. A <b>wire</b> <b>tail</b> bumper completed the undercarriage.|$|E
50|$|The {{plan was}} that the <b>wire</b> <b>tail</b> would be dragged for about 30 mi across the {{countryside}} and eventually encounter a high-voltage transmission line. A phase-to-phase short circuit would be initiated; during trials, arcs 15 ft long were initiated by the wire. The arc would burn for some time before the transmission line protection operated; {{there was a good}} chance the circuit breaker itself would be damaged and the conductors might burn through due to arcing. This could cause a line to collapse and require repairs. German efforts to protect transmission lines from attack were unsuccessful: neither a new type of line conductor clamp nor different overcurrent protection settings had any useful effect.|$|E

The gold bump is usually made by electroplating or gold evaporation, which cause the environment pollution and material waste. A gold wire bump manufacture technology for high power LED flip chip {{is described in}} this paper. The wire bond device is used and different bump making parameters, such as weld temperature, pressure and ultrasonic power, are optimized through experiments. At the same time, a new bump <b>wire</b> <b>tail</b> height managing process is introduced. The gold wire bump with this method height difference keep in 3 micrometers and which is convenient for flip chip. Then, rapid annealing is taken {{to make sure the}} gold wire bump has a well adherence to the wafer. At last, the bump weld result is tested and the bump invalidation is analyzed with the SEM. The bonding force between bump and wafer more than 10 grams. The flip chip high power LED with gold wire bump has low forth voltage and heat resistance. All of above proved that the gold wire bump is convenient and reliable for high power flip chip LED...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} methods developed to increase {{the quality of the}} crescent bond together with the tail bond quality. Low pull force of the crescent bond limits the usage of insulated Au wire in microelectronics assembly. Premature break of the tail which results in the stoppage of the bonding machine is one of obstacles to overcome for Cu wire. The primary focus of this thesis is to understand the tail and crescent bonding process and then to propose methodologies to improve thermosonic wire bonding processes when Cu and insulated Au wires are used. Several series of experiments to investigate the crescent and tail bonding processes are performed on auto bonders. Cu and insulated Au wires with diameters of 25 mm are bonded on the diepads of Ag leadframes. For simplicity, wire loops are oriented perpendicular to the ultrasonic direction. It was found that the crescent bond breaking force by pulling the wire loop (pull force) with insulated Au wire is about 80 % of that of bare Au wire. A modification of the crescent bonding process is made to increase the pull force with insulated Au wire. In the modified process, an insulation layer removing stage (cleaning stage) is inserted before the bonding stage. The cleaning stage consists of a scratching motion (shift) toward to the ball bond in combination with ultrasound. Bonds are then made on the fresh diepad with the insulation removed from the contact surface of the insulated Au wire. This process increases the pull force of the crescent bond up to 26 % which makes it comparable to the results obtained with bare Au wire. An online tail breaking force measurement method is developed with a proximity sensor between wire clamp and horn. Detailed understanding of tail bond formation is achieved by studying tail bond imprints with scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. Descriptions are given of the dependence of the tail breaking force on the bonding parameters, metallization variation, and cleanliness of the bond pad. Simultaneous optimization with pull force and tail breaking force can optimize the Cu wire bonding process both with high quality and robustness. It is recommended to first carry out conventional pull force optimization followed by a minimization of the bonding force parameter to the lowest value still fulfilling the pull force cpk requirement. The tail bond forms not only under the capillary chamfer, but also under the capillary hole. The tail breaking force includes both the interfacial bond breaking strength and the breaking strength of the thinned portion of the wire that will remain at the substrate as residue. Close investigations of the tail bond imprint with scanning electron microscopy indicate the presence of fractures of the substrate indicating substrate material being picked up by Cu <b>wire</b> <b>tail.</b> Pick up is found on Au and Cu wires, but the amount of pick up is much larger on Cu wire. The effect on the hardness of the subsequently formed Cu free air ball (FAB) as investigated with scanning electron microscopy and micro - hardness test shows that Cu FABs containing Au and Ag pick ups are softer than those without pick up. However, the hardness varies significantly more with Au pick up. The amount of Au pick up is estimated higher than 0. 03 % of the subsequently formed FAB volume, exceeding typical impurity and dopant concentrations (0. 01 %) added during manufacturing of the wire...|$|E

50|$|Its {{fuselage}} was wood framed, flat sided and plywood skinned. Its cockpit, {{open but}} with a small windscreen, was immediately ahead of the wing leading edge; there were no instruments. The Balilla's tail surfaces were all straight edged: the tailplane, single strut braced from below, had a sharply swept leading edge and carried elevators with angled tips and a cut-out for rudder movement. The vertical tail was tapered with a squared tip; the rudder reached to the keel, where it was protected by a <b>wire</b> loop <b>tail</b> bumper. Elevators and the rudder lacked aerodynamic balances. A conventional skid, running from the nose to below the wing trailing edge formed the undercarriage.|$|R

50|$|A {{development}} of the earlier Ba.27 fighter (1932), the Ba.64 was designed in 1933 to requirements set out by the Regia Aeronautica for an aircraft able to undertake multiple roles: fighter, bomber and reconnaissance. The aircraft featured an all-metal, low-wing cantilever monoplane with a <b>wire</b> braced <b>tail</b> unit and fixed tail wheel. The open cockpit was placed well forward on the fuselage {{in line with the}} wing roots to provide an excellent field of vision down as well as forward. The headrest behind the cockpit was extended as a streamlined fairing {{all the way down the}} fuselage upper decking to the tail. Two prototypes powered by a 522 kW (700 hp) Bristol Pegasus were developed, the first as a two-seater bomber with an armament of four 7.7 mm (0.303 in) machine guns in the wings and up to 400 kg (882 lb) of bombs in racks under the wings. The second was a single-seater fighter configuration fitted with a semi-retractable main landing gear that when in its rearward retracted position, provided less drag as well as protection in case of a wheels-up landing.|$|R

50|$|Both {{versions}} of the CycloCrane were 178 ft (54.25 m) long. The first version, completed in 1982 had four piston engines and was fitted with a large, inverted Y shaped tail needed to stabilise it at its moorings by keeping it pointed into wind. That version was destroyed at its moorings in a storm and was never flown. It was rebuilt by 1984 and fitted with an 18 faceted, ring shaped <b>tail</b> <b>wire</b> braced to the central axis. The aerostats in both versions were 68 ft 0 in (20.73 m) in diameter and 136 ft 0 in (41.45 m) long and manufactured by ILC Dover of Frederica, Delaware, USA. Partly to save weight, this version had only two engines, a pair of 150 hp (112 kW) Textron Lycoming AEIO-320 horizontally opposed piston engines driving 4-bladed propellers.
