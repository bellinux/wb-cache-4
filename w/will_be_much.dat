5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E
5|$|The Buckeye is {{the only}} purely American breed to sport a pea comb, and this, {{combined}} with its stocky build, makes it a supremely cold hardy chicken. Other breeds of fowl developed in the U.S. (such as the Ameraucana) may sport pea combs, but these chickens were primarily created from foreign birds. It also bears some traits of Game fowl in frame and disposition, being assertive in character {{and a very good}} forager. Generally calm, the cock birds in rare cases may become aggressive. Despite its game heritage, it tolerates confinement well, although it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> happier and produce better if allowed to range on grass. The Buckeye is said by breeders to be disinclined towards feather picking. A good meat producer and layer of between 150 and 200 eggs per year, the Buckeye is a dual purpose chicken wellsuited to small farmyard and backyard flocks.|$|E

5|$|The third planned {{expansion}} {{runs from}} the city center southwards, east of the Center–Nesttun Line, serving Haukeland University Hospital. It then heads west, intersecting with the first line at Kronstad, runs through a tunnel before serving the areas of Fyllingsdalen. The line can use parts of the Norwegian National Rail Administration's right of way from the city center to Kronstad, and would feature a station under the hospital, which is Western Norway's largest work place. It is not planned an extension to Loddefjord and Storavatnet from Fyllingsdalen at this time because the time of travel <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher than the direct bus line using the highway to the city center.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly {{as we know}} it today until the {{hydrogen}} in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially {{on the part of those}} scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact. The author <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E
60|$|In his inmost soul <b>Will</b> <b>was</b> {{conscious}} of wishing to tell Dorothea what was rather new {{even in his}} own construction of things--namely, that Mr. Casaubon had never done more than pay a debt towards him. <b>Will</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> too good a fellow to be easy under {{the sense of being}} ungrateful. And when gratitude has become a matter of reasoning there are many ways of escaping from its bonds.|$|R
40|$|Wegner’s book is on perceptual {{and motor}} illusions of free well and agency, but free <b>will</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more profoundly illusory {{than any of}} the {{phenomena}} reported in his book. We never do anything because we feel like it, even it is feels as if we do, because feelings cannot have any independent causal power, on pain of telekinetic dualism...|$|R
60|$|<b>Wills</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> gratified by your remembrance, {{and sends}} you his warm regard. He wishes me to {{represent}} {{that he is}} very little to be pitied. That he suffers no pain, scarcely inconvenience, even, {{so long as he}} is idle. That he likes idleness exceedingly. He has bought a country place by Welwyn in Hertfordshire, near Lytton's, and takes possession presently.|$|R
25|$|In {{the absence}} of {{interstitial}} materials, as in a vacuum, the contact resistance <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> larger, since flow through the intimate contact points is dominant.|$|E
25|$|Climate models tend to {{reinforce}} that temperature trends {{due to global}} warming <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> smaller in Antarctica than in the Arctic, but ongoing research may show otherwise.|$|E
25|$|If a {{resurgence}} of SARS this winter coincides with the annual outbreak of influenza, identifying and isolating suspected SARS cases <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more difficult. SARS also could mutate, altering the symptoms, transmissibility, or lethality of the disease.|$|E

25|$|The {{advantages}} {{of this technology}} are potentially enormous. Well-coordinated fully automatic driving <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more efficient, with reduction in traffic jams and road accidents, which cost trillions {{per year in the}} US alone. Efficiency will also reduce energy consumption and thus pollution and climate change.|$|E
25|$|Note: Most {{players will}} declare a Grand {{game with the}} above hand, as it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more lucrative than a Suit game in Hearts (declarer will concede at most two Club tricks, {{probably}} achieving Schneider for a Game Value of at least 144 (24x6)).|$|E
25|$|More expensive: If {{high-power}} loudspeakers {{are used}} {{with an emphasis}} on low frequency response, the required transformers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> larger and will add significant cost to the project. Additionally, in some areas, local building and electrical code requires 70-volt cabling to be carried within conduit, increasing the overall project cost.|$|E

25|$|Pali {{sources say}} that beings in Maitreya's time <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> bigger than {{during the time of}} Sakyamuni. In one prophecy his disciples are contemptuous of Mahakasyapa, whose head is no larger than an insect to them. Buddhas robe barely covers two fingers making them wonder how tiny Buddha was. Mahākāśyapa is said to be small enough in {{comparison}} to cremate in the palm of Maitreya's hand.|$|E
25|$|The loss of Freyr's sword has consequences. According to the Prose Edda, Freyr had {{to fight}} Beli without his sword and slew him with an antler. But the result at Ragnarök, {{the end of the}} world, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more serious. Freyr is fated to fight the fire-giant Surtr and since he does not have his sword he will be defeated. In the Íslendingabók, Freyr's sword is known as Sumarbrandr.|$|E

25|$|Compression of air creates heat; {{the air is}} warmer after compression. Expansion removes heat. If {{no extra}} heat is added, the air <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> colder after expansion. If the heat {{generated}} during compression can be stored and used during expansion, {{the efficiency of the}} storage improves considerably. There are three ways in which a CAES system can deal with the heat. Air storage can be adiabatic, diabatic, or isothermal.|$|E
25|$|Local {{planning}} restrictions {{combined with}} a lack of available surplus land mean that St Paul's is faced with progressively replacing obsolete buildings with new ones located in the same general area. The plan should eventually result in a large building footprint area increase as well as increasing the amount of staff housing. The number of car parking spaces will be reduced, but there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more available room for bicycles.|$|E
25|$|At {{temperatures}} above 550°C {{the equilibrium}} CO2 pressure begins {{to exceed the}} CO2 pressure in air. So above 550°C, calcium carbonate begins to outgas CO2 into air. However, in a charcoal fired kiln, the concentration of CO2 <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher {{than it is in}} air. Indeed, if all the oxygen in the kiln is consumed in the fire, then the partial pressure of CO2 in the kiln can be as high as 20 kPa.|$|E
