To investigate these issues, an experiment was conducted under rainfed conditions using grass vegetation strip (VS) with minimum tillage, organic amendments and weed mulch during June 2007 –October 2011 at Dehradun, Uttarakhand in the Indian Himalayan region. Results showed that the mean <b>wheat</b> <b>equivalent</b> yield was ~ 47 % higher in the plots under with CA compared with conventional agriculture in a maize–wheat crop rotation. Mean runoff coefficients and soil loss with CA plots were ~ 45 % less and ~ 54 % less than conventional agriculture plots. On average, after the harvest of maize, soil moisture conservation up to 90 cm soil depth for wheat crop was 108 % higher under CA than conventional agriculture plots. The net return from the plots with CA was 85 % higher, and when expressed net return per tonne of soil loss, it was four and half times higher than conventional practice. Results demonstrate that the suitable CA practice (a grass strip of Palmarosa with applied organic amendments (farmyard manure, vermicompost and poultry manure) along with weed mulching under conservation tillage) enhances system productivity, reduces runoff, soil loss and conserve soil moisture...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, Eucalyptus globulus planted along field {{boundaries}} {{has come}} to dominate the central highland landscape of Ethiopia. Although evidence is scanty, there is a perception that this practice adversely affects crop productivity. An on-farm trial was conducted on Pellic Vertisol at Ginchi to determine the production potential of eucalypt boundaries and their effect on the productivity of adjacent crops of tef (Eragrostis tef) and wheat (Triticum sp.). The experiment comprised three stand ages, four field aspects and six distances from the tree-crop interface, using a split-split plot design with three replicates. Wood production rates ranged between 168 kg ha- 1 y- 1 (four years old) and 2901 kg ha- 1 y- 1 (twelve years). Thus eucalypt boundaries planted on a hectare of land would satisfy 50 to 75 % of the annual biomass energy requirement of a rural household of five persons. Significant depression of tef and wheat yields occurred over the first 12 m from the tree line: the reduction was 20 to 73 % for tef and 20 to 51 % for <b>wheat,</b> <b>equivalent</b> to yield losses of 4. 4 to 26 % and 4. 5 to 10 % per hectare respectively. Nevertheless, in financial terms, the tree component adequately compensated for crop yield reduction and even generated additional income. Therefore, eucalypt boundaries have great potential to satisfy the rising demand for wood, without requiring {{a major change in}} land use on the highland Vertisols. The greater availability of wood will reduce the demand for dung and crop residues for fuel, and thus may contribute to improved soil management on croplands while relieving the increasing pressure on indigenous forest and woodlands...|$|E

Results showed that the highest grain yield and <b>wheat</b> <b>equivalent</b> yield was obtained from sole cropping of wheat. In the intercropping of two rows of wheat with one row of chickpea and one row of wheat with two rows of chickpea Land Equivalent Ratio was 0. 87 and 0. 71 respectively that was less than sole cropping of wheat and cicer. Relative Crowding Coefficient of wheat in two rows of wheat with one row of chickpea and one row of wheat with two rows of chickpea was 1. 93 and 1. 73 and of chickpea was 0. 15 and 0. 17 respectively.

40|$|Concurrent {{schedules}} {{were used}} to establish 6 hens' preferences for three foods. The resulting biases suggested wheat was preferred over honey-puffed and puffed wheat, and puffed wheat was the least preferred food. The hens then responded under fixed-ratio schedules for each food in 40 -min (excluding reinforcer time) sessions, with the response requirement doubling each session until no reinforcers were received. At the smaller ratios, the less preferred the food, the faster the hens' overall response rates (mainly {{as a result of}} shorter postreinforcement pauses) and the more reinforcers they received. The relations between the logarithms of the number of reinforcers obtained (consumption) and the response ratio (price) were well fitted by curvilinear demand functions. Wheat produced the smallest initial consumption (ln L), followed by honey-puffed and puffed wheat, respectively. The response requirement at which the demand functions predicted maximal responding (Pmax) were larger for wheat than for the other foods. Normalizing consumption and price, as suggested by Hursh and Winger (1995), moved the data for the three foods towards a single demand function; however, the Pmax values were generally largest for puffed wheat. The results of normalization, as suggested by Hursh and Silberberg (2008), depended on the k value used. The parameter k is related to the range of the data, and the same k value needs to be used for all data sets that are compared. A k value of 8. 0 gave significantly higher essential values (smaller α values) for puffed wheat as compared to honey-puffed wheat and wheat, and the Pmax values, in normalized standard price units, were largest for puffed wheat. Normalizing demand by converting the puffed and honey-puffed wheat reinforcers to <b>wheat</b> <b>equivalents</b> (by applying the bias parameter from the concurrent-schedules procedure) maintained separate demand functions for the foods. Those for wheat had the smallest rates of change in elasticity (a) and, in contrast to the other analyses, the largest Pmax values.

40|$|Carbon {{sequestration}} {{in tropical}} soils has potential for mitigating {{global warming and}} increasing agricultural productivity. We analyzed 26 long-term experiments (LTEs) in different agro-climatic zones (ACZs) of India to assess the potential and cost of C sequestration. Data on initial and final soil organic C (SOC) concentration in the recommended N, P and K (NPK); recommended N, P and K plus farmyard manure (NPK + FYM) and unfertilized (control) treatments were used to calculate carbon sequestration potential (CSP) i. e., capacity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) by increasing SOC stock, under different nutrient management scenarios. In most of the LTEs <b>wheat</b> <b>equivalent</b> yields {{were higher in the}} NPK + FYM treatment than the NPK treatment. However, partial factor productivity (PFP) was more with the NPK treatment. Average SOC concentration of the control treatment was 0. 54 %, which increased to 0. 65 % in the NPK treatment and 0. 82 % in the NPK + FYM treatment. Compared to the control treatment the NPK + FYM treatment sequestered 0. 33 Mg C ha− 1 yr− 1 whereas the NPK treatment sequestered 0. 16 Mg C ha− 1 yr− 1. The CSP in different nutrient management scenarios ranged from 2. 1 to 4. 8 Mg C ha− 1 during the study period (average 16. 9 yr) of the LTEs. In 17 out of 26 LTEs, the NPK + FYM treatment had higher SOC and also higher net return than that of the NPK treatment. In the remaining 9 LTEs SOC sequestration in the NPK + FYM treatment was accomplished with decreased net return suggesting that these are economically not attractive and farmers have to incur into additional cost to achieve C sequestration. The feasibility of SOC sequestration in terms of availability of FYM and other organic sources has been discussed in the paper...|$|E
40|$|Organic farming {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} priority area globally in view of growing demand for safe and healthy food which provides health and environmental benefits. The long term sustainability and concerns on environmental pollution associated with indiscriminate use of agrochemicals calls for use of organic farming practices in agriculture for maintaining soil health and crop productivity. Over the past few decades, increasing {{attention has been given}} to intercropping particularly in organic agricultural systems and the evidence suggests that this can provide production advantages over sole crops in the absence of increased external inputs due to more efficient utilization of resources. Component crops in intercropping may differ in their use of growth resources over time and space such that when grown together they make more efficient use of light, water and nutrients than when grown separately. Therefore, to study the effect of different composts on the productivity of crops and soil health in terms of nutrient and microbial status in maize/maize + soybean-wheat + gram cropping system, a long term field experiment was conducted at Model Organic Farm of CSK Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University, Palampur (H. P.), India w. e. f. 2006 - 07 to 2011 - 12. The treatments consisted of FYM 20 t/ha, vermicompost (VC) 15 t/ha, Him compost (HC) 5 t/ha, FYM+HC (10 + 2 t/ha), vermicompost + HC (10 + 1 t/ha), FYM + vermicompost (10 + 10 t/ha) and control (FYM 5 t/ha) from 2006 - 07 to 2008 - 09, however, the doses of composts were reduced after 3 rd year of experimentation and the treatments were slightly modified as FYM 15 t/ha, VC 10 t/ha, HC 5 t/ha, FYM + HC (7. 5 + 2. 5 t/ha), VC + HC (5. 0 + 2. 5 t/ha), FYM + VC (7. 5 + 5. 0 t/ha) and Control (FYM 5 t/ha). After third year of experimentation maize + soybean was taken in place of maize in kharif season. Whereas, in rabi season wheat + gram continued as such. In general, for {{the first three years of}} study i. e. w. e. f. 2006 - 07 to 2008 - 09 the yield levels of maize were not increased, however, after third year of study i. e. from 2009 to 2011 the yield levels were improved because of improvement of the fertility and microbial status of the soil. Similarly, in wheat also the yield levels during the first two years i. e. 2006 - 07 and 2007 - 08 were low and almost same but there after an impressive increase in yield levels of wheat was obtained till 2011 - 12 due to continuous increase in fertility levels of the soil. The treatment effects on yield contributing characters of maize and wheat were significant which ultimately increased the grain yields significantly over the control during all the years of experimentation. Irrespective of the doses of different composts, FYM + HC, VC + HC and FYM + VC being at par with each other produced higher values of almost all the yield attributes both of maize and wheat which ultimately resulted in significantly higher maize and <b>wheat</b> <b>equivalent</b> yields over the remaining treatments i. e.

A pilot study of experimental infection with the hookworm Necator americanus was undertaken {{among a group of}} otherwise healthy people with celiac disease to test the potential of the helminth to suppress the immunopathology induced by gluten. METHODS: In a 21 -week, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study, we explored the effects of N. americanus infection in 20 healthy, helminth-naïve adults with celiac disease well controlled by diet. Staged cutaneous inoculations with 10 and 5 infective 3 (rd) stage hookworm larvae or placebo were performed at week- 0 and - 12 respectively. At week- 20, a five day oral <b>wheat</b> challenge <b>equivalent</b> to 16 grams of gluten per day was undertaken. Primary outcomes included duodenal Marsh score and quantification of the immunodominant α-gliadin peptide (QE 65) -specific systemic interferon-γ-producing cells by ELISpot pre- and post-wheat challenge. RESULTS: Enteric colonisation with hookworm established in all 10 cases, resulting in transiently painful enteritis in 5. Chronic infection was asymptomatic, with no effect on hemoglobin levels. Although some duodenal eosinophilia was apparent, hookworm-infected mucosa retained a healthy appearance. In both groups, wheat challenge caused deterioration in both primary and several secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental N. americanus infection proved to be safe and enabled testing its effect on a range of measures of the human autoimmune response.

40|$|The Juvenile Hormone {{analogue}} s-methoprene is used {{to protect}} stored grain from pests such as the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.). The possibility that uneven application influences s-methoprene efficacy against this species was investigated in the laboratory. Adults of methoprene-susceptible strains were exposed for 14 days to wheat treated at doses of up to 0. 6 mg kg- 1, or to mixtures of treated and untreated <b>wheat</b> giving <b>equivalent</b> average doses. Adult mortality after exposure to treated wheat was negligible in all cases (3. 3 %) {{and there was no}} significant effect of either average dose or evenness of application. In contrast, the number of adult progeny depended on both the average dose and evenness of application. Average doses of 0. 3 and 0. 6 mg kg- 1 reduced the number of live F 1 adults by 99 - 100 % relative to the untreated wheat and no effect of evenness of application was detected. At lower doses, however, efficacy tended to decrease with increasing unevenness of application. When adults from the parental generation were transferred to untreated wheat for another 14 days neither the average dose nor evenness of application in the wheat from which they came had any significant effect on reproduction of these adults. This study demonstrates that uneven application can reduce the efficacy of s-methoprene against R. dominica, but that this is unlikely to influence the performance of s-methoprene against susceptible populations at target doses likely to be used in practice (e. g. 0. 6 mg kg- 1 in Australia).

40|$|The {{development}} of bioregenerative systems {{as part of}} the Controlled Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) program depends, in large part, on the ability to recycle inorganic nutrients, contained in waste material, into plant growth systems. One significant waste (resource) stream is inedible plant material. This research compared wheat growth in hydroponic solutions based on inorganic salts (modified Hoagland's) with solutions based on the soluble fraction of inedible wheat biomass (leachate). Recycled nutrients in leachate solutions provided the majority of mineral nutrients for plant growth, although additions of inorganic nutrients to leachate solutions were necessary. Results indicate that plant growth and waste recyling systems can be effectively coupled within CELSS based on <b>equivalent</b> <b>wheat</b> yield in leachate and Hoagland solutions, and the rapid mineralization of waste organic material in the hydroponic systems. Selective enrichment for microbial communities able to mineralize organic material within the leachate was necessary to prevent accumulation of dissolved organic matter in leachate-based solutions.

It is a dark, heavy bread which is sometimes bought pre-sliced, in varieties from light-colored rye, to very dark, and refined to whole grain. Rugbrød forms the basis of smørrebrød (see above). Many people still bake at home, particularly boller, which are small bread rolls, and often the traditional kringle, which is a pastry filled with Zante currants and remonce paste.

Because of the popular rye bread, Danes eat less wheat bread than most other western countries, even though bread is part of most daily meals.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{environmental}} impact of wheat production was assessed through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Local data were collected to characterize Walloon conventional and organic wheat production systems. Two functional units (FU) were investigated: 1 kg of wheat grains at 15 % humidity and 1 ha used for wheat cropping. An uncertainty analysis assessed the significance of differences between conventional and organic systems. Using 1 kg of grains as FU, results are not significantly different in global warming and cumulative energy demand. Very highly significant differences for soil acidification and eutrophication, and significant differences for agricultural land occupation {{were found to be}} in favor of conventional wheat production.

The insulinotropic mechanism of milk has not been elucidated. Objective: The objective was to evaluate the effect of common dietary sources of animal or vegetable proteins on concentrations of postprandial blood glucose, insulin, amino acids, and incretin hormones [glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1] in healthy subjects. Design: Twelve healthy volunteers were served test meals consisting of reconstituted milk, cheese, whey, cod, and <b>wheat</b> gluten with <b>equivalent</b> amounts of lactose. An equicarbohydrate load of white-wheat bread {{was used as a}} reference meal. Results: A correlation was found between postprandial insulin responses and early increments in plasma amino acids; the strongest correlations were seen for leucine, valine, lysine, and isoleucine. A correlation was also obtained between responses of insulin and GIP concentrations. Reconstituted milk powder and whey had substantially lower postprandial glucose areas under the curve (AUCs) than did the bread reference (– 62 % and – 57 %, respectively). Whey meal was accompanied by higher AUCs for insulin (90 %) and GIP (54 %).

40|$|Coleoptile {{length in}} wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can be {{affected}} by several factors, including genotype, height-reducing genes and environmental factors, including temperature. There is little information on how these factors influence rate and duration of coleoptile growth to determine final coleoptile length in wheat. Coleoptile growth was determined for eight genotypes representing four different height-reducing genes: gibberellic acid (GA) -sensitive, standard height (rht), GA-sensitive semidwarfs (Rht 8); and GA-insensitive, semidwarfs (Rht 2). These were grown in the dark at three temperatures (12, 16 and 20 ˚C) and coleoptile lengths measured every 12 ˚Cd. Logistic growth curves were fitted to coleoptile growth data for each genotype with thermal time as the explanatory variable. Differences in final coleoptile length were largely attributable to differences in rate of coleoptile elongation although there were small differences in duration of growth between genotypes. The longer coleoptile of the rht wheats was achieved through the fastest rate of coleoptile elongation. Coleoptiles of Rht 8 <b>wheats</b> were <b>equivalent</b> in final length to rht wheats at 107 mm, but achieved this through a slower growth rate (2. 10 mm ˚Cd– 1) combined with an increased duration of growth (57 ˚Cd). In contrast, the shorter coleoptiles of Rht 2 wheats resulted from 25 % slower rates of elongation than either Rht 8 or rht. There were no interactions between the components of coleoptile growth and temperature, although a longer duration and a fast rate of growth combined to increase coleoptile length at 12 ˚C compared with either 16 or 20 ˚C. In a second experiment, dry matter partitioning and length of coleoptile, subcrown internode (SCI), shoot and roots were determined after 200 ˚Cd. In Rht 2, the SCI and shoot were short while roots were longer than either Rht 8 or rht. Reduced dry matter (DM) partitioning to the coleoptile and SCI and DM retention in the seed reduced the endosperm-use efficiency (EUE) of Rht compared with rht. EUE was poor also in Rht 8, apparently through increased respiratory losses. Reduced partitioning of dry matter to coleoptiles and the SCI in Rht 2 increased the root : shoot ratio compared with rht or Rht 8. We conclude that either increased rate or duration of coleoptile growth could be targeted in a breeding program that aims to increase coleoptile length in wheat...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of TT on muscular strength, blood pressure, and cholesterol in a sedentary population. Eighteen males (18 - 24 yrs,) were randomly assigned using a double-blind protocol into either TT group (n= 9) or placebo (n= 9), while subjects participated in an 8 -week resistance training program. Each group either ingested a 650 mg TT pill or a <b>wheat</b> grass <b>equivalent</b> pill with no change in diet. Strength outcomes were measured by having participants perform a 10 -rep max strength test. Body fat outcomes were analyzed by including 7 -site skinfold measurements and upper and lower body circumferences. Blood lipids and glucose were measured using the Cholestech LDX machine. The training protocol consisted of Smith machine bench press, Smith machine squat, Hammer Strength lat-pulldown, and Hammer Strength seated bicep curl with a ten percent progressive overload rate each week. Baseline body composition, cardiovascular health including cholesterol, and strength were not significantly different. Two-by-two repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze differences between the control and TT groups for all dependent measures. There was a 100 % adherence rate as all subjects completed the training protocol for the entire eight weeks. Although changes did exist such as decrease in body fat percentage (TT- 14. 4 ± 6. 0 to 11. 9 ± 6. 1; Control- 14. 0 ± 5. 4 to 11. 3 ± 4. 7) and total cholesterol (TT- 173. 4 ± 30. 8 to 167. 2 ± 28. 2; Control- 171. 6 ± 30. 4; TT- 155. 6 ± 24. 8), there were no significant differences after 8 weeks between the two groups. There was however, a significant decrease in overall cholesterol for the TT group after training (167. 2 ± 28. 2) (F = 10. 24; P =. 006). Individual variables of cholesterol such as LDL, HDL, triglycerides and blood pressure were not significantly different between groups.

40|$|Intensive {{agriculture}} ensures high yields but {{can cause}} serious environmental damages. The optimal use {{of soil and}} atmospheric sources of nitrogen in cereal–legume mixtures may allow farmers to maintain high production levels and good quality with low external N inputs, and could potentially decrease environmental impacts, particularly through a more efficient energy use. These potential advantages are presented in an overall assessment of cereal–legume systems, accounting for the agronomic, environmental, energetic, and economic performances. Based on a low-input experimental field network including 16 site-years, we found that yields of pea–wheat intercrops (about 4. 5 Mg ha− 1 whatever the amount of applied fertiliser) were higher than sole pea and close to conventionally managed wheat yields (5. 4 Mg ha− 1 on average), the intercrop requiring {{less than half of}} the nitrogen fertiliser per ton of grain compared to the sole <b>wheat.</b> The land <b>equivalent</b> ratio and a statistical analysis based on the Price 2 ̆ 7 s equation showed that the crop mixture was more efficient than sole crops particularly under unfertilised situations.

The intercrops allowed (i) maintaining wheat grain protein concentration and gross margin compared to wheat sole crop and (ii) increased the contribution of N 2 fixation to total N accumulation of pea crop in the mixture compared to pea sole crop.

Himalaya 292) {{is a novel}} hull-less barley variety lacking {{activity}} of a key enzyme of starch synthesis giving a grain containing less total starch, more amylose and higher total dietary fibre. Animal trials have shown that Himalaya 292 contains more resistant starch and has greater positive impact on biomarkers of large-bowel health than comparable wholegrain cereal products. The present study compared the effects of foods made from wholegrain Himalaya 292 with those made from wholegrain wheat on faecal biomarkers of bowel health in human subjects. Seventeen male and female volunteers aged 31 – 66 years consumed similar quantities of Himalaya 292, whole-wheat or refined cereal foods daily for 4 weeks in a randomised cross-over design. Total dietary fibre intakes from weighed food records were 45, 32 and 21 g/d for the Himalaya 292, whole-wheat and refined cereal periods, respectively. Compared with the refined cereal foods, consumption of Himalaya 292 foods resulted in 33 % higher faecal weight, a lowering of faecal pH from 7 · 24 to 6 · 98, a 42 % higher faecal concentration and a 91 % higher excretion of butyrate, a 57 % higher faecal total SCFA excretion and a 33 % lower faecal p-cresol concentration. pH and butyrate concentration and excretion were also significantly different compared with wholemeal wheat. It is concluded that consumption of a diet that included foods made from Himalaya 292 supplied more fibre and improved indices of bowel health compared with refined cereal foods and, for some indices, similar wholemeal <b>wheat</b> foods at <b>equivalent</b> levels of intake.

40|$|During {{the early}} stages of meiosis, three key {{processes}} occur: chromosome pairing, synapsis and DNA recombination. Chromosomes are first replicated during interphase, after which they are aligned together in a non-random fashion to enable the installation of the synaptonemal complex (SC) along the chromosome axes leading to synapsis. Recombination machinery then enables strand invasion to occur, which then leads to the formation of chiasmata and ultimately, genetic recombination. Meiosis is further complicated in organisms with multiple genomes such as allohexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) which has three genomes (inherited from similar yet distinct progenitors), each with seven chromosomes. Thus a large number of proteins are likely to be required for the successful execution of this biological process. The first approach in this study used proteomics to identify proteins that have possible roles during {{the early stages}} of wheat meiosis. Total protein samples isolated from staged meiocytes (specifically from pooled stages of pre-meiotic interphase to pachytene and from telophase I to telophase II) of wild-type Chinese Spring and the Pairing homoeologous deletion mutants, ph 1 b and ph 2 a, were analysed by 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 DGE). This resulted in identifying six differentially expressed protein spots (designated KK 01 to KK 06); from which three full-length coding sequences and one partial coding sequence of the candidate genes encoding these proteins were isolated (a putative speckle-type POZ protein, a pollen-specific SF 21 -like protein, a putative HSP 70 -like protein, as well as a partial hexose transporter peptide). Southern blot analysis revealed that these genes were spread across four different chromosome groups (2, 7, 5 and 1 respectively) with a copy on each of the three genomes (A, B and D). Q-PCR analysis of these four genes across the two pooled meiotic stages and various genotypes suggests that both KK 01 and KK 06 have roles during {{the early stages of}} meiosis and that they may be directly/indirectly regulated by a combination of elements within the Ph 1 and Ph 2 loci. The high level of KK 03 mRNA transcript detected in the later stages of meiosis is consistent with its role as a pollen-specific protein-encoding gene. In contrast, KK 04 expression suggests that it is post-transcriptionally regulated resulting in KK 04 being translated in the ph 2 a mutant. Both the speckle-type POZ protein and putative dnaK/HSP 70 protein were also shown to interact with DNA in vitro. The second approach of this study focused on isolating and characterising wheat homologues of two known meiotic proteins, namely PHS 1 and ZYP 1. In the maize PHS 1 mutant Zmphs 1 - 0, homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis are significantly affected, with homoeologous chromosome interactions occurring between multiple partners. More recently, co-immunolocalisation assays using anti-PHS 1 and anti-RAD 50 antibodies showed that both proteins had similar localisation patterns in the wild-type maize plants and that RAD 50 localisation into the nucleus was affected by the absence of PHS 1 thus implicating PHS 1 as a regulator of RAD 50 nuclear transport. In this study, the full-length coding transcript of wheat PHS 1 (TaPHS 1) was isolated, sequenced and characterised. TaPHS 1 is located on chromosome group 7 with copies on the A, B and D genomes. Expression profiling of TaPHS 1 in both wild-type and the ph 1 b mutant during and post-meiosis show elevated levels of TaPHS 1 expression in the ph 1 b background. The TaPHS 1 protein has sequence similarity to other plant PHS 1 /PHS 1 -like proteins but also possesses a unique region of oligopeptide repeat units. DNA-binding assays using both full-length and partial peptides of TaPHS 1 show conclusively that TaPHS 1 is able to interact with both single- and double-stranded DNA in vitro, even though no known conserved DNA-binding domain was identified within the TaPHS 1 sequence, indicating TaPHS 1 possesses a novel uncharacterised DNA-binding domain. Immunolocalisation data from assays conducted using an antibody raised against TaPHS 1 demonstrates that TaPHS 1 associates with chromatin during early meiosis, with the signal persisting beyond chromosome synapsis. Furthermore, TaPHS 1 does not appear to co-localise with the asynapsis protein – TaASY 1 – possibly suggesting that these proteins are independently coordinated. Combined, these results provide new insight into the potential functions of PHS 1 during early meiosis in bread wheat. Similar to PHS 1, Arabidopsis knock-down mutants of ZYP 1 also display non-homologous chromosome interactions. ZYP 1 has previously been characterised as a SC protein required for holding homologous chromosomes together in other species. In this study, the full-length coding sequence of the wheat ZYP 1 (TaZYP 1) homologue was isolated, sequenced and characterised. Expression of TaZYP 1 analysed by Q-PCR across wild-type, ph 1 b and multiple Taasy 1 mutants during meiosis showed an approximate 1. 3 -fold increase in the ph 1 b mutant. In addition, DNA-binding assays demonstrate that TaZYP 1 interacts with dsDNA under in vitro conditions while immunolocalisation (using an anti-TaZYP 1 antibody) across wild-type, ph 1 b and Taasy 1 revealed the spatial and temporal localisation pattern of TaZYP 1. Taken together, these results show that TaZYP 1 plays an identical role to its homologues in other species as a SC protein and is affected by reduced levels of TaASY 1 in wheat. This body of work utilised a two-pronged approach to investigate meiosis in wheat with the overall outcome of identifying new meiotic proteins as well as characterising the <b>wheat</b> <b>equivalents</b> of two known meiotic proteins previously reported in other organisms. To this end, two previously uncharacterised wheat proteins with possible roles (involving interactions with chromatin) during meiosis have been successfully identified using the proteomics approach while both TaPHS 1 and TaZYP 1 have been characterised with antibodies raised against both these proteins. The characterisation of TaPHS 1 and its DNA-binding capabilities, both in vitro and in planta, has shed light on a previously unknown function of the PHS 1 protein while the localisation profile of TaZYP 1 in Taasy 1 mutant lines has contributed to our understanding of how ASY 1 levels can affect chromosome pairing in wheat.

[URL] agriculture ensures high yields but {{can cause}} serious environmental damages. The optimal use {{of soil and}} atmospheric sources of nitrogen in cereal-legume mixtures may allow farmers to maintain high production levels and good quality with low external N inputs, and could potentially decrease environmental impacts, particularly through a more efficient energy use. These potential advantages are presented in an overall assessment of cereal-legume systems, accounting for the agronomic, environmental, energetic, and economic performances. Based on a low-input experimental field network including 16 site-years, we found that yields of pea-wheat intercrops (about 4. 5 Mg ha− 1 whatever the amount of applied fertiliser) were higher than sole pea and close to conventionally managed wheat yields (5. 4 Mg ha− 1 on average), the intercrop requiring {{less than half of}} the nitrogen fertiliser per ton of grain compared to the sole <b>wheat.</b> The land <b>equivalent</b> ratio and a statistical analysis based on the Price's equation showed that the crop mixture was more efficient than sole crops particularly under unfertilised situations. The estimated amount of energy consumed per ton of harvested grains was two to three times higher with conventionally managed wheat than with pea-wheat mixtures (fertilised or not). The intercrops allowed (i) maintaining wheat grain protein concentration and gross margin compared to wheat sole crop and (ii) increased the contribution of N 2 fixation to total N accumulation of pea crop in the mixture compared to pea sole crop. They also led to a reduction of (i) pesticide use compared to sole crops and (ii) soil mineral nitrogen after harvest compared to pea sole crop.

40|$|In South Australia, {{durum wheat}} yields more than bread wheat under well-watered and fertile conditions, but {{over much of}} the state’s cereal belt the yields of durum wheat, {{relative}} to bread wheat, are low. Three experiments were conducted over 3 years at 2 sites to compare the growth and yield of bread and durum wheat and to investigate some {{of the reasons for the}} differences in the relative yields of the 2 cereals. Durum wheat yielded less than bread wheat when annual rainfall was less than about 450 mm or when the site mean yield for bread wheat was less than 250 g/m². Compared with bread wheat, durum wheat had poorer early vigour, which was associated with fewer tillers/m², and produced fewer kernels/m². Under favourable grain filling conditions, durum wheat produced larger kernels than bread wheat but its kernel weight was more variable across sites and seasons and consequently, the relative yields of the 2 cereals depended largely on kernel weight. For example, in a wet year, durum wheat yielded 20 % more than bread wheat, despite producing 16 % fewer kernels/m², because of its larger kernels (52 v. 36 mg). In 2 drier years, kernel weights of durum and bread wheat were similar (durum and bread wheat mean kernel weights: 40 v. 37 mg; 30 v. 33 mg) and so durum was unable to overcome the limitation of fewer kernels/m² and its yields were similar to or less than bread wheat. Root length densities of durum and bread wheat below 30 cm were low. Durum <b>wheat</b> had an <b>equivalent</b> or lower root length density than bread wheat and lower length per gram of root dry matter, indicating less finely divided roots. This suggests that durum wheat may sometimes be less able than bread wheat to utilise moisture and nutrient reserves in the subsoil because of a smaller root system. This is an undesirable characteristic for a crop that appears to be more reliant than bread wheat on producing large kernels for high yields. Efforts to improve the yield of durum wheat, either through genetic improvement or by agronomic means, should focus on reducing the levels of stress during the post anthesis period so that limitations to kernel growth are minimised. Improving the early vigour of the crop, having cultivars of the appropriate maturity and with adequate levels of resistance to root disease, and improving root growth and function in the subsoil are likely to be desirable characteristics.

40|$|Organic {{producers}} on the Canadian prairies {{rely heavily}} on tillage for weed control and soil nutrient management. Intensive tillage degrades soil quality, and therefore efforts to reduce tillage in organic agriculture are increasing. Research has focused on replacing tillage for green manure termination with alternative low-disturbance methods. The roller-crimper terminates green manures by rolling over the crop and creating a mulch that is anchored to the ground. Rolled mulches can suppress weeds and conserve soil moisture, but surface-placed residues can delay N mineralization and result in subsequent yield loss. 	Three field studies were conducted in Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba using the roller-crimper {{to determine the extent}} to which tillage can be reduced in organic systems without negatively impacting nutrient availability and yield. At two sites in Saskatchewan, the effects of termination timing (early flower, late flower, early pod) and termination method (rolling, mowing, tillage) of field pea (Pisum sativum) and faba bean (Vicia faba) green manures on soil properties and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) performance were measured in 2009 and 2010. Faba bean did not establish well and failed as a green manure crop. Termination timing and method affected soil properties in the first year, but did not affect wheat yield significantly. <b>Wheat</b> yield was <b>equivalent</b> in the rolled and mowed treatments to the tilled treatment, indicating field pea termination without incorporation does not inhibit wheat yield under moist conditions. 	Soil inorganic N was measured in the spring of 2011 following green manure (field pea/barley [Hordeum vulgare]) termination in 2010 by tillage, rolling, rolling + fall tillage, and mowing at two locations. Inorganic N was highest in the tilled plots at both sites, but effects on 4 wk mineralized N (Nmin) differed between sites. When the green manure C:N was narrow (14 : 1), tillage resulted in lower Nmin than the other treatments; when the C:N was wider (20 : 1), tillage resulted in the highest Nmin. These results confirm mineralization rates vary with residue placement and N content. 	Lastly, the effect of 2 yr of continuous no-tillage (NT) or conventional tillage on available N and P, soil microbial biomass (SMB), and oat (Avena sativa) N and P uptake was measured at one site in 2010. Overall, tillage regime did not affect N and P availability, SMB, or oat nutrient uptake. Microbial biomass C and inorganic N tended to be higher in the NT treatment at 0 to 5 cm, suggesting differences may become apparent in the long term. 	This research confirms that a reduction in tillage is possible in organic systems on the Canadian prairies. The degree of reduction is dependent on the green manure used, soil and climatic factors, and the goals of the producer...|$|R
40|$|Triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) is a high-yielding and {{vigourous}} {{interspecific hybrid}} between wheat and cereal rye. The crop {{is known for}} tolerance of abiotic stresses and high biomass production, and thus {{it has the potential}} to increase the profitability and productivity of growers in marginal environments and to help address the food production challenges of the 21 st century. The original cultivars from the 1960 s and 1970 s usually produced grain with flour properties in between triticale’s progenitor species, and thus produced dough inferior to wheat and unsuitable for a range of food products, including loaf bread, flat bread, cakes, biscuits and crackers. However over the last 40 years, grain yield and grain quality for animal feed have been significantly improved through breeding and selection, and hence indirect improvements (or at the least, genetic drift in quality alleles) in its potential to produce good food products could be expected. Furthermore, significant advances in wheat quality research have produced vast amounts of information, methodology and technology that can be easily used to improve triticale quality, and the tastes of the modern consumer are different to those of 40 years ago. This thesis aimed to characterise the flour properties of a range of modern triticale cultivars and compare them to wheat, then investigate genetic, agronomic and post-harvest strategies to improve the value of the grain for a human food market. Focus was given to the two major scientific issues which have historically hindered the use of triticale flour in food products – poor gluten strength and high α-amylase activity – and to other quality traits of commercial significance. The grain and flour quality was quantified in up to 17 modern triticale cultivars grown in four environments over 2 years – Greendale, NSW in 2009 (JP 09), Cowra, NSW in 2010 (COW 10), both of which are typical triticale growing environments with poor soil and minimal fertiliser, Narrabri, NSW in 2010 (NARR 10), which is a high yielding, high quality environment known for producing Australian Prime Hard wheat, and Stirling, SA in 2011 (SA 11) which is a high protein, low yielding environment. Field plots were arranged in a randomised complete block design at JP 09, COW 10 and NARR 10 with minimal irrigation; rust was controlled with fungicide. The three varieties from SA 11 were sourced from commercial seed production lots. Grain was milled to wholemeal flour on a Newport Scientific hammer mill with 0. 5 mm screen, and to white flour on both a Quadrumat® Junior Mill and a Bühler experimental mill. Glutenin and secalin subunits were characterised by SDS-PAGE and the gluten properties were investigated using the SDS-sedimentation test and mixographs. α-Amylase activity was investigated spectrophotometrically and using the falling number test. These vi measurements were compared to estimations of grain protein, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP), starch content and fibre content using near-infrared transmittance (NIT). Flour protein was estimated by NIR (near-infrared reflectance). The pasting properties of milled flours were evaluated on a Newport Scientific Rapid Visco Analyzer according to AACC 76 - 21, except 10 mM AgNO 3 was used in place of DI water to inhibit α-amylase activity. Grain hardness was measured by the Single-Kernel Characterisation System and moisture and ash content by standard oven methods. Colour of Junior milled flour was assessed using a Minolta Chroma meter CR- 400. Finally, plain cookies were baked according to a standard recipe used to assess soft wheats. Variability in the glutenin and secalin subunits was small relative to global diversity amongst triticale cultivars, and reflects the narrow genetic base of material in Australian breeding programs. The gluten quality of these triticale cultivars was inferior to bread wheat but similar to soft wheat; however the protein content of triticale flour was significantly lower than wheat flour. Lower triticale protein content represents a change from early cultivars and reduces its capacity to form viscoelastic gluten. Cultivars Hawkeye and Vicuna were recommended for breeding to improve gluten strength in locally adapted germplasm. Much greater variability in starch and NSP characteristics were found in triticale compared to wheat, and the ranges overlapped between species. The cultivars Tobruk, Yukuri and Berkshire expressed equivalent α-amylase activity to wheat; cultivars Jaywick and Yukuri were found to have partially waxy starch. Triticale generally exhibited higher NSP, equivalent pasting properties, higher α-amylase activity and lower falling number than wheat checks. However, low falling number was not indicative of high α-amylase activity; this contradicts the assumptions on which previous triticale research was based and has implications for the interpretation of research and the use of falling number to compare triticale to wheat. Furthermore, an unexpected negative correlation was observed with NSP, where higher NSP reduced the slurry viscosity measured in the falling number test. Modification of the falling number test is recommended before it can be used in triticale breeding programs. Nevertheless, the observed genetic variability in starch characteristics and α-amylase activity indicates some triticale cultivars have waxy properties conducive to the production of noodles, and that certain lines exhibited similar late-maturity α-amylase activity to modern wheat cultivars: an indirect benefit of breeding and selection over the past few decades. Like starch properties, great variation was found amongst triticale cultivars for hardness, colour and milling yield. Berkshire displayed a grain hardness <b>equivalent</b> to durum <b>wheat,</b> suggesting a null allele at the rye softness protein locus (Sin locus); the remaining cultivars exhibited a grain hardness between soft wheat and bread wheat. The high milling yield and low fibre content of Tobruk (milling yield was even higher than bread wheat) suggested this line has a thin seed coat and thus would be an excellent parent for the genetic improvement of triticale milling yield. Average flour ash content was significantly higher vii than wheat in both statistical and practical terms, and a different bench mark needs to be used for low ash triticale flour compared to low ash wheat. Apart from Vicuna and Yukuri, triticale cultivars produced darker flour than wheat, however with modern consumer preferences tending towards ‘healthy-looking’ foods, darker flour should not be a hindrance to its utility. The overall results confirmed previous suggestions that triticale is suited to soft wheat products such as cookies, and hence their cookie quality was investigated. Although the dough behaviour and water absorption of triticale was different to soft wheat (specifically, triticale dough tended to loose large amounts of water during sheeting), triticale cookies were found to be <b>equivalent</b> to soft <b>wheat</b> cookies. Overall, the survey of quality amongst modern triticale cultivars suggested two things: firstly, sufficient genetic variation exists amongst current lines to breed triticale cultivars with significantly improved flour quality (comparable to wheat for some quality traits); secondly, there is a clear need to classify current cultivars into suitability for various end uses. This would facilitate efficient marketing to the milling industry and subsequent use in food products. Improvement of the the poor gluten strength in triticale was attempted by backcrossing locally-adapted spring breeding lines to DH 265, a winter line which contained a modified 1 R chromosome carrying two translocations from 1 D of bread wheat – the Glu-D 1 d allele from 1 DL (which simultaneously removed Glu-R 1) and the Gli-D 1 /Glu-D 3 locus from the distal end of 1 DS. Single plant and plot selection was performed on five cross populations grown in multiple environments and the yield, protein content and gluten strength was analysed on F 4 -derived F 7 grain. Lines containing the translocation had a slightly lower yield compared to the null lines and the triticale checks; but similar to the wheat checks for all except one cross (which was significantly less). This may reflect a loss of root system vigour, head length or higher selection pressure due to lower transmission rate of the translocation to offspring. The translocation slightly increased protein content in two populations and increased SDS-sedimentation height in one population (after accounting for the influence of higher protein content). However, no difference was detected between the overall average SDS-sedimentation height of the null lines and the wheat and triticale checks. This is partially due to large variability in SDS-sedimentation height within each cross population resulting from significant variability at other glutenin and secalin loci. Nevertheless, several lines were identified with grain yield equivalent to current triticale cultivars (and significantly higher than <b>wheat)</b> plus <b>equivalent</b> SDS-sedimentation height to wheat. Thus the translocation is a potential solution to the generally poor gluten strength of modern triticale cultivars. The viability of using existing variability for secaloglutenin alleles in the progenitor species was investigated as a means of creating new germplasm (‘primary triticales’) with high gluten strength. The HMW glutenins of five durum lines, and the HMW secalins and 75 k γ- secalins of two rye lines, were defined using SDS-PAGE. These lines were then crossed, new primaries were produced, and grain was tested for the expression of secaloglutenin viii alleles, protein content and SDS-sedimentation height as an estimation of secalogluten strength. The secaloglutenin alleles were simply inherited from the parental plants and all were expressed normally in the offspring, however it was possible that mixed oligomers were formed between glutenins and secalins at the macromolecular level. Significant differences were observed in the SDS-sedimentation height of primaries originating from different durum parents, suggesting that selection of durum parents with high SDSsedimentation is a viable method for producing triticale flour with superior gluten properties. In south-eastern Australia, dual-purpose cropping is commonly used by growers to manage risk in mixed enterprise operations. A preliminary report of lower ash content but comparable protein content in triticale produced in dual-purpose systems was reported in Bangladesh and hence an experiment was conducted to assess the effect of biomass removal on grain yield, test weight, protein content and ash content of grain from four Australian dual-purpose triticale lines grown in five year-site environments (ash content is correlated with nutritional value, milling yield and flour colour). Ash content was either unaffected or increased by removal of biomass and both protein content and grain yield were reduced. It was concluded that although ash content was lower in some lines cut late in the season, the general effect was detrimental to quality and even when ash content was reduced, the effect was not large enough to reduce the level to that of wheat. Hence similar to wheat, dual-purpose triticale systems are not recommended for production of grain for a milling market. Poor milling yield in triticale is a key concern for millers. However, the high variability of grain hardness in triticale, historic problems with grain shrivelling, and lack of varietal classification has meant milling is usually conducted without adjusting settings to batch characteristics. Hence the importance of tempering moisture was investigated in three triticale varieties of varying hardness grown in two environments alongside a wheat standard. Milling yield and ash content both increased as tempering moisture was decreased from 15...|$|R
