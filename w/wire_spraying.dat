Droplet diameter controls dynamic and thermal behaviour in the spray, and the splashing and spreading behaviour of droplets at deposition. In electric arc <b>wire</b> <b>spraying,</b> the droplet diameter is determined {{by a combination of}} the melting behaviour of the feedstock wires in a direct current arc, combined with primary and secondary atomisation processes under the action of a high velocity atomising gas. The high frequency arc voltage variations during electric arc spraying of Fe- 0 · 8 C have been investigated and arc voltage fluctuations related to atomisation events occurring at the wire tips during spraying. A simple analytical model has been proposed which allows the {{diameter of}} primary droplets produced by atomisation to be calculated from the wire feedrate and the average time period for material removal, which was obtained from the voltage traces. Primary droplets were then assumed to undergo secondary atomisation according to correlations from the literature, and resulting droplet diameters were compared with diameters measured by experiment. Despite uncertainties in some of the thermophysical data and dynamic conditions during atomisation, predicted droplet diameters were in good agreement with experimental mass mean droplet diameters obtained under a range of atomising gas pressures, arc voltages and wire feedrates...|$|E

The microstructures of coating were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as the powder precursor. Analysis in the coating showed the formation of an amorphous matrix with boron and tungsten carbides randomly dispersed. At high amplifications were identified boron carbides at interface boron carbide/amorphous matrix by TEM. This kind of carbides growth can be attributed to partial crystallization by heterogeneous nucleation. These interfaces have not been reported in the literature by thermal spraying process. The measurements of average microhardness on amorphous matrix and boron carbides were 9. 1 and 23. 85 [*]GPa, respectively. By contrast, the microhardness values of unmelted boron carbide in the amorphous phase were higher than in the substrate, approaching 2. 14 [*]GPa.

40|$|Thermally sprayed {{metallic}} coatings have been frequently applied over {{low carbon steel}} components, aiming at protecting against corrosion and wear. However, these coatings always contain pores, oxides and cracks in the microstructure, which affect the protection performance. The spraying process employed determines not only the amount and distribution of these defects, but also several coating properties (e. g. thickness, hardness and adhesion to the substrate). Therefore, the final coating quality is strongly related to the spray parameters definition, such as: fuel gas type, oxygen pressure, particle velocity and spray distance. This research aims at verifying {{the efficiency of the}} High Velocity Combustion <b>Wire</b> <b>spray</b> process (HVCW) for the deposition of X 46 Cr 13 stainless steel coatings.
