5|$|Leonardo, Donatello, and Michelangelo {{plan their}} next move, while Donatello discovers the next portal will open over Winters' tower. Splinter tells Leonardo {{that his team}} is incomplete, and that he knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> do. After 11 monsters have been captured, General Aguila {{questions}} Yaotl's actions. The generals conspire to betray Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. Raphael encounters the Jersey Devil, one of the remaining monsters but drives it off. Leonardo fights Raphael, but when he breaks Leonardo's swords, Raphael is forced to leave. The generals seize Leonardo, intending to substitute him for the 13th missing beast, and Raphael decides to make amends by rescuing Leonardo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight {{their way through the}} Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: he wants to be free of his curse of immortality. The generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer the world.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{they must}} make Alex a Dragonmaster to confront Ghaleon and save Luna, the team {{heads to the}} border town of Nanza to enlist Kyle, Jessica's boyfriend, in letting them cross into foreign land. After {{traveling}} to a town of inventors, the group obtains a floating device that leads them to the lair of the Red Dragon, who is seemingly destroyed by Ghaleon just before they arrive. The dragon's spirit grants Alex her power before disappearing, and the group departs for the Blue Dragon's cave behind a musical town. Again, the dragon is defeated before their arrival, and the team must travel to the distant and barren Frontier to seek the final trial. The party finds the black dragon, which attacks the team in a mad rage induced by Ghaleon but is defeated. With the final dragon's blessing, Alex and his companions approach the construction site of Ghaleon's mobile mechanical castle, the Grindery, but are unable to stop its advance before it destroys Vane using the power of Luna, who is revealed to be the human form of the Goddess Althena and who is under the Magic Emperor's control. After obtaining Althena's Sword and learning the truth about Luna, the party attacks the Grindery and defeats both Xenobia and the Magic Emperor. Knowing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> do to bring Luna back, Alex climbs the path to Luna, who, as Althena, continuously blasts him with lightning; he plays his harp as he advances, and hearing their song allows Luna's personality to return. She awakens in Alex's arms, surrounded by their friends.|$|E
25|$|When {{he arrives}} in Vision, Wataru meets {{an old man}} who calls himself the Wayfinder. He tells Wataru <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> do to change his destiny: Wataru has to collect five gemstones to go to the Tower of Destiny, where the Goddess grants each Traveler one wish. Each stone has a {{different}} quality: charity, bravery, faith, grace, and the power of darkness and light. Wataru encounters friends and foes during his adventures, and he ultimately comes to terms with the nature of himself.|$|E

Boniface had been under his protection from 723 on; indeed the saint himself explained to his old friend, Daniel of Winchester, that without it he could neither administer his church, defend his clergy, nor prevent idolatry. It was Boniface who had defended Charles most stoutly for his deeds in seizing ecclesiastical lands to pay his army {{in the days leading}} to Tours, as one doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> to defend Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Her first novel, South Moon Under, was {{published}} in 1933. The book captured the richness of Cross Creek and its environs in {{telling the story of}} a young man, Lant, who must support himself and his mother by making and selling moonshine, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> do when a traitorous cousin threatens to turn him in. Moonshiners were the subject of several of her stories, and Rawlings lived with a moonshiner for several weeks near Ocala to prepare for writing the book. South Moon Under was included in the Book-of-the-Month Club and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.|$|E
25|$|Gilgamesh {{complains}} to Enkidu {{that various}} of his possessions (the tablet is unclear exactly whatâ€” different translations include a drum and a ball) {{have fallen into}} the underworld. Enkidu offers to bring them back. Delighted, Gilgamesh tells Enkidu <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> and must not do in the underworld {{if he is to}} return. Enkidu does everything which he was told not to do. The underworld keeps him. Gilgamesh prays to the gods to give him back his friend. Enlil and Suen don't reply, but Ea and Shamash decide to help. Shamash makes a crack in the earth, and Enkidu's ghost jumps out of it. The tablet ends with Gilgamesh questioning Enkidu about what he has seen in the underworld.|$|E

50|$|Chapter 7 of the Manusmriti {{discusses}} {{the duties of}} a king, <b>what</b> virtues <b>he</b> <b>must</b> have, <b>what</b> vices <b>he</b> <b>must</b> avoid. In verses 7.54 - 7.76, the text identifies precepts to be followed in selecting ministers, ambassadors and officials, {{as well as the}} characteristics of well fortified capital. Manusmriti then lays out the laws of just war, stating that first and foremost, war should be avoided by negotiations and reconciliations. If war becomes necessary, states Manusmriti, a soldier must never harm civilians, non-combatants or someone who has surrendered, that use of force should be proportionate, and other rules. Fair taxation guidelines are described in verses 7.127 to 7.137.|$|R
25|$|After Ay's reign, {{which lasted}} {{for a little}} over four years, Horemheb managed to seize power, presumably thanks to his {{position}} as commander of the army, and to assume <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> have perceived to be his just reward for having ably served Egypt under Tutankhamun and Ay. Horemheb quickly removed Nakhtmin's rival claim to the throne and arranged to have Ay's WV23 tomb desecrated by smashing the latter's sarcophagus, systematically chiselling Ay's name and figure out of the tomb walls and probably destroying Ay's mummy. However, he spared Tutankhamun's tomb from vandalism presumably because it was Tutankhamun who had promoted his rise to power and chosen him to be his heir. Horemheb also usurped and enlarged Ay's mortuary temple at Medinet Habu for his own use and erased Ay's titulary {{on the back of}} a 17-foot colossal statue by carving his own titulary in its place.|$|E
25|$|Ip {{attends the}} {{ceremony}} and defeats his first challengers, before striking a draw {{with the last}} challenger, Hung. Ip is allowed to keep running his school {{on the condition that}} he pay his monthly protection fees, but he declines. Hung thus has his students loiter in front of the Wing Chun School and harass anyone interested, causing a street brawl between them and Ip's disciples. Ip is thus forced to close up and move the school nearer to home. Ip soon confronts Hung, who blames him since he wouldn't pay his protection fees, whereas Ip criticizes Hung's management of his students. Hung insists that he is doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> and also insists they finish their fight, but during this encounter, Ip stops Hung from accidentally kicking his son as he suddenly appears, earning respect from him. Ip leaves, and the next day, Hung invites him to a British boxing match he has helped to set up, quietly coming to terms with him.|$|E

500|$|Also, before {{applying}} this test in considering if {{a piece of}} legislation contravenes Article 12, {{there needs to be a}} presumption that an impugned law is constitutional. This presumption of constitutionality stems from the wide power of classification which the legislature has to make laws which operate differently as regards different groups of persons, so as to give effect to its policies. An academic, Tan Yock Lin, has acknowledged the benefit of this presumption as it [...] "tells the challenger <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> do". The person challenging the constitutionality of a legislative or executive classification must expect to [...] "furnish cogent and compelling evidence of unequal treatment". Postulating examples will not be sufficient for the purposes of rebuttal. However, Tan has pointed out that this results in additional indeterminacy for it is not clear what level of cogency will satisfy the court of the viability of the challenge.|$|E
2500|$|Deleuze's {{peculiar}} {{readings of}} the history of philosophy stem from this unusual epistemological perspective. To read a philosopher is no longer to aim at finding a single, correct interpretation, but is instead to present a philosopher's attempt to grapple with the problematic nature of reality. [...] "Philosophers introduce new concepts, they explain them, but they don't tell us, not completely anyway, the problems to which those concepts are a response. [...] The history of philosophy, rather than repeating what a philosopher says, has to say <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> have taken for granted, what he didn't say but is nonetheless present in what he did say." ...|$|E

Mrs. Van Brugh is roused to anger by this, and {{declares}} that she will [...] "be punished no further". [...] Fitz-Partington leaves. Dr. Athelney announces the imminent arrival of his son and Fred, and Eve runs to Fred, crying that {{she knew he would}} come. He declares himself unable to control his father.

Eve faints. Dr. Athelney begins berating him and declares that [...] "I have been a clergyman of the Church of England for five and forty years, and, until today, I have never regretted the restrictions that my calling has imposed upon me. [...] My hands, sir, are tied. Ted, my boy, these remarks do not apply to you." [...] Ted seizes Fred and berates him. Mrs. Van Brugh asks Dr. Athenley to stop Ted, but Dr. Athelney is [...] "too fond of plain truth, and hears it far too seldom to stop it when he does hear it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{its many}} {{institutional}} forms, the function {{and structure of}} ideology is unchanging and present throughout history; as Althusser states, [...] "ideology has no history". All ideologies constitute a subject, even though {{he or she may}} differ according to each particular ideology. Memorably, Althusser illustrates this with the concept of [...] "hailing" [...] or [...] "interpellation". Drawing heavily from Jacques Lacan and his concept of the Mirror Stage, he compares ideology to a policeman shouting [...] "Hey you there!" [...] toward a person walking on the street. Upon hearing this call, the person responds by turning around and in doing so, is transformed into a subject. The person is conscious of being a subject and aware of the other person. Thus, for Althusser, being aware of other people is a form of ideology. Within that, Althusser sees subjectivity as a type of ideology. The person being hailed recognizes himself or herself as the subject of the hail, and knows to respond. Althusser calls this recognition a [...] "mis-recognition" [...] (mÃ©connaissance), because it works retroactively: a material individual is always already an ideological subject, even before he or she is born. The [...] "transformation" [...] of an individual into a subject has always already happened; Althusser here acknowledges a debt to Spinoza's theory of immanence. To highlight this, Althusser offers the example of Christian religious ideology, embodied in the Voice of God, instructing a person on what his place in the world is and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>must</b> do to be reconciled with Christ. From this, Althusser draws the point that in order for that person to identify as a Christian, he must first already be a subject; that is, by responding to God's call and following His rules, he affirms himself as a free agent, the author of the acts for which he assumes responsibility. We cannot recognize ourselves outside ideology, and in fact, our very actions reach out to this overarching structure. For Althusser, we acquire our identities by seeing ourselves mirrored in ideologies.|$|E
