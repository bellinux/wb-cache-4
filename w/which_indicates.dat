5|$|The {{distinct}} {{shape of}} the skull shows that Deinocheirus had a more specialised diet than other ornithomimosaurs. The beak {{was similar to that}} of ducks, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> it may have likewise foraged in water, or browsed near the ground like some sauropods and hadrosaurs. The attachment sites for the muscles that open and close the jaws were very small in comparison {{to the size of the}} skull, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> Deinocheirus had a weak bite force. The skull was likely adapted for cropping soft understorey or water vegetation. The depth of the lower jaw indicates the presence of a large tongue, which could have assisted the animal in sucking in food material obtained with the broad beak when foraging on the bottom of freshwater bodies.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{was named}} by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1905, {{along with the}} family Tyrannosauridae.

5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said {{he rose from}} the dead, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. Some of those {{who claimed to have}} witnessed Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> that their beliefs were likely genuine. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Daybreaker {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Some reviewers praised the band for texturing and progressing their sound, and for writing socio-political lyrics.

5|$|Dominican {{folk music}} is an oral tradition, learned informally through {{watching}} others perform.

Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music, such as complex syncopated rhythms, {{as well as social}} factors, such as the ability of the performers to improvise and respond to their surroundings and to keep the audience excited and participating in the music.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the large fluctuations in Haumea's light curve due to the body's shape, which affect all colours equally, smaller independent colour variations seen in both visible and near-infrared wavelengths show a region on the surface that differs both in colour and in albedo. More specifically, a large dark red area on Haumea's bright white surface was seen in September 2009, possibly an impact feature, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> an area rich in minerals and organic (carbon-rich) compounds, or possibly {{a higher proportion of}} crystalline ice.

5|$|Many drug {{molecules}} are enzyme inhibitors, {{so their}} discovery and improvement {{is an active}} area of research in biochemistry and pharmacology. A medicinal enzyme inhibitor is often judged by its specificity (its lack of binding to other proteins) and its potency (its dissociation constant, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> the concentration needed to inhibit the enzyme). A high specificity and potency ensure that a drug will have few side effects and thus low toxicity.|$|E

5|$|The peak {{brightness}} of the μ ring lies almost exactly on the orbit of the small Uranian moon Mab, which is probably {{the source of the}} ring’s particles. The ν ring is positioned between Portia and Rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it. A reanalysis of the Voyager 2 images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the μ and ν rings. In this geometry the rings are much brighter, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> that they contain much micrometer-sized dust. The outer rings of Uranus may be similar to the G and E rings of Saturn as E ring is extremely broad and receives dust from Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|The second species, P. blackfeetensis, {{is based}} on a {{specimen}} in the Museum of the Rockies (MOR 454), which was described by another notable paleontologist, Jack Horner. This specimen, and the remains of three or four other individuals, were found in Glacier County, Montana. In this case, the fossils were found in a bonebed of Prosaurolophus remains, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> that the animals lived together for at least some time. The bonebed is interpreted as reflecting a group of animals that congregated near a water source during a drought.|$|E
5|$|The {{three primary}} {{branches}} of Crocodilia had diverged {{by the end}} of the Mesozoic. The earliest-known members of the group are alligatoroids and gavialoids that lived in North America and Europe during the Campanian (around 83.6–72.1 million years ago). Although the first known crocodyloids appeared in the Maastrichtian (around 72.1–66.0 million years ago), that lineage must have been present during the Campanian, and the earliest alligatoroids and gavialoids include highly derived forms, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> that the time of the actual divergence between the three lineages must have been a pre-Campanian event.|$|E

5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, <b>which</b> <b>indicates</b> {{that he was at}} least aware of the plot. Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva, but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian, it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder. On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.|$|E

Before the establishment of the EPBC Act, it was, and currently remains, listed as vulnerable under the state-based Nature Conservation Act 1992.

Remaining stands in protected areas are highly fragmented. Furthermore, plants in cultivation are likely to come from a limited genetic pool.
