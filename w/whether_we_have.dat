25|$|The {{underlying}} {{questions are}} <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> control over our actions, and if so, {{what sort of}} control, and to what extent. These questions predate the early Greek stoics (for example, Chrysippus), and some modern philosophers lament the lack of progress over all these millennia.|$|E
25|$|Curtis {{ends the}} episode {{by saying that}} Hamilton's ideas that humans are {{computers}} controlled by the genes have become accepted wisdom. But he asks <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> accepted a fatalistic philosophy that humans are helpless computers to explain and excuse the fact that, as in the Congo, we are effectively unable to improve and change the world.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{any other}} SF story {{up to that}} point it is {{essentially}} plotless, being in the main a speculative take on the work of the physicist Paul Dirac. Blish also pointed out that the presence of communications from the future, implicit in Dirac's treatment of positrons as electrons travelling backwards in time, has philosophical implications for the debate over <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> free will or the future is already determined. To Blish's surprise the story proved popular and even started a new subgenre of SF.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> gone whithersoever <b>we</b> chose, to-day, {{and have}} met with nothing but the kindest attentions. Nobody inquired <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any {{passports}} or not.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was little}} need he should ask <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been {{successful}} in our search, because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> returned as <b>we</b> departed; but I could not refrain from acquainting him with our ill fortune by saying in a sorrowful tone: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{rubbed my}} eyes, doubting <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not slept and dreamt these things {{by reason of}} the fungus <b>we</b> <b>had</b> eaten, and {{suddenly}} discovered the blood upon my face, and then that my shirt was sticking painfully to my shoulder and arm.|$|R
500|$|The {{only thing}} we should worry about is <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{strength}} enough to rescue them and virtue enough to command their loyalty... Now a small country has come to report its distress to the Son of Heaven. If he does not save it, to whom can it turn for aid? And how can the Son of Heaven claim that the rulers of all other states are like sons to him if he ignores their pleases? ...|$|E
500|$|.....I {{remain an}} utter disbeliever {{in almost all}} that you {{consider}} the most sacred truths. I will pass over as utterly contemptible the oft-repeated accusation that sceptics shut out evidence because {{they will not be}} governed by the morality of Christianity... I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions. To the mass of mankind religion of some kind is a necessity. But whether there be a God and whatever be His nature; <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an immortal soul or not, or whatever may be our state after death, I can have no fear of having to suffer for the study of nature and the search for truth, or believe that those will be better off in a future state who have lived in the belief of doctrines inculcated from childhood, and which are to them rather a matter of blind faith than intelligent conviction.|$|E
2500|$|Asked in 2003 if Proposition 54 could derail school {{integration}} {{efforts in}} California, Connerly said: [...] "I don't care {{whether they are}} segregated or not… kids need to be learning, and I place more value on these kids getting educated than I do on <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> some racial balancing or not." ...|$|E
5000|$|Further, argued Hudson, it {{was entirely}} irrelevant, for {{explanatory}} purposes, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> actually <b>had</b> [...] "two distinct minds", <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> only seemed to be “endowed with a dual mental organization”, or <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> actually <b>had</b> “one mind of certain attributes and powers under some conditions, and certain other attributes and powers under other conditions” (pp. 25-26).|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{few minutes}} since you asked <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{not heard from}} Graham during our absence, and I said there were two letters for papa on business; this was true, but I did not tell you all." ...|$|R
60|$|It was at {{this point}} that {{interrupting}} his flow of talk to light his pipe but holding us with his eye he inquired <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> known Powell. Marlow with a slight reminiscent smile murmured that he remembered him very well.|$|R
2500|$|Shyamalan or Paramount/Nickelodeon did not {{immediately}} confirm the [...] "go-ahead" [...] or whether the plug will be pulled on the trilogy. While filming The Last Airbender, Shyamalan mapped out a rough draft for a second film that is [...] "darker" [...] and includes Azula, portrayed by Summer Bishil, as the main antagonist. In a July 2010 interview with New York Magazine, Shyamalan commented [...] "In {{the next few months}} we'll be able to know <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> that opportunity or not" [...] when asked about the sequel. No such announcement was made and in a September 2010 interview when asked if he knew when the sequel will be made, he replied, [...] "I don't, {{because there are so many}} factors they take into account", adding, [...] "I guess it will get into an area where it becomes a discussion—like pros and cons." [...] In September 2015, Shyamalan confirmed to Metro UK that he may work on the sequel after completing his next thriller, which started shooting in November 2015.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all;--just {{because there}} will be no gallantry. But come and see us to-morrow and find out <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got through it alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We laid it out, father; but we {{have not}} the least idea <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> bought rubbish or not. This black bag is full of it." ...|$|E
60|$|There were {{loads of}} shiny reasons, which {{reminded}} me that we were at war and cleared for action, and that the interlude had been merely play. A companion rose alongside {{and wanted to know}} <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> seen anything of her dummy.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1990 interview, Flora said, [...] "Burl Ives was a troublemaker. His wife handled his {{affairs and}} if you forgot some da-da-da, {{she was on the}} phone to the {{president}} of Columbia. I don’t know <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to do this over again or what." ...|$|R
60|$|So sudden is it all, and so like a {{flash of}} unreal fancy, that but for the flake of white foam left quivering and {{perishing}} on a mail-sack after the vision had flashed by and disappeared, <b>we</b> might <b>have</b> doubted <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> seen any actual horse and man at all, maybe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you ever}} lived in London?" [...] Shelton asked. [...] "It {{always makes me}} feel a doubt <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> any right to have {{children}} at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall {{wait till}} you send me. Besides, how can you invite company till we know <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a roof over our house or not? What is he doing now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Scarborough," [...] {{continued}} Tyrrwhit, [...] "will be here, {{and will}} expect to learn <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> accepted his offer. He will {{be accompanied by}} Mr. Barry. If one rejects, all reject." ...|$|E
60|$|Some {{bushes and}} {{a tangle of}} {{creeping}} vines hid the entrance most admirably; but, after we were once inside, I questioned to myself <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not been reckless in coming directly to this place without taking precautions to cover our footprints, for, should a keen-eyed savage chance to see our trail, there was good reason for believing he would follow it up.|$|R
5000|$|Gotta Have It!, Make It Stop!, {{in which}} new trends among celebrities are {{discussed}} deciding <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> them or make them stop.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{clashes between}} {{indigenous}} Australians and white settlers during settlement. Robert von Steiglitz stated {{in his journal}} [...] "… it may be questioned by some feather-bed philanthropist <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{the right to take}} the country from the blacks but I believe the general rule is that if people cultivate or graze the land they have a claim to it. These creatures did neither …".|$|R
6000|$|Then Boone said reflectively: [...] "I wonder <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{been too}} easy with him, sir. I can't help feeling, {{by the way}} he yielded, that the rascal has {{something}} up his sleeve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well!' {{returned}} Mr. Gradgrind, with a patient, even a submissive, air. And he sat for {{a little}} while pondering. 'Bounderby, I see reason to doubt <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> ever quite understood Louisa.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why not? Easy enough' and a {{good riddance}} for Alexandria. Yet if we made away with him we {{should be forced to}} take the city too; and I doubt <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> hands enough for that.' ...|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of course I {{understood}} that Morgan, the Jerseyman, would visit the cabin late in the evening in order to learn <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> delivered the message with which he had charged us; but although I could find so much of trouble in the future, I failed of guessing that we might be forced to remain away from the cabin a full four and twenty hours.|$|R
6000|$|It {{had been}} some hours since I had used the oars, but <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> drifted, or {{remained}} where we were when I stopped rowing, of course I could not know; but this mattered very little; our boat was slowly sinking beneath us, and it could make no difference <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> went down in one spot or an other. I sat and racked my brain to think {{what could be done}} in this fearful emergency. To bail any longer was useless labor, and what else was there that we could do? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did it all}} but one question," [...] said Ethel, [...] "but so did he, you know, and <b>we</b> can't tell <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> it {{done well}} enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was my chief temptation,' said Claude. 'As {{long as we}} know {{we are out of}} {{the path}} of duty it does not make much {{difference}} <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> turned to the right hand or to the left.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can, if you will, dine with us to-morrow night," [...] she invited, [...] "at half-past eight. My aunt will {{be delighted}} to see you. I forget <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> people coming or not, but you will be very welcome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{that sounds}} {{a little too much}} like General Triscoe's pessimism," [...] said Mrs. March; and she added: [...] "But <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> any {{national}} melodies or not, we don't poke women out in the rain and keep them soaking!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mornin', sir," [...] said Bill, {{shuffling}} up. [...] "We'd like to know, sir, me an' Tommy, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> can <b>have</b> our rations {{for dinner}} served out now same as before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} tea and mixed biscuits!" [...] cried his neighbour, Meier of Sarnen. [...] "What I {{want to know}} is <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> to pay for keeping sheep any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{next moment}} he was gone. Theodore passed him on the stairs and asked me, {{with one of his}} impertinent leers, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a new client and what we might expect from him. I shrugged my shoulders. [...] "A new client!" [...] I said disdainfully. [...] "Bah! Vague {{promises}} of a couple of louis for finding out if Madame his wife sees more of a certain captain of the guards than Monsieur the husband cares about." ...|$|R
