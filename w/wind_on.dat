Sustained winds reached 47mph (76km/h) at Gulfport, the strongest <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> a land station.

5|$|The Superdome {{sustained}} significant damage, {{including two}} {{sections of the}} roof when waterproof membrane had essentially been peeled off by <b>wind.</b> <b>On</b> August 30, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco ordered the complete evacuation of the remaining people that sought shelter in the Superdome. They were then transported to the Astrodome in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of winds offshore are {{nearly double the}} wind speed observed onshore. This is attributed to the differences in friction between land masses and offshore waters. Sometimes, there are even directional differences, particularly if local sea breezes change the <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> shore during daylight hours.|$|E

5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E
5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic <b>wind)</b> <b>on</b> the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E

5|$|Few {{official}} surface {{observations are}} available for {{the passage of the}} hurricane. Upon making landfall, Kenna was accompanied with an estimated 16foot (4.9m) storm surge in San Blas. The surge also affected Puerto Vallarta, with reports of 10foot (3m) waves rushing inland from the bay. The hurricane dropped about 1.38inches (35mm) of precipitation while passing about 60mi (95km) east of the offshore archipelago, Islas Marías. There, sustained winds reached an estimated 106mph (170km/h). On land, Kenna dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 18.91inches (480mm) at San Ignacio, Sinaloa, and 12.89inches (327mm) near Manzanillo, Colima. The highest recorded sustained <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> land was about 100mph (161km/h) at Tepic, Nayarit, with wind gusts at Puerto Vallarta reaching 50mph (80km/h). The hurricane also produced heavy rainfall in Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco, and hit Baja California Sur with strong winds and rough seas.|$|E
5|$|Solar power {{tends to}} be {{complementary}} to <b>wind.</b> <b>On</b> daily to weekly timescales, high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter. Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. In 2007 the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, biogas and hydrostorage to provide load-following power around the clock and throughout the year, entirely from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{westerlies}} {{explain why}} coastal North America {{tends to be}} wet, especially from Northern California to Alaska, during the winter. Differential heating from the sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture rich air from the Pacific Ocean to flow from the west, resulting in frequent rainstorms and <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until orographic lift caused by the Coast, Cascade, Columbia and Rocky Mountains cause a rain shadow effect which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure and tends to block moisture-rich air from the Pacific from reaching land. This explains why most of coastal North America in the middle latitudes experiences dry summers, despite abundant rainfall in the winter.|$|E

5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can be tracked from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E
25|$|Wind is {{far less}} uniformly {{distributed}} than solar resources, with optimal locations positioned near special topographical funnelling features close to coastal locations, mountain ranges, and other natural channels {{in the north and}} south. The availability of <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> the western coast of Africa is substantial, exceeding 3,750kW·h, and will accommodate the future prospect for energy demands Central Africa has lower than average wind resources to work with.|$|E
25|$|In a {{physical}} sense, this zero-wind point {{will be the}} center of a cyclone or anticyclone. (Like the swirled hairs on the tennis ball, the wind will spiral around this zero-wind point - under our assumptions it cannot flow into or out of the point.) In brief, then, the theorem dictates that, given at least some <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> Earth, there must at all times be a cyclone or anticyclone somewhere.|$|E

25|$|The {{wind and}} waves create surface {{currents}} (designated as « drift currents »). These currents can decompose in one quasi permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of Stokes drift under {{the effect of}} rapid waves movement (at the echelon {{of a couple of}} seconds).). The quasi permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves, and in a lesser governing effect, by the friction of the <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> the surface.|$|E
25|$|Windscreens (or {{windshields}} – {{the terms}} are interchangeable) {{provide a method}} of reducing the effect of <b>wind</b> <b>on</b> microphones. While pop-screens give protection from unidirectional blasts, foam “hats” shield wind into the grille from all directions, and blimps / zeppelins / baskets entirely enclose the microphone and protect its body as well. The latter is important because, given the extreme low frequency content of wind noise, vibration induced in the housing of the microphone can contribute substantially to the noise output.|$|E

In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy and calculus.|$|E
