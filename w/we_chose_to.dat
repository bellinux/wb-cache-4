Caballero said that [...] "We didn't want to make exact sculptural copies of the cartoon drawings and layouts, just because it might've ended up feeling too 'perfect' or something. So <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> re-appropriate real world objects as much as possible." [...] Art director Kelly Mazurowski focused on [...] "digging through salvage yards", picking the right materials {{to be used in}} the set. Caballero described this process as [...] "'puppetizing' the world of Bikini Bottom." ...|$|E
500|$|Del Vecho {{explained}} how the film's animation team was organized: [...] "On this movie {{we do have}} character leads, supervising animators on specific characters. The animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it's always under one lead. I think it was different on Tangled, for example, but <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> {{do it this way}} as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and then be able to impart that to the crew. Hyrum Osmond, the supervising animator on Olaf, is quiet but he has a funny, wacky personality so we knew he'd bring a lot of comedy to it; Anna's animator, Becky Bresee, it's her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead Anna." [...] Acting coach Warner Loughlin was brought in to help the film's animators understand the characters they were creating. In order to get the general feeling of each scene, some animators did their own acting. [...] "I actually film myself acting the scene out, which I find very helpful," [...] said animation supervisor Rebecca Wilson Bresee. This helped her discover elements that made the scene feel real and believable. Elsa's supervising animator was Wayne Unten, who asked for that role because he was fascinated by the complexity of the character. Unten carefully developed Elsa's facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against Anna's fearlessness. He also studied videos from Menzel's recording sessions and animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing. Head of Animation, Lino DiSalvo, said, [...] "The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you've ever seen." ...|$|E

When a sponsor is earned a new paint livery is unlocked for the player to customize their stock car with. Players can have up to five different saved cars, and each car can feature a different paint scheme and sponsorship. The sponsorship benefits are cosmetic only.

2500|$|Commodore BASIC 2.0 is {{used instead}} of the more {{advanced}} BASIC 4.0 from the PET series since C64 users were not expected to need the disk-oriented enhancements of BASIC 4.0. The company did not expect many to buy a disk drive, and using BASIC 2.0 simplified VIC-20 owners' transition to the 64. [...] "The choice of BASIC 2.0 instead of 4.0 was made with some soul-searching, not just at random. The typical user of a C64 {{is not expected to}} need the direct disk commands as much as other extensions and the amount of memory to be committed to BASIC were to be limited. <b>We</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> leave expansion space for color and sound extensions instead of the disk features.

2500|$|Following {{the death}} of civil rights leader Coretta Scott King in 2006, BET {{broadcast}} its regularly scheduled music video programming, rather than covering King's funeral live as CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, and BET competitors TV One and Black Family Channel did. The BET website streamed the funeral live, while the channel periodically broadcast taped, 60-second reports from the funeral by senior news correspondent Andre Showell. Michael Lewellen, BET's {{senior vice president for}} corporate communications, defended the decision: [...] "We weighed a number of different options. In the end, <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> offer a different kind of experience for BET viewers." [...] Lewellen also said that BET received around [...] "two dozen" [...] phone calls and [...] "a handful" [...] of emails criticizing BET for not showing the King funeral live. On the evening of the funeral, February 7, 2006, BET broadcast the tribute special Coretta Scott King: Married to the Mission, and BET repeated this the following Sunday, February 12. Showell hosted a program featuring highlights of the funeral, Coretta Scott King: Celebrating Her Spirit, that broadcast that same day. In its 2007 convention, the National Association of Black Journalists gave BET its Thumbs Down Award for not broadcasting King's funeral live.|$|E

For the conscript armies in which Europe still so largely believes are only of use against conscript armies and adversaries who will consent to play the rules of the German war game; they are, if <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> determine they shall be, if <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> deal with them as they should be dealt with, as out of date as a Roman legion or a Zulu impi.|$|E
