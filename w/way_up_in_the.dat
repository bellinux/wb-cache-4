5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction after Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright) goes missing and her son Jeffrey (Chris Owens) angrily attempts to push his <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FBI. The Syndicate, meanwhile, quicken their tests for the black oil vaccine, sacrificing their own to do so.|$|E
5|$|Later, as a rebel alien race {{secretly}} attacks {{several groups}} of former alien abductees, the agents meet Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), {{a woman who}} {{claims to be a}} multiple abductee and wants to deliver a positive message about aliens. Eventually, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction after Cassandra goes missing and her son, Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), angrily attempts to push his <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> FBI. The Syndicate, meanwhile, quicken their tests for the black oil vaccine, sacrificing their own to do so. Later, the assassination of a chess grandmaster leads Mulder and Scully into an investigation that they soon discover strikes {{at the heart of the}} X-Files; they learn that the real target was a telepathic boy named Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka).|$|E
5|$|The recipes {{were often}} brief {{and did not}} give precise quantities. Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as {{the time it took}} to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, working their <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the Ménagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E

500|$|When Future was relaunched {{in early}} 1950, the sf {{magazine}} field {{was not particularly}} crowded, and Lowndes was able to attract moderately good stories from writers who were either well-known or on their <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. [...] The first issue included stories by James Blish, Lester del Rey and Murray Leinster; other authors featured in the early issues included Fritz Leiber, Judith Merril, H. Beam Piper, and L. Sprague de Camp. [...] Some of the better-known stories Lowndes published in the early 1950s were [...] "And There Was Light" [...] by del Rey, [...] "If I Forget Thee, Oh Earth" [...] by Arthur C. Clarke, and [...] "Liberation of Earth" [...] by William Tenn, which Damon Knight described as [...] "the funniest story [...] ever written". [...] He also bought work {{by some of the}} women writers active in the 1950s, including several early stories by Carol Emshwiller. [...] Lowndes knew many successful writers in the field, and was able to call on them for stories, but the expanding sf magazine market of the mid-1950s meant that the best material was spread thinly. [...] To attract readers, Lowndes established a friendly and personal style for the magazine, with letter columns and departments aimed at science fiction fans. [...] Blish, writing as William Atheling, Jr., commented in 1953 that Lowndes was doing a [...] "surprisingly good job" [...] with Future, despite the low rates and the slow payment to authors.|$|E

Nozomi had been stabbed at least six times, covered with gasoline and set on fire about 10 meters from the car. It was reported that Nozomi's companion was a company employee in Nagano Prefecture, and that in what the police called a possible murder-suicide pact, the man had burned himself to death inside the car. The remains were so badly charred that it took hours of testing before investigators could even determine that the remains belonged to a male.

2500|$|Costumes for Broadchurch were {{designed}} by freelance costume designer Ray Holman. Holman worked with the actors portraying major characters {{to ensure that the}} costumes fit the character. He spent hours discussing the characters with the actors, and sometimes took the actors shopping or to costume suppliers to find the right look. Holman crafted the [...] "old and saggy" [...] look of Alec Hardy's character to reflect the fact that Hardy [...] "didn't really care what he wore." [...] Often arriving on the set at 6 a.m., Holman ensured that Tennant's suit was appropriately crumpled every day. Holman also designed Ellie Miller's [...] "unflattering grey work suit". Holman and actress Olivia Colman agreed that Ellie was a person who'd lived in a small town her entire life. Having been a uniformed police officer, she'd worked her <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ranks but still retained an unconscious desire to appear in uniform. The grey trouser suit was critical to that look. [...] "I did apologise to her about that, but it looked fantastic and characterised her," [...] Holman said. Beth Lattimer's red dress, seen in episode one, was also Holman's idea. There was disagreement about it, but Holman said he insisted on the red dress. [...] "I wanted the red dress because I knew it would move quite beautifully and she has to run on the beach and I wanted the red against the cliffs," [...] he said.|$|E
