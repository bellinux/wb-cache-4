Andretti re-passed Hunt on lap 6 and then started to pull away. Reutemann ran third until he had to pit for tyres, and so John Watson inherited third until he was passed by Jacques Laffite, but soon the recovering Peterson passed both of them. Hunt now suffered from tyre problems and he also began to drop back, and so Peterson moved into second with Laffite third.

Most music critics positively reviewed the song, complimenting the blending of Brown and Bieber's vocals.

[...] Carpenter and Technicolor also devised a lookup table (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, [...] "For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of 'Kodak' – saturated and upbeat.

Bekmambetov described the original comic as [...] "risky and very provocative", with [...] "a twist and good characters", and declared that the thing that attracted him the most in Wanted <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> went through various film genres in its plot: [...] "It’s a comedy, a tragedy, a drama, a melodrama.

500|$|Sal Cinquemani noted her {{popularity}} had eclipsed Michael Jackson's, [...] "as {{she would}} continue to do {{for more than a}} decade." [...] Music scholars John Shepherd and David Horn wrote that as a crossover artist on the pop and R charts, she emerged [...] "the most dominant female performer of the 1980s" [...] behind Whitney Houston. Dan Rubey observed that she presented herself as a role model for black women and as a creative intellect whose work advocated the advancement of black people. Joseph Vogel stated that her rising popularity {{towards the end of the}} decade was important for several reasons, [...] "not the least of which <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> coincided with (and spoke to) the rise of black feminism." [...] At a time when radio airplay and MTV primarily catered to white rock musicians, her album and its predecessor garnered widespread critical acclaim alongside other [...] "unprecedented breakthroughs" [...] by black women—including Alice Walker's The Color Purple (1982), Toni Morrison's Beloved (1987) and Patricia Hill Collins's Black Feminist Thought (1990)—musically capturing the spirit of the movement and presenting an alternate model on both womanhood and feminism to that of Madonna. Regarding her diverse appeal among youth, he also stated: [...] "Janet didn't have the vocal prowess of Whitney Houston, or the poetic subtlety of Kate Bush; she didn't have Annie Lennox's penchant for the avant-garde or Madonna's predilection for shock. But none of these artists achieved the cross-racial impact (particularly on youth culture) of Janet. And none of them had an album like Rhythm Nation 1814." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1837 Bird {{took part}} in an {{investigation}} of the dangers posed by the arsenic content of cheap candles. [...] These were stearin candles with white arsenic added, which made them burn more brightly than ordinary candles. [...] The combination of cheapness and brightness made them popular. [...] The investigation was conducted by the Westminster Medical Society, a student society of Westminster Hospital, and was led by John Snow, later to become famous for his public health investigations. [...] Snow had previously investigated arsenic poisoning when he and several fellow students were taken badly ill after he introduced a new process for preserving cadavers at the suggestion of lecturer Hunter Lane. [...] The new process involved injecting arsenic into the blood vessels of the corpse. [...] Snow found that the arsenic became airborne as a result of chemical reactions with the decomposing corpse, and this <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was ingested. [...] Bird's part in the candle investigation was to analyse the arsenic content of the candles, which he found to have recently been greatly increased by the manufacturers. [...] Bird also confirmed by experiment that the arsenic became airborne when the candles were burnt. [...] The investigators exposed various species of animal and bird to the candles in controlled conditions. [...] The animals all survived, but the birds died. [...] Bird investigated the bird deaths and analysed the bodies, finding small amounts of arsenic. [...] No arsenic was found on the feathers, however, indicating that poisoning was not caused by breathing airborne arsenic, since arsenic in the air would be expected to adhere to the feathers. [...] However, Bird found that large amounts of arsenic were in the birds' drinking water, indicating that this was the route taken by the poison.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to literature, the episode spoofs the Ocean's Trilogy, a film series {{about a group}} of criminals that heist casinos. Selman revealed to Entertainment Weekly in January 2011 that the episode is essentially about [...] "Homer and some people in Springfield hav to perpetrate an Ocean's Eleven–style heist in the non-Ocean's Eleven world of children’s fantasy book publishing." [...] Throughout the episode as the story progresses, title cards with titles such as [...] "The Crew", [...] "The Setup", [...] "The Heist", and [...] "The Payday" [...] appear. During these title cards, which last for about three to four seconds each, a version of the song [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] by David Holmes is heard. This song was played for approximately three minutes during a scene in Ocean's Eleven. On his blog, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma wrote that Selman wanted [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] to be played repeatedly throughout [...] "The Book Job" [...] because he erroneously thought that <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was done in film. During the heist of TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, the screen splits in several ways, showing the different team members making their way to the printing room. According to Selman, [...] "the set-up and feel [...] is a real creative departure for us. It's sort of a heist movie where the heist is writing a book but when that kicks in, there's a giant stylistic leap. It's also a little sillier, a little more stylistic than most episodes.

2500|$|Augustus was {{determined}} to bring back [...] "the style of yesteryear" [...] (the toga).
