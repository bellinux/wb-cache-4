For illustration, it is applied to four specific problems: <b>the</b> normal distribution <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> mean, <b>the</b> normal distribution <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> absolute value of mean, <b>the</b> Bernoulli distribution <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> success probability, and <b>the</b> coin <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> bia...|$|R

The states <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> populations, from the Netherlands upwards, all have a bicameral system. Although there is a greater mix among the smaller states (some influenced by their federalist structure), the smallest states are on the whole unicameral.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of the Little Boy mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E

5|$|In 1906, the {{government}} issued {{a policy to}} limit its financial support to one shrine per village. This state supported shrines that followed its specific guidelines for funding, and encouraged unfunded shrines to become partners <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> shrines. As {{a result of this}} initiative to consolidate Shinto beliefs into state-approved practices, Japan's 200,000 shrines had been reduced to 120,000 by 1914, consolidating control to shrines favorable to the state interpretation of Shinto.|$|E

The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.|$|E

5|$|Its closest {{relative}} is {{the black}} currawong (S. fuliginosa) of Tasmania, which has sometimes been considered a subspecies. Together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> grey currawong (S. versicolor), they form the genus Strepera. Although crow-like in appearance and habits, currawongs are only distantly related to true crows, and instead belong to the family Artamidae, together with the closely related Australian magpie and the butcherbirds. The affinities of all three genera were recognised early on and they {{were placed in the}} family Cracticidae in 1914 by ornithologist John Albert Leach after he had studied their musculature. Ornithologists Charles Sibley and Jon Ahlquist recognised the close relationship between woodswallows and butcherbirds in 1985, and combined them into a Cracticini clade, which became the family Artamidae.|$|E

The factory only ever designated two, the Mark I and Mark II, {{but as the}} official Mark I production spanned the change in body style from the Series IV Alpine panels to the Series V panels, the later Mark I cars are generally designated Mark IA by Sunbeam Tiger enthusiasts. The Mark II Tiger, fitted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> Ford , was intended exclusively for export to America and was never marketed in the UK, although six right-hand drive models were sold to the Metropolitan Police for use in traffic patrols and high-speed pursuits; four more went to the owners of important Rootes dealerships.|$|E
5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger,</b> open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E

At 01:35 a shot from Seine struck the main topmast on Pique, bringing it crashing down. The consequent loss of speed forced Milne back, Seine pulling away from the smaller ship but unable to escape Jason which was steadily gaining.|$|E
