Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side package manager.

5|$|Unlike unique {{sciences}} such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or {{discipline of}} design is not {{brought to a}} generally accepted common denominator. The historical beginnings of design are complex {{and the nature of}} design is still the subject of ongoing discussion. In design, there are strong differentiations between theory and practice. The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as intuition. In his Classification of Design (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. industrial design, packaging design, service design), information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, <b>web</b> <b>design),</b> and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{information}} system creation process consists of several different actions, {{one of those}} actions – <b>web</b> interface <b>design.</b> <b>Web</b> interface <b>design</b> process requires a good methodology, to make web interface process better, quicker, flexible and satisfy other <b>web</b> interface <b>design</b> criterions. RUP (Rational Unified Process) don’t present any special creation process of internet web interface. Frequently <b>web</b> interface <b>design</b> process lies in the head of it’s designers. There are no full methodology of <b>web</b> interface <b>design</b> process in one place, only some web interface advices or articles about one or other web interface process steps could be found. The goal of this work {{is to make a}} methodology of <b>web</b> interface <b>design</b> and implement it for internet service provider system. Methodology also would be useful for companies which participate in <b>web</b> interface <b>design</b> process, also in school or university study process, or like a guide for any web interface designer. The developed methodology for <b>web</b> interface <b>design</b> was used for implementing internet service provider system <b>web</b> interface, system <b>design</b> process and redesign above-mentioned system web interface for measuring process times. Methodology of <b>web</b> interface <b>design,</b> reduce <b>web</b> interface <b>design</b> process time, help to make <b>web</b> interface <b>design</b> process easier, more flexible and understandable for web interface designer, also certain better web interface appearance independence from system functional part, with possibility to change web interface appearance without changing rest of system parts...|$|R

5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} prey that hit orb webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting the prey (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all prey. For example: wider spacing of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept prey, but reduce its stopping power and retention; closer spacing, larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but {{would make it easier}} for potential prey to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use during the day and those built for use at night. In fact, there is no simple relationship between orb <b>web</b> <b>design</b> features and the prey they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of prey.|$|E

25|$|Because markup languages, {{and more}} {{generally}} data description languages (not necessarily textual markup), are not programming languages (they are data without instructions), {{they are more}} easily manipulated than programming languages—for example, web pages are presented as HTML documents, not C code, and thus can be embedded within other web pages, displayed when only partially received, and so forth. This leads to the <b>web</b> <b>design</b> principle {{of the rule of}} least power, which advocates using the least (computationally) powerful language that satisfies a task to facilitate such manipulation and reuse.|$|E
25|$|Traditional orb webs are not {{effective}} for capturing moths, because only their scales will stick, allowing the moth to escape. The ladder webs of Scoloderus species {{appear to be}} adaptations in <b>web</b> <b>design</b> to increase moth capture. These webs extend vertically about seven times their width. When a moth slides down the web, it leaves a trail of scales until its body sticks to the web. However, these spiders {{do not seem to}} be closely related to bolas spiders. The nearest relatives seems to be the Cyrtarachneae (e.g. Pasilobus) of the Paleotropics. They also specialize on moths, and use threads that are beaded with sticky droplets. Celaenia and Taczanowskia species in South America seem to use chemical attractants to catch moths, too, and may also be closely related to bolas spiders.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Swiss {{pharmacologist}} Peter N. Witt {{started his}} research {{on the effect of}} drugs on spiders. The initial motivation for the study was a request from his colleague, zoologist H. M. Peters, to shift the time when garden spiders build their webs from 2am–5am, which apparently annoyed Peters, to earlier hours. Witt tested spiders with a range of psychoactive drugs, including amphetamine, mescaline, strychnine, LSD, and caffeine, and found that the drugs affect {{the size and shape of}} the web rather than the time when it is built. At small doses of caffeine (10µg/spider), the webs were smaller; the radii were uneven, but the regularity of the circles was unaffected. At higher doses (100µg/spider), the shape changed more, and the <b>web</b> <b>design</b> became irregular. All the drugs tested reduced web regularity except for small doses (0.1–0.3µg) of LSD, which increased web regularity.|$|E

A few style guides allow double sentence spacing for draft work, and the Gregg Reference Manual makes room for double and single sentence spacing based on author preferences. <b>Web</b> <b>design</b> guides do not usually provide guidance on this topic, as [...] "HTML refuses to recognize double spaces altogether".
