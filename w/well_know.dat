25|$|We full <b>well</b> <b>know</b> that, {{while the}} {{historic}} facts and religious truths {{of this series}} of revelatory presentations will stand on {{the records of the}} ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} {{advanced}} technology, the Soviet Union was {{far behind the}} United States, Western Europe, and Japan. Vacuum tube electronics remained in use long after they became obsolete elsewhere, and many factories in the 80s still used 1930s-vintage machine tools. General Nikolai Ogarkov in an unusually candid interview with an American journalist in 1982 admitted that [...] "In America, even small children play with computers. We do not even have them in all {{the offices of the}} Defense Ministry. And for reasons you <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> we cannot make computers widely available in our society." [...] Soviet manufacturing was not only primitive by Western standards, but extremely inefficient, often requiring 2-3 times the labor force of a mill or factory in the US.|$|E

500|$|William {{sought to}} be made a duke like his elder brothers, and to receive a similar {{parliamentary}} grant, but his father was reluctant. To put pressure on him, William threatened to stand for the House of Commons for the constituency of Totnes in Devon. Appalled {{at the prospect of}} his son making his case to the voters, George III created him Duke of Clarence and St Andrews and Earl of Munster on 16 May 1789, supposedly saying: [...] "I <b>well</b> <b>know</b> it is another vote added to the Opposition." [...] William's political record was inconsistent and, like many politicians of the time, cannot be certainly ascribed to a single party. He allied himself publicly with the Whigs as well as his elder brothers George, Prince of Wales, and Frederick, Duke of York, who were known to be in conflict with the political positions of their father.|$|E
500|$|In 1616, {{two years}} after Peacham's Case, the case of commendams arose. The in commendam writ was a method of {{transferring}} ecclesiastical property, which James used in this case to allow Richard Neile to hold his bishopric and associated revenues without actually performing the duties. On 25 April 1616 the courts, at Coke's bidding, held that this action was illegal, writing to the king that [...] "in case any letters come unto us contrary to law, we do nothing by such letters, but certify your Majesty thereof, and go forth to do the law notwithstanding the same". James called the judges before him and, furious, ripped up the letter, patronisingly telling them that [...] "I <b>well</b> <b>know</b> the true and ancient common law {{to be the most}} favourable to Kings of any law in the world, to which law I do advise you my Judges to apply your studies". While all the other judges [...] "succumbed to royal pressure and, throwing themselves on their knees, prayed for pardon", Coke defended the letter and stated that [...] "When the case happens I shall do that which shall be fit for a judge to do".|$|E

2500|$|The Orthodox Christian is {{expected}} to uphold truth, at all times and in all places, without exception. Slander and gossip are equally evil, and the initial speaker is responsible for any further damage caused as the report is spread. Unless there is a compelling reason to speak ill of someone, {{as is the case}} of protect oneself or others against harm, it is not permissible even if the account be true.

2500|$|The Urantia Book {{states in}} its Foreword {{that more than}} one {{thousand}} [...] "human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings" [...] were selected in preparing the papers. The authors say that they were required to [...] "give preference to the highest existing human concepts pertaining to the subjects to be presented" [...] and would [...] "resort to pure revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate previous expression by the human mind." [...] One of the authors wrote in Part IV: [...] "I <b>well</b> <b>know</b> that those concepts which have had origin in the human mind will prove more acceptable and helpful to all other human minds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Churchland's {{luminous}} room:"Consider a {{dark room}} containing a man holding a bar magnet or charged object. If the man pumps the magnet up and down, then, according to Maxwell's theory of artificial luminance (AL), it will initiate a spreading circle of electromagnetic waves and will thus be luminous. But as {{all of us who}} have toyed with magnets or charged balls <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> their forces (or any other forces for that matter), even when set in motion produce no luminance at all. It is inconceivable that you might constitute real luminance just by moving forces around!" [...] The problem is {{that he would have to}} wave the magnet up and down something like 450 trillion times per second in order to see anything.|$|E

2500|$|President Shachtman {{issued a}} call for the {{biennial}} convention of the IFWU {{to be held in}} the Executive Council chamber at the AFL Building in Washington, D.C., on July 13, 1927. The union's constitution required the convention to be held in May, but AFL leaders (including the influential Executive Council member, Matthew Woll) demanded that Shachtman delay the meeting until such time as he could guarantee that a large majority of delegates would be pro-AFL. [...] "As you <b>well</b> <b>know,</b> your International Union is today being financed to a great part by the reorganizing activities going on here in New York City," [...] Woll and two others wrote Shachtman, [...] "and that without this income your organization would be practically bankrupt." [...] The letter was thinly-veiled blackmail, and Shachtman knuckled under to it.|$|E
2500|$|... he {{executive}} {{authority is}} one. By this means we obtain very important advantages. We may discover from history, from reason, and from experience, the security which this furnishes. The executive power {{is better to}} be trusted when it has no screen. Sir, we have a responsibility in the person of our President; he cannot act improperly, and hide either his negligence or inattention; he cannot roll upon any other person the weight of his criminality; no appointment can take place without his nomination; and he is responsible for every nomination he makes. We secure vigor. We <b>well</b> <b>know</b> what numerous executives are. We know there is neither vigor, decision, nor responsibility, in them. Add to all this, that officer is placed high, and is possessed of power far from being contemptible; yet not a single privilege is annexed to his character; far from being above the laws, he is amenable to them in his private character as a citizen, and in his public character by impeachment.|$|E

Those who know me best <b>well</b> <b>know</b> that I have always adhered to that testimony. And that no man may be misled or doubt my present views in regard to the same, I do again affirm the truth of all my statements as then made and published...I submit this statement to the world; God in whom I trust being my judge as to the sincerity of my motives and the faith and hope that is in me of eternal life. My sincere desire is that the world may be benefited by this plain and simple statement of the truth.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, Hungerford {{made the}} right choice in {{breaking}} professional ties with George W. Patterson Jr., who took over as the President of the Geo. Washington Bank. On November 2, 1868, Patterson left work, placing his eighteen-year-old teller, George Eaton, in charge of the bank. Some time after three o'clock, a man came in and announced that he was a government detective there to arrest Eaton and Patterson for counterfeiting money. Eaton managed to lock the vault before being handcuffed. The so-called detective placed a revolver to Eaton's head and said to him: [...] "Young man, you may as <b>well</b> <b>know</b> my business at once. I want the money of this bank or I will blow your brains out." [...] Eaton told him to go ahead and a struggle ensued. The two compromised and Eaton, who was still in handcuffs, allowed the man to escape in exchange for his life. Eaton ran around Corning until he eventually found Patterson. By then, of course, the would-be robber escaped. Patterson offered a $100 reward for the assailant's arrest. Patterson was fortunate that he did not find his bank vault empty upon his return.|$|E
2500|$|... "A {{circumstance}} which has, perhaps, {{more than}} any other, contributed to conceal this oscillation from common view, {{is the difference between}} the nominal and real price of labour. It very rarely happens that the nominal price of labour universally falls; but we <b>well</b> <b>know</b> that it frequently remains the same, while the nominal price of provisions has been gradually rising. This, indeed, will generally be the case, if the increase of manufactures and commerce be sufficient to employ the new labourers that are thrown into the market, and to prevent the increased supply from lowering the money-price. But an increased number of labourers receiving the same money-wages will necessarily, by their competition, increase the money-price of corn. This is, in fact, a real fall in the price of labour; and, during this period, the condition of the lower classes of the community must be gradually growing worse. But the farmers and capitalists are growing rich from the real cheapness of labour. Their increasing capitals enable them to employ a greater number of men; and, as the population had probably suffered some check from the greater difficulty of supporting a family, the demand for labour, after a certain period, would be great in proportion to the supply, and its price would of course rise, if left to find its natural level; and thus the wages of labour, and consequently the condition of the lower classes of society, might have progressive and retrograde movements, though the price of labour might never nominally fall.|$|E
