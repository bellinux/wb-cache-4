500|$|Entomophagy is {{the eating}} of insects. Many insects are {{considered}} a culinary delicacy in some societies around the world, and Frederick Simon Bodenheimer's Insects as Human Food (1951) {{drew attention to the}} scope and potential of entomophagy, [...] but the practice is uncommon and even taboo in other societies. Sometimes insects are considered suitable only for the poor in the third world, but in 1975 Victor Meyer-Rochow suggested that insects could help ease global future food shortages and advocated a change in western attitudes towards cultures in which insects were appreciated as a food item. [...] P.J. Gullan and P.S. Cranston felt that the remedy for this may be marketing of insect dishes as suitably exotic and costly to make them acceptable. They also note that some societies in sub-Saharan Africa prefer caterpillars to beef, while Chakravorty et al. (2011) [...] point out that food insects (highly appreciated in North-East India) are more expensive than meat. The economics, i.e., the costs involved collecting food insects and the money earned through the sale of such insects, have been studied in a Laotian setting by Meyer-Rochow et al. (2008). [...] In Mexico, ant larvae and Corixid <b>water</b> <b>boatman</b> eggs are sought out as a form of caviar by gastronomes. In Guangdong, water beetles fetch a high enough price for these insects to be farmed. Especially high prices are fetched in Thailand for the giant water bug Lethocerus indicus.|$|E

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>boatmen</b> {{were one}} of the first species to colonize our pond. Seen from above they appear to hang upside down on the surface, a black shape with two {{characteristic}} paddles easily visible {{on either side of the}} body. They seem rather dull. They don’t move much except to dart down to the depths if disturbed, and they are sufficiently numerous to be regarded as common, with all the negative connotations of that word. The boatman doesn’t even have the advantage of its mirror image, the pond skater, which is equally common but more entertaining since an observer at the water’s edge is able to monitor its usually unsuccessful attempts to catch small insects. In the late summer, some <b>water</b> <b>boatmen</b> leave the <b>water</b> and sunbathe on the stalks of plants. As shown in Figure 1, their appearance is a revelation. They sport an iridescent silver cloak, with stylish darker streaks.

50|$|Hemiptera is {{the largest}} order of {{hemimetabolous}} insects (not undergoing complete metamorphosis) containing over 75,000 named species; orders with more species all have a pupal stage, Coleoptera (370,000 described species), Lepidoptera (160,000), Diptera (100,000) and Hymenoptera (100,000). The group is very diverse. The majority of species are terrestrial, including {{a number of important}} agricultural pests, but some are found in freshwater habitats. These include the <b>water</b> <b>boatmen,</b> pond skaters, and giant water bugs.|$|R
50|$|Several {{families}} of Heteroptera are water bugs, adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, {{such as the}} <b>water</b> <b>boatmen</b> (Corixidae), <b>water</b> scorpions (Nepidae), and backswimmers (Notonectidae). They are mostly predatory, and have legs adapted as paddles to help the animal move through the water. The pondskaters or water striders (Gerridae) are also associated with water, but use the surface tension of standing water to keep them above the surface; they include the sea skaters in the genus Halobates, the only truly marine group of insects.|$|R
5000|$|Notonecta undulata, {{also known}} by the common name grousewinged backswimmer, are from the family Notonectidae and the insect {{suborder}} Heteroptera. They are a type of hemipteran or true bug. These aquatic insects typically spend their time at the water's surface, using their abdomen and legs to cling to {{the underside of the}} surface tension. The Grousewinged backswimmer can be found in both lotic and lentic environments; however, they typically prefer small ponds and lakes where the water is slow-moving with less current. They swim upside down looking for prey. Once they stop swimming they float back up to the surface. These insects can be distinguished from <b>water</b> <b>boatman</b> or Corixidae by their segmented beak and front legs. <b>Water</b> <b>boatman</b> have highly modified front legs whereas backswimmers do not. Backswimmers are distributed across a broad range throughout North America. However, the species Notonecta undulata has only been documented and studied in southern Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the western United States. N. undulata differs from other backswimmers by their antennae and size. They are approximately 10-12 mm long, and their antennae are 4 segmented ...|$|E
50|$|D. villosus is {{omnivorous}} and {{feeds on}} a variety of invertebrates, including other members of the Gammaridae family. It has been found to kill blue-tailed damselfly nymphs, water hoglice, <b>water</b> <b>boatman,</b> fish leeches as well as small fish and the eggs of other vertebrates. Often it only kills prey but does not eat it. It kills its prey by biting it with its large mandibles and then shreds it before eating it.|$|E

50|$|Belostoma flumineum are {{commonly}} found in wetlands, marshes and ponds throughout North America. They live among weeds and like ponds with muddy bottoms which are good for over wintering in. Common species that B. flumineum prey upon are backswimmers, <b>water</b> <b>boatmen,</b> dragonfly nymphs, and snails. While they do not regularly participate in cannibalism they will attack smaller individuals of the same species. Reproduction in this species has 2 phases, a fall cycle and a spring cycle, where in the fall they are young breeders and in spring they are over wintered adults.|$|R
5|$|Very low {{sounds are}} also {{produced}} in various species of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Mantodea and Neuroptera. These low sounds are simply the sounds {{made by the}} insect's movement. Through microscopic stridulatory structures located on the insect's muscles and joints, the normal sounds of the insect moving are amplified {{and can be used}} to warn or communicate with other insects. Most sound-making insects also have tympanal organs that can perceive airborne sounds. Some species in Hemiptera, such as the corixids (<b>water</b> <b>boatmen),</b> are known to communicate via underwater sounds. Most insects are also able to sense vibrations transmitted through surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Primarily or {{exclusively}} {{aquatic animals}} have re-evolved from terrestrial tetrapods multiple times: examples include amphibians such as newts, reptiles such as crocodiles, sea turtles, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, marine mammals such as whales, seals and otters, and birds such as penguins. Many species of snakes are also aquatic and live {{their entire lives}} in the water. Among invertebrates, a number of insect species have adaptations for aquatic life and locomotion. Examples of aquatic insects include dragonfly larvae, <b>water</b> <b>boatmen,</b> and diving beetles. There are also aquatic spiders, although they tend to prefer other modes of locomotion under water than swimming proper.|$|R
