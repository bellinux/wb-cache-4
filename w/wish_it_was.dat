500|$|Lang did not {{disguise}} his {{relief that}} the crisis was over. He wrote of George VI: [...] "I was now sure that to the solemn words of the Coronation there would now be a sincere response." [...] On 12 May 1937, Lang crowned George VI with full pomp in Westminster Abbey. It was the first coronation to be broadcast. Time magazine recorded: [...] "All through the three-hour ceremony, {{the most important person}} there was not the King, his nobles or his ministers, but a hawk-nosed old gentleman with a cream-&-gold cope who stood on a dais as King George approached: The Rt. Hon. and Most Reverend Cosmo Gordon Lang, D.D.. Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England." [...] Supposedly the archbishop fumbled with the Crown but Lang himself was fully satisfied: [...] "I can only be thankful to God's over-ruling Providence and trust that the Coronation may not be a mere dream of the past, but that its memories and lessons will not be forgotten." [...] He also said of the Coronation: [...] "It was in a sense the culminating day of my official life. Once I saw it was going well, I enjoyed every minute." [...] "Thank God that is over!" [...] said his chaplain, as they got into the car to leave. [...] "Lumley, how can you say such a thing!" [...] cried the archbishop. [...] "I only <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> beginning over again." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Adams, the {{producer}} of Murder on the Orient Express, was extremely determined to have David Suchet as the voice actor for Poirot, a major character in the game. Nixon thought that Suchet had become so intertwined with the character of Poirot, after his success with the television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, {{that it would be}} hard to imagine someone else doing Poirot's voice without constantly being compared to Suchet. Nixon described the situation as a catch-22, saying that he [...] "worried about someone coming in and doing a Suchet impression instead of a unique rendition of Poirot, yet the more the voice strays from Suchet's version, the more people will <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Suchet doing it!" [...] Another reason for the development team's determination to have Suchet aboard was that they thought he would spur the other voice actors in the game, such as Vanessa Marshall who portrayed Antoinette Marceau, to step up and compete with Suchet's skillful portrayal of Poirot. Fairly late in the game's development, Suchet agreed to do the voice acting. He admitted that one reason for his acceptance of the offer was that he felt possessive of the role of Poirot, considering he had been portraying the character for so long. Adams expressed pride at having succeeded in convincing Suchet to do voice acting for Murder on the Orient Express, and said that his skillful voice acting would bring [...] "tremendous excitement and authenticity" [...] to the game.|$|E

2500|$|The cover design {{echoes the}} {{silhouette}} design of Fogerty's first solo album The Blue Ridge Rangers. The first single from {{the album was}} [...] "Don't You <b>Wish</b> <b>It</b> <b>Was</b> True". The album contains two war protest songs: [...] "Long Dark Night" [...] and [...] "I Can't Take It No More", both of which speak out against the Bush administration and the Iraq War. The latter song contains a lyric that refers {{to one of his}} hits with CCR, by referring to Bush as a [...] "Fortunate Son". Also, this song sounds like Ramones-style punk rock. Fogerty has done some experimentation with that sound ("She's Got Baggage" [...] from Deja Vu (All Over Again)). Another song, [...] "Summer of Love", is a tribute to Cream and Jimi Hendrix, and has a musical citation from [...] "Sunshine of Your Love". [...] "Creedence Song" [...] refers to CCR's swamp rock.|$|E

2500|$|After Theresa May became {{leader of}} the Conservative and Prime Minister, Johnson was {{appointed}} as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs on 13 July 2016. Johnson's appointment was criticised by some journalists and foreign politicians due to his history of controversial statements about other countries and their leaders. Former Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt said [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a joke", and France's foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault stated: [...] "I am not at all worried about Boris Johnson, but... during the campaign he lied {{a lot to the}} British people and now it is he who has his back against the wall" [...] as the UK tries to negotiate its future relationship with EU. Conversely, former Prime Minister of Australia Tony Abbott welcomed the appointment and called him [...] "a friend of Australia". A senior official in the US government suggested that Johnson's appointment would push the US further towards ties with Germany {{at the expense of the}} Special Relationship with the UK.|$|E
2500|$|George Lutz {{maintained}} that {{events in the}} book were [...] "mostly true" [...] and denied any suggestion of dishonesty on his part. In June 1979, George and Kathy Lutz took a polygraph test relating to their experiences at the house. The polygraph tests were performed by Chris Gugas and Michael Rice who, at the time, were reportedly among the top 5 polygraph experts in America. The results, in Mr. Rice's opinion, did not indicate lying. In October 2000, The History Channel broadcast Amityville: The Haunting and Amityville: Horror or Hoax?, a two-part documentary made by horror screenwriter/producer Daniel Farrands to mark the 25th anniversary of the case. George Lutz commented in an interview for the program: [...] "I believe this has stayed alive for 25 years because it's a true story. It doesn't mean that everything that has ever been said about it is true. It's certainly not a hoax. It's real easy to call something a hoax. I <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> It's not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vigilante 8 Arcade was {{announced}} on February 14, 2008. The game's developer, Isopod Labs, {{consists of three}} key individuals responsible {{for much of the}} production of the original Vigilante 8. The studio consisted of just six individuals and a small number of art contractors, and the title's development was self-funded. Isopod Labs originally looked to a June 2008 release; however, the game was not originally submitted for Xbox Live certification until August 12, 2008. Testers found issues on Microsoft's end in relation to the QNet code library. The issue was resolved by both parties and the game was sent back to Microsoft for resubmission. [...] "We certainly <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a quicker process," [...] said Isopod Labs, [...] "but this is how the cookie crumbles — not much else to do, but wait." [...] In a post-release interview with Joystiq Isopod Labs' Adrian Stephens added [...] "The certification issue is a tricky one and more could be done to smooth the path towards certification." [...] Vigilante 8 Arcade passed Microsoft's Xbox Live certification on September 24, 2008, and was released November 5, 2008.|$|E

2500|$|... "I’m really {{fortunate}} {{to be given the}} crew members that I have on this mission. It’s myself and six others. We do swap one of our crew members with the expedition crew member on board. So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I’m really {{fortunate to}} have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I’ve seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of <b>wish</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E
