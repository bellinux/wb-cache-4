50|$|The {{increased}} defensive {{capability of}} a man clad in full plate armour caused {{the use of the}} sword to be drastically changed. While slashing attacks were still moderately effective against infantry wearing half-plate armour, cutting and slicing attacks against an opponent <b>wearing</b> <b>plate</b> armour were almost entirely ineffective in providing any sort of slashing wound as the sword simply could not cut through the steel, although a combatant could aim for the chinks in a suit of armour, sometimes to great effect. Instead, the energy of the cut becomes essentially pure concussive energy. The later hardened plate armours, complete with ridges and roping, posed a threat against the careless attacker. It is considered possible for strong blows of the sword against plate armour to damage the blade of the sword, potentially rendering it much less effective at cutting and producing only a concussive effect against the armoured opponent.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal for}} this thesis is to {{minimize}} clearances and tolerances, {{in order to}} prevent water leakage. A proper seal on the seal rings does not let excess water flow through the turbine runner, thus conserving more water and wasting less energy. Moreover, water leakage past <b>worn</b> <b>wear</b> <b>plates</b> allows for an extra load for the turbine when operating in condense mode. When the wicket gates are closed, water leakage past <b>worn</b> <b>plates</b> wastes mechanical energy in the water; thus, decreasing the efficiency of the Francis turbine, especially when operating at partial loads. Furthermore, the wicket gates also known as guide vanes can increase the efficiency of the turbine in their relation to their laminar profile and proper seal. Water is a very vital resource in today 2 ̆ 7 s society. This thesis illustrates how existing hydro machinery can be improved to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels as an electric energy source. This study provides actual examples of improvements using the generating units located at Hoover Dam. Hoover Dam located in Boulder City, NV is part of the Lower Colorado Region, of the U. S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation. Overhauling a hydro unit to obtain better efficiency is very similar to overhauling a vehicles engine to improve the vehicles fuel economy. Modifying and replacing three major hydro-machinery components: seal rings, <b>wear</b> <b>plates,</b> and wicket gates, improves the efficiency of Hoover Dam units by an average of 2 percent. This increase in capacity equates to an additional 8, 000 MW-hrs per year per unit. The wholesale market value of this increase in energy and capacity, roughly equates to about 290, 000 per unit per year [1].

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} was to {{understand}} the structure and chemical composition changes of gas metal arc welded joints of <b>wear</b> resistant <b>plate</b> with constructional steel plate with possible application as replacing material for reservoirs and chute in cement industry. Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of <b>wear</b> resistant <b>plate</b> with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Design/methodology/approach: <b>Wear</b> resistant <b>plates</b> can be used for elements working in intensive abrasion resistance conditions to obtain considerable material and economical savings based on the manufacturing costs reducing and decreasing turnaround time for replacing worn parts. During the welding process of two materials, when one is <b>wear</b> <b>plate</b> and the other is steel plate significant structure changes and mixing of alloying components in weld area are observed. Findings: Based on the experiment results presented it is clear that welding of <b>wear</b> resistant <b>plate</b> with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root, most of important changes during welding of wear resistant material are connected with melting, mixing and carbides passage into weld area, non uniform chemical composition of the welded joint creates different microstructures with different hardness. Practical implications: Welding of <b>wear</b> resistant <b>plate</b> with constructional steel is possible, but special attention is needed during the welding process of the root. Root weld must be free of cracks and possibly free of intermixing with <b>wear</b> resistant <b>plate</b> material.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Wear</b> <b>plate</b> welding {{machines}} requires some special raw {{material handling system}} as they are heavy to handle. <b>Wear</b> <b>plate</b> welding requires 4 - 5 workers for handling and clamping of raw material. This paper reviews different material handling equipment used by various industries. As the raw material is heavy, {{it is very difficult}} to handle manually. Hence there is requirement of integrated material handling and clamping system to do this heavy task. An integrated approach for material handling and clamping is suggested. In this paper, various handling mechanisms like scissor lifting mechanism, hydraulic lift platform in scissors type mechanism, hydraulic lifting system based on multistage telescopic cylinder are discussed. Their analysis is done by using various software. Some failure diagnosis points are also discussed by mathematical calculations.
