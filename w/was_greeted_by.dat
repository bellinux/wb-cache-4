5|$|James Wolfe {{expected}} to lead 12,000 men, but <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> only approximately 7,000 regular troops, 400 officers, and 300 gunners. Wolfe's troops {{were supported by}} a fleet of 49 ships and 140 smaller craft led by Admiral Charles Saunders.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the writer}} Branko Ćopić, who was a Partisan in Grmeč, Stojanović <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> a crowd of villagers and welcomed with the {{traditional}} bread and salt ceremony when he crossed the Sana River. Prominent villagers shook hands with him, and they compared him with Miloš Obilića famous Serbian epic hero from the medieval Battle of Kosovo. Several women approached Stojanović to kiss his hands; he declined this mark of respect, {{saying that he was}} not a priest but a communist.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Union forces at Bull Run on July 21, 1861, Lincoln summoned McClellan from western Virginia, where McClellan had given the North the only engagements bearing a semblance of victory. He {{traveled}} by special train on the main Pennsylvania line from Wheeling through Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and Baltimore, and on to Washington, D.C., and <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> enthusiastic crowds that met his train along the way.|$|E

5|$|Following the German invasion, Molotov {{conducted}} urgent {{negotiations with}} Britain and, later, the United States for wartime alliances. He took a secret flight to Glasgow, Scotland, where he <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> Eden. This risky flight, {{in a high}} altitude Tupolev TB-7 bomber, flew over German occupied Denmark and the North Sea. From there he took a train to London to discuss with the British government the possibility of opening a second front against Germany.|$|E
5|$|Nerva was succeeded without {{incident}} by his adopted son Trajan, who <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> the Roman populace with much enthusiasm. According to Pliny the Younger, Trajan dedicated a temple {{in honour of}} Nerva, yet no trace of {{it has ever been}} found; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the Deified Nerva issued until ten years after his death. According to Cassius Dio, however, the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against Nerva, Casperius Aelianus, was 'dismissed' upon Trajan's accession.|$|E
5|$|New Mexico finally entered Newark Channel on 19 November, and <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> {{the same}} Newark fireboats that had earlier {{been sent to}} oppose the ship. Newark also {{arranged}} to have school children honor the old battleship dockside, with a marching band. New Mexico was subsequently joined by Idaho and Wyoming, where all three were finally dismantled. Scrapping of New Mexico began on 24 November and was completed by July 1948.|$|E

5|$|On {{his arrival}} at Alexandria, Cleomenes <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> Ptolemy, who welcomed him with smiles and promises. At first Ptolemy was guarded towards Cleomenes, but soon came to respect him {{and promised to}} send him back to Greece with an army and a fleet. He also promised to provide Cleomenes with an annual income of twenty-four talents. However, before he could fulfill his promise, Ptolemy died—and with him any hope for Cleomenes to return to Greece, as the weak Ptolemy IV ascended the throne.|$|E
5|$|On {{reaching}} Jejuri, Khandoba <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> Mhalsa's {{fury and}} her strong protest {{of his second}} marriage. To avoid the quarrels of his wives, Khandoba gave {{the upper half of}} the hill to Mhalsa and the lower half to Banai. The idol of Mhalsa is placed with Khandoba in the main shrine at top of the hill at Jejuri. A separate shrine to Banai is situated halfway down the hill.|$|E
5|$|The Turks agreed, but Prime Minister Deligiannis refused and {{dispatched}} 1400 {{troops to}} Crete {{under the command}} of Colonel Timoleon Vassos. While the Great Powers announced a blockade, Greek troops crossed the Macedonian border and Abdul Hamid II declared war. The announcement that Greece was finally at war with the Turks <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> delirious displays of patriotism and spontaneous parades in honor of the King in Athens. Volunteers by the thousands streamed north to join the forces {{under the command of}} Crown Prince Constantine.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} in New York on 20 June, George Washington <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> the unfurling of the {{official}} banner of the League of Peace from the Singer Building, and docked at 18:30 at the North German Lloyd piers in Hoboken, New Jersey. Coincidentally, , an ocean liner of the unrelated Austro-American Line, was in port when George Washington docked in New York for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Abebe {{returned}} to his homeland a hero. He <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> a large crowd, many dignitaries and {{the commander of the}} Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did not yet know how to drive) and a home, both owned by the Guard.|$|E
5|$|At 09:12, JG 2 {{crossed the}} front line at Malmedy and <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> an {{enormous}} volume of Allied ground fire. The entire area was heavily defended by anti-aircraft artillery, since the area had been the scene of heavy fighting, but also had been attacked by V-1 and V-2 missiles. I./JG 2 lost at least seven fighters to ground fire alone. III./JG 2 lost 10 fighters. A possible seven Bf 109s from II./JG 2 were also lost to ground fire. JG 2 attacked Asch and Ophoven airfields by mistake.|$|E

5|$|De Gaulle {{ordered the}} plan for an advance into Libya {{to be put in}} motion {{in the wake of the}} Eighth Army's victory in the Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942. Leclerc set out from Fort Lamy on 16 December 1942 with 500 European and 2,700 African troops in 350 vehicles. He {{captured}} Sebha on 12 January 1943, and Mizdah on 22 January. He reached Tripoli on 26 January, where he <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> the Eighth Army's commander, General Bernard Montgomery. Leclerc's command, now reinforced by the Greek Sacred Squadron, and known as L Force, covered the Eighth Army's inland flank during its advance into Tunisia. L Force beat off a German counterattack on 10 March, and participated in the attack on the Mareth Line.|$|E
5|$|For his {{services}} during the war, he was welcomed back to America {{with a large}} parade down Broadway in New York, along with other honors. Schwarzkopf led a highly publicized homecoming parade in Washington, D.C., on June 8, 1991, where he <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> Bush amid thousands of onlookers. His accomplishments were praised in a manner much differently from commanders who returned from the Vietnam and Korean Wars. He became an instant national celebrity {{and the source of}} great curiosity by the general public. He was quick to award praise and medals to the troops, part of what he saw as restoring pride in the U.S. armed forces after the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Muñoz Rivera ran for Resident Commissioner in the United States House of Representatives {{representing}} the Union of Puerto Rico party, and served from 1911 to 1916. After spending {{nearly a year}} perfecting his English, Muñoz Rivera began forming friendships with some congressmen. Among these were Henry L. Stimpson and Felix Frankfurter. In 1915 Muñoz Rivera proposed granting Puerto Rico greater autonomy without requesting independence from the United States, and equal rights without becoming a state. His proposal <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> opposition from many members of his party including José de Diego. Still in the end, his party agreed on his proposal.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa {{wasted no}} time moving onto his next project: Madadayo, or Not Yet. Based on autobiographical essays by Hyakken Uchida, the film follows {{the life of a}} Japanese {{professor}} of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the film's 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1962, United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara visited South Vietnam and {{was taken}} on an {{inspection}} tour of the country, accompanied by Diệm and Thảo. Perhaps because Thảo divulged the tour details to Vietcong guerrillas, each of McNamara's stopovers was punctuated by bloody attacks on nearby ARVN installations. For example, when McNamara was in Bình Dương Province, five government soldiers were killed. As he flew from Đà Lạt north to Đà Nẵng near the Demilitarized Zone, he <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> a Vietcong bombing of a southbound troop train, which killed 27 and wounded 30 Civil Guard members.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Gellibrand {{returned}} to Tasmania. He boarded the troopship RMS Kaiser-i-Hind in London on 4 May 1919, and reached Hobart on 30 June, {{after a long}} sea voyage, a rail trip from Fremantle to Melbourne, passage across the Bass Strait, and a week in quarantine on Bruny Island due to the 1918 flu pandemic. As Tasmania's highest-ranking war hero, he <b>was</b> <b>greeted</b> <b>by</b> the Governor of Tasmania, Sir Francis Newdegate. On August 1919 he accepted an offer from the Premier of Tasmania, Walter Lee, of the post of Public Service Commissioner. He investigated {{the conditions of the}} service, and found that public servants were agitating for a 40 per cent pay rise, as no pay rises had been granted since before the war. He {{came up with a plan}} for a temporary reclassification of positions, which would offer some relief, at a cost to the government of £12,000. This was implemented in December. On 19 July 1920, he was formally knighted by the Prince of Wales.|$|E
