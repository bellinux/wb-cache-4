40|$|We {{show that}} the {{existence}} of a sequence of elements from cocompact torsion-free arithmetic subgroups of SL(2, 1 %) converging to the identity is equivalent to the density of Salem numbers in [1, oo). 1 In t roduct ion In this note we show that a natural question on arithmetic subgroups of SL(2, B.), is essentially equivalent to one studied by number theorists work-ing on the set of algebraic integers called Salem numbers. More precisely, we show that an ~mnat ive answer for either of the following two questions implies one for the other. Quest ion 1 : Does there exist a neighbourhood W of the identity in SL(2, B.) such that for every cocompact torsion-free arithmetic subgroup I', we have I ' N W = {e}? Quest ion 2 : Does there exist a number e> 0 such that any Salem number r> l+e? We point out that, as of now, neither of the questions has been answered. Actually Question 2 is expected to have an affurmative answer. <b>We</b> <b>note</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} finite separable coverings of curves f: X → Y over a {{field of}} characteristic p ≥ 0. We are interested in describing the possible monodromy groups of this cover if the genus of X is fixed. There has been much progress on this problem {{over the past decade}} in characteristic zero. Recently Frohardt and Magaard completed the final step in resolving the Guralnick Thompson conjecture showing that only finitely many nonabelian simple groups other than alternating groups occur as composition factors for a fixed genus. There is an ongoing project to get a complete list of the monodromy groups of indecomposable rational functions with only tame ramification. In this article, we focus on positive characteristic. There are more possible groups but we show that many simple groups do not occur as composition factors for a fixed genus. We also give a reduction theorem reducing the problem to the case of almost simple groups. We also obtain some results on bounding the size of automorphism groups of curves in positive characteristic and discuss the relationship with the first problem. <b>We</b> <b>note</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|E
40|$|Competition, {{security}} of supply and sustainability are {{at the core of}} EU energy policy. The Commission argues that making the European gas market more competitive (completing the internal gas market) will be instrumental in the pursuit of these objectives. We examine the question through the eyes of existing models of the European gas market. Can model tell us anything on this problem? Do they confirm or infirm the analysis of the Commission appearing in fundamental documents such the Green Paper, the Sector Inquiry or the new legislation package? We argue that results of existing models contradict a fundamental finding (paragraph 77) of the Sector Inquiry. We further elaborate {{on the basis of the}} economic assumption underlying the models, that changing the assumptions implicitly contained in paragraph 77 cast doubts on a large part of the reasoning justifying the completion of the internal gas market. We also explain that models could help arriving at a better definition of the relevant market, which is so important in the reasoning of the Commission. Last we also find model results that question the effectiveness of ownership unbundling. As to {{security of}} supply, we explain that models can also contribute to assess the value of additional infrastructure in the context of {{security of supply}}, but this potential seems largely untapped.

The Signal to Noise Ratio constraint used here includes {{the effect of}} a band limited, additive coloured Gaussian noise communication link and a (non) minimum phase unstable continuous (discrete) linear time invariant (LTI) plant with time delay. Target performance is introduced in a form that directly implies an additional term in the required SNR compared to the case of stabilisability only. In a first approach performance is sought as output disturbance rejection giving guaranteed reference tracking at zero frequency (integral action) and compensation for perturbations over a range of frequencies.

40|$|Overdrive pacing {{was used}} {{for many years to}} prevent {{ventricular}} tachycardia and there are many reports of its effectiveness. Nevertheless, the use of overdrive pacing for most types of ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been abandoned. One notable exception is torsades de pointes, in which interventions that increase heart rate, including pacing, at least temporarily protect against recurrence. Overdrive may work by narrowing dispersion of ventricular refractoriness, and measurement of the latter could provide a marker to selectively apply overdrive pacing, thus increasing its usefulness. T H E RATIONALE FOR the use of overdrive pacing to pre-vent ventricular tachyarrhythmias is based on the obser-vation made early in this century that heart rate is critical to the genesis of some arrhythmias.

40|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century most leading {{biologists}} believed that development and heredity were {{one and the same}} problem. Even as late as 1896, the first edition of E. B. Wilson’s famous book had the title The cell in develop-ment and inheritance, even though, {{in the absence of the}} recognition of Mendel, almost nothing was known about the mechanism of heredity. It is extremely likely that Mendel’s work was ignored for 30 years precisely because heredity was linked to development (Sandler and Sandler l 985). When his work was rediscovered at the beginning of the twentieth century, the discipline of gentics was launched. Mendel’s genius was to unravel the laws of inheritance without knowing anything about the process of development, and most geneticists followed this path thereafter.

40|$|This {{review of}} the role of the metaphor in {{instruction}} begins with a brief description of historical thinking on the subject. Modern views of the metaphor as a psychological mechanism rather than just a figure of speech are then presented, with emphasis on reasons why metaphors should be helpful in education. It is noted that the hypothesis that metaphor allows a transfer of meaning from something well-known to something less well-known is supported by contemporary theorists, who further suggest that the transfer of structures from one domain to another may involve the creation of new cognitive structures. Brief discussions of the:ubstitution theory view and the interaction view include the limited role ascribed to metaphor in education by both substitutionists and interactionists. The attitudes of scientists toward metaphor are then described, and it is <b>noted</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT-Certain {{alterations}} {{of blood}} group substance (BGS) expression {{have been observed}} in gastrointestinal cancer tissues. However, in the pancreas {{little is known about}} BGS expression by normal or malignant tissue. The present immunohistochemical study analyzed simultaneously the expression of A, B, H, Lewisa (Lea), and Lewis? (Leb) antigens in specimens of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic carcinoma (primary and metastatic). In normal pancreas all five antigens were expressed in ducts, ductules, and acini, but not in islets. Acinar cells expressed A, B, H, and Leb in supranuclear cytoplasm, whereas Lea was found mainly on centroacinar cells. Only BGSs that were appro-priate for the host's blood type were expressed, except for one case of Lea deletion. BGS expression by chronic pancreatitis tissue closely resembled that by normal tissue.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study the {{addition}} of parameters to typed�-calculus with definitions. We show that the resulting systems have nice properties and illustrate that parameters allow for a better fine-tuning {{of the strength of}} type systems as well as staying closer to type systems used in practice in theorem provers and programming languages. 1 What are parameters? Parameters occur when functions are only allowed to occur when provided with arguments. As we will show below, both in mathematics and in programming languages the use of parameters is abundant and closely connected to the use of constants and definitions. If {{we want to be able}} to use type systems in accordance with practice and yet described in a precise manner, we therefore need parameters, constants, and definitions in type theory as well.

We consider a general multi-hop wireless network, and show how the attempt probabilities/attempt rates in Aloha protocols should be set so that the achieved rates are globally proportionally fair. For both slotted and unslotted Aloha, we argue {{that it is possible to}} achieve globally fair rates with local topology information. I. INTRODUCTION AND SYSTEM MODEL Next we describe the system model that we use. A general wireless ad-hoc network can be modeled as an undirected graph G = (N, L), where N and L respectively denote the set of nodes and the set of (undirected) links in the network, and a link exists between two nodes if and only if they can hear each other (we assume a symmetric hearing matrix). <b>Note</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|R
