5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the <b>windpipe.</b> It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the <b>windpipe</b> collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} a third jury consumed {{a year and}} a half. During the delay, Desha attempted suicide by cutting his throat and severed his <b>windpipe.</b> Doctors used a silver tube to repair his <b>windpipe,</b> and Desha survived. On {{the last day of the}} court's term in June 1827, the judge announced another continuance, since the court had not yet empaneled a jury. Governor Desha stood and produced a pardon for his son. Although legend holds that Governor Desha resigned immediately after issuing the pardon, records show that he served out the rest of his term. The pardon damaged the governor's reputation and that of the Relief Party, which lost a number of legislative seats in the subsequent elections.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal intubation, usually simply {{referred}} to as intubation, is the placement of a flexible plastic tube into the trachea (<b>windpipe)</b> to maintain an open airway or {{to serve as a}} conduit through which to administer certain drugs. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of the lungs, including mechanical ventilation, and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction.|$|E

5|$|As they {{attempted}} to continue up the hill, several Chinese soldiers from a nearby trench opened fire, injuring another soldier. According to witness reports, Bleak rushed the trench and dove into it, tackling one Chinese soldier and, with only his hands, broke the soldier's neck, killing him. Bleak was then confronted by a second soldier, whom he reportedly grabbed by the neck, fatally crushing his <b>windpipe.</b> A third Chinese soldier then approached, and in the ensuing scuffle, Bleak used his combat knife to stab and kill the soldier.|$|E
5|$|Once in space, sudden {{exposure}} of unprotected humans to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture of the lungs, {{due to the}} large pressure differential between {{inside and outside the}} chest. Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the <b>windpipe</b> may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the heated}} {{political}} {{environment of the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, allies of his father claimed that the governor's political enemies had framed his son. The governor's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable change of venue for the trial, and the governor used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would hear the case. Isaac Desha was twice convicted, but both times, {{the judge in the}} case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds. While awaiting a third trial, Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat, but doctors saved his life, reconnecting his severed <b>windpipe</b> with a silver tube. Shortly after the suicide attempt, Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son.|$|E
5|$|In July 1826, Isaac Desha, free on bail while {{awaiting}} a third trial and apparently {{in a highly}} intoxicated state, attempted suicide by cutting his own throat. Physicians saved his life by reconnecting his severed <b>windpipe</b> with a silver tube. He recovered, and in June 1827, faced a third trial. During the June term of the court, Desha's lawyers used a number of peremptory challenges to again prevent the court from empaneling a jury. The judge ordered him held without bail until the next session of the court, but Governor Desha, who {{was present at the}} proceedings, stood and issued a pardon for his son, as well as lambasting the judge in a lengthy impromptu speech. Some accounts hold that the governor immediately resigned upon granting the pardon, but the official records reflect no such action.|$|E
5|$|Shepard died {{unexpectedly}} {{during the}} afternoon of March 24, 1893 at his Manhattan residence. Two doctors were attempting to remove a bladder stone from him. They instructed him to eat lightly, only well before the operation. They gave him the anesthetic ether at 12:45p.m. For a few minutes Shepard {{did not seem to}} react, though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse dimmed, so administration of ether was stopped, however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation. His condition started to worsen again; the doctors suspected food or vomit was blocking his <b>windpipe</b> or bronchial tubes. The doctors then administered oxygen, which helped temporarily; however, at 4:00p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble, he fell unconscious, and died at 4:10p.m. His cause of death was edema and congestion of the lungs, after the administration of ether, but due to an unknown cause.|$|E

50|$|In Fukushima Prefecture, {{it is said}} to be a weasel. When {{one looks}} up at a nyūdō-bōzu, it would gnaw at people's <b>windpipes</b> and kill them. It is said that since the weasel stops on the {{shoulder}} of the person it is trying to fool, if one does not get startled and grasps that leg and stomps it on the ground, it would be possible to exterminate the nyūdō-bōzu. In Nagano Prefecture, it is said that their true form is considered to be a tanuki or mujina, and in Miyagi Prefecture, a mujina.|$|R
5|$|Since it {{is easier}} for a snake's tongue to fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the <b>windpipe</b> can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E
5|$|Luongo {{recorded}} a 3–1 win against the Detroit Red Wings in his Canucks debut on October 5, 2006. Later in the month, he notched his first shutout with the Canucks, stopping 32 shots in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Blackhawks on October 25. On January 9, 2007, Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender {{for the first time}} in his career for the Western Conference All-Stars. Six days after the announcement, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice. He spent the night in the intensive care unit for fears his <b>windpipe</b> would swell shut. Discharged from the hospital on game day, Luongo {{recorded a}} shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. During the 2007 NHL All-Star Game in Dallas, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12–9 win over the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his franchise record-setting 39th win in a 2–1 overtime victory on March 9. He surpassed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in 1991–92. He went on to finish with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of league-leader Martin Brodeur, who broke Bernie Parent's thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties.|$|E

The work began in 1837 and continued for six years, Yarrell publishing {{at the rate}} of one instalment, containing three sheets, every two months. Many of the drawings were from skins or stuffed specimens, though every bird species is illustrated with a lifelike drawing of the bird standing (or rarely, flying or swimming) in a natural setting. Additional drawings depict nests, feathers, and details of bird anatomy including feet, breastbones, and <b>windpipes.</b> The work was hugely influential.|$|R

The stars blinked lazily in the dim vault overhead; and the full moon, rising in the east, touched with its light the myriads of wisps and threads and spidery films of smoke that intertwined and writhed and twisted along the deck, over the rails, and up the masts and shrouds.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that vocal tract {{resonances}} are involved in sound production in mammals, but models of bird vocal production often assumed that their sounds are only source created (Greenwalt 1968). In large birds the source sound resonates off the sides of the long and curved trachea or within air sacs (Welty & Baptista 1988). Recently Nowicki (1987), who studied passerines with short rigid <b>windpipes,</b> showed that resonances are involved in bird song as well; however, the actual way resonances are produced is not yet well known.

The mountain lion is well known for predation on feral horses, and the larger members of the species may hunt both horses and moose.

In this manner, the epiglottis prevents food from going into the trachea and instead directs it to the esophagus, which is at the back. Should food or liquid enter the <b>windpipe</b> due to the epiglottis failing to close properly, the gag reflex is induced to protect the respiratory system.|$|E

Only in the fourth, rewritten edition of 1871–85 were illustrations by other artists (Charles Whymper, J. G. Keulemans, Edward Neale) added. Some of the bird figures, such as [...] "The Snowy Owl" [...] and [...] "Richard's Pipit" [...] in Volume 1, are signed [...] "A. FUSSEL DEL." [...] (A.

Yarrell thanks Fussell in his Preface for [...] "nearly five hundred of {{the drawings}} on wood here employed", and John Thompson (1785–1866) and his sons for the [...] "very long series of engravings" [...] of the drawings. He also thanks his printers, Messrs. Bentley, Wilson and Fley for their care and skill. The pen for the remaining drawings, if any (the title page asserts there are 520 in the book), is not stated.
