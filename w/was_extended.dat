5|$|Highway60 was {{designated}} in 1937 between Huntsville and Lake Dore, near where it met Highway41. During the 1940s, the route {{shared a common}} termini with Highway41 at Golden Lake. When Highway41 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> north to Pembroke in 1957, Highway60 was routed along it between Golden Lake and Eganville. It <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> east to Highway17 in downtown Renfrew circa 1961.

5|$|M-90 in the Lower Peninsula {{replaced}} the M-38 designation between M-36 near North Branch and M-19 near Melvin.

5|$|SR-68 {{became a}} state highway in 1931, {{at which time}} the route ran from then–US-40 (North Temple Street) in Salt Lake City to present-day US-89 in Lehi. In 1933, the route <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> north to US-89 at Beck's Hot Springs. SR-68 was routed onto Redwood Road in 1943, taking over what had been {{designated}} SR-153. In 1960, SR-68 switched alignments with SR-249 to follow Redwood Road and 2300 North to Bountiful; the route <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> south to Elberta at this time also. SR-249 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> west along a proposed roadway to 2200 West and 2200 North in 1961 before being removed in 1969.

5|$|The DR <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Uxbridge in 1910, by a {{connection}} {{made to the}} MR. In 1913, the Bakerloo Tube <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Paddington and to Queen's Park and Watford Junction four years later. The Hampstead tube <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> a short distance at its southern end to provide an interchange with the Bakerloo and the DR at Embankment in 1914. It <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> at its northern end from Golders Green into the Middlesex countryside to reach Edgware in 1924. In 1926, the Hampstead tube <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> south to connect to the C at Kennington {{in conjunction with a}} reconstruction of the C and its 1926 extension from Clapham Common to Morden. The CLR <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Ealing Broadway in 1920. Permission for an extension of the line to Richmond was obtained in 1913 and again in 1920, but was not used.

The current highway's immediate predecessors {{were included in the}} original M-4 in the state. That designation was renumbered to the current M-134 moniker in 1939. Since the trunkline number was finalized, it <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> eastward to end south of Goetzville in the 1950s, with a further extension to De Tour in the 1950s.

5|$|Between 1918 and 1926, Route 46 <b>was</b> <b>{{extended}}</b> to Sheridan. Soon after, in 1933, it extended south, {{two miles}} east of Sheridan. The extension caused the road to Sheridan to become a spur route of Route 46. The spur route was then extended west into Nodaway County around 1948–1949, and was numbered supplemental route D. Four years later, the route <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to Route 27 (now Route 148). In 1954, Route 246 was designated, starting from Sheridan, and ending at Route 46. The next year, Route 246 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to replace supplemental route D as the main connector from Hopkins to Route 46. The whole route was surfaced in concrete by 1959.|$|E

In the 1950s, the road <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> to US 13 Alt. (now US 13) in Wilmington, {{in which it was}} rerouted at Leipsic to follow its current alignment to Wilmington. DE 9 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> further north to DE 2 by the 1970s. The route was rerouted to bypass downtown New Castle in the 1980s.

5|$|During the 1930s, two U.S. highways, both {{formed in}} 1926, were {{extended}} into California using El Camino Sierra.

5|$|During the mid-1930s, Highway28 <b>was</b> <b>extended</b> as {{far north}} as Apsley.
