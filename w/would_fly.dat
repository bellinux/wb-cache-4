5|$|Another {{mission to}} Titan {{proposed}} in early 2012 by Jason Barnes, {{a scientist at}} the University of Idaho, is the Aerial Vehicle for In-situ and Airborne Titan Reconnaissance (AVIATR): an unmanned plane (or drone) that <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> through Titan's atmosphere and take high-definition images of the surface of Titan. NASA did not approve the requested $715 million, {{and the future of}} the project is uncertain.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the mission}} plan, the first {{helicopter}} would hover over the compound's yard while its full team of SEALs fast-roped to the ground. At the same time, the second helicopter <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> to {{the northeast corner of}} the compound and deploy the interpreter, the dog and handler, and four SEALs to secure the perimeter. The team in the courtyard was to enter the house from the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Adverse weather {{such as a}} storm or hail could devastate crop {{fields and}} orchards, and thus {{jeopardize}} the livelihood of farmers in the affected area. A role of zduhaći, according to folk tradition, was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save their crops. A zduhać could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops. The other zduhać <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> up to confront the bringer of bad weather, {{and there would be}} a fight between the zduhaći.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} new fighter McCudden was eager to fly was the company he would be flying with. Albert Ball (44 victories), rising star Arthur Rhys-Davids (27) and McCudden's former pupil Geoffrey Hilton Bowman (32) were {{just some of the}} fighter aces who flew with the unit. Though Ball was killed in May 1917, he <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> and fight {{alongside}} Rhys-Davids, Bowman, Richard Maybery, Reginald Hoidge and Keith Muspratt.|$|E
5|$|Despite the improvements, the {{in-service}} {{rates for}} the F-84E remained poor with {{less than half of}} the aircraft operational at any given time. This was primarily due to a severe shortage of spares for the Allison engines. The expectation was that F-84Es <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> 25 hours per month, accumulating 100 hours between engine overhauls. The actual flight hours for Korean War and NATO deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison's ability to manufacture new engines. The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, lingering with ANG units until 1959.|$|E
5|$|France {{was willing}} to commit to a launch aid, or subsidies, while the Germans were more cautious. The UK {{government}} was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling requested by British Aerospace (BAe) and estimated at ₤250million, it was postponed for three years. On 1 March 1984 {{the government and the}} manufacturer agreed that ₤50million would be paid whether the A320 <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> or not, while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Armstrong {{had been}} {{selected}} for the U.S. Air Force's Man In Space Soonest program. In November 1960, he was chosen {{as part of the}} pilot consultant group for the X-20 Dyna-Soar, a military space plane under development by Boeing for the U.S. Air Force, and on March 15, 1962, he was selected by the U.S. Air Force as one of seven pilot-engineers who <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> the space plane when it got off the design board.|$|E
5|$|NASA had no {{official}} policy prohibiting women, but {{the requirement that}} astronauts had to be military test pilots effectively excluded them. NASA dropped this requirement in 1965, but did not select any women as astronauts until 1978, when six women were selected, although none as pilots. After Tereshkova, no women of any nationality <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> in space again until August 1982, when the Soviet Union launched pilot-cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya. During the late 1970s, Glenn reportedly supported Space Shuttle Mission Specialist Judith Resnik in her career.|$|E
5|$|On 12 March 1916, Dodd was {{appointed}} {{as a pilot}} to the 1st Aero Squadron, under General John Pershing's 8th Brigade, which was positioned on the Mexican border. As the pilot of Airplane #44, he and his observer, Captain Benjamin Foulois, made the first reconnaissance flight into Mexico on 15 March 1916. Throughout the rest of March and early April they <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> deep into Mexico to observe troop movements and fly dispatches to other bases. Upon the completion of his work in Mexico he remained with the 1st Aero Squadron and was promoted to major in May 1917.|$|E

5|$|On 5 August 1945, Tibbets {{formally}} {{named his}} B-29 Enola Gay after his mother. Enola Gay had been personally selected by him {{while it was}} still on the assembly line at the Glenn L. Martin Company plant in Bellevue, Nebraska. The regularly assigned aircraft commander, Robert A. Lewis, was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious {{when he arrived at the}} aircraft on the morning of August 6 to see the aircraft he considered his painted with the now-famous nose art. Lewis <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> the mission as Tibbets's co-pilot.|$|E
5|$|They decided Sverdrup <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> with Miller in XPBS-1 from Nouméa to Suva, Fiji, Sverdrup's headquarters, {{with the}} Southern Seas following. He arrived in Sydney on 30 December. In January 1942 Sverdrup signed a cost-plus-fixed-fee {{contract}} to provide architectural and engineering services to US Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA). The contract remained in force until 15 May, {{when it was}} terminated by mutual agreement and Sverdrup & Parcel employees in Australia became civilian employees of the US Army. On 16 April, Sverdrup boarded {{the first of a}} series of aircraft that would return him to the United States.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, the {{services}} were gradually {{taken over by}} Lufttransport, who used both small aircraft and helicopters. These gradually became more regular and became de facto scheduled services every fortnight. Lufttransport replaced the helicopter service with a two-engine five-seat aircraft in 1989, which cut the cost of transport significantly. In 1993, Widerøe established itself at Svalbard Airport and flew services to Ny-Ålesund, but this only lasted the one season. In 1996, Lufttransport and Kings Bay made an agreement that the airline <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> once per week during the winter and up to five times per week during the summer. The airline would use a Dornier Do 228, which was also used for flights from Longyearbyen to Svea Airport for Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani.|$|E

5|$|HB1001 {{made its}} first flight on 1December1977 {{at the hands of}} Lockheed test pilot, Bill Park. He <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> the next four sorties, all chased by a T-38 piloted by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ken Dyson. Dyson, an F-15 Eagle pilot, was {{previously}} approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976. He made his first flight on HB1001 on 17January1978, chased by Park. In fact, the two would be the only test pilots of Have Blue, alternating between the demonstrator and the chase plane. Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW system. At the same time, they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft's behavior.|$|E
5|$|Like ale, aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, {{such a man}} would fall into a trance, and his spirit <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> out of his body toward the clouds as if his spirit were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the damage was done to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought ale using plough beams. In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), {{and for this reason}} people would not hurt these snakes.|$|E
5|$|On October 7, 1908, Edith Berg, {{the wife}} of the brothers' European {{business}} agent, became the first American woman passenger when she flew with Wilbur—one of many passengers who rode with him that autumn. Wilbur also became acquainted with Léon Bollée and his family. Bollée was the owner of an automobile factory where Wilbur would assemble the Flyer and where he would be provided with hired assistance. Bollée <b>would</b> <b>fly</b> that autumn with Wilbur. Madame Bollée had been in the latter stages of pregnancy when Wilbur arrived in LeMans in June 1908 to assemble the Flyer. Wilbur promised her that he would make his first European flight the day her baby was born which he did, August 8, 1908.|$|E

The BEA subsequently categorized the accident as a Controlled Flight Into Terrain, where an airworthy plane unintentionally flown into terrain. Several findings revealed that the crew were fatigued and there was no Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) to alert the crew that they <b>would</b> <b>flew</b> into terrain.|$|R
