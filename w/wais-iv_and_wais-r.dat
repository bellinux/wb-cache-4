As part of the standardization of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Fourth Edition (<b>WAIS-IV)</b> <b>and</b> Wechsler Memory Scale–Fourth Edition (WMS-IV), participants completed the Texas Functional Living Scale (TFLS), a measure of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. The relationships between TFLS <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-IV</b> <b>and</b> WMS-IV were examined in both normally developing and clinical samples.

40|$|Since {{publication}} in 1982, the 50 -item National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson, 1982; NART–R; Nelson & Willison, 1991) {{has remained a}} widely adopted method for estimating premorbid intelligence both for clinical and research purposes. However, the NART has not been standardised against the most recent revisions of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III (1997) <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-IV</b> (2008)). Our objective, therefore, was to produce reliable standardised estimates of WAIS-IV IQ from the NART. Ninety-two neurologically healthy British adults were assessed and regression equations calculated to produce population estimates of WAIS-IV full-scale IQ (FSIQ) and constituent index scores. Results showed strong NART/WAIS-IV FSIQ correlations with more moderate correlations observed between NART error and constituent index scores.

The differences in performance on the WISC-R <b>and</b> the <b>WAIS-R</b> were investigated for the total group, for the Gifted students and for the Educable Mentally Handicapped students. WISC-R <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-R</b> were administered individually by school psychologist interns and a school psychologist. The reliability coefficients for all subtests on both Wechsler instruments were obtained through split-half correlations and were corrected by the Spearman Brown formula. Subtests not included were Digit span and Coding for the WISC-R and Digit Span and Digit Symbol for the WAIS-R. Pearson product moment correlational coefficients were computed for corresponding subtests and IQ scores for the WISC-R <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-R.</b> Spearman-Rho correlational analysis was computed for assessing the mean subtest scores for the WISC-R <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-R.</b> WAIS-R scores for the 28 subjects were compared on all three IQ scales with the WISC-R.

40|$|A {{matched samples}} design was {{employed}} to compare WAIS <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-R</b> IQ in UK subjects. The WAIS yielded significantly higher mean Full Scale, Verbal and Performance IQs. The mean differences were 7. 5, 6. 4 and 7. 9 IQ points respectively. The WAIS <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-R</b> samples were broadly representative of the UK adult population in terms of age, sex and social class distribution, and therefore provide tentative estimates of population mean scores for both Wechsler scales. Mean WAIS IQ was 108. 6, suggesting that the WAIS yields inflated IQ scores in the contemporary UK copulation.

40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} the test-retest stability of a standardized version of Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s (1976) Modified Card Sorting Test (MCST) and its relationships with demographic variables {{in a sample}} of healthy older adults. Design. A standard card order and administration were devised for the MCST and administered to participants at an initial assessment, and again at a second session conducted a minimum of six months later in order to examine its test-retest stability. Participants were also administered the WAIS-R at initial assessment in order to provide a measure of psychometric intelligence. Methods. Thirty-six (24 female, 12 male) healthy older adults aged 52 to 77 years with mean education 12. 42 years (SD = 3. 53) completed the MCST on two occasions approximately 7. 5 months (SD = 1. 61) apart. Stability coefficients and test-retest differences were calculated for the range of scores. The effect of gender on MCST performance was examined. Correlations between MCST scores and age, education <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-R</b> IQs were also determined. Results. Stability coefficients ranged from. 26 for the percent perseverative errors measure to. 49 for the failure to maintain set measure.

METHODS:An electronic literature search was performed to find studies comparing cognitive performance in MDDP versus MDD. A meta-analysis of broad cognitive domains (processing speed, reasoning/problem solving, verbal learning, visual learning, attention/working memory) and individual cognitive tasks was conducted on all included studies (n= 12). Demographic and clinical features were investigated via meta-regression analysis as moderators of cognitive performance. RESULTS:No difference in socio-demographic and clinical variables was detected between groups. In general, a poorer cognitive performance was detected in MDDP versus MDD subjects (ES= 0. 38), with a greater effect size in drug-free patients (ES= 0. 69). MDDP patients were more impaired in verbal learning (ES= 0. 67), visual learning (ES= 0. 62) and processing speed (ES= 0. 71) tasks.

INTRODUCI’ION With the publication of its British Supplement (Lea, 1986). it is to be expected that the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R; Wechsler, 1981) will become the major instrument for the assessment of intellectual abilities and deficits in the U.

An important question for psychologists who have begun to use the British WAIS-R as a replacement for its predecessor the WAIS (Wechsler. 1955. Saville, 1971) is whether the two scales yield comparable IQ scores. The need to examine this issue arises from the work of Flynn (1984), who has demonstrated that, in the United States, successive IQ test standardisation samples have consistently established norms of a higher standard than their predecessors.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The goal of {{the current}} {{meta-analysis}} was to review and examine in detail the features of cognitive performance in psychotic (MDDP) versus non-psychotic (MDD) major depressive disorder. METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed to find studies comparing cognitive performance in MDDP versus MDD. A meta-analysis of broad cognitive domains (processing speed, reasoning/problem solving, verbal learning, visual learning, attention/working memory) and individual cognitive tasks was conducted on all included studies (n= 12). Demographic and clinical features were investigated via meta-regression analysis as moderators of cognitive performance. RESULTS: No difference in socio-demographic and clinical variables was detected between groups. In general, a poorer cognitive performance was detected in MDDP versus MDD subjects (ES= 0. 38), with a greater effect size in drug-free patients (ES= 0. 69). MDDP patients were more impaired in verbal learning (ES= 0. 67), visual learning (ES= 0. 62) and processing speed (ES= 0. 71) tasks. A significantly poorer performance was also detected in MDDP patients for individual tasks as Trail Making Test A, WAIS-R digit span backward <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-R</b> digit symbol.

CONCLUSION: In line with previous meta-analyses, our findings seem to support an association between psychosis and cognitive deficits in the context of affective disorders. Psychosis during the course of MDD is associated with poorer cognitive performance in some specific cognitive domains, such as visual and verbal learning and executive functions...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to assess the role of response time on the Category Test of the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery (HRNB). The intent was to define the underlying constructs of the Category Test more particularly, the speed of performance by examining response time to individual slides of the Category Test. Seventy-two normal adult volunteers were administered the complete HRNB. Average response times were computed for correct (CRT), incorrect (IRT), and total (TRT) scores on the Category Test. The efficacy of using response measures (CRT, IRT, and TRT) to predict Category performance was examined in the context of other HRNB variables that loaded factorially with the Category Test, more specifically: TPT-time, memory, and location, Trails B, <b>WAIS-R</b> Block Design, <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-R</b> Object Assembly. A step-wise multiple regression analysis was computed using the above HRNB and response time measures to predict Category error scores. Results from this analysis indicated that TPT-location, TRT, and IRT contributed significantly (p<. 05) in the prediction of Category scores. Approximately 15 % of the variability in Category scores was explained by a measure of spatial memory (TPT-location) and an additional 15 % was accounted for by psycho-motor speed (TRT and IRT). The significant contribution of response time in defining the underlying construct of the Category Test was discussed in terms of possible implications for enhancing the neuropsychological significance of the Category Test.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{can lead}} to diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) and cognitive deficits that manifest as peripheral and central neuropathy, respectively. In this study we investigated the relationship between visuospatial working memory (VSWM) capacity and DPN severity, and attempted to improve VSWM in DPN patients via the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Sixteen DPN patients and sixteen age- and education-matched healthy control subjects received Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (<b>WAIS-IV)</b> <b>and</b> Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) for baseline cognitive assessment. A forward- and backward-recall computerized Corsi block tapping task (CBT), both with and without a concurrent motor interference task {{was used to measure}} VSWM capacity. Each DPN patient underwent a pre-treatment CBT, followed by tDCS or sham treatment, then a post-treatment CBT on two separate days. We found that although patients with severe DPN (Dyck’s grade 2 a or 2 b) showed comparable general intelligence scores on WAIS-IV as their age- and education-matched healthy counterparts, they nonetheless showed mild cognitive impairment on MOCA and working memory deficit on digit-span test of WAIS-IV. Furthermore, patients’ peripheral nerve conduction velocity (NCV) was positively correlated with their VSWM span in the most difficult CBT condition that involved backward-recall with motor interference such that patients with worse NCV also had lower VSWM span. Most importantly, anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC was able to improve low-performing patients’ VSWM span to be on par with the high-performers, thereby eliminating the correlation between NCV and VSWM. In summary, these findings suggest that 1) mild cognitive impairment and severe peripheral neuropathy can coexist with unequal severity in diabetic patients, 2) the positive correlation of VSWM and NCV suggests a link between peripheral and central neuropathies and 3) anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC can improve DPN patients’ VSWM, particularly for the low-performing patients...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cognitive {{impairment}} {{associated with}} temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) {{has been recognized}} in multiple studies. We designed this study to find a specific cognitive profile in patients with TLE who were candidates for epilepsy surgery. We also sought to find if neuropsychological assessment could differentiate left TLE, right TLE and normal subjects. METHODS: The sample of this study consisted of 29 patients with right TLE, 31 with left TLE, and 32 subjects without history of seizure as the control group. For all recruited patients and controls, demographic questionnaire, Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS-III) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-R (WAIS-R) were administered. Multivariate {{analysis of variance was}} carried out to reveal differences in memory and intelligence performance between the three groups. RESULTS: All of the mean scores of the WMS-III indexes were significantly higher in the control group in comparison with the right or the left TLE groups (p < 0. 001). There were not any significant differences between mean scores of WMS-III indexes of {{the right and the left}}. The WAIS-R also showed significantly better mean scores of full scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and performance intelligence quotient (PIQ) in the control groups than both of the right and left TLE patients (p < 0. 001). Although the verbal intelligence quotient (VIQ) mean scores were significantly different between the left TLE and the control group (p = 0. 037), there were not any significant differences between the right TLE patients and the control group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that WMS-III <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-R</b> can differentiate patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy from normal subjects.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the <b>WAIS-IV</b> <b>and</b> how the changes to the test may impact the measure 2 ̆ 7 s usefulness in neuropsychological evaluations. It was hypothesized that the WAIS-IV would be a significantly better predictor of performance on the neuropsychological measures of the Category Test, Finger Tapping Test, Trail Making Test, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test over the WAIS-III. The mixed clinical sample came from an archival database of volunteer research participants and individuals clinically referred to a university outpatient facility. A total of 91 participants were administered the WAIS-III <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-IV</b> {{as part of a}} larger neuropsychological battery. The results of the current study found that both the WAIS-III <b>and</b> the <b>WAIS-IV</b> were able to account for a significant amount of the variance in performance on the neuropsychological measures, with the exception of the FTT dominant and non-dominant hands, where only the WAIS-IV was able to significantly account for the variance in performance on the measures. Using the Alf and Graf (1999) model, there were no significant R 2 differences between the WAIS-III subtests <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-IV</b> at the. 01 significance level. Thus, the WAIS-IV did not provide a better model for predicting performance on any of the neuropsychological measures. It should be noted that the small sample size of the current study may have inflated the R 2, particularly in the WAIS-III models, which could have masked greater R 2 differences between the two models. While the publishers endeavored to make the WAIS-IV a better measure of processing speed, working memory, and fluid reasoning, these goals were largely unmet. The analyses of the WAIS-IV working memory subtests, showed that the sequencing component added to the Digit Span subtest did not add to the relationship with neuropsychological measures with working memory components. The analyses of the WAIS-IV processing speed subtests showed that the Coding subtest of the WAIS-IV was a better measure of processing speed than the WAIS-III version, but this was not found for the PSI as a whole. Changes to Symbol Search did not show any improvement in the relationship to neuropsychological measures. One interesting finding was that the new subtest of Visual Puzzles does appear to add to the relationship with neuropsychological measures over the other subtests of the WAIS-IV. Visual Puzzles was consistently the highest correlated PRI subtest with the neuropsychological measures, with the exception of the WCST. The subtest appears to assess a wide range of abilities outside of the spatial reasoning skills purported by the test publishers. Specifically, the subtest was correlated with measures of processing speed, executive skills, and motor speed/reaction time. Thus, clinicians should use caution and examine all possible options when evaluating poor performance on this new subtest. Since none of the WAIS-IV models were able to significantly predict performance on any of the neuropsychological measures over the WAIS-III models, it would appear that the WAIS-IV as a whole is not a better neuropsychological measure than its predecessor. Despite being the gold standard for intellectual assessment, the WAIS-IV appears to add little to clinical utility over the WAIS-III outside of shorter administrative time. Clinicians are advised to continue using neuropsychological measures to assess processing speed, working memory, and higher order cognitive skills in conjunction with the WAIS...|$|R

No {{significant differences were found between}} WAIS <b>and</b> <b>WAIS-R</b> mean Full Scale IQs (121. 60 and 118. 69, respectively) although this is thought to be due in large part to the 2 : 1 ratio of practiced to unpracticed subjects in the presence of a strong test by practice interaction. Evidence is presented to suggest that the WAIS-R may, in fact, yield significantly lower Full Scale IQ scores. Estimates of the magnitude of that difference are also provided. Significant practice effects were found with the largest gains made by subjects practiced on the other test. The test by practice interaction, thought to confound Latin Square designs in many previous studies, was also found statistically significant for the Full Scale IQ scores. The WAIS Full Scale IQ appeared to be practice-resistant, while that of the WAIS-R was not. At the scaled score level of analysis, the test by practice interaction decremented considerably, and several scaled scores demonstrated significant test effects. Significant gender differences were found, but due to the voluntary nature of the sample, were not believed to be interpretable as effects of interest. According to several other criteria, the two tests appeared to be surprisingly comparable. They demonstrated parallel profiles, particularly among verbal subscales.
