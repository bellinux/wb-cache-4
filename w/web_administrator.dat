Only one vulnerability that hide in web source code, {{it is possible for}} external party breaking the web system. Moreover, because of misunderstanding, some of web developers concern about network than source code, and some of them think that security is <b>web</b> <b>administrator</b> job. So, this research tried to test the security of web technology for representing the results when web developers are imaware of web security.

40|$|Our final {{project is}} a fully-customizable and free web-based forum {{for the sale of}} goods. The {{intended}} use of the software is to provide universities and other online communities a website where members can sell, buy, and search for various items ranging from electronics, furniture, textbooks, apartments, or sublets. Through a simple and easy to use form, students can post items and upload a picture of the item. Students can also later go back and edit or remove their post from the system. The main feature of our software is customizability. Customizability is provided in both the front and back end of our software. On the back-end, our software allows the <b>web</b> <b>administrator</b> to customize the underlying database that the website is built upon through a simple online tool. The <b>web</b> <b>administrator</b> can customize the website by adding whatever categories they would like, such as textbooks or computers. He or she can add whatever attributes they would like for each category, such as price and description. These attributes are the fields that will appear in the forms for posting an item in that specific category.

40|$|A {{large number}} of web {{applications}} {{is based on a}} relational database together with a program, typically a script, that enables the user to interact with the database through embedded SQL queries and commands. In this paper, we introduce a method for formal automated verification of such systems which connects database theory to mainstream program analysis. We identify a fragment of SQL which captures the behavior of the queries in our case studies, is algorithmically decidable, and facilitates the construction of weakest preconditions. Thus, we can integrate the analysis of SQL queries into a program analysis tool chain. To this end, we implement a new decision procedure for the SQL fragment that we introduce. We demonstrate practical applicability of our results with three case studies, a <b>web</b> <b>administrator,</b> a simple firewall, and a conference management system. Comment: 25 page...|$|E

These activities are depending highly on Web server and maintaining good server security has been a requirement for avoiding any malicious attacks especially web defacements and malware. <b>Web</b> server <b>administrators</b> should be alert and attentive {{to the status of}} the server at all time.
