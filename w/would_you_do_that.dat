2500|$|The Blackhawks {{have worked}} with the American Indian Center to help educate their {{community}} and fan base by sharing Native American culture and history. Scott Sypolt, executive counsel for the American Indian Center, commented on the logo and name controversy: Joe Podlasek, {{the executive director of}} the American Indian Center of Chicago, commented on their relationship, stating, [...] " [...] are far and away ahead of everyone else in forward-thinking. What they have done is engaged the community. In the other cities (organizations) want nothing to do with native people but yet they're trying to say they respect us." [...] However, this stance is markedly different from the one taken by the American Indian Center up until recent years. In 2010, Joe Podlasek stated that, [...] "The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks logo to change. For us, that's one of our grandfathers. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with your grandfather's picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on it and dance on it?" [...] John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position may be tied to contributions the team has recently begun making to the center: [...] "We all do contributions, but we don't do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something we've done that's offensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E

5000|$|In October 2007, Variety {{reported}} that Naomi Watts would star in Universal's {{remake of the}} film, which would be directed by Casino Royale director Martin Campbell. The production would be a joint venture by Platinum Dunes and Mandalay Pictures. Hedren stated her opposition to the remake, saying, [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> Why? I mean, can't we find new stories, new things to do?" [...] However, since 2007, development has been stalled. On June 16, 2009, Brad Fuller of Dimension Films stated that no further developments had taken place, commenting, [...] "We keep trying, but I don't know." [...] Eventually, in December 2009, Martin Campbell was replaced as director by Dennis Iliadis.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{publicity}} material that {{appeared at the}} time of its release in August 1918, Triple Trouble represented a new wrinkle in Essanay's strategy: [...] "If you bought a piece of real estate and foresaw that its value <b>would</b> quadruple if <b>you</b> held it a certain length of time, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> <b>That's</b> just what we did with Triple Trouble. ... We knew there would come a time when it would be worth many times its weight in gold. We held this negative in our vaults for the most opportune time of release, which we believe is NOW." [...] Such hyperbole is somewhat disingenuous; in 1915, Chaplin had begun work on Life, his first feature-length comedy, but the studio had stepped in and stopped the production as Chaplin was taking too long—what they really needed was one-reel subjects to fill then voracious public demand for Chaplin's work.|$|R

Those {{traditional}} cauldrons have no humanity about them at all; they're just vast, bombastic pieces that weight fifty tons. We wanted something that had some humanity and warmth about it rather than shock and awe. It's a key moment in the opening ceremony, and it's what all the other events are leading up to.

5000|$|Dylan {{never forgot}} his {{debt to the}} Clancys, {{which is why he}} invited them to perform at his 30th anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden. It was Dylan's wish that the party after the concert be held at Tommy Makem's Irish Pavilion, a Manhattan pub owned by Makem. At the {{exclusive}} party, attended by George Harrison and Eric Clapton among others, Liam Clancy tentatively asked Dylan if he would mind if the Clancys recorded an album of his songs, arranged in a traditional Irish style. Far from minding, Dylan was flattered by the idea: [...] "Man, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> Would you?" [...] He added, [...] "Liam, you don't realize, do you, man? You're my fucking hero." [...] Although the group never made an entire album of Dylan's music, two of his songs, [...] "When the Ship Comes In" [...] and [...] "Rambin' Gamblin' Willie", appeared on the final Clancy Brothers album, Older But No Wiser, three years later. The 1997 eponymous Clancy, O'Connell, and Clancy album also contained a Dylan number, [...] "Restless Farewell".|$|E

He pressures his wife Trudy to visit her ex-boyfriend Charlie Fiddich, her first lover, who now works in publishing, to get him to publish a story that Pete has written. Their meeting goes awkwardly, with him trying to start an affair with Trudy, but Trudy resists his advances, and thus he only agrees to publish the story in Boys' Life. Upon hearing the news, Pete is outraged, saying that his story was good enough for The New Yorker and that Trudy should have done whatever it took to get him published there.

40|$|Why {{on earth}} <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> For generations this {{question}} has been asked of adolescents by bewildered adults {{in the home and}} classroom. In the Middle: The adolescent brain, behaviour and learning seeks to answer this question by looking at the latest empirical evidence related to the maturing adolescent brain. Over the last couple of decades neuroscience has provided us with exciting insights into how the brain develops and matures. Significantly, some of the latest research suggests that adolescent behaviour is not just about hormones or nurturing, but is also influenced by changes in the brain as it matures and restructures itself. Following on from his work looking at early brain development, Dr Nagel provides a continuing journey into the developing brain and mind with a degree of clarity to be appreciated by educators, health professionals and parents alike.
