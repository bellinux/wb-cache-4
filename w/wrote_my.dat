5|$|Julie Couillard {{began dating}} Conservative Party of Canada Member of Parliament Maxime Bernier in April 2007. The media started {{covering}} her in August, when {{she wore a}} revealing dress to Bernier's swearing-in ceremony for his new position as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The couple had first met at a restaurant-dinner with business associates. Couillard and Bernier dated until December 2007 but continued seeing each other until April 2008. Their relationship {{became the subject of}} a political scandal which brought about intense media attention. As the scandal unfolded, Couillard decided to write an autobiography, telling her side of the story. She formally signed a contract in July with publishers, McClelland & Stewart; {{and with the help of}} journalist, Serge Demers, a ghostwriter, she <b>wrote</b> <b>My</b> Story in French within a few months. The publisher translated the text into English.|$|E

In addition, he reflects on the history of his family, a prominent Afrikaner clan that migrated to the Cape in the 17th century and included Daniel François Malan, the South African Prime Minister who was a principal ideological force behind Apartheid doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The Kanins <b>wrote</b> <b>My</b> Pal Gus (1952) {{in which}} Richard Widmark becomes {{a good father}} and {{falls in love with}} Joanne Dru, the Elizabeth Taylor film Rhapsody (1954) and The Opposite Sex (1956), a musical remake of The Women. But it was the Oscar-nominated script for Teacher's Pet (1958) for which they are best remembered, a film about a self-made {{newspaper}} editor Clark Gable who has a love-hate relationship with journalism teacher Doris Day. The film almost did not get made since the Kanins were not under any studio contract, and having shopped the script around without attracting any interest, it was only after a rewrite inspired by Garson Kanin's Born Yesterday that producer Bill Perlberg and director George Seaton purchased it.|$|E

When I asked for permission to use the text I was refused, which was disappointing. I then <b>wrote</b> <b>my</b> own lyrics for the song, although I felt that the original idea had been more interesting. Well, I'm not James Joyce am I? When I came to work on this project I thought I would ask for permission again and this time they said yes." ...|$|E

500|$|Bob Mercer {{felt that}} Bush's {{relative}} lack of success in the United States compared {{to the rest of}} the world was due to her music being a poor fit for American radio formats, and that there were no outlets for the visual presentation central to Bush's appeal. EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with NME magazine in 1982 Bush criticised this marketing technique, stating: [...] "People weren't even generally aware that I <b>wrote</b> <b>my</b> own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body." [...] In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, Lionheart, to take advantage of the success of The Kick Inside. Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with Lionheart, feeling that she had needed more time to get it right. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. While it had spawned several hit singles, most notably [...] "Wow", it did not garner the same reception as her first album, reaching number six in the UK album charts.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{composition}} begun after Strange Music label-mate ¡Mayday! sent Tech N9ne {{the song}} with their and Kendall Morgan's vocals on it. He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I <b>wrote</b> <b>my</b> verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot. But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Morton Feldman's I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg was {{inspired}} by a vision he had of the dead Heine as he walked through Heine's old neighborhood in Paris: [...] "One early morning in Paris I was walking along the small street on the Left Bank where Delacroix's studio is, just as {{it was more than a}} century ago. I'd read his journals, where he tells of Chopin, going for a drive, the poet Heine dropping in, a refugee from Germany. Nothing had changed in the street. And I saw Heine up at the corner, walking toward me. He almost reached me. I had this intense feeling for him, you know, the Jewish exile. I saw him. Then I went back to my place and <b>wrote</b> <b>my</b> work, I Met Heine on the Rue Fürstemberg." ...|$|E

[...] Because he did not believe it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in The Washington Post until October 12, 2003: [...] "I <b>wrote</b> <b>my</b> October story because I did not think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by {{trying to get me to}} stop writing about Wilson.

2500|$|Many {{critics have}} noted that Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch series (first {{published}} in 1974 by Allison & Busby), {{is set in a}} school for girls, [...] "Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches", reminiscent of Hogwarts. The story concerns an awkward pupil at a boarding-school for witches, who faces a scheming rival student. Her professors include a kindly and elderly headmistress and a bullying, raven-haired potions teacher. Murphy has commented on her frustration at constant comparisons between her work and Harry Potter: [...] "It's irritating … everyone asks the same question and I even get children writing to ask me whether I mind about the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and pointing out similarities. Even worse are reviewers who come across my books, or see the TV series, and, without taking the trouble to find out that it's now over quarter of a century since I <b>wrote</b> <b>my</b> first book, make pointed remarks about 'clever timing' – or say things like 'the Worst Witch stories are not a million miles from J K Rowling's books'. The implications are really quite insulting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Raphael was subpoenaed as {{a witness}} by the Daily Star when Jeffrey Archer sued it over a story that he had consorted with a prostitute, Monica Coghlan. Raphael was a crucial witness as the Observer’s {{political}} editor. When the story broke in the News of the World, he rang Archer, who was then Vice-Chairman of the Conservative Party and asked him whether it was true. Archer replied that he had only met Monica ‘on only one occasion’ {{and that he had}} been disgracefully set up by the paper. This evidence was central to the subsequent libel trial. The judge, Bernie Cornfield described Raphael as ‘a thorn in Archer’s side’ but the jury chose to believe Archer that he had never met Monica and awarded him £500,000 in damages. In the middle of the trial, Raphael was attacked by the editor of the Mail on Sunday, Stewart Steven, for having betrayed Archer as a source. This led to another libel action which ended with the Mail on Sunday paying Raphael £40,000 in costs and damages. Shortly after the Archer trial, Raphael <b>wrote</b> <b>My</b> Learned Friends (1989) in which he alleged that the jury had been misled by Archer’s alibi witnesses. It took another decade for the truth to emerge. In 1999, Raphael wrote an article in The Economist which said that Archer had asked him to change his evidence and that he had lied about where he had been on the night he met Monica. Two years later in 2001 Archer was tried for perjury and jailed for four years.|$|E
