50|$|One of {{the first}} of these {{mixtures}} was produced by Rawlplug and was composed of dry white asbestos fibres, sold loose in a tin. The user wetted some into a ball (usually by spitting on them) and pushed this plug of putty into the hole. A small tamper and spike was supplied with the kit. This putty worked very well, but the hazard of the asbestos fibres means that the product is no longer available. However, another way to fix wall plugs is accomplished by the application of a cotton woven pad which has been impregnated with a special formulated gypsum to bond into the wall. The pad is wetted and wrapped around the wall plug, and the two are inserted into the hole; after a short time it hardens and a strong bond is achieved and the <b>wall</b> <b>fitting</b> can be applied. It is used in combination with wall plugs in masonry, ceramic, wood and plasterboard walls.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} enclosure {{design for}} SEED-Config using {{an example from}} “Architectural Details for Insulated Buildings” (Brand 90). We develop enclosures for insulated buildings {{in terms of the}} functional units that specify them, the technologies that implement them and the design units that describe them. Brand gives details in eight series (A-H), in each series he describes a specific detailing system. We base our exposition on series A to E: these share the property of the <b>wall</b> <b>fitting</b> partially under the roof and floor slabs. In series F and G the wall stands clear of the slabs and this would require a different approach to detailing from a very high level. Series H is a compendium of special cases that we do not discuss here at all. We conclude with a discussion of what our enclosure design example implies for the representation and computational engine of SEED-Config. We chose insulated enclosures as our example for a specific reason: Brandis treatment of them is proximate to the fundamental approach we take in SEED. Brand wrote in clear, rule-like terms that progress from the abstract to the specific. He explicitly links each part of every detail to the function it fulfills...|$|E
40|$|Automatic 3 D {{building}} reconstruction {{has been}} a hot research area; a task which has been done manually even up today. Automating the task of building reconstruction enables more applications where up to date information is of great importance. This thesis proposes a system to extract parametric buildings and trees from dense aerial stereo image data. The method developed for the tree identification and parameterization is a totally new approach which have yielded great results. The focus has been to extract the data {{in such a way}} that small flying platforms can use it for navigational purposes. The degree of simplification is therefor high. The building parameterization part starts with identifying roof faces by Region Growing random seeds in the digital surface model (DSM) until a coverage threshold is met. For each roof face a plane is fitted using a Least Square approach. The actual parameterization is started with calculating the intersection between the roof faces. Given the nature of 2. 5 D DSM data there is no possibility to perform <b>wall</b> <b>fitting.</b> Therefor all the walls will be constructed with a 2 D line Hough transform of the border data of all the roof faces. The tree parameterization is done by searching for possible roof face topologies resembling the signature of a tree. For each possible tree topology a second degree polynomial surface is fitted to the DSM data covered by the faces in the topology. By looking at the parameters of the fitted polynomial it is then possible to determine if it is a tree or not. All the extraction steps were implemented and evaluated in Matlab, all algorithms have been described, discussed and  motivated in the thesis...|$|E

50|$|Beginning in 1968, Knoebel {{was one of}} {{the first}} Beuys {{students}} to use photography as an independent artistic medium. For his Innenprojektionen (Interior Projections; 1968-1970) black-and-white photographs, he started using empty slide projections, creating empty squares of light, projected on a wall or in a darkened, closed-off room. This later evolved to his placing slides covered in copy ink with precisely carved vertical and horizontal lines into the projector and then cast throughout the room. Projecting these lines at various angles throughout a darkened space, at windows, corners, <b>wall</b> <b>fittings</b> and architectural irregularities, offered limitless possibilities for the artist. Knoebel documented these light projections with his camera and displayed the variations in large grids, often with as many as 80 photographs comprising a single work. Knoebel’s 1968 Projektion 1, is a series of luminous, disorienting black-and-white photographs of light projections that bring to mind the architectural slicings that Gordon Matta-Clark was conducting at that time. Projection X (1970-71) and Projektion X Remake (2005), two versions of the same video concept, are his only videotapes based on these outdoor projections. During a nocturnal drive through the sleeping city of Darmstadt, a large, luminous X-shaped beam of light is projected from the vehicle onto the walls of buildings.|$|R

The transient temperature field which was generated by the three oxy-hydrogen flame guns was used to simulate the transient high temperature field inside the engine wall. The simulated inner wall surface temperature curves of the engine could be got by the curve fitting extrapolation of temperature sensor and the infrared thermometer respectively, which show good agreement in the overall trend and at the peak point, and verify the correctness of the extrapolation model and method.

40|$|Reducing heating {{costs is}} an {{important}} concern for householders, but many conventional methods of cutting down heating costs, such as insulating lofts and cavity <b>walls</b> and <b>fitting</b> double glazing, involve considerable capital outlay. An effective way of reducing heat losses {{with a minimum of}} capital outlay is to fit reflecting metal foil behind the central heating radiators, but little has been done to measure the amount of energy saved in this way. Similarly, a foil layer can be used to reduce heat losses from beneath suspended floors, but little data are available on its effectiveness. Work is reported here on experiments carried out in an environmental chamber to measure the effect on heat losses of metal foils behind radiators and beneath suspended floors. Reductions in the overall energy consumption of the room of up to 6 % were recorded by installing foil behind a radiator, while the heat loss through the area of wall immediately behind the radiator fell to less than 30 % of the original value. The heat loss from a suspended timber floor was reduced by up to 48 % when foil was applied to its under surface. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present two methods for the {{quantitative}} {{measurement of the}} thickness of ferroelectric domain walls, one using high-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) and the other weak beam transmission electron microscopy (WBTEM). These techniques {{can be used to}} determine the thickness of domain walls at room temperature as well as close to the ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition. The first method allows a direct visualization of the lattice distortion across the domain wall, by measuring the continuous deviation of a set of planes with respect to the undistorted lattice. The second method consists in a quantitative analysis of the thickness fringes that appear on weak beam images of inclined domain <b>walls.</b> By <b>fitting</b> simulated fringe profiles to experimental ones, we can extract the thickness of the domain walls in a quantitative way. These two complementary techniques lead to a complete characterization of the thickness of ferroelectric domain walls over a wide range of specimen thicknesses at different magnifications. As an example we apply these methods to ferroelectric domain walls in PbTiO 3 The domain wall thickness at room temperature is found to be 1. 5 ± 0. 3 nm using HREM (in very thin samples≈ 10 nm) and 2. 1 ± 0. 7 nm using WBTEM (in samples thicker than 30 nm...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that tokamaks display a second region of {{stability}} to ideal magnetohydro-dynamic (MHD) internal modes. An important determining factor for MHD properties is the radial profile of toroidal current. Here it is shown that in a low aspect ratio toka-mak with high on-axis safety factor (qo ~ 2) and high shear a path to high beta can be obtained that remains completely stable against ideal MHD modes. By maintaining high shear this scenario avoids fixed boundary instabilities for both high and low toroidal mode numbers for beta values well above the Troyon limit (stability was tested up to c = 1. 4, Q = 10. 8 %).
