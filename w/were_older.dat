5|$|By the 18th century, {{four types}} of {{midshipman}} existed: midshipman (original rating), midshipman extraordinary, midshipman (apprentice officer), and midshipman ordinary.

By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.|$|E

5|$|The {{possibility}} that the Hawaiian islands became older as one moved to the northwest was suspected by ancient Hawaiians long before Europeans arrived. During their voyages, seafaring Hawaiians noticed differences in erosion, soil formation, and vegetation, allowing them to deduce that the islands to the northwest (Niihau and Kauai) <b>were</b> <b>older</b> than those to the southeast (Maui and Hawaii). The idea was handed down the generations through the legend of Pele, the fiery Hawaiian Goddess of Volcanoes.|$|E
5|$|Alonso and Arteta were {{ambitious and}} dreamed of playing {{alongside}} each other for Real Sociedad when they <b>were</b> <b>older.</b> Though they attended different schools, the two young players joined forces at the local youth side Antiguoko, playing games at the weekend.

Alonso's move to Real Sociedad, however, was not a companionless one, as his older brother Mikel, who had also become an adept player, had joined the club one year earlier.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} of Operation Overlord, German forces were of an unknown {{quantity}} and quality, but the division would be confronted by elements of Germany's 711th Infantry Division, {{a part of the}} 15th Army. The 711th was composed of the 731st and the 744th Grenadier Infantry Regiments, together with artillery and other supporting arms. Even before the invasion the German division had not been considered a front line formation, but rather a static division on anti-invasion duties, and many of its units had not been at full strength. Furthermore, many of its troops <b>were</b> <b>older</b> than was normal in a first line division, or were conscripted foreigners from Poland and Russia. Being a static division, it was hampered further by having almost no transport of its own, and what was available was mostly horse drawn.|$|E

5|$|In August 1728, Linnaeus {{decided to}} attend Uppsala University {{on the advice}} of Rothman, who {{believed}} it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they <b>were</b> <b>older</b> and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, {{which was one of the}} richest botanical libraries in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Lukić {{notes that}} the {{mortality}} rate among the children at Jastrebarsko was much {{lower than that of}} children at Stara Gradiška and Sisak for two reasons.

More importantly, that from the end of July, twenty-six volunteer nurses from the teachers' school at Rude near Samobor, along with several doctors and other medical personnel, under the leadership of Marinić, began to intervene with the camp administration and Ustaše guards to improve the health of the children. The Ustaše propaganda soon took advantage of the improved condition of the children.|$|E
5|$|Robert was {{probably}} one of the sons of Gilbert de Gant, who is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Gilbert was from Flanders and came to England during 1069. Gilbert, who died around 1095, was married to Alice, daughter of Hugh de Montfort. Robert's conjectured siblings were Emma– wife of Alan de Percy, Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle, Gilbert de Gant– who died before his father, and Walter de Gant. If Robert was a son of Gilbert, he was a younger son, probably the youngest of the four brothers, and probably was born sometime around 1085, as his supposed parents married about 1075 and there <b>were</b> <b>older</b> siblings. Robert is often confused in the historical records with another Robert, son of Walter. Robert {{was probably}} also the uncle of Gilbert de Gant, later Earl of Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{insurance system}} devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, {{and when the}} number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they <b>were</b> <b>older.</b> There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (roughly equivalent to $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E
5|$|By N42 and S89 the equestrian parade {{is at an}} end, and the {{following}} 16 figures on the north and 18 on the south are taken to be the elders of Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art.

No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107–114, N20–28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the lyre) and four aulos (flute) players. N16–19 and S115–118 (conjectured) perhaps, as hydriaphoroi, the water-vessel carriers, here men, rather than metic girls mentioned {{in the literature on}} the Panathenaia. N13–15, S119–121 are the skaphephoroi, the tray bearers of the honeycombs and cakes used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1–12, S122–149 are the four cows and four sheep on the north and ten cows on the south meant for sacrifice on the acropolis, presumably an abbreviated form of the hecatomb usually offered on this occasion – there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.|$|E
