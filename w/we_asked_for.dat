2500|$|One of {{participants}} of the Gaza flotilla, Sinan Albayrak, told the Turkish newspaper Akşam {{in response to}} the Israeli apology, [...] "hat is the importance of the apology? 'We killed nine people and are sorry' – of course it sounds ridiculous. I say this is what the state should have done. If [...] only had prevented this at the start. But <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> it. We went there ourselves." [...] According to Hürriyet Daily News Semih Idiz, some Turkish citizens are even suggesting that those involved with the Mavi Marmara incident should also bring charges against the Turkish state for playing a prominent role in supporting the Mavi Marmara's mission and for failing to prevent the death of nine Turks on the ship.|$|E
2500|$|During the New York printers' {{strike of}} 1963, when The New York Times {{and six other}} {{newspapers}} suspended publication, Hardwick, Lowell and the Epsteins seized the chance to establish the sort of vigorous book review that Hardwick had imagined. Jason Epstein knew that book publishers would advertise their books in the new publication, since they had no other outlet for promoting new books. The group turned to the Epsteins' friend Silvers, who had been an editor at The Paris Review and was still at Harper's, to edit the publication, and Silvers asked Barbara Epstein to co-edit with him. She {{was known as the}} editor at Doubleday of Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl, among other books, and then worked at Dutton, McGraw-Hill and The Partisan Review. Silvers and Epstein sent books to [...] "the writers we knew and admired most. ... <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> three thousand words in three weeks in order to show what a book review should be, and practically everyone came through. No one mentioned money." [...] The first issue of the Review was published on February 1, 1963 and sold out its printing of 100,000 copies. It prompted nearly 1,000 letters to the editors asking for the Review to continue. The New Yorker called it [...] "surely the best first issue of any magazine ever." [...] After the success of the first issue, the editors assembled a second issue to demonstrate that [...] "the Review was not a one-shot affair". The founders then collected investments from a circle of friends and acquaintances, and Ellsworth joined as publisher. The Review began regular biweekly publication in November 1963.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the refusal}} to honour the victims during the opening {{ceremony}} of the Olympics, on July 23 IOC President Jacques Rogge led a minute of silence during a ceremony which promoted the Olympic truce. This {{was the first time}} that the IOC honoured the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village. Rogge started by “honoring the memory of the 11 Israeli Olympians who shared the ideals that have brought us together in this beautiful Olympic village" [...] and said that the Israelis “came to Munich in the spirit of peace and solidarity.” [...] Rogge added, [...] "we owe it to them to keep that spirit alive and to remember them.” In response to Rogge's spontaneous minute of silence, Ilana Romano, the widow of Israeli weightlifter Yossef Romano, said, [...] "He is trying to do the bare minimum,” and called it [...] "shameful." [...] Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, also criticized Rogge, saying, “This is not the right solution, to hold some ceremony in front of 30 or 40 people. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a moment of silence at the opening ceremony, not for someone to mumble something in front of a few dozen people.” At the London commemoration on August 6, Romano told Rogge he had [...] "submitted to terrorism", and would be [...] "written down on the pages of history as ... a president who violated the Olympic charter calls for brotherhood, friendship and peace." [...] Their attacks were applauded by the audience, but afterwards some attendees privately expressed discomfort at the sustained attack on Rogge, and Andrew Gilbert, formerly chair of Limmud International tweeted that “the memorial service for Munich 11 became an anti-IOC rally and heavy-handed humiliation of Rogge".' ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{also had}} the very young man's craving to be criticised, and we made it our custom to oblige each other.

60|$|By {{good fortune}} {{we found a}} sleepy man in the {{galvanized}} iron shed, and he informed us that Lane had alighted from the last train and started on foot towards the nearest ranch, which lay about a league away.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> Burns's dwelling; {{and a woman}} pointed {{across the}} street to a two-story house, built of stone, and whitewashed, like its neighbors, but perhaps of a little more respectable aspect than most of them, though I {{hesitate}} in saying so. It was not a separate structure, but under the same continuous roof with the next. There was an inscription on the door, hearing no reference to Burns, but indicating that the house was now occupied by a ragged or industrial school. On knocking, we were instantly admitted by a servant-girl, who smiled intelligently when we told our errand, and showed us into a low and very plain parlor, not more than twelve or fifteen feet square. A young woman, who seemed to be a teacher in the school, soon appeared, and told us that this had been Burns's usual sitting-room, and that he had written many of his songs here.|$|E
60|$|The American Hotel {{is a small}} house, not at {{all such}} a one as American {{travellers}} of any pretension would think of stopping at, but still very respectable, cleanly, and with a neat sitting-room, where the guests might assemble, after the American fashion. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> the landlady, and anon down she came, a round, rosy, comfortable-looking English dame of fifty or thereabouts. On being asked whether she knew a Mr. ------, she readily responded {{that he had been}} there, but, had left no luggage, having taken it away before paying his bill; and that she had suspected him of meaning to take his departure without paying her at all. Hereupon she had traced him to the hotel before mentioned, where she had found that he had stayed two nights,--but was then, I think, gone from thence. Afterwards she encountered him again, and, demanding her due, went with him to a pawnbroker's, where he pledged his watch and paid her. This was about the extent of the landlady's knowledge of the matter. I liked the woman very well, with her shrewd, good-humored, worldly, kindly disposition.|$|E
60|$|Discreditable and disgraceful {{as it may}} seem, {{nobody can}} read this Report without plainly seeing that the Commissioners were, in {{treating}} with the Boers on these points, {{in the position of}} ambassadors from a beaten people getting the best terms they could. Of course, they well knew that this was not the case, but whatever the Boer leaders may have said, the Boers themselves did not know this, or even pretend to look at the matter in any other light. When <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> the country back, said they, we did not get it; after we had three times defeated the English we did get it; the logical conclusion from the facts being that we got it because we defeated the English. This was their tone, and it is not therefore surprising that whenever the Commission threatened to decide anything against them, they, with a smile, let it know that if it did, they would be under the painful necessity of re-occupying Lang's Nek. It was never necessary to repeat the threat, since the majority of the Commission would thereupon speedily find a way to meet the views of the Boer representatives.|$|E

60|$|We {{were very}} glad indeed {{to get to}} Madrid, though dismayed by apprehensions of the octroi which we felt sure awaited us. We {{recalled}} {{the behavior of the}} amiable officer of Valladolid who bumped our baggage about on the roof of our omnibus, and we thought that in Madrid such an officer could not do less than shatter our boxes and scatter their contents in the streaming street. What was then our surprise, our joy, to find that in Madrid there was no octroi at all, and that the amiable mozos who took our things hardly knew what we meant when <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> it. At Madrid they scarcely wanted our tickets at the gate of the station, and we found ourselves in the soft embrace of modernity, so dear after the feudal rigors of Old Castile, when we mounted into a motor-bus and sped away through the spectacular town, so like Paris, so like Rome as to have no personality of its own except in this similarity, and never stopped till the liveried service swarmed upon us {{at the door of the}} Hotel Ritz.|$|E
6000|$|Besides this {{convention}} of the French cuisine there is almost everywhere a {{convention of the}} English language in some one of the waiters. You must not stray far from the beaten path of your immediate wants, but in this you are safe. At San Sebastian we had even a wider range with the English of the little intellectual-looking, pale Spanish waiter, with a fine Napoleonic head, who came to my help when I began to flounder in the language which I had read so much and spoken so little or none. He had been a year in London, he said, and he took us for English, though, now he came to notice it, he perceived we were Americans because we spoke [...] "quicklier" [...] than the English. We did not protest; it was the mildest criticism of our national accent which we were destined to get from English-speaking Spaniards before they found we were not the English we {{did not wish to}} be taken for. After dinner <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> a fire in one of our grates, but the maid declared there was no fuel; and, though the hostess denied this and promised us a fire the next night, she forgot it till nine o'clock, and then we would not have it. The cold abode with us indoors to the last at San Sebastian, but the storm (which had hummed and whistled theatrically at our windows) broke during the first night, and the day followed with several intervals of sunshine, which bathed us in a glowing-expectation of overtaking the fugitive summer farther south.|$|E
60|$|The sea moderating as the {{sun came}} up, though the sky was cloudy and wild, we spoke the other boat, to know what stores they had, and to {{overhaul}} what we had. I had a compass in my pocket, a small telescope, a double-barrelled pistol, a knife, and a fire-box and matches. Most of my men had knives, and some had a little tobacco: some, a pipe as well. We had a mug among us, and an iron spoon. As to provisions, there were in my boat two bags of biscuit, one piece of raw beef, one piece of raw pork, a bag of coffee, roasted but not ground (thrown in, I imagine, by mistake, for something else), two small casks of water, and about half-a- gallon of rum in a keg. The Surf-boat, having rather more rum than we, and fewer to drink it, gave us, as I estimated, another quart into our keg. In return, we gave them three double handfuls of coffee, tied up {{in a piece of}} a handkerchief; they reported that they had aboard besides, a bag of biscuit, a piece of beef, a small cask of water, a small box of lemons, and a Dutch cheese. It {{took a long time to}} make these exchanges, and they were not made without risk to both parties; the sea running quite high enough to make our approaching near to one another very hazardous. In the bundle with the coffee, I conveyed to John Steadiman (who had a ship's compass with him), a paper written in pencil, and torn from my pocket-book, containing the course I meant to steer, in the hope of making land, or being picked up by some vessel--I say in the hope, though I had little hope of either deliverance. I then sang out to him, so as all might hear, that if we two boats could live or die together, we would; but, that if we should be parted by the weather, and join company no more, they should have our prayers and blessings, and <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> theirs. We then gave them three cheers, which they returned, and I saw the men's heads droop in both boats as they fell to their oars again.|$|E
