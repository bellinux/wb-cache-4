Currently there are A110, A310, GTA-atmo-turbo-lemans, A610, Renault 5 Turbo and Renault Sport Spiders registered.|$|E

Although French and British detainees tended to receive enough food in the mail, {{this was not the}} case for the Russians, the majority of whom were condemned to eat from rubbish bins or die of hunger.|$|E

The assignment earned an A and she performed her song in front of classmates. She approached a Melbourne record company {{and was told that}} they <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one song. She wrote more songs and worked with the Kool Skools project, which enables students to record music. In 2001, her sister Nicola entered [...] "All for Believing" [...] on Higgins' behalf into Unearthed, radio station Triple J's competition for unsigned artists. The song won the competition and was added to the station's play list.|$|E

500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they <b>wanted,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were just going to make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E
500|$|Frankie {{begins to}} hear their tiny voices calling to her and, though World tries to {{distract}} her from it, she finally discovers her friends. World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever. She calms him down enough to befriend and unshrink the gang, but Mr. Herriman bursts in, having gotten into the toy box and somehow past the gang's obstacles, and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World. World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void. World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera-like creature to attack them all (made of the remaining refuse of his world). The gang manages to escape the toy box. Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box. Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box, due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence. World gets happy already and shouts that he's free and everyone is really confused, Frankie's answer is: [...] "Well, {{think of it this}} way: Imagine if you were able to have anything you wanted, except one thing, but that one thing is what you <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anything else. For him, that thing is a friend. That's all he wanted; that's {{what he was trying to}} protect. So I brought him here. Here he can have all the friends in the world! I mean come on, isn't friendship what Foster's is all about?" [...] Instantaneously Bloo shouts, [...] " [...] No, it's all about me!" [...] promptly Herriman slaps him with a glove, to the delight of everyone else.|$|E
2500|$|Louis XIV {{asked that}} there be no autopsy {{on the body of}} the duchess, presumably because he feared that the autopsy would {{encourage}} rumors that she was poisoned. However, by the request of her family, the autopsy was still performed. Her doctors found that her lungs were in appalling condition (with the right one in particular being full of [...] "purulent matter") while her chest was flooded with fluid. The cause of her death was perhaps unknown but not in any way connected with the blood loss which she suffered for months in 1680. They were unable to determine whether she was poisoned or not. The doctors later stated that the duchess aborted her children, and she was guilty of the crime of infanticide and abortion. This seems unlikely since, like all of the king's mistresses, Marie Angélique would presumably have <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anything to give the king children so she would secure her place at court.|$|E

50|$|When President Lyndon B. Johnson {{signed the}} act into law on November 7, 1967, he {{described}} its purpose as:"It announces {{to the world}} that our nation <b>wants</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just material wealth; our nation <b>wants</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a 'chicken in every pot.' We in America have an appetite for excellence, too. While we work every day to produce new goods and to create new wealth, we want most of all to enrich man's spirit. That is the purpose of this act.|$|R
2500|$|In 2003, Rolling Stone {{named him}} the biggest pop {{star of the}} year and {{featured}} him on the magazine's cover, commenting that he [...] "attained the one thing most pop stars don't, and the one thing he <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> anything else: credibility." [...] For Entertainment Weekly his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, [...] "redefined pop's cutting edge"; for Vibe it [...] "pushed boundaries more forcefully" [...] than works by his male contemporaries. Fuse TV's editor Jason Lipshutz stated it [...] "changed the game. [...] was steely and sweaty, a universal dance opus that made room for intimacy. It had the best first half of any pop album in 25 years. You {{have to go back to}} 1979 for Off the Wall, to find a pop album with a first half that matches up." [...] He was ranked 66th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time. Timberlake appeared for the first time on the Time 100 list of most influential people in 2007. In 2013, Timberlake made his second appearance on the 100 list, with Stevie Wonder writing [...] "Justin has accomplished a lot at a young age, taking advantage of all the possibilities, and yet he's found time to give of himself too—he gets and gives back. He has a spirit. He does God's work through using the most of his talent." [...] In October 2015, he was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, becoming its youngest member.|$|E
