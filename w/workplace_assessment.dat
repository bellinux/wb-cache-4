40|$|Abstract Background With recent {{emphasis}} {{placed on}} <b>workplace</b> based <b>assessment</b> (WBA) {{as a method of}} formative performance assessment, there is limited evidence in the current literature regarding the role of feedback in improving the effectiveness of WBA. The aim of this systematic review was to elucidate the impact of feedback on the effectiveness of WBA in postgraduate medical training. Methods Searches were conducted using the following bibliographic databases to identify original published studies related to WBA and the role of feedback: Medline (1950 -December 2010), Embase (1980 -December 2010) and Journals@Ovid (English language only, 1996 -December 2010). Studies which attempted to evaluate the role of feedback in WBA involving postgraduate doctors were included. Results 15 identified studies met the inclusion criteria and minimum quality threshold. They were heterogeneous in methodological design. 7 studies focused on multi source feedback, 3 studies were based on mini-clinical evaluation exercise, 2 looked at procedural based assessment, one study looked at <b>workplace</b> based <b>assessments</b> in general and 2 studies looked at a combination of 3 to 6 <b>workplace</b> based <b>assessments.</b> 7 studies originated from the United Kingdom. Others were from Canada, the United States and New Zealand. Study populations were doctors in various grades of training {{from a wide range of}} specialties including general practice, general medicine, general surgery, dermatology, paediatrics and anaesthetics. All studies were prospective in design, and non-comparative descriptive or observational studies using a variety of methods including questionnaires, one to one interviews and focus groups. Conclusions The evidence base contains few high quality conclusive studies and more studies are required to provide further evidence for the effect of feedback from <b>workplace</b> based <b>assessment</b> on subsequent performance.

40|$|Abstract Background Upper {{extremity}} musculoskeletal {{symptoms and}} disorders {{are common in}} the working population. The economic and social impact of such disorders is considerable. Long-time, dynamic repetitive exposure of the hand-arm system during manual handling operations (MHO) alone or in combination with static and postural effort are recognised as causes of musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders. The assessment of these manual work tasks is crucial to estimate health risks of exposed employees. For these work tasks, a new method {{for the assessment of}} the working conditions was developed by the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) and released as a draft in the year 2007. The draft of the so-called Key Indicator Method for Manual Handling Operations (KIM-MHO) was developed in analogy with the existing KIM for Lifting/Holding/Carrying (KIM-LHC) and Pulling/Pushing (KIM-PP) of loads. The KIM-MHO is designed to fill the gap existing in risk assessment of manual work processes, since the existing KIMs deal only with manual handling of loads. This research project focused on the following: - Examination of the validity of <b>workplace</b> <b>assessment</b> with the KIM-MHO comparing expert ratings with the results of the observations. - Examination of the objectivity of <b>workplace</b> <b>assessment</b> with the KIM-MHO applied by different examiners. - Examination of the criterion validity of the risk assessment provided by KIM-MHO with respect to the association between exposure and the occurrence and prevalence of health related outcomes. Methods/Design To determine the objectivity and validity of <b>workplace</b> <b>assessment,</b> the KIM-MHO is applied by occupational health and safety officers at different workplaces involving manual handling operations. To determine the criterion validity of risk assessment, a survey of employees at different workplaces takes place with standardised questionnaires and interviews about symptoms in the neck and upper extremities. In addition, physical examinations of these employees following a standardised medical diagnostic procedure are also carried out. Discussion This research project will provide scientific evaluation of the new KIM-MHO and, if necessary, indicate areas for modification to improve this new method for assessment of the health risk of manual handling operations at diverse workplaces. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Workplace</b> <b>Assessment</b> (WPA) of National Qualifications Framework (NQF) {{competency}} standards {{has assumed}} significance {{as an alternative}} pathway for vocational qualifications for the NZ workforce. The stated intentions of the initiators of <b>workplace</b> <b>assessment</b> of NQF qualifications were multiple, an, at times, uneasy alliance of differing ideologies. These intentions included: {{an increase in the}} capability of the workforce, unified qualifications, social well-being and upward mobility for workers, the widening of participation in education, more fair and valid assessment and public choice. These official narratives for WPA are viewed through a critical theory 'lens', which is then focussed on a case study within the NZ Ambulance Service. The qualitative field work constitutes semi-structured interviews of six workplace assessors and eight candidates employed by Wellington Free Ambulance service. This research indicates that the intention to increase skill levels was partly realised in the valid and direct assessment of performance offered by WPA. Yet, competition with university qualifications detracted from the unified nature of the NQF; its qualifications were relegated to lower levels of the ambulance service. The intention to provide equitable pathways encountered barriers, particularly for volunteer ambulance officers. Moreover, lessened provider capture has resulted in inconsistencies in assessment practice. However, the assessors' holistic evidence-gathering methodologies employed an interplay model, integrating atomistic competencies and holistic judgements of ambulance work. This hermeneutic knowledge counters tendencies to reductionist assessment of ambulance work. A further model of workplace assessors' practice is developed showing how the level of closeness or distance between assessors and candidates influences the candidates' confidence and therefore fairness in <b>workplace</b> <b>assessment.</b> Participatory practices and positive closeness favourably affected assessment events. Costs, particularly the time required for WPA, are partly borne by the ambulance workers, with a resulting intrusive effect into the 'lifeworld' of these workers. The study concludes that WPA is a site where the ongoing contest for emancipation is played out, where workers may challenge the subjectivity of the learning organisation. Yet, candidates saw WPA as a way to meet their personal and career aspirations and valued the rewards attached to the qualifications gained, which offered them protection from the vagaries of the labour market...|$|E
40|$|Even though rater-based judgements of {{clinical}} competence are widely used, they are context sensitive and vary between individuals and institutions. To deal adequately with rater-judgement unreliability, evaluating {{the reliability of}} <b>workplace</b> rater-based <b>assessments</b> in the local context is essential. Using such an approach, the primary intention {{of this study was}} to identify the trainee score variation around supervisor ratings, identify sampling number needs of <b>workplace</b> <b>assessments</b> for certification of competence and position the findings within the known literature. This reliability study of workplace-based supervisors' assessments of trainees has a rater-nested-within-trainee design. Score variation attributable to the trainee for each competency item assessed (variance component) were estimated by the minimum-norm quadratic unbiased estimator. Score variance was used to estimate the number needed for a reliability value of 0. 80. The trainee score variance for each of 14 competency items varied between 2. 3 % for emergency skills to 35. 6 % for communication skills, with an average for all competency items of 20. 3 %; the "Overall rating" competency item trainee variance was 28. 8 %. These variance components translated into 169, 7, 17 and 28 assessments needed for a reliability of 0. 80, respectively. Most variation in assessment scores was due to measurement error, ranging from 97. 7 % for emergency skills to 63. 4 % for communication skills. Similar results have been demonstrated in previously published studies. In summary, overall supervisors' <b>workplace</b> based <b>assessments</b> have poor reliability and are not suitable for use in certification processes in their current form. The marked variation in the supervisors' reliability in assessing different competencies indicates that supervisors may be able to assess some with acceptable reproducibility; in this case communication and possibly overall competence. However, any continued use of this format for assessment of trainee competencies necessitates the identification of what supervisors in different institutions can reliably assess rather than continuing to impose false expectations from unreliable assessments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundBefore July 2011, all medical {{graduates}} chose their specialties for residency training {{prior to}} receiving a 1 -month postgraduate year 1 (PGY- 1) emergency medicine (EM) training in Taiwan. Therefore, the EM curriculum content may not correlate {{well with the}} chosen specialty. Accordingly, the PGY- 1 trainees might learn from their EM training differently depending on specialty. PurposeThis study explored {{the influence of the}} specialties of PGY- 1 trainees on their performance in the 1 -month EM training using <b>workplace</b> <b>assessment</b> tools. MethodsThis retrospective study analyzed the clinical performance of 183 PGY- 1 residents who underwent a 1 -month EM training program in the emergency department of a teaching hospital. Their performance was assessed using several mini-clinical evaluation exercises (mini-CEXs) and a single monthly global rating. We classified trainees into three groups based {{on the extent to which}} the specialty chosen reflected primary care. (Radiology, pathology, nuclear medicine, and anesthesiology reflected little correlation. Obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, otolaryngology, ophthalmology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, psychiatry, neurosurgery, neurology, orthopedics, and urology reflected some correlation. Internal medicine, general surgery, EM, and family medicine had high correlation.) We analyzed the variation in the assessment outcomes between groups using Kruskal–Wallis test. ResultsSuccess in achieving learning outcomes in the emergency department was proportional to the degree of general practice of the specialty chosen. This trend was statistically significant for the mini-CEX domains of medical interviewing (p =  0. 028), clinical judgment (p =  0. 012), physical examination (p =  0. 001), professionalism (p =  0. 023), and clinical skills (p =  0. 001). Compared to the mini-CEX, the final monthly global rating showed no significant correlation between degree of learning and the trainee specialty.
