25|$|After a {{short and}} {{unremarkable}} amateur career, Schilling turned professional on September 30, 2006, taking on Lawson Baker in an 84kg/185lb bout on ten days' notice in Inglewood, California. He recalls striking his opponent <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might,</b> only {{to watch him}} continue to advance unfazed. After being dropped multiple times and nearly throwing in the towel, Schilling finally found the one weapon that worked, elbows. 47 landed elbows later, {{he won his first}} professional Muay Thai fight by way of split decision.|$|E
25|$|When David {{heard that}} God had blessed Obed-Edom {{because of the}} Ark, David brought the Ark to Jerusalem with joy. When those who bore the Ark had gone six paces, they sacrificed an ox and a fatling. The Israelites brought up the Ark with {{shouting}} {{and the sound of}} the horn, and David danced <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might</b> girded with a linen ephod. As the Ark came into the city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out the window and saw David leaping and dancing, and she despised him in her heart.|$|E
25|$|A {{long time}} ago, {{there was a}} rich {{merchant}} and his beautiful wife who lived happily in a big house. Despite their good fortune, the couple didn't have any children. One day, they went together to a shrine and made an offering of twelve banana hands to a tree spirit. Not long thereafter the wife became pregnant and the rich man wished <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might</b> that the child would be a boy, but his wife {{gave birth to a}} girl. His wife, however, conceived again and again. She became pregnant twelve times and each time she had a daughter. By that time his business started to go wrong for him since the ships that took his goods to sell in another country were robbed several times. Finally the rich merchant ended up borrowing a lot of money from his friends trying to fix his business problems. Yet, no matter what he did, his family kept getting poorer.|$|E

High says that [...] "Muspell's sons" [...] will ride across Bifröst, described in Gylfaginning as a rainbow bridge, and that the bridge will then break. The sons of Muspell (and their shining battle troop) advance {{to the field of}} Vígríðr, described as an expanse that reaches [...] "a hundred leagues in each direction", where Fenrir, Jörmungandr, Loki (followed by [...] "Hel's own"), and Hrym (accompanied by all frost jötnar) join them. While this occurs, Heimdallr stands and blows the Gjallarhorn <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might.</b> The gods awaken at the sound, and they meet. Odin rides to Mímisbrunnr in search of counsel from Mímir. Yggdrasil shakes, and everything, everywhere fears.|$|E
500|$|Snow was {{designed}} by Nao Ikeda and Tetsuya Nomura. He {{was designed}} around a motif of ice, with his bandanna inspired by an unused costume element from Kingdom Hearts coded designed by Kamikokuryo. For XIII-2, the bandanna was removed and {{he was given a}} new hairstyle. Originally to have been called [...] "Storm", the development team nicknamed the character [...] "Mr. 33 cm" [...] in reference to his shoe size while his name was still a secret. Nomura designed his darker look in Lightning Returns. Snow's personality in XIII, which carried over to XIII-2, was created to be passionate, optimistic and impulsive, opposing and acting as a foil for Lightning's cold mannerisms. He has also been described in interviews as the [...] "tough guy" [...] type, and not having a jealous side to him. He was originally to have been a more negative delinquent athletic type, but this was changed to his [...] "big brother" [...] persona. Concerning his stance in Lightning Returns, Kitase described Snow as [...] "struggling <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might</b> to keep himself from falling apart from the sadness of losing Serah." [...] His design was intended to reflect the state of the world, as he had changed from his lighthearted former self because of the world's fate. His darker portrayal was emulated by his weapon in the opening cinematic. Watanabe enjoyed writing the character's story, as he was able to give Snow scenes where he appeared [...] "cool", rather than taking on a [...] "thankless" [...] roles. VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole called his relationship with Lightning and Hope, and the way he coped with Serah's fate, {{one of the most interesting}} aspects of the original game. Aside from his appearance in the XIII games, the character was featured in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as a subcharacter representing Final Fantasy XIII, and his outfit from that game was featured as an optional character costume in [...] along with Lightning's Guardian Corps uniform. Snow is voiced by Troy Baker in English and by Daisuke Ono in Japanese.|$|E

Though he loves field trips and excursions in general, he hates having to travel, because he gets sick very easily, and struggles <b>with</b> <b>all</b> of <b>his</b> <b>might</b> not to vomit.

Fifteen was considered to be a good number but achieving a score of twenty was considered praiseworthy. They also undertook exercises in accurately striking targets with a lance: [...] "Each man carries one lance, and before he gets near the platform, he must whirl his lance <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might,</b> and, as soon as it reverberates, throw it, taking aim at the target which has been set up [...] [...] [...] on the left of the platform." ...|$|E

According to them, Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin [...] "was among the three great thinkers who took turns to lead Dahomey (now Benin) from May 1970 to October 1972." [...] A long prison sentence did not affect his inspiratory qualities. Les Echos du Jour stated that [...] "the dental surgeon who became president fought to the end against life and its mishaps, then against death ... He resisted <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might</b> not to escape death, but merely to show that nothing was over until it was over." [...] In an obituary, Jeune Afrique described the man as [...] "humor, loved good cheer, knew how to enjoy the good side of life, but his blows of anger were Homeric." ...|$|E
2500|$|Noting that Moses asked God to {{designate}} someone {{to succeed him}} in [...] soon after the incident of Zelophehad's daughters, a Midrash deduced that when the daughters of Zelophehad inherited from their father, Moses argued that it would surely be right for his sons to inherit his glory. God, however, replied (in the words of [...] ) that [...] "Whoever keeps the fig-tree shall eat its fruit; and whoever waits on the master shall be honored." [...] The sons of Moses sat idly by and did not study Torah, but Joshua served Moses and showed him great honor, rose {{early in the morning}} and remained late at night at the House of Assembly, and arranged the benches and spread the mats. As he had served Moses <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might,</b> he was worthy to serve Israel, and thus God in [...] directed Moses to [...] "take Joshua the son of Nun" [...] as his successor.|$|E

2500|$|While I {{was hearing}} the boys’ confessions {{on the evening}} of the 5th [...] I was {{suddenly}} terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might.</b> I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.|$|E
2500|$|At noon on Thursday, September 24, 1891, Francis Heney's brother Ben, who {{had been}} helping guard Francis, was in San Francisco {{attending}} to family business. Francis Heney left his office for lunch. His secretary Lautaro Roca was to join him momentarily. Handy waited outside the courthouse, and a half-block away at Pennington St. and Church Ave., as Heney walked past Handy, Handy suddenly shouted and grabbed the smaller man from behind, whirled him around, seized Heney by the throat and pushed him against a wall, choking him <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might.</b> Handy then let go and hit Heney in the face, saying, [...] "Take that {{you son of a}} bitch." [...] Handy's finger-trigger didn't keep up with his hair-trigger temper. Heney broke away and ran, pulling a pistol from his pocket. The noon-time crowd around the courthouse saw the fracas. Some shouted, [...] "Don't shoot! Don't shoot!" [...] Handy grabbed the pistol and tried to take the weapon from Heney. The two men struggled for control of it when it discharged, striking Handy in the lower abdomen. Handy, although wounded, lifted the smaller Heney off the ground and then both men fell to the street, still grappling for the revolver. But Heney refused to release his grip on the pistol while Handy still struggled for it. Deputy Sheriff John Wiegle and several other people finally removed the gun from Heney’s grip and Handy’s fingers from Heney’s hands.|$|E
2500|$|The prince rents {{a room in}} the Ivolgin apartment, {{occupied}} by Ganya; Ganya's sister Varvara Ardalyonovna (Varya); his mother, Nina Alexandrovna; his teenage brother, Nikolai (Kolya); his father, General Ivolgin; and another lodger named Ferdyshchenko. There is much angst within Ganya's family about the proposed marriage, which is regarded, particularly by his mother and sister, as shameful. Just as a quarrel on the subject is reaching a peak of tension, Nastassya Filippovna herself arrives to pay a visit to her potential new family. Shocked and embarrassed, Ganya succeeds in introducing her, but when she bursts into a prolonged fit of laughter at the look on his face, his expression transforms into one of murderous hatred. The Prince, fearing something might happen, intervenes to calm him down, and Ganya's rage is diverted toward him in a violent gesture. Ganya recovers himself, but his extreme discomfort is not helped by the entrance of his father—a drunkard with a tendency to tell elaborate lies. Nastassya Filippovna flirtatiously encourages the General and then mocks him. Ganya's humiliation is compounded by the arrival of Rogozhin, accompanied by a rowdy crowd of drunks and rogues, Lebedyev among them. Rogozhin openly starts bidding for Nastassya Filippovna, ending with an offer of a hundred thousand rubles. With the scene assuming increasingly scandalous proportions, Varya angrily demands that someone remove the [...] "shameless woman". Ganya loses all control and violently seizes his sister's arm. Cheered on by Nastassya Filippovna, Varya spits in his face. He is about to strike her when the Prince again intervenes, and Ganya slaps him in the face <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>his</b> <b>might.</b> Everyone is deeply shocked, including Nastassya Filippovna, and she struggles to maintain her mocking aloofness as the others seek to comfort the Prince. Myshkin admonishes her and tells her it is not who she really is. She apologizes to Ganya's mother and leaves, telling Ganya to be sure to come to her birthday party that evening. Rogozhin and his retinue go off to raise the 100,000 rubles.|$|E

The little man, whose name was Auberon Quin, had an appearance compounded of a baby and an owl. His round head, round eyes, seemed to have been designed by nature playfully with a pair of compasses. His flat dark hair and preposterously long frock-coat gave him something of the look of a child's [...] "Noah."
