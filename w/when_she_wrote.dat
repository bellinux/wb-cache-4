5|$|Born in 1933 in Anderson, Indiana, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor {{was raised}} in Indiana and Illinois in the 1930s during the Great Depression. During her {{childhood}} she was hardly given any toys. Instead, with her parents reading to her every night, books formed {{a major part of}} her early years—"the happiest part". Her parents read a variety of literature to her, including Bible stories, The Wind in the Willows, and Mark Twain's novels, until she was 14. After she became a parent, she read to her children in the mornings because of their evening activities. At 16, Naylor wrote a short story for a church magazine, and in her early thirties she published her first book. She has published over 100 books. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> and published Shiloh, her 65th novel, she was living in Bethesda, Maryland with her husband Rex, a speech pathologist whom she married in May 1960. She has two adult sons and four grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the cave}} network {{she finds a}} dying Cameo, who tells her the Beforetime weapons Alexi and Vega are searching for caused the Great White, {{but they do not}} know this. She also reveals it is Elspeth’s destiny, as the Seeker, to destroy them. After {{mourning}} her death, Elspeth overhears that Rushton, imprisoned in the next cavern, is the true heir of Obernewtyn. Suddenly, she is captured by Ariel, who ties her to a table next to the Zebkrahn machine. Elspeth is forced to hold the diaries of Marisa Seraphim, the wife of the founder of Obernewtyn and Alexi's stepmother, and use her abilities to discover what Marisa was thinking <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> them to determine the weapons’ location. Still withstanding the torture, Elspeth mentally enters Rushton’s mind and recognises the voice of her earlier rescuer from the Zebkrahn. Rushton gives his mental strength to her to endure the pain inflicted on her by the machine. In her despair at their threats to kill him, her resistance breaks and Marissa’s thoughts reveal the map to be carved into the front doors of Obernewtyn. At this point, the Zebkrahn overheats and bursts into flames. Something in Elspeth’s mind cracks and she uses this new power to kill Vega, who she saw standing over Rushton with a knife. She falls unconscious as Domick and Rushton’s other friends rush in. Alexi is killed, but Ariel flees into the night and is believed to have died in the blizzard. Now known to be the legal master of Obernewtyn, Rushton plans to build it into a secret refuge for Misfits.|$|E

25|$|Edith Shain {{wrote to}} Eisenstaedt {{in the late}} 1970s {{claiming}} to be {{the woman in the}} picture. In August 1945, Shain was working at Doctor's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City as a nurse when she and a friend heard on the radio that World War II had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace and kissed her. She related that at the time she thought she might as well let him kiss her since he fought for her in the war. Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject.|$|E
25|$|The Zephyrettes {{were hired}} in Chicago, first by McPeek {{and later by}} her successor, Mary Lou Gordon. While the California Zephyr was jointly {{operated}} by the Burlington, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, and the Western Pacific Railroad, the Zephyrettes were technically Western Pacific employees and thus paid in San Francisco. At any one time, there were 10 or 11 Zephyrettes who were actively employed, with six in transit aboard trains (three heading in either direction) and two on layovers (one in San Francisco {{and the other in}} Chicago), and perhaps also an occasional trainee. A typical itinerary for a Zephyrette consisted of the two and a half day trip on the eastbound California Zephyr, a night layover at the Hilton Chicago, another two and a half day trip westbound, and then two and a half days off in San Francisco. Over the course of a month, a Zepyhrette would generally make three round trips. Some Zephyrettes worked other jobs while not aboard the California Zephyr: one, Rita Pelz, modeled for I. Magnin. The average tenure of employment for a Zephyrette was one and a half years, but some served much longer: Nellie O'Grady was already in her seventh year with the California Zephyr <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> about her experiences in the December 1955 issue of The Saturday Evening Post.|$|E
25|$|The {{diplomatic}} intrigue failed, {{largely due}} to the intervention of Sophia's mother, Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. Historical accounts portray her as a cold, abusive woman who loved gossip and court intrigues. Johanna's hunger for fame centred on her daughter's prospects of becoming empress of Russia, but she infuriated Empress Elizabeth, who eventually banned her from the country for spying for King Frederick of Prussia. The Empress Elizabeth knew the family well: she had intended to marry Princess Johanna's brother Charles Augustus (Karl August von Holstein), who had died of smallpox in 1727 before the wedding could take place. In spite of Johanna's interference, Empress Elizabeth took a strong liking to the daughter, who, on arrival in Russia in 1744, spared no effort to ingratiate herself not only with the Empress Elizabeth, but with her husband and with the Russian people. She applied herself to learning the Russian language with such zeal, she rose at night and walked about her bedroom barefoot, repeating her lessons (even though she mastered the language, she retained an accent). This led to a severe attack of pneumonia in March 1744. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> her memoirs, she said she made up her mind when she came to Russia to do whatever was necessary, and to profess to believe whatever was required of her, to become qualified to wear the crown.|$|E

25|$|Morris {{was born}} in Connecticut and raised in Trumbull. She recalls her first-ever {{voice-over}} role as recording for an English as a Second Language learning cassette when she was 12. Her parents would occasionally pull her out of school {{to take her to}} auditions in New York City. When she was in middle school at around age 14, she was involved in an educational video series called Real World Science where she served as the on-screen program host as well as provide narration for the science videos being presented. She described her experience as good practice reading scripts, and noted that the producers at Mazzarella Media kept calling her back to do more videos, so she continued working on those through high school and college, where she would later help the company in production and script writing for other educational videos. She got involved in journalism <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> for the local newspaper The Trumbull Times where she covered high school sports. She graduated in 2004 from New York University with a B.A. degree in Journalism and Mass Communications. In New York, she wrote for US Weekly magazine, New York Press, The Aquarian and Metro New York.

500|$|Le Guin herself {{later said}} she was unhappy with the [...] "strident" [...] tone of the novel. She had been troubled by the Vietnam War, but was living in London <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> the novel, {{cut off from the}} anti-war {{movement}} she had been a part of in Oregon. Written in these circumstances, The Word for World is Forest became what Le Guin called a [...] "preachment". She stated that writing the book was like [...] "taking dictation from a boss with ulcers". She said that she had wanted to write about forests and dreaming, but that the [...] "boss" [...] had made her write instead about ecological destruction. Charlotte Spivack stated that the book was an [...] "angry work", that ended on a note of futility and despair.|$|E
500|$|Millett {{was not the}} [...] "polite, middle-class girl" [...] {{that many}} parents of her {{generation}} and social circle desired: she could be difficult, brutally honest, and tenacious. Liza Featherstone, author of [...] "Daughterhood Is Powerful", says that these qualities helped to make her [...] "one {{of the most influential}} radical feminists of the 1970s". They could also make for difficult interpersonal relationships. Millett wrote several autobiographical memoirs, with what Featherstone calls [...] "brutal honesty", about herself, her husband, lovers, and family. Her relationship with her mother was strained by her radical politics, domineering personality, and unconventional lifestyle. Helen was particularly upset about examination of her lesbianism in her books. Family relationships were further strained after she was involuntarily committed to psychiatric wards and again <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> The Loony Bin Trip.|$|E
500|$|... "Follow Me Home" [...] {{was written}} by the Sugababes—Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena, and Heidi Range—in {{collaboration}} with Jonathan Lipsey, Karen Poole, and Jeremy Shaw, for the group's fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways (2005). Lipsey developed {{the idea of a}} close person as the song's inspiration. Buena wrote the first verse based upon her daughter Tahlia, who was born in March 2005. While writing the verse, she pondered questions such as 'What would you say to her if she was ever in trouble?', and 'How would you say, I’ll always be there for you?'. Buena wanted people to interpret the verse in different ways, and stated that the lyrics came naturally. Buchanan drew inspiration from her close friend <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> the other verse. Lipsey produced the song under his production name Jony Rockstar. [...] "Follow Me Home" [...] was mixed and engineered at Metropolis Studios by Tom Elmhirst and Richard Wilkinson, respectively.|$|E

The line [...] "Daddy, I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah", according to Gaga, was inspired by [...] "rich kids" [...] in the area who she would hear calling their parents for money to buy drugs with.

500|$|In 1741, the Austrian {{authorities}} informed Maria Theresa that Bohemian populace {{would prefer}} Charles Albert {{to her as}} sovereign. Maria Theresa, desperate and burdened by pregnancy, wrote plaintively to her sister: [...] "I don't know if a town will remain to me for my delivery." [...] She bitterly vowed to spare nothing and no one to defend her kingdom <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> to the Bohemian chancellor, Count Philip Kinsky: [...] "My mind is made up. We must put everything at stake to save Bohemia." [...] On 26October, the Elector of Bavaria captured Prague and declared himself King of Bohemia. Maria Theresa, then in Hungary, wept on learning {{of the loss of}} Bohemia. Charles Albert was unanimously elected Holy Roman Emperor on 24January 1742. The Archduchess, who regarded the election as a catastrophe, caught her enemies unprepared by insisting on a winter campaign; the same day he was elected emperor, Austrian troops under Ludwig Andreas von Khevenhüller captured Munich, Charles Albert's capital.|$|E

Lauren Hoffman from Cosmopolitan lauded the episode for its [...] "amazingly effective storytelling" [...] and enjoyed the chemistry between Meredith and Alex. She further wrote that, [...] "if nothing else, Grey's reminds us that there's no upper limit to the amount of suffering a single person can go through, so just grab your people and get ready to roll with it" [...] Praising Washington she noted that, [...] "Denzel and Grey's despite being disparate, could bring each other to new creative heights." ...|$|E

500|$|When Lessing {{published}} Shikasta in 1979, {{the first}} book in her Canopus in Argos series, it represented a major shift of focus for the author. In her earlier books, Lessing had established a name for herself as a writer of realistic fiction; in Shikasta she introduced her readers to the spiritual and mystical themes in Sufism. In the mid-1960s Lessing had become interested in Sufism, an Islamic belief system, after reading The Sufis by Idries Shah. She described The Sufis as [...] "the most surprising book [...] had read", stating that it [...] "changed [...] life". Lessing later met Shah, who became [...] "a good friend [...] teacher". In the early 1970s Lessing began writing inner space fiction, which included the novels Briefing for a Descent into Hell (1971) and Memoirs of a Survivor (1974), and in the late 1970s she turned to science fiction <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> Shikasta, in which she used many Sufi concepts.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, {{the year}} before she died, Potter's {{thoughts}} returned to Kitty MacDonald <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wrote</b> about a piece of crockery:Seventy eighty years ago it belonged to another old woman, old Katie MacDonald, the Highland washerwoman.

At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I just sat there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account.
