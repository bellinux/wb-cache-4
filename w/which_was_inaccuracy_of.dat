40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} dynamic {{thermocouple}} compensation is considered. Taking {{into account the}} nonlinear dependency of the thermocouple time constant on fluid velocity, a thermocouple model and a time constant model are proposed successively for estimation of nonlinear thermocouple time constant. This technique is most suitable for measuring dynamic temperature because of the precise description of time constant. The improve scheme offers better compensation of the thermocouple response. The parameter estimation is performed using GTLS {{to cope with the}} noise present on the regressors and the output. Instruction In many industrial applications, thermocouples are used due to their high credibility and good linear dependence with temperature. However there are drawbacks of thermocouples, the most important <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>of</b> measuring high frequency temperature fluctuations [1]. So, by establishment of the dynamic model, thermocouple input can be reconstructed. In general, thermocouple was model as a first order nonlinear model. Time constant is the undetermined parameter of the model. As the present research，a fixed (mean) time constant [2] is almost always used, although it is variable in fluctuating velocity and thermal field. The simplification of th...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{highlights}} {{improvement of}} the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) of the autoclave process through the implementation of time studies. Two types of time study are employed where the initial time study conducted was the direct stopwatch time study used to validate the current OEE standard. Maynard's Operation Sequencing Technique (MOST) is then adopted to conduct the secondary time study. MOST study revealed the significant value added and non-value added activities at each sub process. MOST is {{used to evaluate the}} percentage of improvement contributed to the OEE. The paper significantly highlight problem in computing the OEE <b>which</b> <b>is</b> the <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>of</b> the data used and lack of a medium to evaluate the improvement ideas before it is implemented. MOST is an effective method to evaluate and shows the gain from the improvement ideas proposed without investing in costly implementations. The limitation of this study is mainly concerned with direct stopwatch time study performed during initial stage as it might varies from one person to another. The other concern is on operation steps performed might be different from one labor to another which might contribute to the variation of the time studies performed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some performance bounds on {{the possible}} localization accuracy of airborne GMTI radar systems. The adaptive monopulse technique is seen to allow azimuth direction estimates with an accuracy of one tenth of the beamwidth of the radar system, or better if the integrated target SNR is increased. The azimuth position error <b>is</b> studied <b>which</b> <b>is</b> caused by <b>inaccuracies</b> <b>of</b> the GPSr/INS system, {{and the impact of}} unaccounted for changes in aircraft altitude is assessed. It is seen that even if the PAMIR antenna were ideal (i. e. did not have beam pointing errors), just the sum of these effects would lead to an azimuth position error between 84. 9 m and 163. 1 m in geographic coordinates at the unambiguous range of the Scan-MTI mode. It is finally pointed out that good elevation information (e. g. a DEM) is required for accurate target ground range location, and it is suggested that this can also be achieved by processing a SAR image from the GMTI data take and geometrically rectifying both this image and the repositioned ground moving targets...|$|R
40|$|The exact {{prediction}} of hydrodynamic forces {{acting on a}} floating body moving with steady velocity has been of concern to ship hydrodynamists. In {{the case of a}} deeply submerged body the constant pressure on the free surface is linearized, and in some calculations the same linearized condition has also been used for a partially immersed body. When solving these hydrodynamic problems there are often difficulties associated with the computation of non-zero steady speed, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> due to <b>inaccuracies</b> <b>of</b> the Green function results. This may probably be due to the point singularity at the intersection of the body with the free surface. The analytical difficulty, {{in the case of a}} surface-piercing body oscillating and translating in the free surface, is that of a singularity at the intersection of the body contour with the free surface. Assumptions of regularity or least singularity of the flow very close to the free surface is used. This assumption, however, does not lead to stable numerical solutions. In this paper the author describes the Green function approach for a steady translating body and then briefly discusses the translating and oscillating case. Velocity vectors are presented for two different Froude numbers and for four different non-dimensional wave numbers. Prediction of the hydrodynamic forces is not easy, even if the effects of viscosity are neglected. 1...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a good candidate to provide high-resolution soil moisture information over extended areas. SAR data could be used as observations within a global Data Assimilation (DA) approach to benefit applications such as hydrology and agriculture. Prior to developing an operational DA system, one must tackle the following challenges of soil moisture estimation with SAR: (1) the dependency of the measured radar signal on both soil moisture and soil surface roughness which leads to an ill-conditioned inverse problem, and (2) the difficulty in characterizing spatially/temporally surface roughness of natural soils and its scattering contribution. The objectives of this project are (1) to develop a roughness measurement method to improve the spatial/temporal characterization of soil surface roughness, and (2) to investigate to what extent the inverse problem can be solved by combining multipolarization, multi-incidence, and/or multi-frequency radar measurements. The first objective is achieved with a measurement method based on Structure from Motion (SfM). It is tailored to monitor natural surface roughness changes <b>which</b> have often <b>been</b> assumed negligible although without evidence. The measurement method is flexible, a. ordable, straightforward and generates Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for a SAR-pixel-size plot with mm accuracy. A new processing method based on band-filtering of the DEM and its 2 D Power Spectral Density (PSD) is proposed to compute the classical roughness parameters. Time series of DEMs show that non-negligible changes in surface roughness can happen within two months at scales relevant for microwave scattering. The second objective is achieved using maximum likelihood fitting of the Oh backscattering model to (1) full-polarimetric Radarsat- 2 data and (2) simulated multi-polarization / multi-incidence / multi-frequency radar data. Model fitting with the Radarsat- 2 images leads to poor soil moisture retrieval <b>which</b> <b>is</b> related to <b>inaccuracy</b> <b>of</b> the Oh model. Model fitting with the simulated data quantifies the amount of multilooking for di. erent combinations of measurements needed to mitigate the critical e. ect of speckle on soil moisture uncertainty. Results also suggest that dual-polarization measurements at L- and C-bands are a promising combination to achieve the observation requirements of soil moisture. In conclusion, the SfM method along with the recommended processing techniques are good candidates to improve the characterization of surface roughness. A combination of multi-polarization and multi-frequency radar measurements appears to be a robust basis for a future Data Assimilation system for global soil moisture monitoring...|$|R

40|$|Users and {{manufacturers}} of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) systems have, po-tentially, an unrivalled asset. Phase contrast mapping of velocities through planes transecting the great arteries should {{provide the most}} accurate measurements available of cardiac out-put, shunt flow, aortic or pulmonary regurgitation and, indirectly, of mitral regurgitation. But {{the reality is that}} phase contrast velocity mapping remains under-used, and may have become discredited in the eyes of some CMR users and referring clinicians. Even when appropriate methods of acquisition have been used, there can <b>be</b> <b>inaccuracies</b> <b>of</b> flow measurement on some CMR systems caused by background phase errors due to eddy currents or uncorrected concomitant gradients. Measurements of regurgitant or shunt flow can be seriously affected by these errors <b>which</b> should <b>be</b> minimised or corrected by appropriate hardware and software design.

Prison facilities encounter many challenges in TB screening procedures and TB control. This review explores screening practices for detection of TB and describes limitations of TB control in prison facilities worldwide. Methods: A systematic search of online databases (e. g., PubMed and Embase) and conference abstracts was carried out. Research papers describing screening and diagnostic practices among prisoners were included. A total of 52 articles met the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis of TB prevalence in prison facilities by screening and diagnostic tools was performed. Results: The most common screening tool was symptom questionnaires (63 ? 5 %), mostly reporting presence of cough. Microscopy of sputum with Ziehl-Neelsen staining and solid culture were the most frequently combined diagnostic methods (21 ? 2 %). Chest X-ray and tuberculin skin tests were used by 73 ? 1 % and 50 %, respectively, as either a screening and/or diagnostic tool.
