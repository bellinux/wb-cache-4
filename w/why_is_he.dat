25|$|The 19th century Italian writer Arturo Graf {{gives this}} version of the legend in his 1889 book Il Diavolo : There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have {{children}} and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, {{for the first time in}} his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.|$|E
500|$|Kalākaua, Armstrong and Judd were {{formally}} {{presented to}} Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. Kalākaua's {{letter to his}} sister Liliuokalani expressed his excitement about meeting the Queen, [...] "…I was quite electrified and monopolized the whole conversation that {{took place during the}} interview." [...] His letter was effusive in details about the titled royals and aristocrats they had met, including the Prince and Princess of Wales, and the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Prussia. The Prince of Wales paid many attentions to Kalākaua, hoping to sway him away from the United States. He insisted on giving [...] Kalākaua precedence ahead of his brother-in-law, the Crown Prince of Germany and responded to German objections by saying, 'Either the brute is a king or else he is an ordinary black nigger, and if he is not a king, <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> here?' At this point in their trip, Armstrong temporarily returned to his family in the United States.|$|E

500|$|The first {{official}} trailer saw its release on March 27, 2013 and showcased a clock striking midnight which established the film's key plot devices including the Dark Hour phenomenon, the primary antagonists — the Shadows {{and the main}} protagonist summoning his Persona, Orpheus. When the second trailer was released on July 22, 2013, {{it was also the}} first to feature dialogue as well as the main theme song for the film, titled [...] "More Than One Heart" [...] by Yumi Kawamura. The third trailer was released on October 19, 2013 and introduced the Tartarus tower along with designs of the signature weapons used by each individual character. A reporter at Kotaku described the animation as [...] "gorgeous" [...] and felt as though the movie reflected the game's [...] cut-scenes. The fourth and final trailer was released on November 18, 2013 and was the lengthiest of its predecessors. It showcased new footage including the characters Igor and Elizabeth in the Velvet Room, more use of the Evokers, a bit of Makoto Yuki's back story (in flashbacks) along with new dialogue. At the end of the trailer, a reference alluding to Makoto's ambivalence is made by the character Junpei Iori who asks, [...] "I wonder... Just <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> [...] fighting?" [...] — a trait later mentioned by film critics.|$|E

"Oh," [...] said Ayala, quite satisfied,--remembering {{now that}} she had heard her friend Nina boast of a Colonel cousin, who was {{supposed}} to be the youngest Colonel in the British army, who had done some wonderful thing,--taken a new province in India, or marched across Africa, or defended the Turks,--or perhaps conquered them. She knew that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very brave,--but <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>he</b> so very ugly? His hair was ruby red, and very short; and he had a thick red beard: not silky, but bristly, with each bristle almost a dagger,--and his mouth was enormous. His eyes were very bright, and there was a smile about him, partly of fun, partly of good humour. But his mouth! And then that bristling beard! Ayala was half inclined to like him, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> so completely master of himself, so unlike the unhappy ancient gentleman who was still hovering at a distance.

2500|$|Aspinall {{finally agreed}} to direct the company on a {{temporary}} basis, simply so that someone would finally be in charge. When, in 1969, the Beatles engaged Klein as their manager, he also inherited the chairmanship of Apple Corps, which led to an immediate streamlining of company affairs: [...] "Overnight, glib lack of concern deferred to pointed questions," [...] wrote Clayson & Leigh. [...] "Which typist rings Canberra every afternoon? Why has so-and-so given himself a raise of 60 pounds a week? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> seen only on payday?

2500|$|In Chapter 58 it is {{suggested}} that the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene created a [...] "potent political union with the potential of making a legitimate claim to the throne." [...] Olson and Meisel not only state that this assertion is without any historical basis, but question why Solomon's kingship would have any purpose or meaning today that would motivate a large-scale conspiracy. The authors also question why if Jesus were merely a [...] "mortal prophet", as the novel suggests, a royal goddess would not have any interest in him. Olson and Meisel quote Chicago archbishop Francis Cardinal George, who remarked, [...] "Jesus isn't God but Mary Magdalene is a goddess? I mean, what does that mean? If he's not God, <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> married to a goddess?" [...] Olson and Meisel also argued that having Davidic blood in Jesus' time would not have been unique, since all of his stepfather Joseph's relatives, which included twenty generations of kings of Judah, had it as well. The authors also state that the Benjamites were not considered [...] "rightful" [...] heirs to the throne, and that the New Testament does not mention Mary Magdalene's tribal affiliation, and that she was likely not from the tribe of Benjamin, and that her connection with that tribe is traced to the 1982 book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which does not substantiate the idea.|$|E

[...] The night of the ceremony, Queen expressed {{that there were more}} than just one artist attending and that they only gave the awards to one artist. [...] "They dedicated the night to Calle 13." [...] she said. She conuntied saying that what happened that night was an injustice because even though Calle 13 won, she had the support of the public.

Ivy Queen received a gold and platinum certification in the United States for Sentimiento, signifying sales of over 100,000 copies.
