50|$|After the Congolese wars, <b>Walikale</b> <b>territory</b> {{had known}} {{a period of}} {{relative}} calm: surely, armed groups activities had not ceased, ‘food lootings’ were still frequent and armed groups benefited from the central state’s ignorance of the region to continue their mining exploitation activities and to extend their local power. But at least, almost no conflicts were going on between armed groups, and nor the governmental army, nor was the MONUC interfering with their activities.|$|E
50|$|Bisie is a tin deposit in the <b>Walikale</b> <b>territory,</b> {{province}} of North Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), although the name {{has also been}} used to include the nearby village of Manoire. It {{used to be an}} illegal source of an estimated 15,000 tons of tin, or 4% of global production. At the present time, artisanal activity has been suspended, and Alphamin Resources Corp., a Mauritius-based exploration company, is leading an exploration program on the site.|$|E
50|$|The Mayi-Mayi Simba {{group was}} {{initially}} created in 1964 during the ‘Lumumbist rebellion’. It used to share communitarians ideals and motivations, but its motivations today are exclusively related to pillage and looting. They {{are located in}} the north of <b>Walikale</b> <b>territory,</b> on the western axis near the borders with Lubutu and Maniema (region of Oninga), but their activities have decreased in the last years in Walikale. It is very hard to evaluate their number, as today they often attack in alliance with the Mayi-Mayi Tseka, or very occasionally with the FDLR. One of the most recent grouped attacks is the one lead in the famous mining site of Bisié.|$|E

5000|$|Taking the Northern Road: {{the road}} crosses Masisi {{territory}} {{and is known}} for being very dangerous. The first axis when entering <b>Walikale</b> <b>territory</b> is Kibati Kibua; the road is very damaged and almost unpracticable during the rainy seasons. The second axis from Kibua to Mpofi has a good road which has been rehabilitated by the NGO AAA. However,attacks on humanitarians {{have been reported in}} the surroundings of Mpofi. Finally, the road from Mpofi to Walikale is also in relatively good conditions. Frequent check points of rebels from the FDLR {{have been reported in the}} Walikale - Kibua axis ( [...] and more precisely, the Mpofi - Kibua axis). The overall trip in good conditions takes 10 to 15 hours but is not recommended to humanitarians, especially for the transportation of material.|$|E
50|$|In addition, some armed {{groups such}} as the FDLR had even started to {{integrate}} into the social and economic organization of Walikale; as shown in a report of Pole Institute dating from 2008, the FDLR had begun to constitute “a state within a state” (Rudahigwa, 2008): customary chiefs admitted at the time that an important part of <b>Walikale</b> <b>territory</b> was under control of the FDLR, who had imposed its own rules and organization. Regular collects were organized within the local population of each village, and a part of their harvest had to be given, as a sort of tax. In exchange, the FDLR protected them. Furthermore, the members of the FDLR even started to develop economic activities other than mining looting, such as farming, local trade of foodstuff or manufactured products and even building hospital or social infrastructures.|$|E
