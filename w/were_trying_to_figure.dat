25|$|One change, {{which was}} later to {{become synonymous with}} the show, was the {{transformation}} of Diana Prince into Wonder Woman by spinning. During the filming of the pilot, producers <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> {{out a way to}} show how Diana Prince became Wonder Woman, when Carter suggested that she do a spin.|$|E
25|$|When the {{aircraft}} was on final, the pilots received several warnings from ATC {{that they were}} 1000–2000 meters {{to the left of}} the landing course, followed by another warning that they were too low. The pilots were confused about their location and <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> it out based on reports from ATC, the flight computer and a portable GPS device. According to the final investigation report, they also ignored automatic altitude readouts that started at 60 m above ground level and continued every 10 m. Nine seconds before the impact, the pilot contacted ATC to ask if they were off course, still concentrated on aligning {{the aircraft}} with the runway and not on its altitude. The pilots made no effort to stop the descent.|$|E

500|$|... "When Flanders Failed" [...] {{features}} the second {{appearance of the}} character Akira, voiced by Hank Azaria. He was previously seen in the season two episode [...] "One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish", {{where he is a}} waiter at a Japanese restaurant. It is revealed in this episode that the characters Ned Flanders, Moe Szyslak and Montgomery Burns are left-handed, just like The Simpsons creator Matt Groening. The Simpsons writer George Meyer {{came up with the idea}} of The Leftorium when the creators <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out what Ned's failed business would be. The inspiration came from a friend of Meyer's who opened a left-handed store that was quickly forced to close down due to lack of business.|$|E
500|$|... "The Crepes of Wrath" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was {{credited}} as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode {{was inspired by the}} French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out which country the foreign exchange student should come from when they came up with Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and could not think of a good name for the boy so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and they tried to get the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her voice was a bit different from what the viewers are used to in the later episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|Orci came up {{with the}} idea to start the episode in a church's confessional, while the ambered scene on the bus was {{originally}} scripted to take place on a subway; one of the writers felt the bus [...] "let you see more of the city". Early in the show's creation the writers <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out what Fringe could be, and ultimately chose [...] "big crazy event" [...] at the start of each episode that would catapult its plot and drive its characters. They felt the bus scene essentially achieved this. When creating the scene on the bus when the gas canister is released, the crew sat on a bus that was really driving through the streets of New York City; director Frederick Toye called the shooting [...] "Student film style, run and gun". To shoot the three scenes of the bus in the tunnel, the crew looked at a variety of locations before choosing a tunnel near the United Nations headquarters on the east side of Manhattan. As it was a busy area, they had to shoot at night and then attempt to make it appear to be daytime, as the scenes were set during the day. They had a limited schedule to shoot all three scenes, and despite never having seen the tunnel before, the production crews had 8–9 hours to quickly set up the massive set and leave enough time to shoot the scenes before dawn approached. To simulate being encased in amber, the actors had to pretend they were frozen.|$|E

500|$|Producer Ron Hauge came up {{with the}} idea of someone {{shooting}} a bird and feeling guilty about it. Hauge told the staff a few weeks before Cohen started writing the episode that when he was 13 or 14 years old, he accidentally killed a bird after he got a Wrist Rocket slingshot, and took a shot at a bird that he thought was [...] "far, far away". Hauge said his friends were excited about it, but he was [...] "dying inside". For the scene in which the bird is killed, Cohen received further inspiration from an episode of The Andy Griffith Show entitled [...] "Opie the Birdman". The writers <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out a way to have Bart kill the bird without actually wanting to kill it, and decided to give the gun a crooked sight that Bart would be unaware of, so when Bart intentionally takes a shot at the right of the bird to avoid it, the bullet still hits the bird. After Bart kills the mother bird, he imagines himself before a bird court with a vulture, an eagle, and a toucan as judges. This sequence was added to [...] "liven up the visuals", because the writers thought the episode tended too heavily towards extreme realism and because most of the scenes in the episode were taking place in and around the Simpsons' house. Then-show runner Mike Scully had done the same thing with an episode he wrote for season seven called [...] "Marge Be Not Proud". In that episode, Bart gets caught shoplifting, and writer Bill Oakley suggested the addition of a fantasy sequence to get away from the realism in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|In a December 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke about writing this episode with guest star Ian McShane in mind, [...] "Christmas and American Horror Story {{do not go}} together and so we <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out 'What's our version of Christmas?' And the answer of course is a homicidal Santa. There's a whole subgenre in horror dedicated to these psycho Santas. It's a thing. So we decided let's write somebody who's so crazy they end up in Briarcliff. I had heard Ian McShane really loved American Horror Story. So we wrote it and we were like, 'Let's send it to him {{and ask for a}} quick pass.' To my delight, he said yes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a December 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, guest star Dylan McDermott spoke {{about being in}} the second season of American Horror Story, [...] "I loved doing the show. It's like being home for me. We talked about it I think early in the season. He [...] called me over the summer and we <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> out what was the best plan and in what capacity. I wasn't sure myself and obviously he's the master and the genius that figures this shit out. So the day the show premiered he called me and he explained it to me because I hadn't read any of the scripts. He explained to me what my character {{was going to be}} and I was like, 'Are you fucking kidding me? I love this! I love this! It's beyond!' To play the modern day Bloody Face and to have this whole back story of a guy who's thrown away and aborted and still lived! It was just like, are you kidding me? It was music to my ears, maybe nobody else's. But to me? I couldn't believe it. It's so twisted and dark and fucked up. That's why I'm on the show because I love stuff like that." ...|$|E
