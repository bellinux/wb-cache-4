5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Florence <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} wave that {{moved through the}} Lesser Antilles into the eastern Caribbean on September21. The wave tracked generally westward, and spawned a tropical storm on September23 about 100mi (160km) southeast of Jamaica. Given the name Florence, the storm steadily intensified after developing, although a well-defined circulation was not observed until September24. That day, Florence attained hurricane status in the Yucatán Channel between the Yucatán Peninsula and the western tip of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Dorothy <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August13.

Two days later, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Dorothy, while located about 500mi (800km) east of the Lesser Antilles, with its intensity confirmed by the Hurricane Hunters.|$|E
5|$|Alpha's origins <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} {{wave that}} developed near the Windward Islands on October20. Satellite images {{indicated that a}} low pressure center associated with the tropical wave formed near Barbados and moved west-northwest with increasing convective activity. In an area of light wind shear, the convection increased and Doppler weather radar data from Puerto Rico detected a well-defined cyclonic circulation. On October22, the {{area of low pressure}} organized into Tropical Depression 25, southeast of Hispaniola. Shortly thereafter, satellite imagery indicated that a closed circulation had developed, and the associated convection had started banding. Later that same day, the depression had organized enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Alpha; {{this was the first time}} the National Hurricane Center had to use a Greek name for an Atlantic hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Rwanda as a UN Trust Territory after World War II, with {{a mandate to}} oversee its eventual independence. The economic landscape had changed considerably during the war; a cash economy grew, {{and with it the}} demand for labourers in the Congolese mines of Katanga and the coffee and sugar plantations of Uganda. There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church; prominent figures in the early Rwandan church, who <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> wealthy and conservative background (such as Léon-Paul Classe), were replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these, a greater proportion were Flemish rather than Walloon Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu. Economic conditions and the seminary education provided by the church gave the Hutu a social mobility not previously possible, allowing the development of an elite group of Hutu leaders and intellectuals. This group, consisting of Hutu from the precolonial Kingdom of Rwanda, was joined by prominent citizens of kingdoms acquired during colonialism (including the Kiga).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Tico is one {{of three}} major hurricanes to strike Mazatlan. The origins of Hurricane Tico <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> weak {{tropical}} disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October7, 1983. Over warm waters, the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One on October 11, about 575mi (930km) south of Acapulco. On October12 it turned sharply northward; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October13. Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify. Two days after becoming a tropical storm, Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status. Early on October19, it reached peak winds of 130mph (215km/h). It weakened slightly as it approached the coast, and at about 1500UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 125mph (205km/h). The remains were tracked into the Mid-Atlantic States for five more days.|$|E
5|$|The Party for Freedom's {{political}} platform often overlaps {{those of the}} assassinated Rotterdam politician Pim Fortuyn and his Pim Fortuyn List. After his death, Fortuyn's impact remained, {{as more and more}} politicians sought to gain political mileage by directly confronting topics such as a ban on immigration that <b>were,</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> politically correct point of view, considered unmentionable in the Netherlands until Fortuyn came on the scene and upended the Dutch tradition of consensus politics with an anti-immigration stance. Wilders would position himself to inherit Fortuyn's constituency. The Party for Freedom called for a €16billion tax reduction, a far stricter policy toward recreational drug use, investing more in roads and other infrastructure, building nuclear power plants and including animal rights in the Dutch constitution. In the 2006 Dutch parliamentary election, their first parliamentary election, the Party for Freedom won 9 out of the 150 open seats.|$|E

5|$|The first {{announcement}} {{of the discovery of}} element 102 was announced by physicists at the Nobel Institute in Sweden in 1957. The team reported that they had bombarded a curium target with carbon-13 ions for twenty-five hours in half-hour intervals. Between bombardments, ion-exchange chemistry was performed on the target. Twelve out of the fifty bombardments contained samples emitting (8.5±0.1)MeV alpha particles, which were in drops which eluted earlier than fermium (atomic number Z=100) and californium (Z=98). The half-life reported was 10minutes and was assigned to either 251102 or 253102, although the possibility that the alpha particles observed <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> presumably short-lived mendelevium (Z=101) isotope created from the electron capture of element 102 was not excluded. The team proposed the name nobelium (No) for the new element, which was immediately approved by IUPAC, a decision which the Dubna group characterized in 1968 as being hasty. The following year, scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory repeated the experiment but were unable to find any 8.5MeV events which were not background effects.|$|E

Verge then kicked a penalty goal to bring the difference to one point. The second half was a demonstration of good attacking play and strong defensive work on both sides. The only points scored <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> try for Queensland, giving them a 7–11 win.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Arlene <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> cloud mass that {{developed}} in the eastern Pacific Ocean in early May1981. The system crossed Central America, and by the afternoon of May5, a low-level circulation was evident near Roatán, {{off the coast of}} Honduras. Convection was initially disorganized, preventing classification as a tropical cyclone. It was not until late on May6 that Dvorak satellite intensity estimates began on the system. Around that time, it is estimated it became a tropical depression, while located near the Cayman Island. It was a rare example of an Atlantic depression forming from a disturbance that originated in the eastern Pacific.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Carlos <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} wave that exited {{the west coast}} of Africa on June14. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, with little evidence of its existence on satellite imagery. By June20 it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean, later spawning an area of convection, or thunderstorms, south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the system in its tropical weather outlook on June24, by which time a low pressure center developed. Gradually, the system continued to develop due to light wind shear, with rainbands and convection located near the broad center. By early on June26, the disturbance had organized enough for the NHC to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Three-E, about 130miles (210km) south-southwest of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Cyclone Bingiza <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{persistent}} area of disorganized convection on February8, about 880km (545mi) north-northeast of Réunion. At the time, the system {{consisted of a}} poorly defined circulation, located {{in an area of}} low wind shear. It moved west-southwestward along the northern periphery of a ridge, and its convection gradually became more organized over the center. On February9, Météo-France (MF) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance5, and six hours later upgraded it to a tropical depression. Shortly thereafter, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert after convective banding and outflow increased. Following intensification of the depression into a moderate tropical storm, MF advised the Madagascan Weather Service to name the storm as Bingiza which they did late on February 9.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Francesca <b>were</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} low that {{formed in the}} Australia region on January28, east of the Cocos Islands. This was near the same place that Eddy had formed a week prior. The system that became Francesca moved west-southwestward due to a ridge to the south. On January30 it crossed into the South-West Indian Ocean, where wind shear prevented significant development. On January31, the system intensified into a tropical depression, and late {{the next day the}} JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S. Wind shear diminished on February2, which allowed the depression to strengthen into Tropical Storm Francesca after convection increased. It continued to intensify steadily, becoming a tropical cyclone on February3. The next day, the JTWC upgraded Francesca to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane.|$|E
