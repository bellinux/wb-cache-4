The research areas reviewed are the functional form of the financial ratios, distributional characteristics of financial ratios, classification of financial ratios, and the estimation of the internal rate of return from financial statements. It is observed that it is typical of financial ratio analysis research that there are several unexpectedly distinct lines with research traditions of their own. A common feature of all the areas of financial ratio analysis research seems to be that while significant regularities can be observed, they are not necessarily stable across the different ratios, industries, and time periods. This leaves much space for the development of a more robust theoretical basis and for further empirical research. Financial statement analysis, financial ratios, review...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Institutions {{are vital}} to policy outcomes, and the design of {{institutions}} has thus become {{a major focus of}} political science research. Yet institutions seldom are adopted wholesale, from a readily available blueprint. They develop instead in stops and starts over time and in response to policy demands and unpredictable contingencies. Recognizing that accountability institutions are no exception to this general rule, this paper analyzes the evolution of the “web ” of accountability institutions in Brazil over the past two decades, the interactive development of its component institutions over time, and the implications of this cross-institutional evolution for contemporary anti-corruption initiatives in Latin America’s largest democracy.

Southern Nuclear has graciously volunteered to host the test at their Plant Hatch site. The MPC mock-up was constructed of the same materials, welded using the same welding techniques, and has the same diameter and weld sizes as a full-sized MPC. The mock-up was procured for training purposes to demonstrate lid welding and use of ancillary equipment with the vent and drain ports. The only differences between a full size MPC and the mock-up are {{that there is no}} fuel basket inside, the lid is 2 / inches thick (viz. 9 / or 10 inches for the actual MPC), and the height is truncated for handling ease.

My sincere thanks to Joseph Tyson and {{all of you for}} the invitation. This essay will proceed in three parts. First, I will discuss a recent example of the state of affairs in the study of Paul and Christian/Jewish relations, and set out the importance of Paul and of the challenge to rethinking the portrait from which Christians and Jews have worked to date. Second, I will offer a new interpretation of Paul by investigating a few of his statements in various texts. And third, I will discuss some of the implications of this construction of Paul for Christian/Jewish relations. [Note: This manuscript has become longer than I intended, which is due to expanding the second section (point 5). This paper represents development of a lecture presented first to Jewish and Christian clergy and then revised for General Theological Seminary’s Annual Lecture on Jewish/Christian relations.

40|$|Clinical {{characterization}} {{of a family}} with a mutation in the uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein) gene. BackgroundWe have recently identified a mutation in the uromodulin gene in a large family affected with hyperuricemia, gout, and renal failure. The purpose of this investigation {{is to provide a}} comprehensive {{characterization of}} the clinical findings of this syndrome in family members who had a mutation in the uromodulin gene. MethodsAn extended family suffering from hyperuricemia and gout was identified by a local practitioner. After consent was obtained, patients provided a directed clinical history and blood and urine specimens for chemical and genetic testing. All family members were tested for the presence of uromodulin gene mutations by direct DNA sequence analysis. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of family members carrying the affected mutation were then investigated. ResultsThirty-nine family members were found to have an exon 5 uromodulin gene mutation (g. 1966 1922 del), and 29 unaffected family members were identified. The cardinal clinical features in individuals with the uromodulin mutation included hyperuricemia, decreased fractional excretion of uric acid, and chronic interstitial renal disease leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the fifth through seventh decade. Women did not always develop hyperuricemia or gout, but still developed progressive chronic renal failure. ConclusionMutation of the uromodulin gene resulted in hyperuricemia, reduced fractional excretion of uric acid, and renal failure. Genetic testing will be required to definitively identify individuals suffering from this condition. We are interested in studying other families that may suffer from this condition and <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>any</b> such referrals...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a construction of ordered algebraic structures (ordered abelian semi-groups, ordered commutative semi-rings, etc.) and {{describe a}}pplications to topology, measure theory, and probability theory. For a suitable ordered semi- algebraic structure L and measure space X we define L-measures ν on X. In certain cases and for certain ordered structures L, a measure ν {{can be interpreted}} as a “probability L-measure ” and can be used to calculate the probability of “black swan events. ” If L is a codimension- 1 essential lamination in a manifold, it sometimes admits transverse L-measures for various L. Transverse L-measures can be used to understand laminations far more complicated than those admitting transverse R-measures. We also investigate actions on L-trees which are associated to laminations with transverse L-measures. 1 Ordered algebraic structures. In this paper we construct certain ordered semi- algebraic structures which have surely been described before. The author <b>would</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>any</b> references to the literature. Then we use these ordered algebraic structures for various applications. In particular, we describe measures with values in the ordered semi- algebraic structures, some of which can be used for probability calculations. The (probability) measure theory ideas may also already exist in some form. Finally, we will describe transverse measures for codimension- 1 laminations with values in our ordered semi- algebraic structures. We begin by defining a very simple ordered commutative semi-ring which was used in [3] to analyze finite height (or finite depth) measured laminations in surfaces. Example 1. 1. Let N 0 = N∪{ 0 } = { 0, 1, 2, 3, [...] . } and let S denote the set { 0 } ∪ (N 0 × (0,∞]), where (0,∞] ⊂ R ̄ and where R ̄ = [−∞,∞] denotes the extended real line. We are using the symbol 0 to denote 0 in R or Z, but in the definition of S we are adding a distinct 0. We use the lexicographical order relation on N 0 × (0,∞], so that (i, t) < (j, s) either if i < j and s, t ∈ (0,∞] or if i = j and t < s. The element 0 ∈ S is a least element, 0 < (i, t) for all 1 a...|$|R
