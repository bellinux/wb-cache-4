500|$|Other reviews {{were not}} as positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. [...] The two criticized the idea that Scully would give her child up for {{adoption}} solely based on the word of Jeffrey Spender, noting [...] "if she wasn't {{going to give it}} away for the sake of its own protection after a UFO cult abducted it , then <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> because Jeffrey Spender of all people comes along and informs her that it's under threat?" [...] Shearman and Pearson, however, did praise Chris Owens' acting, writing that he did a [...] "great job". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode and derided its plot. He heavily criticized the idea that Scully would offer William up for adoption. Kessenich did however praise Duchovny's directing, noting that [...] " [...] did a masterful job of luring me back to this world of The X-Files". Aaron Kinney from Salon wrote that the episode [...] "scuttled the entire" [...] baby William subplot. M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the decision to conclude the William subplot but called the episode's conclusion [...] "sappy".|$|E
60|$|<b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> be glad, and <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> be {{sure that}} he would be good to his uncle? Could it be that she also had been told the story of Kate O'Hara? Then, as no other {{occupation}} was possible to him, he took himself to bed.|$|E

She {{is as good}} as you. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> {{not bear}} the name you are so proud of dinning into our ears? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> not be a Countess? Has she ever disgraced herself? If she is disgraced in your eyes you must be a Devil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see <b>why</b> they <b>should.</b> <b>She's</b> only my {{great-aunt}} by marriage. I wouldn't mind in {{the least}} if people did talk. They'll talk anyway--you know that, mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{would do}} nothing at her bidding. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> I? <b>She</b> had been my enemy throughout, since she found that the money belonged to her son and not to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, I {{suppose it}} is. <b>Why</b> else <b>should</b> <b>she</b> treat me {{in such a}} way? But I do believe of her that she would rather eat an honest, dry crust, than dishonest cake and ale." ...|$|R
60|$|To this Fanny said nothing. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she?</b> She was not Mr. Ingram's keeper.|$|E
6000|$|The trouble {{went on and}} on, {{day after}} day. She had always piles of books to mark, myriads of errors to correct, a heart-wearying task that she loathed. And the work got worse and worse. When she tried to flatter herself that the {{composition}} grew more alive, more interesting, she had {{to see that the}} handwriting grew more and more slovenly, the books more filthy and disgraceful. She tried what she could, but it was of no use. But {{she was not going to}} take it seriously. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> say to herself, that it mattered, if she failed to teach a class to write perfectly neatly? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> take the blame unto herself? ...|$|E
60|$|Inez only laughed bitterly, {{but did not}} {{resent the}} words. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she?</b> It was not worth while.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. DUDGEON. <b>Why</b> else <b>should</b> <b>she</b> be here? D'ye think I've not {{had enough}} trouble and care put upon me {{bringing}} up my own girls, let alone {{you and your}} good-for-nothing brother, without having your uncle's bastards-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> it? Better <b>she</b> were dead--she'll be {{much more}} real. She'll be {{positive}} in death. In life she was a fretting, negated thing.' ...|$|R
60|$|So Margaret spoke, {{and then}} she sighed, remembering the reason <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not attend soap-bubble parties.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{a fierce}} desire of life seized hold of her, the angry answer of her young blood to despair. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> die, never having known {{what it was}} to live? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> {{prostrate}} herself before this juggernaut of other people's respectability? Joy called to her; only her own cowardice stayed her from stretching forth her hand and gathering it. She returned home a different woman, for hope had come to her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush! hush! hush!' {{said the}} Doctor, himself very agitated. 'Venetia loves you, only you. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> love any one else?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Even now! Why should I give up {{that much}} of you that is mine? If she could take it--But she cannot take it. If I let you go--you will do nothing. All this ambition, all these {{interests}} will dwindle and die, and she will not mind. She will not understand. She will think that she still has you. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> covet what she cannot possess? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> be given {{the thing that is}} mine--to throw aside?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{might say}} that, {{but it was}} not true; she felt that there were reasons <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> care. <b>She</b> had brought him into her life, and <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have to pay for it. But she wished to know the worst at once. [...] "Are you against our emancipation?" [...] she asked, turning a white face on him in the {{momentary}} radiance of a street-lamp.|$|R
60|$|LADY TEAZLE. Well--well I'm {{inclined}} to believe you--besides I really never could perceive <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have so any admirers.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why? <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> it be?' <b>she</b> asked. He only stood still, in the terribly {{cold air}} that moved invisibly over the {{mountain}} tops, folding her round with his arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> {{always be}} at his chambers? I {{have seen her}} there twice, Mrs. Orme. I have indeed;--with my own eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD GORING. Your {{wife will}} forgive you. Perhaps {{at this moment}} she is {{forgiving}} you. She loves you, Robert. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> not forgive? ...|$|E
60|$|Georgina wept. She {{would go}} with her God from the world's end to the world's end. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> leave him? She loved him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if {{she dies}} of any sentiment, {{it will be}} wounded vanity. Serve her right for {{allowing}} {{a man to be}} forced into marrying her. I believe she knows in her soul that he does not care about her. <b>Why</b> else <b>should</b> <b>she</b> be jealous of me, of you, and of everybody?" ...|$|R
6000|$|As for {{my mother}} I don't think she would say a word. <b>Why</b> [...] <b>should</b> <b>she?</b> But I am {{not the sort of}} man to be talked out [...] of my {{intentions}} in such a matter as this. I have set my [...] heart upon having you and nothing will ever turn me off.|$|R
60|$|Fred. If <b>she</b> be false--yet, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> I suspect her? Yet <b>why</b> <b>should</b> I not? <b>She's</b> a woman; that {{includes}} ambition and inconstancy; then, she's tempted high: 'twere unreasonable to expect <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be faithful: Well, something I have resolved, and will about it instantly; {{and if my}} friends prove faithful, I shall prevent the worst.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> {{not try to}} {{save her}} lad from capture or ambuscade such as befell the Hessian {{commissary}} with the provisions that you--" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss La Creevy {{said she}} didn't know. And <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> say she didn't know? Because {{she must have}} known whether it did or not.|$|E
6000|$|Dawn and sunset {{were the}} feet of the rainbow that spanned the day, and she saw the hope, the promise. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> travel any further? ...|$|E
6000|$|Phil. She, {{with her}} happiness, might mine create; Yet seems indulgent {{to her own}} ill fate: But she in secret hates me, sure; for <b>why,</b> If not, <b>should</b> <b>she</b> Candiope deny? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Indeed {{there is}} no reason <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> hear of it," [...] said Lord Kew, [...] "unless some obliging friend should {{communicate}} it to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> not come?" [...] Mrs. Nairn inquired. [...] "I told ye {{some time}} ago that we partly {{expected}} her. Ye were-na astonished then." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>she</b> want {{a special}} page to herself?" [...] demanded Peter Hope. [...] "Why should not the paper {{as a whole}} appeal to her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{something}} to me, Mr. Thwaite, as her friend. Is there no reason <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have treated you thus? Ask your own conscience." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{if it did}} {{not hurt}} her then, <b>why</b> <b>should</b> it hurt her again? There's old General M'Kinnon, my father's old friend, who runs about {{everywhere}} in a wheeled-chair with a leg-rest; and I can't think <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not do the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was settled}} years ago," [...] said Mrs. Furnival. [...] "Horrid, cruel man! But after all I don't see <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> mind it so much." ...|$|R
