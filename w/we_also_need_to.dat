According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received {{the highest number of}} refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, [...] "We’ve raised some red flags and said this isn’t good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed [...] "it’s going to be more difficult for the refugees to do well" [...] in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, [...] "We don’t want to get the idea out that we are not supportive of refugees. We’ve been very accepting. But <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> keep it in a ratio that's healthy for the refugees as well as the residents".|$|E

To this end, we have deøned generic correspondences [Leb 93] between relational concepts and some of the object concepts that are common to most object models. These correspondences allow to translate relational data into complex objects and conversely. They generalize the mapping proposals that we found in the literature [Lee 90, WBL+ 91, KJA 93]. An implementation of these deønitions has been realized. This is the Driver system [Leb 92] whose speciøcity is to deøne an object oriented dbms (oodbms) on a relational dbms (rdbms).

The first author used such a {{logical relation}} argument to establish strong normalising for a cut-elimination procedure in classical logic. He presented a rather complicated, but informal, proof establishing this property. The difficulties in this proof arise from a quite subtle substitution operation. We have formalised this proof in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL using the Nominal Datatype Package, closely following the first authors PhD. In the process, we identified and resolved a gap in one central lemma and a number of smaller problems in others. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> make one informal definition rigorous.
