Cuse told USA Today, [...] "We're not approaching this show {{as if we were}} doing a period piece. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a contemporary program. Our characters just happen to be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities. The Indiana Jones movies were period pieces too, but you never thought of them that way." [...] Anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series. The show was intended to be family friendly, so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations. Boam said, [...] "In the two-hour pilot Brisco doesn't even once have to shoot his gun. Our violence is cartoonish. There is no pain and suffering." [...] Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements, billboards, and even a trailer shown in movie theaters. When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993, Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell [...] "isn't the next big television star, I'll eat my desk".|$|E
500|$|One {{method was}} by {{introducing}} overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as [...] "The Pattern" [...] in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot {{over the course}} of several episodes or seasons. Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias. [...] A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production. [...] Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost, where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers. Instead, with Fringe, they were able to create [...] "clearly defined goalposts" [...] (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot. These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show's fate if known at the start. Abrams stated that [...] "There are certain details that are hugely important that I believe, if shared, will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air." [...] Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from [...] "how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell". During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that [...] "We have six to eight seasons worth of material. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to tell our complete story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Second Lifes {{status as}} a virtual world, a {{computer}} game, or a talker, is frequently debated. Unlike a traditional computer game, Second Life {{does not have a}} designated objective, nor traditional game play mechanics or rules. It can also be argued that Second Life is a multi-user virtual world, because the virtual world is centered around interaction between multiple users. As it does not have any stipulated goals, it is irrelevant to talk about winning or losing in relation to Second Life. Likewise, unlike a traditional talker, Second Life contains an extensive world that can be explored and interacted with, and it can be used purely as a creative tool set if the user so chooses. In March 2006, while speaking at Google TechTalks, Rosedale said: [...] "So, we don't see this as a game. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a platform".|$|E

2500|$|Many {{schools on}} all {{education}} levels offer service-learning programs, which {{allow students to}} serve the community through volunteering while earning educational credit. According to Alexander Astin in the foreword to Where's the Learning in Service-Learning? by Janet Eyler and Dwight E.

[...] When describing service learning, the Medical Education at Harvard says, [...] "Service learning unites academic study and volunteer community service in mutually reinforcing ways. ...service learning is characterized by a relationship of partnership: the student learns from the service agency and from the community and, in return, gives energy, intelligence, commitment, time and skills to address human and community needs." [...] Volunteering in service learning seems to have the result of engaging both mind and heart, thus providing a more powerful learning experience; according to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, it succeeds {{by the fact that it}} [...] "...fosters student development by capturing student interest..." [...] While not recognized by everyone as a legitimate approach, research on the efficacy of service learning has grown. Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles conducted a national study of American college students to ascertain the significance of service learning programs, According to Eyler and Giles,"These surveys, conducted before and after a semester of community service, examine the impact of service-learning on students." [...] They describe their experience with students involved in service-learning in this way: [...] "Students like service-learning. When we sit down with a group of students to discuss service-learning experiences, their enthusiasm is unmistakable. ...it is clear that believe that what they gain from service-learning differs qualitatively from what they often derive from more traditional instruction." ...|$|E
