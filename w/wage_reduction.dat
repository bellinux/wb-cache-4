5|$|In 1874 mine owners reduced workers' wages by ten percent. Efforts {{to rouse}} a strike in {{response}} were fruitless. The {{next two years}} saw the mines run on two-thirds time, and another <b>wage</b> <b>reduction</b> of fifteen percent was made in 1876. Again, efforts to organize a strike were ineffective.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, {{the workers}} of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in Scranton {{proposed}} that their wages be restored to that prior to the recently imposed 10% reduction. On July 24 at 12:00 P.M., 1,000 employees of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company, unaffiliated with the railroad, peacefully walked out due to their own <b>wage</b> <b>reduction.</b> The railroad workers struck at 6:00 P.M. that same day.|$|E
25|$|After the Samuel Commission's report, {{the mine}} owners {{declared}} that miners would be offered new terms of employment, which included lengthening the work day and reducing wages depending on various factors. The Miners' Federation of Great Britain refused the <b>wage</b> <b>reduction</b> and regional negotiation.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Knights of Labor {{were growing}} tremendously in the 1884-85 period. A series of {{successful}} strikes swept the country, affecting textile workers, plumbers, bricklayers, stove molders, stonecutters, carpet weavers, shoemakers, glass molders and coal miners. The Knights struck the Union Pacific Railway, forcing {{the company to}} rescind a 10 percent wage cut in 1884 and another 10 percent <b>wage</b> <b>reduction</b> the company tried to introduce the following year. In July 1885, the Knights had 104,000 members; by July 1886, they had 703,000 members.|$|E
25|$|Rieve's {{tenure as}} acting {{chairman}} saw {{the beginning of}} events which would seriously affect the union in the 1950s. The first was Rieve's ejection of the New Bedford Textile Council. The council, a federation of seven textile unions in New Bedford, Massachusetts, had been confronted by an employer demand in January 1938 to cut wages by 12.5 percent. Rather than stay silent and acquiesce in the wage cut, the council formally approved the <b>wage</b> <b>reduction.</b> The action not only angered other New England locals, but undercut TWOC organizing efforts in the region. Determined to uphold the authority of TWOC and concerned that the council's action might spark a revolt by other New England local unions, Rieve revoked the charters of the seven locals.|$|E
25|$|Millis {{returned}} to the University of Chicago. One of his students at this time was Oliver Cox, an African American who later was a noted economist. In 1937, he was appointed {{a member of the}} Illinois Commission on Unemployment and President Roosevelt appointed him to a Railway Labor Act fact-finding board in a dispute between the Chicago Great Western Railway and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. His railway panel found that the railroad should not impose a 15 percent <b>wage</b> <b>reduction</b> on the workers. Roosevelt appointed him to a second railways panel in 1938 to arbitrate a dispute between the million members of the Railway Labor Executives' Association (an umbrella group representing 18 railway labor organizations) and the Association of American Railways (which represented all long-haul railroads in the U.S.). In 1940, he sat on a third arbitration panel which resolved a long-running wage dispute between American Railway Express and its unions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{increasing}} real wages steepens or reverses {{the slope of}} the labour demand schedule because increasing wages give firms incentives to innovate and to invest in newer and more efficient vintages of capital. Using macroeconomic data for the OECD countries it is shown that the efficiency inducement of higher real wages steepens the traditional neoclassical labour demand function substantially. Taking into account the adverse demand effects of <b>wage</b> <b>reductions</b> it is doubtful that real <b>wage</b> <b>reductions</b> are a cure for the unemployment problem in the OECD countries. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors search {{information}} on the provisions of 10, 947 wage contracts signed in the Canadian unionized sector between 1976 and 1999 for evidence of downward nominal wage rigidity (the disinclination of wages to fall, in nominal dollars, below their established level). Over the sample period, real <b>wage</b> <b>reductions</b> were common, but nominal <b>wage</b> <b>reductions</b> were rare. The probability of downward nominal wage rigidity increased substantially during lowinflation periods. During such periods, apparently there was no reduction {{in the incidence of}} real wage cuts, but the magnitude of those cuts was modest, suggesting a lesser ability of wages to adjust to labor market conditions than at other times...|$|R
50|$|In 1921, the National Maritime Board imposed <b>wage</b> <b>reductions</b> {{which were}} {{supported}} by the NSFU. This acceptance of cuts in pay provoked considerable resistance from ordinary seafarers and from the rival organisations: the British Seafarers' Union and the National Union of Ship's Stewards. Other sections of the trade union and labour movement were also strongly critical of the NSFU's detrimental collusion with employers. This was especially the National Transport Workers' Federation, which helped to merge the rival organisations referred to above into a new organisation, the Amalgamated Marine Workers' Union, intended as {{a viable alternative to}} the NSFU. Further <b>wage</b> <b>reductions</b> were made in 1923, and 1925, which again outraged members.|$|R
25|$|Upon his re-election, Wallace {{indicated}} {{his intention}} to undertake a three-month review the club's business operations and it was revealed this included cuts to the first-team wage budget. The Rangers manager signed off on a <b>wage</b> <b>reduction</b> on 11 January, {{the same day as}} the club hired Philip Nash as a financial consultant to assist with the business review. Following this the club unsuccessfully asked the first-team squad to take pay cuts of around 15% until summer 2015 and as greater scrutiny was focused on the club's finances, Rangers financial director Brian Stockbridge resigned on 24 January. Indeed, in early February Wallace was forced to deny claims that the club was {{on the brink of a}} second insolvency event, however, two-weeks later Rangers borrowed £1.5m from shareholders Sandy Easdale and Laxey Partners for working capital. The loan agreement was widely criticised, as Laxey Partners stood to make £150,000 in either interest or shares by the time it was repaid and also the Albion Car Park and Edmiston House were being used as security. Despite this, prior to his court case, former director Imran Ahmad has failed to ring-fence cash at the club ahead of his now £500,000 lawsuit.|$|E
25|$|Kelly became Fourth Sea Lord in April 1924 and, {{having been}} {{promoted}} to vice-admiral on 25 October 1926, became commander of the 1st Battle Squadron and second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet with his flag in the battleship HMS Warspite in April 1927. He became the admiral commanding the reserves in August 1929 and was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 3 June 1929 before being promoted to full admiral on 12 December 1930. In September 1931 the National Government led by Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald decided to reduce the wages of all public sector employees: the <b>wage</b> <b>reduction</b> in the Royal Navy was particularly severe and led directly to the Invergordon Mutiny later that month. In {{the aftermath of the}} mutiny Kelly, known for his skill in personnel matters, was asked to take command of the Atlantic Fleet in October 1931. He insisted that the mutineers be transferred out of the fleet and his fleet be renamed the Home Fleet before he took up his new command flying his flag in the battleship HMS Nelson. He rapidly restored discipline and issued a report which was quite critical of the Admiralty Board's handling of the pay cuts issue in the first place.|$|E
500|$|Later that evening, second vice {{president}} Keyser, upon {{the request of}} the strikers, addressed a workingmen's meeting at Cross Street Market Hall, and presented the company's written response reprinted in the papers for the public. The letter, signed by both King and Keyser, stated the company's position as follows: the company would not negotiate on the matter of the 10 percent <b>wage</b> <b>reduction,</b> but it would [...] "be pleased to address itself to the investigation of any of the minor grievances of which the men complained." [...] The Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser reported a general hope that, owing to the imminent increase in traffic due to the transport of harvested crops, the firemen would be able to make daily round trips, thus avoiding layovers, and that the company could arrange for them to return home on passenger trains when this was not feasible.|$|E
50|$|The mining {{industry}} was privatised on 1 April 1921 and the mine owners immediately threatened <b>wage</b> <b>reductions.</b> The Miners' Federation of Great Britain planned a coordinated response with its {{allies in the}} Triple Alliance on Friday the 15th.|$|R

50|$|The Quota was {{accompanied}} by industrial and agricultural <b>wage</b> <b>reductions</b> in 1927, which overcompensated for the reduction in prices, decreasing the real wage and thus the purchasing power of most Italians; unemployment also rose, especially in the agricultural South.|$|R
2500|$|By 1910, Fraina {{was writing}} voluminously {{for the daily}} {{newspaper}} published by the SLP. According to Fraina's biographer, historian Paul Buhle, [...] "No one, not even DeLeon by this time, wrote more regularly for The Daily People. Fraina's most important journalistic task while {{on the staff of}} The Daily People was covering the 1912 Lawrence textile strike, one of the pivotal events of the American labor movement of that decade. This strike, in which members of some two dozen nationalities stayed out for weeks to resist a <b>wage</b> <b>reduction,</b> facing violence and arrest, was deeply influential upon Fraina. It was there that the Industrial Workers of the World had their day in the sun — and the revolutionary possibilities seemed endless.|$|E
2500|$|The 1926 {{general strike}} in the United Kingdom {{was a general}} strike that lasted 9 days, from 3 May 1926 to 12 May 1926. It was called by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to force the British government to act to prevent <b>wage</b> <b>reduction</b> and worsening conditions for 1.2 million locked-out coal miners. [...] Some 1.7 million workers went out, especially in transport and heavy industry. The government was prepared and enlisted middle class volunteers to maintain essential services. [...] There was little violence and the TUC gave up in defeat. In the long run, there was little impact on trade union activity or industrial relations. [...] Keith Laybourn says that historians mostly agree that, [...] "In no significant way could the General Strike be considered a turning point or watershed in British industrial history." ...|$|E

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the First World War, the Triple Alliance and united action in general were regarded by many trade unionists as a defence against the threat of <b>wage</b> <b>reductions</b> occasioned by the onset of economic depression. A complicating factor was that both the coal industry and railways had been controlled by the state during the war and were not immediately returned to private hands. The Coalition-Liberal Government of David Lloyd George was unwilling to impose <b>wage</b> <b>reductions,</b> as this would provoke strike action against the government, with political implications. Reductions for miners were postponed until the industry was de-controlled on 31 March 1921. Miners who refused to accept the reductions were locked out of employment.|$|R

50|$|In 1919 the NUR and ASLEF jointly {{organised}} the 1919 United Kingdom railway strike, which {{prevented a}} proposed <b>wage</b> <b>reduction</b> and won an eight-hour maximum working day. The NUR formed Federation agreements with ASLEF in 1903 and 1982 but both were short-lived.|$|E
30|$|Although {{these results}} {{illustrate}} significant <b>wage</b> <b>reductions</b> {{in response to}} the crisis, {{it is worth noting that}} the percentage experiencing earnings increases remained above 40 % throughout the period.

50|$|As a small local railway, the Severn Bridge Railway {{with its}} partner the Severn and Wye Railway {{struggled}} to make a profit.
