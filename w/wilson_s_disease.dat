40|$|Wilson disease (WD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder of copper transport caused by mutations in the ATP 7 B gene that encodes a P-type copper ATPase, ATP 7 B. In WD, a mutated dysfunctional ATP 7 B {{leads to a}} progressive accumulation of Cu in the liver and brain. Clinically, WND shows considerable phenotypic variability including fulminant hepatic failure, hemolysis, chronic liver disease, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, and neuro-psychiatric disease with or without hepatic involvement.

40|$|<b>Wilson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> (WD) is {{a genetically}} determined, {{autosomal}} recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The gene ATP 7 B encodes a copper carrier that both transports copper from hepatocyte to bile and ceruloplasmin copper incorporation. WD may present with almost any variety of liver disease {{at an age}} ranging from 4 – 12 years, or with neurological and psychiatric symptoms in adolescence. Less commonly, haemolysis and/or fulminant hepatic failure may be an initial presentation. Low plasma ceruloplasmin, a positive penicillamine challenge test, and a high hepatic copper content suggest the diagnosis. Molecular methods help in diagnosing WD. If diagnosed early, it is treatable with chelators and/or zinc, and has a good prognosis. Fulminant hepatic disease has a poor outcome without transplantation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Copper is an {{essential}} element that is required {{for a variety of}} important cellular functions. Since not only copper deficiency, but also excess of copper can seriously affect cellular functions, cellular copper metabolism is tightly regulated. Disturbances of copper homeostasis are the underlying defect of the inherited diseases Menkes and <b>Wilson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and have also been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease. Known astrocytes features strongly suggest a pivotal role of theses cells in the metal metabolism of the brain. Using astrocyte-rich primary cultures as model system, this thesis investigated the copper metabolism as well as copper-mediated alterations in the metabolism of astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes efficiently accumulated copper with saturable kinetics. The characteristics of the observed copper accumulation suggest that both copper transporter receptor 1 (Ctr 1) and a Ctr 1 -independent mechanism are involved in astrocytic copper accumulation. Cultured astrocytes were also found to release copper in a time-, concentration- and temperature-dependent manner. Copper export from these cells most likely involves the copper-ATPase ATP 7 A. Thus, with being capable of both taking up and exporting copper, astrocytes possess the cellular machinery required to transport copper from the blood-brain barrier to the brain parenchyma. Cultured astrocytes were remarkable resistance against copper-induced toxicity. Nevertheless, prolonged copper treatment led to profound alterations in their metabolism. For example, copper accumulation by cultured astrocytes was accompanied by a stimulation of glycolytic flux, an increase in the cellular glutathione content and an acceleration of glutathione export. Such copper-mediated alterations in the metabolism of astrocytes may also occur in vivo, for example in copper overload conditions such in <b>Wilson</b> <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> and could either contribute to disease progression or serve as compensatory response to protect the brain against the toxic effects of an excess of copper...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of review: To {{discuss the}} {{relationship}} between androgens, cognition and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Recent findings: It {{has been found that}} low circulating levels of androgens are a risk factor for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> Decreased circulating androgens are also associated with declining cognitive performance, particularly in memory-related tasks. Conversely, androgen supplementation to hypogonadal men results in improved memory performance. It has therefore been hypothesized that androgen supplementation may be beneficial in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> In recent studies, animal models have been used to elucidate the molecular mechanism behind this relationship between androgens and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease.</b> These studies have shown that androgen depletion results in increased levels of beta amyloid and hyperphosphorylated tau, changes which are thought to be associated with subsequent neuronal death.

40|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> is the degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, leading to depletion of striatal dopamine. Recent neuroanatomical work has identified pathways for communication across striatal subdivisions, {{suggesting that the}} striatum provides a platform for integration of information across parallel corticostriatal circuits. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether dopaminergic dysfunction in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with impairments in functional connectivity across striatal subdivisions, which could potentially reflect reduced integration across corticostriatal circuits. Utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we analyzed functional connectivity in 39 patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> both “on” and “off” their regular dopaminergic medications, along with 40 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrate widespread impairments in connectivity across subdivisions of the striatum in patients with Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> in the “off” state. The administration of dopaminergic medication significantly improved connectivity across striatal subdivisions in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease,</b> implicating dopaminergic deficits in the pathogenesis of impaired striatal interconnectivity. In addition, impaired striatal interconnectivity in the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “off” state was associated with pathological decoupling of the striatum from the thalamic and sensorimotor (SM) networks. Specifically, we found that although the strength of striatal interconnectivity was positively correlated with both (i) the strength of internal thalamic connectivity, and (ii) the strength of internal SM connectivity, in both healthy controls and the Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> “on” state, these relationships were absent in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>disease</b> when in the “off” state.
