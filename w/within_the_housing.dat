The Red Summer of 1919 was marked by hundreds of deaths and higher casualties across the U.S. as a result of race riots that occurred in more than three dozen cities, such as the Chicago race riot of 1919 and the Omaha race riot of 1919.

Overall, African-Americans in Northern cities experienced systemic discrimination in a plethora of aspects of life. Within employment, economic opportunities for blacks were routed to the lowest-status and restrictive in potential mobility. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> market, stronger discriminatory measures were used in correlation to the influx, resulting in a mix of [...] "targeted violence, restrictive covenants, redlining and racial steering".|$|E
