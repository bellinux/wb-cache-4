In this study, two samples of H. lupulus (vernalized and <b>wild</b> <b>hops)</b> were selected for further analysis about differences of their essential oils. Methods: The essential oils from the flowers of two H. lupulus (vernalized and <b>wild</b> <b>hops)</b> were achieved through hydrodistillation and analyzed via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Retention indices for all compounds were determined according to the kovats retention indices using n-alkanes series as standards. The components of the essential oils were identified by comparison of the retention indices and mass spectral data with those for the standards. Results: Analysis of the vernalized hops essential oil resulted in the identification of 64 components, representing 87. 04 % of the total essential oil that principally contained β-caryophyllene (25. 3 %), β-bisabolole (16. 7 %) and β-elemene (5. 3 %). In the case ofwild hops, 49 components were identified, representing 80. 9 % of theessential oil, among them β-bisabolole (35. 2 %), β-myrcene (13. 3 %) and β-sesquiphellandrene (11. 3 %) were the main compounds. Overall, both vernalized and <b>wild</b> <b>hops</b> possessed sesquiterpene hydrocarbons inhigher contents, followed bynon-terpenoid compounds, oxygenated sesquiterpenes and finally monoterpenoids in less amounts. Conclusion: Concerning {{the results of this study}} we found some similarities and differences among vernalized and <b>wild</b> <b>hops</b> and also in comparison with other species of the genus Humulus. Generally, mentioned similarities and differences might be attributed to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting both the quality and quantity of the obtained essential oils...|$|R

40|$|Hop (Humulus lupulus L.) is a dioecius {{perennial}} plant. The cultivation {{is specific}} for female plants, used mainly for brewing and pharmacology. Female inflorescence, known as cone or strobili, contains bitter acids, essential oil and polyphenols. Commercial hop cultivation provides better results in regions between 45 and 55 degrees {{north or south}} in latitude, an area that also includes {{the northern part of}} Italy, where hop is endemic. Despite several studies have been conducted on the characterization of wild hops biodiversity in the U. S. A. and Europe, a lack in literature concerning the description of Italian wild hops genetic variability is still present. The increasing request of hop varieties improved in important traits, like diseases, resistance and valuable aroma profile, is bringing the hop industry. Moreover, Italian agricultural sector needs new impulse to be competitive in the market. In this view, Italian <b>wild</b> <b>hop</b> biodiversity is a resource, useful for the obtaining of Italian hop varieties, characterized by peculiar aromatic traits and more adaptable to Mediterranean climate, making their cultivation more sustainable. Based on this consideration, the present Ph. D. thesis deals with the evaluation of the Italian hop biodiversity, through the characterization of the wild samples under different point of view. The project started with the recovery of <b>wild</b> <b>hop</b> samples in different areas of north of Italy to consitue a collection field, where 11 commercial cultivars of US and European origin were grown, to have a complete vision of the hop panorama. Ph. D. project followed different research lines, the results of each one contributed to completly characterize the northern Italian hop wild biodiversity: •	the morphological description showed a high phenological variability (Study 1); •	the genetic characterization confirmed the rich biodiversity of the Italian population and showed a significant genetic distance between Italian genotypes and the commercial cultivars, taken in consideration (Study 2); •	the need of an early sex discrimination method leads to an improvement of a genetic marker, developing a more efficient marker (Study 3); •	a complete morphologic, genetic and chemical analysis of plants gave results to select the most promising genotypes (Study 4); •	the comparison between the performance of wild hops and commercial cultivars in the same collection field indicated that some wild genotypes had a higher environment adaptability (Study 5); •	the evaluation of the terroir, obtained comparing commercial cultivars in the collection field and the same genotypes purchased in the market, showed the influence of the northern Italian environment on the aromatic profile (Study 5); •	a new analytical method for the revelation of bioactive metabolites and a simple extraction procedure were developed (Study 6). In conclusion, the Ph. D. thesis, contains the first characterization of Italian <b>wild</b> <b>hop,</b> made under field condition. The present study: i) permits to obtain a complete and significative description of the genotypes; ii) allows the identification of the most promising wild Italian genotypes; iii) allows the identification of commercial cultivars more adaptable the northern Italian climate...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Hop powdery mildew, {{caused by}} Podosphaera macularis Braun & Takamatsu (formerly Sphaerotheca macularis (Wallr. :Fr.) Lind, syn. S. humuli (DC.) Burrill) was not {{observed}} in Pacific Northwest hop yards until 1997, when it was discovered in Washington. Within one year, it had spread to Oregon and Idaho. This emerging disease caused severe economic losses to hop growers, {{due in part to}} the lack of resistance incorporated into commercial varieties. Despite several collection trips that increased the amount of <b>wild</b> <b>hop</b> (Humulus lupulus L.) germplasm available to researchers, there was no knowledge of its potential as a resource for resistance to P. macularis. The objectives of this study were: 1) to collect previously unrepresented native hop seed from the Southwestern United States, 2) to evaluate <b>wild</b> <b>hop</b> germplasm for resistance to P. macularis, and 3) to microscopically examine the progression of powdery mildew on different hop genotypes. Plant collecting expeditions were taken in September of 2002 and 2003 to obtain wild American hop germplasm (H. l. var. neomexicanus) from Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. During these expeditions, 60 seedlots and 28 plant accessions were obtained. This germplasm was deposited at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Clonal Germplasm Repository (NCGR), located in Corvallis, Oregon. More than 2, 100 wild (1563 North American and 107 Kazakhstani) hop seedlings, from 54 seedlots were evaluated for powdery mildew resistance. The number of resistant seedlings observed when greenhouse temperatures were > 30 °C was 218. The number of resistant seedlings decreased to 62 when greenhouse temperatures were 30 °C) prior to inoculation. The development of P. macularis on several native North American and Kazakhstani hop genotypes was observed using direct light microscopy. The disease progressed slower on native genotypes than on the susceptible H. l. 'Symphony'. Conidia on the resistant cultivar 'Nugget' produced only the primary germ tube prior to shriveling. On 3 infected native Kazakhstani genotypes, epidermal cells at the center of the colony began to collapse at 120 h, forming a lesion that continued to radiate outward. Fungal hyphae then shriveled in response to epidermal collapse. As a result of this work, new sources of resistance to powdery mildew were identified. A high percentage of resistant seedlings were observed in specific lots from Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and North Dakota. Resistant genotypes from North America and Kazakhstan may lead to germplasm releases for use in hop breeding programs. The partial resistance observed in wild hops suggests that multiple genes are involved. This type of resistance would be more durable than single gene resistance, which is easily overcome by the evolution of more virulent pathotypes...|$|E

The first written mention about local hop garden comes from 1348, {{but it is}} certain that the hop gardens were owned by brewers and church dignitaries even earlier. First, hops was grown on the monastery grounds on a large scale. Czech, and thus Saaz hops, reached its peak in the 19 th century, mainly for its fragrance, color and kontent of lupulin, and became a {{benchmark}} for determining the quality and price of hops. Kazbek is the first variety of "flavour hops" bred in the Czech Republic. Its unique sensory properties were examined with numerous brewing tests in several breweries of different sizes. Breeding of "flavour hops" is a real challenge for hop breeders. The first hop in that category, for example Citra, Amarillo, Simcoe, Bravo, were bred in the United States. Variety Kazbek was obtained by selecting progeny of the hybrid material, which has origins in Russian <b>wild</b> <b>hops.</b> It was registered in 2008 due to high stability and efficiency. Robustness and stability is expressed {{in the name of the}} variety, because Kazbek is the highest mountain of the middle Caucasus. From the brewing point of view, it belongs among the bitter types. Saaz Late variety was obtained by selecting F 1 offspring of parental combination of unfinished breeding material that is the origin of Saaz. It has a charakter of late variety. Saaz Late is an aromatic variety for the second and third hopping. Aroma is genuine, fine, hoppy. The most important quality aspect of hops is alpha acids content. Content of alpha acids has been reagularly assessed since 1981. The evaluation results show, that the alpha acids kontent in varieties Saaz Late and Kazbek is proven statistically different. Selection of suitable location is the key element for cultivation of hybrid varieties. It is very important to focus on the evaluation of natural conditions of each location. This paper shows that there is no statistically significant difference between locations Stekník and Blšany. Optimal temperature for growth and subsequent yield formation should not drop below + 7 °C in April, + 11 °C in May and from June to August should range between + 15 and + 18 °C.

Introgression {{with the}} domesticated hop plant (Humulus lupulus L., Cannabaceae) makes some {{morphological}} indentifications difficult for <b>wild</b> or heirloom <b>hop</b> plants found on wild or fallow lands. As a result, this dissertation takes an approach using DNA barcodes {{to investigate the}} proposed polytypic model for Humulus, which is mostly based on morphology. Results from two standard DNA barcode studies with fresh and herbarium materials show the genetic variability and phylogenetic relationships. In addition, putatively wild as well as unknown hop plants were sorted into three species (H. lupulus, H. scandens, and H. yunnanensis), while H. lupulus was further split into Western to Central Eurasia, East Asia, and the New World clades. Low resolution was found for the putative varieties of H. lupulus from East Asia and the New World. Furthermore, results from two chloroplast genome (plastome) barcode studies show the conserved relationships and unique evolutionary history within the Cannabaceae (s. s.). The phylogenomic analyses presented here suggest the Cannabaceae (s. s.) is much more ancient than previously proposed. With a mid-Cretaceous origin based on high bootstrap and posterior probability support on a polyphyletic tree with basal East Asian taxa, a Laurasian migration hypothesis is probable for Humulus. Compared to single or several DNA regions used to barcode plants, the plastome as a single DNA barcode supports {{the unity of the}} H. lupulus complex in a polytypic model. Further duplicate sampling on the phyloplastome tree is required to test the varietal relationships of H. lupulus from East Asian and the New World. More broadly, a large scale phylogenomic study on the Cannabaceae (s. l.) /Celtidaceae remains as a high priority for future research...|$|R
