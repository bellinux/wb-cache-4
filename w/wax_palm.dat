Its common names in Spanish show the various colours (and technical qualities) that its wood and/or bark takes according to its environment: palma blanca, palma negra, palma colorada ("white", [...] "black", and [...] "red" [...] palm, respectively). In Guaraní, it is called caranday, [...] "water palm".

Pawpaw fruits used for this study were obtained from a local farm at Aagba, in Boripe Local Government Area of Osun State, Nigeria. The fruits were grouped into four. Three of them were differently treated with each of the three <b>waxes</b> (<b>palm</b> kernel honey and chemical) using cold or dipping wax method while the fourth group served as control sample. The four samples were then stored under the same conditions of storage {{for a period of}} four weeks {{at the end of which}} they were evaluated for their chemical properties, mineral composition and antinutrients using the standard methods. The chemical analysis gives the pH (5. 380. 02 - 5. 910. 02), Reducing sugar (5. 320. 02 - 6. 400. 03) and vitamin C (22. 600. 05 - 27. 800. 05). The mineral analysis gives potassium (171. 600. 4 - 198. 700. 6), Phosphorus (148. 700. 3 - 161. 700. 4) and Iron (0. 450. 004 - 0. 640. 005).
