50|$|To {{address this}} problem, some {{wheeling}} machines {{have a hand}} adjuster close beneath the anvil yoke (also known a <b>wheel</b> <b>holder)</b> so such panels can curve underneath unobstructed. This type of machine typically has a diagonal lower 'C' shaped frame that curves lower to the floor, with a hand operated adjuster close to the anvil <b>wheel</b> <b>holder,</b> instead of the horizontal and long vertical hand adjuster shown in the above picture. A third type of adjuster moves the top wheel {{up and down with}} the bottom anvil wheel left static.|$|E

50|$|The Mini Marcos was a fibreglass-bodied coupe {{produced}} by the specialist British sports car manufacturer Marcos and {{was built on the}} Austin/Morris Mini chassis and fitted with a highly tuned Mini engine. The Corgi model Mini Marcos GT850 (341), finished in metallic red, was the first in the series of Take-Off Wheels models and was introduced in March 1968. The Rover 2000 TC (275) issued a month later in April 1968 and finished in metallic green was a new casting despite Corgi having previously issued a model of the Rover 2000, and was fitted with a clear roof panel as featured on a Rover 2000 displayed on the Triplex stand at the 1965 Earls Court Motor Show, and a plastic spare <b>wheel</b> <b>holder</b> attached to the boot lid which was a popular period extra on the real car. A rare version finished in white with a red interior also exists.|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} {{degradation of}} optical samples {{exposed to the}} effluent gases and particulate matter emanating from the payload of the space transportation system during orbital operations may be determined by measuring two optical parameters for five samples exposed to this environment, namely transmittance and diffuse reflectance. Any changes detected in these parameters {{as a function of}} time during the mission are then attributable to surface contamination or to increased material absorption. These basic functions are attained in the optical effects module by virtue of the following subsystems which are described: module enclosure; light source with collimator and modulator; sample <b>wheel</b> with <b>holders</b> and rotary drive; photomultipliers for radiation detection; processing and sequencing electronic circuitry; and power conditioning interfaces. The functions of these subsystems are reviewed and specified...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} a {{bachelor}} thesis {{work within the}} field of Product Development and is also an assignment for Thule Sweden. The work has been performed by Niclas Tjäderborn and Christian Holm, students at the Mechanical Engineering Program with major in Product Development and Industrial Design at Jönköping School of Engineering during spring the semester of 2009. The thesis work concerned {{the development of a new}} <b>wheel</b> <b>holder</b> for bike carrier for Thule Sweden. The background to the project was that the initiator wanted a more user friendly <b>wheel</b> <b>holder</b> with better design than those available on the market. The <b>wheel</b> <b>holder</b> is able to be implemented on one or several of Thule’s current wheel holders. The report continues the entire process from pre-study to the finished prototype. One of the challenges concerning the project was that the <b>wheel</b> <b>holder</b> should be able to attach bicycle wheels that have large variations in dimensions; due to this a specific investigation concerning dimensions was performed. A patent investigation was also made in order to find out what patents that currently exist. Seven different concepts with several versions have been developed during the project work, all of them created in CAD, specifically using Solidworks. After a four phase’s evaluation, one of these concepts was chosen. This final concept was further developed and a prototype was made in 3 D-printer.     The authors of this thesis would like to thank everyone that has been a great help during the thesis work. A special thanks goes to Joakim Andersson and Anders Lundgren at Thule Sweden...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project is {{to design and fabricate}} of three shelves book trucks which can make people easy in doing their daily job. Purpose of this shelves produced is to make a transportation of books, reference materials, medical charts and others materials more easy from a place to another. With application of <b>wheel,</b> <b>holder</b> and barrier at the main part, this shelves book trucks can accept at minimum two hundred (200) to three hundred (300) of books and others. Assume of the materials have been done by consider the maximum size is three to four centimetre (cm). Currently, the product that exist in the market not meet customer need, that’s why this product produced to make customer not hesitate to use it. Three shelves book trucks produced by selection the suitable materials, techniques and process which is can make the product have long-life span and can detain the load given. The ideas to produced this product is based on student’s creativity. Besides, the design that have been selected base on stability, affordable to accept load and also ability to bring anywhere because of the size and the function. There are several process that used during fabricate this product and it’s entertain in this report...|$|E

The complete kit came with a wheel, hub tire, shock-absorbing spring sprocket <b>holder,</b> <b>wheel</b> sprocket and chain, handlebar controls for choke, throttle and engine shutoff, three quart gas tank and gas line, and all necessary fittings to adapt the engine and rear wheel unit to any 26" [...] bicycle.|$|R
50|$|Capsela was a {{construction}} toy brand consisting primarily of gears and motors in spherical plastic capsules {{that could be}} connected to form various static or dynamic toys suitable for land or water. The capsules usually have six hollow octagonal connectors pointing out, where an octagonal sleeve piece bridges between two capsules. The hollow connection pegs on a capsule can have electrical or rotary adapters inside, reaching into the next capsule. There are electric motor capsules, gear capsules, switch capsules, pontoon capsules, and others; there are also battery <b>holders,</b> <b>wheels,</b> propellers, impellers, lights, wires, and other miscellaneous supporting pieces.|$|R
5000|$|On {{her maiden}} voyage in 1856, Persia struck an iceberg, but was saved by her clipper bow and the stoutness of her construction. In April, {{she took the}} Atlantic speed records in both {{directions}} with an eastbound voyage of 9 days, 10 hours, 22 minutes (13.46 kn) and a westbound voyage of 9 days, 16 hours, 16 minutes (13.11 kn). She held both records until 1863 when Cunard commissioned the Scotia, the last paddle <b>wheel</b> Atlantic record <b>holder.</b> Scotia was originally intended to be Persia's sister, but was delayed when the Collins Line collapsed. [...] When Scotia was finally built, she was a larger edition of Persia with an extra deck and power.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} the American Civil War in 1865, Inman was {{the largest}} {{passenger}} steam ship line to America, and was known for its screw-propelled ships that were economical, but not especially fast. When in 1862 Cunard commissioned , a paddle <b>wheel</b> Blue Riband <b>holder,</b> it also commissioned China, the first screw steamer in Cunard's express mail service. While China was only a knot slower than Scotia, China's coal consumption was only half of Scotia's while China carried more cargo. Cunard quickly ordered two additional screw steamers to partner the paddlers Scotia and [...] on the New York express route. Cunard also opened a secondary service for immigrants that directly competed against Inman. Inman countered Cunard by opening its own express service. With City of Paris, Tod and Macgregor started construction of five fast liners for Inman's Liverpool - New York route to rival the Cunard Line's best. In response, Cunard commissioned its own fast screw express liners, starting with Russia, which replaced Persia in 1867.|$|R
