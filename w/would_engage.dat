5|$|The {{committee}} was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having Burghers displayed in their preferred form: {{the work was}} {{placed in front of}} a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.|$|E

At the same time, the university denied tenure to international studies assistant professor Mehrene Larudee, {{a strong supporter of}} Finkelstein, despite unanimous support from her department, the Personnel Committee and the dean. Finkelstein stated that he <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> in civil disobedience if attempts were made to bar him from teaching his students.|$|E
5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to The Book of the Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, The Book of the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} The Book of the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon had {{calculated}} that Kutuzov, expecting reinforcements from Russia {{to defend its}} political allies, would withdraw toward Vienna; he envisioned that his and Kutuzov's armies <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> in a great battle at Vienna, and that this battle would decide the war. Consequently, Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the Grande Armée {{to create a new}} VIII Corps. This corps was to secure the north shore of the Danube, block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and, more importantly, prevent Kutuzov from crossing the river and escaping to Russia.|$|E
5|$|Tadeusz Kościuszko {{proposed}} a plan where the entire Polish army would be concentrated and <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> {{one of the}} Russian armies, in order to assure numerical parity and to boost the morale of mostly inexperienced Polish forces with a quick victory; this plan was however rejected by Prince Poniatowski. (Only a few months ago, however, both commanders had the opposite idea – Poniatowski wanted the troops concentrated, and Kościuszko, dispersed). Poniatowski also planned to avoid serious engagements {{in the first phase}} of the war, hoping to receive the expected Prussian reinforcements of 30,000 which would bring parity to the two sides.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} had changed again by 1918, when tank attacks would have one tank every 100 or , with a tank company of 12–16 tanks per objective. One section of each {{company would be}} out in front, with {{the remainder of the}} company following behind and each tank providing protection for an infantry platoon, who were instructed to advance, making use of available cover and supported by machine gun fire. When the tanks came across an enemy strong point, they <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> the defenders, forcing them into shelter and leaving them to the devices of the following infantry.|$|E
5|$|The {{vessels that}} {{eventually}} became the Iowa-class battleships were born from the US Navy's War Plan Orange, a Pacific war plan against Japan. War planners {{anticipated that the}} US fleet <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> and advance in the Central Pacific, with {{a long line of}} communication and logistics that would be vulnerable to high-speed Japanese cruisers. The chief concern was that the US Navy's traditional 21-knot battle force would be too slow to force these Japanese task forces into battle, while faster carriers and cruiser escorts would be outmatched by the Japanese Kongō-class battlecruiser, which had been upgraded in the 1930s to fast battleships. Even during the development process of the North Carolina-class and South Dakota-class battleships, designs that could achieve 30 knots were seriously considered.|$|E
5|$|At 08:30 on {{the morning}} of 18 December, a small boat sailed from Anse la Barque with a message {{offering}} the British a temporary truce. Simultaneously the British ship of the line HMS Sceptre arrived from Fort Royal on Martinique under the command of Captain Samuel James Ballard, who immediately assumed command of the diverse squadron assembled {{at the entrance to the}} bay. Ballard dismissed the French negotiators and ordered an immediate attack on the anchored frigates. His plan was simple: Blonde and Thetis would enter the harbour and engage the flûtes directly, while Sceptre and Freija <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> the gun batteries to prevent them targeting the small brigs bringing up the rear. The brigs would be towing boats full of sailors and Royal Marines, who would storm the French ships and gun positions as they were engaged with the larger warships.|$|E

5|$|News {{arrived from}} eastern Albania that the Ottomans had {{initiated}} massacres in the area. The pope was distressed by this {{and called on}} the Christian princes of Europe to aid Skanderbeg. Soon after, Mehmed's men marched into Albania. Unlike his father Murad II, Mehmed considered {{that the only way}} Albania could be conquered would be through isolating Krujë, the main Albanian fortress, by reducing Skanderbeg's manpower, supplies, and political and moral backing. Afterwards, Krujë would be put under siege. The Ottoman campaign was thus sent in two directions: one through the Shkumbin River valley and another through the Black Drin River valley. Both fielded men in the frontier regions, right and left of both valleys, and <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> in massacring the local populations, raiding inhabited areas, and burning every village which offered resistance. The populations thus decided to flee into safe areas.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarians, using {{information}} from escaped prisoners of war, determined that Entente forces <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> in hostile actions west of lake Ohrid, in Monastir, Dobro Pole or Human. On 27 August, the 2nd and 3rd Bulgarian Divisions stationed at Dobro Pole {{were ordered to}} make emergency preparations, as new evidence indicated a frontal assault on Dobro Pole along with a secondary attack on Human. By 7 September, Dobro Pole was reinforced by one machine gun company, six battalions and ten heavy howitzers, the head of Army Group Scholtz General Friedrich von Scholtz then stated that the defensive measures made {{the defense of the}} front feasible. Scholtz had failed {{to take into account the}} departure of Bulgarian chief of staff Nikola Zhekov and his subsequent replacement by Georgi Todorov. Widespread insubordination and desertions also plagued the Bulgarian troops who refused to participate in fortification works; poor rations and fatigue contributed to the low morale.|$|E
5|$|The {{commanding}} officer of the 5th Military District, Major General Andrija Rašeta, in overall command of the JNA intervention, told the media that his men were not protecting either side and were there only to prevent ethnic confrontations for an indeterminate period. However, the Croatian government reacted furiously to the JNA move. Tuđman's aide, Mario Nobilo, claimed that the JNA had told Croatian officials that it <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> the police {{if they did not}} leave Plitvice. In a radio address, Tuđman said that the JNA would be regarded as a hostile army of occupation if its course of action remained unchanged. On 2 April, the JNA handed the Croatian authorities an ultimatum, requesting the police leave Plitvice. The special police left Plitvice the same day, but the 90 officers staffing the newly established police station remained in place.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1943, as the Luftwaffe {{took the}} fight to the bombers flying unescorted over the Reich, Specht scored regularly. Leading by example, he soon {{became one of the}} top Viermot aces {{shooting}} down 14 bombers out of his 18 victories that year. This included his 13th victory on 26 July, during Blitz Week, when bombers targeted the Blohm & Voss U Boat yards in Hamburg and the synthetic rubber factories of Continental AG and Nordhafen in Hanover.; as well a pair on 17 August on the infamous Schweinfurt raid. He was awarded the Ehrenpokal (Goblet of Honour) on 23 August, and the German Cross in Gold on 25 November. Specht became increasingly critical of the relatively weak armament of the Bf 109 during this time. Towards the end of 1943, with longer-ranged fighter-escorts accompanying the Allied bombers, tactics had to change: The single-engined fighters <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> the fighter screen while a Zerstörergruppe would take on the bombers. Coincidentally, for a while Specht’s II./JG 11 was paired up with his old unit, I./ZG 26.|$|E
5|$|As the {{bombardment}} {{of the city}} proved to be unsuccessful, Montgomery then began to plan for an assault. Montgomery was to assault the Lower Town district, {{the part of the}} city near the river shore, while Arnold was to attack and take the Cape Diamond Bastion, a strong part of the city walls on the highest point of the rocky promontory. Montgomery believed that they should attack during a stormy night, therefore the British {{would not be able to}} see them. On December 27, the weather became stormy, and Montgomery ordered that the men prepare to attack. However, the storm soon subsided and Montgomery called off the attack. As Montgomery waited for a storm, he was forced to revise his plans, because a deserter communicated the original plan to the defenders. In the new plan, Montgomery would attack the Lower Town from the south and Arnold would attack the Lower Town from the north. After breaking through the walls, Montgomery and Arnold would meet up in the city and then attack and take the Upper Town, causing resistance to collapse. To increase their chance of surprise, Montgomery planned two feints. One detachment of troops (the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston) would set fire to one of the gates while another (under the command of Jacob Brown) <b>would</b> <b>engage</b> the guard at Cape Diamond Bastion and fire rockets to signal the start of the attack. While the feints were conducted, artillery would fire into the city. Although Montgomery was reluctant to attack, enlistments for Arnold's men were expiring on January 1, and he was concerned about losing their services.|$|E
