40|$|Abstract: Optically {{reconfigurable}} gate arrays, which consist simply of a holographic memory, a {{laser diode}} ar-ray, and a gate array VLSI, have a perfect parallel programmable capability. Even if a gate array VLSI includes defective areas, the perfect parallel programmable capability allows perfectly avoidance of those defective areas; instead, the remaining area on the gate array is used. Therefore, the architecture enables fabrication of large die VLSI chips and even <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> <b>integrations</b> using the latest processes with a high fraction of defects. Moreover, holographic memory is well-known to have high defect-tolerance because each bit of a reconfiguration context {{can be stored in}} the entire holographic memory and the damage of some component rarely affects its diffraction pattern or reconfiguration context. Therefore, the architecture has a high manufacturing-defect tolerance. In this paper, the high manufacturing-defect tolerance of optically programmable architectures is clarified using a single context prototype optically programmable architecture, which combines a liquid crystal spatial light modulator as a holographic memory, a He-Ne laser, and a perfectly parallel optically programmable gate-array VLSI.

40|$|One {{important}} goal of micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) development is to seamlessly interface microelectronics with the non-electronic world {{in an integrated}} manner. In the mean time, integrated micro fluidic devices and systems are expected to extract biomedical information in ways similar to how IC-chips process electrical current. Therefore, functional integration and fabrication process integration are the keys and challenges to MEMS development. This work is first devoted to developing novel low-temperature MEMS fabrication technologies that use Parylene as a micro-structural material. A bromine trifluoride (BrF 3) gas phase silicon etching method for micromachining is then developed. Combining with the Parylene processes, BrF 3 etching method plays important roles in bulk silicon etching, the release of Parylene freestanding structures and silicon surface treatment. The developed technology facilitates <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> post-CMOS <b>integration</b> and integrated micro fluidic systems. Using this technology, a Parylene-based electro-spray chip for protein mass spectrometry, a single chip micro check valve, an in-channel normally closed check valve, and a fully integrated shear stress sensor are successfully designed, fabricated, and tested. ...|$|R

40|$|Integrated circuit size (and hence complexity) {{is limited}} by the fact that chips created using current design {{techniques}} will not function correctly in the presence of even a single circuit defect. This research examines the problem of constructing chips up {{to the size of the}} wafer (<b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> <b>integration)</b> that operate correctly despite the occurrence of such flaws. We concentrate on a particular family of parallel processors, configurable, highly parallel (CHiP) processors. ^ The key problem in the implementation of <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> <b>integration</b> is structuring the wafer so that only the functional PEs are connected together. A methodology, the two level hierarchy, that efficiently and economically solves the structuring problem for CHiP processors is presented. The principle elements are the use of column exclusion with high yield building blocks that contain redundant components. This approach limits the performance degradation due to structuring and allows the structuring problem to be solved with tractable computational effort. ^ Since the yield of building blocks must be high for the two level hierarchy to be a practical approach, yield phenomena are investigated in detail. A model of the integrated circuit manufacturing process is developed that predicts circuit yield and the probability distribution of manufacturing defects. These results are applied to the analysis of parallel processors in which several PEs occupy a single chip. In addition, they are used to design the building blocks meeting the requirements of the column exclusion strategy. ^ It was shown that these building blocks can be assembled into a wafer scale CHiP processor. With current technology, it is possible to fabricate a wafer scale system with 250 to 300 PEs. This represents a truly large parallel machine. Furthermore, this machine is highly robust to faults occurring during the machine 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime, consumes a manageable amount of power and can be efficiently tested. ^ Although the techniques for implementing <b>wafer</b> <b>scale</b> <b>integration</b> were developed for CHiP processors, they can be applied to other system composed of uniform parts. ...|$|E
