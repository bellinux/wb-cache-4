40|$|Abstract Background For {{parents and}} {{caregivers}} of food hypersensitive (FH) children, accommodating their child’s dietary needs <b>when</b> <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> {{can be a}} challenging experience. This study explored caregivers’ experiences and behaviours <b>when</b> <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> with their FH child {{in order to gain}} insights into how they support and prepare their child in negotiating safe <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> experiences. Methods A cross-sectional, qualitative design was used. In depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with 15 caregivers of children with FH. Interviews were analysed using framework analysis. Results Caregivers reported a number of issues relating to <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> with their FH child, or allowing their child to <b>eat</b> <b>out</b> without their supervision. Through themes of ‘family context’, ‘child-focused concerns’, and ‘venue issues’, caregivers described how they managed these and explained the limitations and sacrifices that FH imposed on their child, themselves, and family members. Conclusions Through deeper understanding of the anxieties, negotiations and compromises experienced by caregivers of children with FH <b>when</b> they are <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> clinicians and support charities can tailor their support {{to meet the needs of}} caregivers and children. Support and education provision should focus on providing caregivers of children with FH the tools and strategies to help enable safe <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> experiences...|$|R

However, restaurants that serve and claim Yaksun mainly focus on stamina foods. A consistent definition of Yaksun {{has not been}} provided, which can confuse the public interpretation of Yaksun. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the perception of Yaksun in Korean adults living in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Chungbuk regions. Among the participants (M= 55, F= 168, 25 y), only 10. 4 % understood the definition of Yaksun (mainly through the broadcast media). The frequency of Yaksun consumed <b>when</b> <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> was 2 ~ 3 times per month in 50. 2 % of participants. The main reason for choosing a Yaksun menu (46. 3 % of participants) <b>when</b> <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> was for health. The mean satisfaction score of Yaksun was 3. 5 ± 0. 8 on the five point Likert scale. Participants highly agreed (3. 8 ± 0. 8) that Yaksun is composed of nutritious foods combined with oriental medicinal herbs for the treatment of disease, which was significantly higher in groups with learning experience on Yaksun (p< 0. 05). Interestingly, participants showed neutral to the description, that a diet without oriental medicinal herbs is not Yaksun (3. 1 ± 1. 0), which was significantly different between genders (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Consumers now demand {{higher quality}} {{in all aspects}} of life. This has had a {{particular}} effect on the food industry where the need for quality encompasses both food safety and sensory characteristics. The sous vide process was developed to produce food on a large scale but with superior sensory qualities compared to the products of cook-chill and cook-freeze systems. This research aimed to determine whether the sous vide process could produce meals with superior sensory properties as claimed. A literature survey indicated that craft-based assessors (chefs) claimed improved qualities in sous vide products which were not consistently supported by sensory analysts (scientists). Empirical studies were conducted to test whether sous vide and conventionally processed dishes could be distinguished by untrained assessors in a controlled laboratory environment and with assessors in an ecologically valid environment, a restaurant. In the laboratory, the sous vide meals were easily distinguishable from and less acceptable than the conventionally produced dish. In the restaurant, few significant differences were found. Thus the ecologically valid environment of the restaurant where the many extrinsic factors affect consumers' perceptions, effectively masked differences between the sous vide and conventionally prepared meals. To explore the reasons for this, a survey (n 188) was conducted to determine the relative importance of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting the acceptability of foods <b>when</b> <b>eating</b> <b>out.</b> Results included a factor analysis which clearly showed components of 'customer care' had the greatest influence on the pleasure of <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> followed by 'drink', and the absence of 'entertainment'. The factor which included 'enjoyment of food' was eleventh in the level of influence. Two scales were also devised to assess consumers' attitudes towards complaining about problems with meals and towards the technology used to produce them. This work has demonstrated that although consumers assume that the intrinsic qualities of food are the most important facator giving them pleasure <b>when</b> <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> many extrinsic factors will have a much greater influence on affecting their overall pleasure from the experience...|$|R

Thirty-one freshman football players at a National Collegiate Athletic Association division I school completed a self-administered nutrition screening question-naire designed to determine their dietary practices and at-titudes. Fasting blood samples were collected and height and weight were measured. The mean age of these athletes was 18 years. These players reported eating 3. 6 times per day and on the average <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> 4. 8 times per week. Fast food was the most common choice <b>when</b> <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> (55 %).

The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), a clearly specified model and good predictor of fruit and vegetable intake, was used as a framework to guide a formative research for the development of health messages targeting individuals at either a non-intentional or intentional stage of change. A mix-method approach was used, combining eight focus groups (n = 45) and a questionnaire (n = 390). Target beliefs for people at both stages were identified under five theoretical constructs (risk perception, outcome expectancies, action planning, coping planning and self-efficacy). Highlighting health problems due to low fruit and vegetable consumption, health benefits, weight reduction and pleasure, and enhancing self-efficacy to increase fruit and vegetable intake are the main guidelines for designing messages to non-intenders. For intenders, messages should reassure them of their ability to maintain adequate fruit and vegetable consumption, outline specific plans for increased consumption, identify barriers such as preparation, forgetting or being tired and unwilling to eat fruit and vegetables, and suggest strategies to overcome them, such as presenting some practical examples on how to include fruit and vegetables <b>when</b> <b>eating</b> <b>out...</b>|$|R

40|$|Adherence and non-adherence to a {{gluten-free}} diet (GFD) may impact negatively on health-related {{quality of}} life (HRQoL). Understanding {{the factors that influence}} compliance could help inform management and also guide support. With a particular focus on adolescence, this narrative review critiques current literature on the burdens associated with following a GFD and the factors associated with adherence. Studies highlight a variety of burdens faced by individuals with coeliac disease, including the cost, access and availability of gluten-free (GF) foods, as well as the dilemmas experienced <b>when</b> <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> travelling and socialising with friends. A number of studies report that adolescents face stigmatisation and feel isolated in social situations and at school. Additional burdens that are highlighted are a lack of knowledge regarding CD and GFD difficulties in interpreting food labels, as well as dissatisfaction with the organoleptic properties of GF foods. Factors associated with poor adherence in adolescence include older age, an absence of immediate symptoms, difficulties <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> and poor palatability of GF foods. Conversely, better emotional support and stronger organisation skills have been associated with superior adherence. Significant associations have been reported between HRQoL measures and adherence, although the findings are inconsistent. Limitations in research methodologies exist and data are restricted to just a few countries. Further research specific to adolescence is required to identify independent predictors of adherence.
