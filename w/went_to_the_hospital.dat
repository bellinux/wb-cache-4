25|$|It was a {{cultural}} norm {{for women to}} have their babies at their home or their mother's home, and professional medical attention was not sought unless there was a problem. This meant that when Allison handled deliveries, {{they were more likely}} to be due to prenatal complications. To treat these cases, Dr. Allison often needed to leave the hospital to make house calls. Some women died due to complications in their homes. Over time, more pregnant women <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> for prenatal care and delivery.|$|E

In one incident, Danny's mother <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> after claiming her husband tried to make her cut herself with a razor blade. Claudia made repeated attempts to leave her husband but always returned.

25|$|Zoya Phan {{was born}} in Manerplaw, then the {{headquarters}} of the Karen National Union (KNU), on 27 October 1980, the second of her parents' three biological children. Her father was Padoh Mahn Sha Lah Phan, General Secretary of the KNU, and her mother was Nant Kyin Shwe, a former soldier for the KNU. Zoya got her unusual name from her father, who named her after the Russian World War II hero Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya because he saw several parallels between the Soviet fight against the Nazis and the Karen struggle against the Burmese government. She spent most of her early life in a Karen village called Per He Lu, an hour's walk away from the KNU headquarters in Manerplaw. When she was six, she began to spend more time in Manerplaw, and it was there she had her first exposure to the fighting in Burma, as land mine victims frequently <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> there for treatment.|$|E
25|$|Patient G.D. was a {{white male}} born in 1940 {{who served in the}} Navy. He was {{diagnosed}} with chronic renal failure and received hemodialysis treatment {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1983, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> for elective parathyroidectomy. He also had a left thyroid lobectomy because of the severe loss of blood in his left lobe. He began having cardiac problems as a result of the surgery and became very agitated. Even five days after being released from the hospital he was unable to remember what had happened to him. Aside from memory impairment, none of his other cognitive processes seemed to be affected. He did not want to be involved in much research, but through memory tests he took with doctors, they were able to ascertain that his memory problems were present for the next 9.5 years until his death. After he died, his brain was donated to science, photographed, and preserved for future study.|$|E

25|$|After encountering rifle {{fire from}} armed {{guards at the}} Alstahaug plane wreck Branger decided to {{continue}} on to Sandnessjøen to free the wounded Germans held there. Landing at Sandnessjøen at 1730hrs, Branger and an Unteroffizier armed themselves and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> where they demanded {{the release of the}} wounded Germans held there. Although the chief physician refused to release the Germans the police commissioner at nearby Nesna ordered him to comply with the Germans' demands. While the Germans attempted to gain the release of their comrades Honningsvåg arrived at Sandnessjøen. Løytnant Plyhn contacted the district commander in Bodø and was ordered to seize the He 59 and capture the Germans. Oberstleutnant Branger and the Unteroffizier were the first to be taken prisoner, while the two Germans remaining with the seaplane refused to budge and stayed on board until Plyhn approached them alone and after firing a warning shot took them prisoner. The captured Germans were handed over to the police. The He 59 proved impossible to remove due to low tide. After attempts to pull it free had damaged the pontoons and wings beyond repair, it was towed out on the Leirfjord and sunk on 18 May.|$|E
25|$|In late 2002, Big Show {{was traded}} to SmackDown!, {{immediately}} challenging Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship. During this time, Big Show adopted a new attire, donning black jeans and taking on a new hairstyle and facial hair. Big Show became a two-time WWE Champion defeating Brock Lesnar at Survivor Series, ending Lesnar's undefeated streak with help from Paul Heyman. He lost the title to Kurt Angle a month later at Armageddon. At the Royal Rumble, Big Show lost a Royal Rumble qualifying match to Lesnar. He then began feuding with The Undertaker, after Big Show threw him off the stage, injuring his neck, leading to Big Show and his partner A-Train losing to The Undertaker at WrestleMania XIX. He renewed his feud with Lesnar, wrestling him four times for the WWE title (including a Stretcher match at Judgment Day), but was unsuccessful {{in his attempt to}} regain the title. On the June 12, 2003 episode of SmackDown!, Lesnar superplexed Big Show off the ropes and the ring imploded, two ring posts moved and three rows of ropes came down. The referee called for the event physician Dr. Burke, EMTs, medics, trainers, and even more referees. This kept the title in Lesnar's hands and both <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> On the June 26, 2003 episode of SmackDown!, Big Show, Shelton Benjamin, and Charlie Haas defeated Mr. America (a disguised Hulk Hogan), Brock Lesnar, and Kurt Angle in a six-man tag team match when Show pinned Mr. America.

Because of its proximity to the hospital, the shop received medical students and doctors as visitors. One of these was the surgeon Frederick Treves who arranged to have Merrick brought into the hospital to be examined. According to Norman's autobiography, Merrick <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> [...] "two or three" [...] times, but then refused to go any more, as the examinations made him feel [...] "like an animal in a cattle market".|$|E
500|$|After leaving Connecticut on a Sunday {{morning in}} 2007 for Monday Night Football in Pittsburgh, Scott had a {{stomachache}}. After the stomachache worsened, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> {{instead of the}} game and later had his appendix removed. After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer. Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix. After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy. By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC's NBA Christmas Day studio show. Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy. Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: [...] "One of the coolest things about having cancer, and I know that sounds like an oxymoron, is meeting other people who've had to fight it. You have a bond. It's like a fraternity or sorority." [...] When Scott returned to work and people knew of his cancer diagnosis, the well-wishers felt overbearing for him as he just wanted to talk about sports, not cancer.|$|E

She serves in the honorary position of ambassador for the program leading the federal government's effort to give women a [...] "wake up call" [...] {{about the risk of}} heart disease. She commented on the disease: [...] "Like many women, I assumed heart disease was a man's disease and cancer was what we would fear the most. Yet heart disease kills more women in our country than all forms of cancer combined. When it comes to heart disease, education, prevention, and even a little red dress can save lives." [...] She has undertaken a signature personal element of traveling around the country and talking to women at hospital and community events featuring the experiences of women who live, or had lived, with the condition. This outreach was credited with saving the life of one woman who <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E

He was able to hobble around, and did some staff work, then flew to General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa. He stayed there until mid-January, when he was sent to Walter Reed Hospital back in the United States. While Middleton was at Walter Reed, General Eisenhower communicated to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he needed Middleton back overseas. Acknowledging Middleton's difficulty with his knees, Eisenhower said, [...] "I don't give a damn about his knees; I want his head and his heart. And I'll take him into battle on a litter if we have to." [...] Command of the 45th Division went to Major General William W. Eagles.|$|E
