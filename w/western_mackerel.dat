40|$|The latest years, it {{is evident}} that most of the {{mackerel}} present in the North Sea belongs to the Western stock, since the yearly catches by far exceed the presumed size of the North Sea stock. The Norwegian tagging data have been revised to obtain estimates of the percentage of <b>Western</b> <b>mackerel</b> in the catches in the North Sea. By combining these data with the distribution of catches, a reasonable estimate of the migration of the <b>Western</b> <b>mackerel</b> to the North Sea may be obtained...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary {{analysis of the}} fecundity-length relationship of the North Sea mackerel. The relationship was {{compared to that of}} the <b>Western</b> <b>mackerel</b> stock (LOCKWOOD, 1978) by an analysis of covariance between the regression lines. Further analysis is necessary before any decisive conclusion can be drawn. The results, however, seem to demonstrate a lower fecundity in the North Sea mackerel (140 000 - 360 000 eggs) as compared to the <b>Western</b> <b>mackerel</b> (400 000 - 990 000 eggs) at the same range of length.

40|$|An {{optimising}} {{model is}} developed to determine the. {{sequence of total}} allowable catches of <b>western</b> <b>mackerel</b> which {{would result in the}} maximum present value of the stream of annual rents. It is found that the optimal steady state fishing mortality would be one half to one third of recent levels. For the base formulation of the model the optimal plan calls for periodic fishing, with a moratorium on fishing for the first two years, and for a very substantial catch in the third year. The sensitivity of pulse fishing as an optimal strategy is tested with respect to number of solution iterations, asymmetric charges for increasing fleet capacity, quadratic adjustment costs, harvesting stock effects, the rate of discount, and the price elasticity of demand for mackerel. dynamic programming, optimal control, <b>western</b> <b>mackerel,</b> total allowable catch, periodic fishing, Environmental Economics and Policy, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the <b>western</b> Atlantic <b>mackerel</b> stock has expanded, {{resulting}} in an earlier start of spawning and earlier occurrence of the mackerel peak of spawning. In 2014 and 2015, mackerel winter spawning surveys have been conducted to determine the start date of mackerel spawning in the western area.

40|$|Abstract In 2006 the {{stakeholders}} of the Pelagic Regional Advisory Council (Pe-lagic rac) contacted {{scientists with}} expertise on <b>western</b> horse <b>mackerel</b> {{and asked them}} to assist the rac in developing a long-term management plan. This article reports on that process and contributes to the knowledge of best practices for interactive processes between scientists and stakeholders. Overall, the partici-pants considered the process, which led to the first step of the implementation of the management plan from 2008, as a considerable success.

40|$|The <b>western</b> horse <b>mackerel</b> {{stock is}} {{currently}} managed by annual TACs covering {{only part of}} its distribution area. No stock assessment has been accepted and recent ICES advice has consistently been for status quo catches. In 2006, the Pelagic Regional Advisory Committee asked scientists to help with developing a harvest control rule for the stock that would both meet conservation and stability objectives. An initial questionnaire was circulated to the industry, to elicit feedback on possible management options. A series of Harvest Control Rules were developed. These were tested by simulation and presented to the RAC {{at a number of}} meetings. Results will be presented within the ICES advisory process and elsewhere in the scientific literature. This is a developing approach involving scientists and stakeholders in an iterative process. The problems encountered and lessons learned, are discussed.

40|$|Length, {{weight and}} age in random samples from Norwegian catches of' {{mackerel}} from 1960 to 1985 have been reviewed. A standard growth curve was constructed by applying a modified von Bertalanffy equation to all data. The deviation from this curve is largely independent of age for adult mackerel, {{and may be}} used as a measure of the growth pattern. In the North Sea area, the length at age has increased gradually by 4 - 5 cm during this period, while it has been nearly stationary in the western spawning area. The condition has remained stable in this period. The mackerel caught in the North Sea is generally larger at age than the typical <b>Western</b> <b>mackerel,</b> even in the years and seasons when <b>Western</b> <b>mackerel</b> dominated in the cathes in the North Sea. The mixing of two stock components with different growth patterns also makes the use of length distributions as a measure of age distributions questionable...|$|E

40|$|The {{ecosystems}} {{with their}} relationships between fish species and stocks, {{have been established}} by evolution for millions of years, but only during the last 50 years, the ecosystems in the North Sea and along the Norwegian coast have been changed fundamentally by fisheries. The North Sea mackerel stock has been depleted and its feeding grounds have {{been taken over by}} the <b>Western</b> <b>mackerel</b> which spawns west of Ireland. This stock is now very rich in numbers and distributes into the North sea, the Norwegian sea and the western Barents Sea. If the stock of <b>Western</b> <b>mackerel</b> is allowed to grow further it may outcompete many of the other fish stocks in the area. 50 years ago there was a large stock of sandeel, which spawned in the North Sea and on the Norwegian coast. Sandeel juveniles was an important food source {{for a wide range of}} species, including sea mammals and birds. The fact that this stock has also been overfished, may explain many of the changes seen in the ecosystem on the west coast of Norway, for example a large reduction in the populations of sea birds. There are indications that ecosystems shift to sustain jellyfish blooms in response to depletion of forage fish stocks. This was registered in Namibia in the 1990 ’s, where the pilchard stock was decimated and the biomass of jellyfish was overwhelming. On the west-coast of Norway, there are now frequent blooms of jellyfish, yet another indication that sandeel, a key species in the transfer of nutrients from zooplankton to higher trophic levels in the area, has been depleted. In this paper, I give a description of the situation and some suggested measures that should be taken in fisheries management. ...|$|E
40|$|Observations of {{fecundity}} {{from the}} 2001 <b>western</b> horse <b>mackerel</b> spawning-stock biomass survey {{suggest that the}} species is an indeterminate spawner. Therefore, estimates of fecundity based on biological analyses and until recently used in the calibration of the stock assessment are now questioned. The stock is assessed by fitting a linked Separable and ADAPT VPA-based model to the catch-at-age data and to the egg production estimates. Currently, {{the assumption is that}} egg production and spawning-stock biomass are linked by a constant but unknown fecundity parameter, estimated within the model. In this study, the effects of introducing relationships linking biological indicators of fecundity, such as lipid content or feeding intensity during the spawning season, to actual fecundity are examined within a simulation framework. Simulations suggest that when the underlying relationships between fecundity and the proxy are poorly described, weak, or based on a relatively short time-series of data, the assumption of constant fecundity will result in better management advice than using the prox...|$|R
40|$|Biomass {{estimates}} {{are made by}} combining ICES working group VPA biomass esti-mates of 11 commercial fish species with catch rates in the ICES International Young Fish Surveys (1 YFS) {{in the first quarter}} of the year and in the English Groundfish Surveys (EGFS) in the third quarter of the year. Data from 1983, 1984, and 1985 are used. The total biomass of fish is calculated as the mean of the three years. In the first three months of the year the mean total biomass was 8. 6 million tonnes, of which the 11 commercial species constituted 5. 9 million tonnes. In the third quarter it was 13. 1 million tonnes, of which the 11 commercial species constituted 8. 5 million tonnes. The difference between the first and third quarters was mainly caused by the migra-tion of 0. 5 million tonnes of <b>Western</b> stock <b>mackerel</b> and 1. 6 million tonnes of horse mackerel into the North Sea during the third quarter.

40|$|Recently {{collected}} data support earlier indications {{of the value}} of the plerocercus of the trypanorhynch oestone Grillotia angeli as a biological tag for estimating the size of the Western stock component in populations of adult mackerel, Scomber scombrus L., of mixed stock composition. During 1981, three samples of mackerel were examined from the northern North Sea, one from the Norwegian Sea and one from off the north coast of Scotland. The proportion of <b>Western</b> stock <b>mackerel</b> in each of these samples was estimated by comparing the prevalence rate of G[?]angeli in each sample with the mean prevalence rate in mackerel samples from the western English Channel. The results indicate that some <b>mackerel</b> samples of <b>Western</b> stock origin do not return to Western stock spawning grounds but remain in the North Sea to spawn.

40|$|Probability {{distributions}} for the recruitment, {{conditional on}} the spawning stock biomass (SSB) were made using a kernel method.

Examples are given for 3 stocks, <b>Western</b> <b>mackerel,</b> North Sea sandeel and North Sea herring. Three management strategies were studied, a fixed F, a fixed yearly catch and a regime aiming at stabilizing the SSB. Due to the variable recruitment, attempts to stabilize the SSB increases the year to year variations in the yield.

SkagenThe Working Group on the Assessment of Mackerel, Horse Mackerel, Sardine and Anchovy (WGMHSA) met in Vigo from 5 - 16 September, {{to assess}} and provide catch options for four {{different}} pelagic species widely distributed in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. The WG reports {{on the status of}} all 7 stocks (see Fig. 0. 1 for stock definitions), and in case of Sardine also on the status of the species distributed outside current stock definitions. This year a benchmark analytical assessment is available for Anchovy in Biscay and update analytical assessments are available for Northeast-Atlantic Mackerel and Sardine in VIIIc and IXa. <b>Western</b> Horse <b>mackerel</b> is in a benchmark year, so an in-depth exploratory analysis was carried out using several models (with different assumptions) as well as exploring the signals in the input data. Southern horse mackerel and Gulf of Cadiz anchovy assessments are still in a developmental stage, whilst no assessment was possible for North Sea horse mackerel. Northeast-Atlantic (NEA) Mackerel. This species is distributed in the whole ICES area and currently supports one of the most valuable European fisheries (with more than 600 kt annual landings). Mackerel is fished by a variety of fleets (ranging from open boats using hand lines on the Iberian coasts to large freezer trawlers and Refrigerated Sea Water (RSW) vessels in the Northern Area. The stock is historically divided into three components, with the North Sea component considered to be over fished since the late 1970 s, and the Western component contributing the vast majority of biomass and catch to the combined stock. The quality of sampling data remains good. There is an extensive exploration section examining the trade offs in assessing the NEA mackerel stock with the available data and model formulations. This year the issue of accuracy of the catch data has been addressed, and indicates that data on both the accuracy of landings and estimates of total discards is inadequate. The WG carried out an update assessment applying the same approach as accepted by ACFM last year. The assessment indicates that the declining trend of the stock has not continued, but that F in 2004 was above Fpa and outside the management agreement. The exploration exercise concludes that although the trend in SSB and F and the level of F can be estimated without bias from the existing data, that the true level of SSB cannot be estimated without knowledge of the level of unaccounted mortality. Horse Mackerel. Following from the redefinition of the stock boundaries last year, much work had been carried out intersessionally, in compiling extended data series for western and southern horse mackerel. For North Sea horse mackerel effort was applied this year to try and understand why any attempted assessments performed so poorly. The data exploration showed inconsistent signals in the catch at age data and a survey index, which may be missing {{an important component of the}} stock due to seasonal migration. An in depth exploration was carried out for <b>western</b> horse <b>mackerel.</b> These analyses showed (with the available data i. e. no independent measure of stock size), that there had most likely been a change in fishing pattern in the mid 90 ’s, that the SSB followed the growth of the exceptional 1982 year class, and that in 2004 this is at a level around that in 1982. Although large uncertainty surrounds the estimates of stock parameters, the analyses were more stable and indicated strong recruitment of the 2001 year class which may have halted the declining trend of the stock. An exploratory analyses was conducted for southern horsemackerel. This analysis suffers from conflicting signals between surveys and as for <b>western</b> horse <b>mackerel</b> the absence of an SSB index. None the less the data exploration indicates a declining SSB since the late 90 ’s with stable F. Sardine is assessed only in part of the distribution area: in VIIIc and IXa. Stock structure is currently under investigation. An update assessment was performed. This assessment showed a small decrease in the SSB due to the waning influence of the 2000 year class, but that the SSB is about average. The assessment also indicates a large incoming recruitment (2004 year class). However even at this level of SSB the stock is more dependent on incoming recruitment than in the 1980 ’s. Anchovy is a short-lived species, showing large fluctuations in biomass. This is driven by recruitment which in turn might be driven by a combination of environmental factors. Catches consist mainly of 1 - and 2 -yr old fish. In 2005 there was a failure of the commercial fishery for the Biscay stock, and this prompted much intercessional work and meetings to be conducted before the WG. In addition this year the WG attempted a benchmark for Biscay anchovy, an annual ICA assessment, as performed in previous years, plus a seasonal one are presented as exploratory assessments, while a Bayesian implementation of the biomass dynamic model is proposed as the final assessment. There was coherence in the signals in the catch and survey data and new implementation of the assessment model overcomes some of the shortcomings of the previous approach. The overall outcome is that SSB is below Blim and recruitment at age 1 has been low since 2002. Without a recruitment index little can be said about the prognosis for the stock until the next acoustic and DEPM surveys in late Spring 2006. The assessment of Anchovy in Cadiz is developed further this year with a standardisation of the CPUE index. This exploratory assessment now gives a coherent picture of the development of the stock...|$|R
