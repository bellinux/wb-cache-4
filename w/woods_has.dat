5|$|Evidence of Bronze Age {{settlements}} {{has been}} found within the woods during archaeological excavations. Timber from the <b>woods</b> <b>has</b> {{been used in the}} building of several nationally significant buildings, as well as locally; the Great Barn at Manor Farm was built from oak from the woods.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, <b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been {{near the bottom of}} the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E
5|$|<b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> broken {{numerous}} golf records. He {{has been}} World Number One {{for the most}} consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any golfer. He has been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record eleven times, the Byron Nelson Award for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times, and has the record of leading the money list in ten different seasons.|$|E
50|$|These <b>woods</b> <b>have</b> high {{conservation}} value {{because they}} are ancient ash and maple, and this habitat has sharply declined in extent since 1945. The <b>woods</b> <b>have</b> diverse flora and fauna, particularly invertebrates.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>has</b> six children. Jesse is his {{son with}} his first wife, Krissy (née Findlay), a former model to whom he was married from 1971 to 1978. In 1985 Wood married his second wife, Jo Wood (née Karslake), mother of his {{daughter}} Leah and son Tyrone. Also a former model, Jo <b>Wood</b> <b>has</b> developed a successful line of organic beauty products. In addition to his six children, <b>Wood</b> <b>has</b> 6 grandchildren.|$|R
50|$|At Trinil, Java, burned <b>wood</b> <b>has</b> {{been found}} in layers that carried H. erectus (Java Man) fossils dating from 830,000 to 500,000 BP. The burned <b>wood</b> <b>has</b> been claimed to {{indicate}} the use of fire by early hominids.|$|R
5|$|<b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> {{spent the}} most {{consecutive}} and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings. He {{is one of}} five players (along with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus) to have won all four professional major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so. Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row, accomplishing the feat in the 2000–2001 seasons.|$|E
5|$|He has won 14 {{professional}} major golf championships, {{where he}} trails only Jack Nicklaus who leads with 18, and 79 PGA Tour events, second all-time behind Sam Snead, who had 82 wins. Woods leads all active golfers in career major wins and career PGA Tour wins. He {{is the youngest}} player to achieve the career Grand Slam, and the youngest and fastest to win 50 tournaments on tour. Additionally, Woods {{is only the second}} golfer (after Nicklaus) to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times. <b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> won 18 World Golf Championships, and won at least one of those events in each of the first 11 years after they began in 1999. Woods and Rory McIlroy are the only golfers to win both The Silver Medal and The Gold Medal at The Open Championship.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these <b>woods</b> <b>has</b> increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, <b>Wood</b> <b>had</b> a {{recurring}} role in Offspring. In June 2011, {{it was announced}} that <b>Wood</b> <b>had</b> joined the cast of Neighbours for a six-month guest role as Martin Chambers. He made his first on screen appearance in September.|$|R
50|$|The Arizona Daily Star quoted {{speculation}} over Wood's role, {{addressing the}} concern that <b>Wood</b> <b>had</b> been unaware of the most extreme abuse of her subordinates, and addressing {{the concern that}} <b>Wood</b> <b>had</b> merely passed on authorization for the abuse from more senior officers.|$|R

25|$|<b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> also {{recorded}} and released a Christmas album entitled Christmas Like This, which {{was released on}} November 10, 2009. Woods {{was one of three}} judges at the 2013 Christian Women in Media Association National Music Showcase in Nashville, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|American {{professional}} golfer Tiger <b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> enjoyed one of {{the most}} successful golfing careers of all time.

25|$|Historical {{examination}} of the legends suggests Reprobus (Christopher) lived during the Christian persecutions of the Roman emperor Decius (249 to 251), {{and that he was}} captured and martyred by the governor of Antioch. Historian David <b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> proposed that St. Christopher's remains were possibly taken to Alexandria by Peter of Attalia where he may have become identified with the Egyptian martyr Saint Menas.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{every house}} in Palmer <b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> unique {{architectural}} features, {{but a number}} are particularly important. At {{the southern edge of}} the district is the Dorothy H. Turkel House, the only house in Detroit designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. C. Howard Crane, the noted theater architect, designed the home of John H. Kunsky, incorporating many theater elements into the design. Minoru Yamasaki and Leonard B. Willeke also designed houses in the district.|$|E
25|$|Steep hills are a {{characteristic}} feature {{of most of}} the site, and wheelchair access is only from Greenwood Road into the open grassland. Greenwood Dale High School shares a boundary with the reserve and educational events have been held in partnership with the school including photographic scavenger hunts and sapling collection. Open days are held in the summer allowing the public to be actively involved with the reserve. Colwick <b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> an active Friends Group who meet regularly to discuss the condition of the site and carry out wildlife conservation activities in the woods.|$|E
25|$|Palmer <b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> its own {{security}} service and an active voluntary neighborhood association. The home of physicians, politicians, business owners, artists, executives and their families, the Palmer Woods neighborhood has attracted some of Detroit's most prominent citizens. Charles W. Burton himself made {{his home in}} the neighborhood. Two of the seven Fisher Brothers (owners of Fisher Body), Alfred and William, also lived in the neighborhood. William Fisher's house, on Wellesley, is , {{one of the largest in}} Detroit. John H. Kunsky, the founder of United Artists theatres, also lived in the area.|$|E

25|$|Interest in and {{the study}} of Amazon dark earths was {{advanced}} with the work of Wim Sombroek. Sombroek's interest in soil fertility came from his childhood. He was born in the Netherlands and lived through the Dutch famine of 1944. His family subsided on a small plot of land that had been maintained and improved for generations. Sombroek's father, in turn, improved the land by sowing it with the ash and cinders from their home. Sombroek came across Terra preta in the 1950s and it reminded him of the soil from his childhood, inspiring him to study it further. Soil biologist from the University of Kansas William W. Woods is also a major figure in Terra preta research. <b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> made several key discoveries and his comprehensive bibliography on the subject doubles in size every decade.|$|E
500|$|<b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> won 79 {{official}} PGA Tour events, including 14 majors. He was 14–1 when {{going into}} {{the final round of}} a major with at least a share of the lead.

He owns the lowest career scoring average and the most career earnings of any player in PGA Tour history.|$|E
500|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} injured {{more than}} 1,000people and caused $450million in total damages and destruction. Moshannon State Forest lost an estimated $8million in lumber to the tornado that hit Quehanna; after the storm, $2million in timber was salvaged {{in the state}} forest. In the ensuing years, the affected forest at Quehanna, though younger and smaller than the surrounding <b>woods,</b> <b>has</b> partly recovered. The official map for the Quehanna Trail is labeled [...] "tornado zone" [...] where the twister passed through the wild area.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} has also received some negative reception. In 2003, Nick Catucci of The Village Voice called her [...] "a woman carrying more emotional baggage than Witherspoon's Elle <b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> pink Gucci suitcases" [...] and stated, [...] "And Max's love interest? A contract killer who survived being {{shot in the}} head, and who you also play: Mona Sax. Who wrote this crap, Ed Wood?" [...] Tyler Wilde of GamesRadar ranked a cheat to undress Mona nude for her gameplay sections in Max Payne 2 as the fourth-rudest cheat in video games.|$|E
500|$|... "Sexual Healing" [...] is {{the fourteenth}} season {{premiere of the}} American {{animated}} television series South Park, and the 196th overall episode of the series. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 17, 2010, and on Comedy Central UK on March 19, 2010.

Meanwhile, schools are screened for the condition and Kyle, Kenny and Butters are diagnosed with sexual addiction.|$|E
500|$|On two {{occasions}} the golfer Tiger <b>Woods</b> <b>has</b> {{been the target}} of remarks regarding fried chicken. The first occurred in 1997 when golfer Fuzzy Zoeller said that Woods should avoid choosing fried chicken for the Masters champions' dinner the following year; [...] the second when golfer Sergio García was asked in a press conference in 2013 whether he would invite Woods to dinner during the U.S. Open to settle their ongoing feud. García, a Spaniard who was unaware of the existence of this stereotype in American society, committed a gaffe saying: [...] "We will have him round every night [...] [...] [...] We will serve fried chicken", which Woods said was [...] "wrong, hurtful and clearly inappropriate". Both Zoeller and García subsequently apologized to Woods.|$|E
