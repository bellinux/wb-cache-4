5|$|Abraham Lincoln {{lived in}} Indiana from 1816 until 1830, age 7 to 21. It was {{during these years}} that Lincoln first {{encountered}} slavery and began to form his opinions. Growing up in a climate <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> politics were run by men like Jennings and Pennington would have much influence {{on the development of}} Lincoln's views.|$|E
5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
5|$|Despite DuPont's grand {{boulevard}} {{not coming}} to fruition, he was a visionary who implemented key practices before they became standard in the decades after he initiated his project. After his death in 1930, DuPont was recognized for foreseeing that traffic on highways would approach the speed and volume of railroads and planning with provisions for future needs. Based on that vision, he designed his highway with a wide right-of-way and curves and grades adequate for high-speed traffic. The DuPont Highway was also innovative {{as one of the}} earliest roads to be constructed on a new alignment that passed close to towns but not directly through them, a development that was more convenient for through traffic and less disruptive to a town's residents. Up to that point, the use of bypasses had been limited to the railroads. South of Milford, the DuPont Highway was constructed entirely on new alignment except from Bedford Street north of Georgetown to Old State Road at Redden. The portion of the highway north of Milford, which DSHD designed, mostly overlaid the existing MilfordDover highway. The two exceptions were through Frederica, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Road used Market Street, and between Milford and Frederica, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Road followed Jenkins Pond Road, Reynolds Road, Pritchett Road, and Milford Neck Road.|$|E

5|$|In June 1968, an {{agreement}} was reached <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> Transportation Assistance Authority would pay $2 million and Penn Central would pay $2.5 million for the 11 Metroliners for Harrisburg service. On July 14, a 4-car train was tested on the line, with several demonstration runs for officials on August 21. In early October, several test trains proved {{the viability of the}} planned sub-3-hour schedules. Substation modifications later that month and a legal settlement between Budd and Penn Central in November paved the way for service to begin. On December 20, Penn Central announced that Metroliner service would begin on January 16, 1969.|$|E
5|$|MD 528 and MD 378 {{head north}} through the {{downtown}} area of Ocean City, where they meet the eastern terminus of US 50 at North Division Street. North Division Street between MD 528 and MD 378 is one-way eastbound, so traffic coming from the south uses North 1st Street, which is one-way westbound and designated MD 378A, to access US 50 west. MD 528 and MD 378 continue north to 9th Street, which is one-way westbound and designated MD 378B. MD 528 becomes two-way at 9th Street. MD 378 continues north as a two-lane street northbound to 15th Street, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> highway turns west to reach its northern terminus at MD 528. Baltimore Avenue continues north of 15th Street as a two-way municipal street to its northern end at 33rd Street.|$|E
5|$|Providence {{is one of}} {{many cities}} claimed to be founded on seven hills like Rome. The more {{prominent}} hills are: Constitution Hill (near downtown), College Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and containing New England's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts). The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point, Smith Hill (<b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston and Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill {{at the lower end of}} Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s.|$|E

5|$|Temples, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> rituals {{were carried}} out, {{were filled with}} images of the gods. The most {{important}} temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary. These statues were usually less than life-size, and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods' bodies. Many temples had several sanctuaries, each with a cult statue representing one of the gods in a group such as a family triad. The city's primary god was envisioned as its lord, employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented. The gods residing in the temples of Egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon. But many deities—including some important gods {{as well as those}} that were minor or hostile—were never given temples of their own, although some were represented in the temples of other gods.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{had a major}} {{effect on}} the {{development}} of Indiana. Before the war, the population was generally in the south of the state, where many had entered via the Ohio River, which provided a cheap and convenient means to export products and agriculture to New Orleans to be sold. The war closed the Mississippi River to traffic for nearly four years, forcing Indiana to find other means to export its produce. This led to a population shift to the north <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> came to rely more on the Great Lakes and the railroad for exports.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{entrance to}} the cave is flanked by two panels of Shiva dated to the Gupta period, both damaged. The left panel depicts Yogishvara (Shiva as the Lord of Yoga) and the right shows Nataraja (Shiva as the Lord of Dance). The Sadashiva is flanked by two large friezes, one of Ardhanarishvara and the other of Gangadhara. The walls of the mandapa feature other Shaivism legends. All the friezes, states Stella Kramrisch, feature the vyaktavyakta concept of Samkhya, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> of spiritual existence transitions between the unmanifest-manifest, the figures leap {{out of the cave}} walls towards the spectator as if trying to greet the narrative. Even the manifested Sadashiva is shown to be rising out of the rocks.|$|E
30|$|He et al. [183] {{address this}} {{fundamental}} challenge for proactive fault management using a POMDP, to formulate the trade-off between monitoring, diagnosis, and mitigation. They assume partial observability, {{to account for}} the fact that some monitored observations might be missing or delayed in a communication network. They propose an RL algorithm to obtain approximate solutions to the POMDP with large number of states representing real-life networks. The authors devise a preliminary policy <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> are completely observable. Then, they fine-tune this policy by updating the belief space and transition probabilities in <b>the</b> real world, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> are incompletely observed.|$|R

5|$|The {{song was}} {{accompanied}} by two music videos directed by Spike Lee. The first was shot in two locations in Brazil, in Pelourinho, the historic city center of Salvador, and in a favela of Rio de Janeiro called Dona Marta, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> authorities had tried to ban all production over fears the video would damage their image, the area and prospects of Rio de Janeiro staging the 2004 Olympics. Still, {{the residents of the}} area were happy to see the singer, hoping their problems would be made visible to a wider audience. The second video was shot in a prison and contained video footage of multiple references to human rights abuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{state is}} governed by a {{parliamentary}} system of representative democracy. Uttar Pradesh {{is one of the}} seven states in India, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council). The Legislative Assembly consists of 404 members who are elected for five-year terms. The Legislative Council is a permanent body of 100 members with one-third (33 members) retiring every two years. Since Uttar Pradesh sends the largest number of legislators to the national Parliament, it is often considered {{to be one of the}} most important states with respect to Indian politics. The state contributes 80 seats to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, Lok Sabha and 31 seats to the upper house of the Indian Parliament, Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days before}} the 1995 Illinois state competition, Steinmetz High School {{obtained}} copies of the tests from the DeVry Institute of Technology, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> finals were being held. The team was therefore able to look up and memorize the answers. The cheating allowed Steinmetz to beat perennial powerhouse Whitney Young Magnet High School, who had won the Illinois state finals in 22 of the previous 23 years. Six of the twelve students in the nation who scored over 900 points on the math test came from Steinmetz High School, prompting the Illinois state Academic Decathlon to suspect cheating. The Steinmetz team was disqualified after team members refused to take an alternate version of the test, and its coach eventually resigned. The incident was dramatized in the movie Cheaters.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the crumbling social system outside their walls, the prison film portrayed a universe <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> was all powerful and orderly. Sparked by the Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930 in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions in prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconion system in the blazing outdoors where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors. The prototype of the prison genre was 1930's The Big House. 1932's I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is considered the seminal film of the chain gang genre. Although the chain gang film Hell's Highway had beaten Fugitive to the screen two months earlier, it exerted nowhere the influence.|$|E
5|$|The highway heads southeast, partly {{along the}} latter creek, past Keddie to Quincy in the American Valley. It leaves the valley via Greenhorn Creek, passing the Feather River Route's Williams Loop and then {{following}} the small Estray Creek to Lee Summit, which the rail line passes under in the Spring Garden Tunnel. This brings SR 70 {{into the valley}} of the Middle Fork Feather River, which takes it southeast to Blairsden, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> Scenic Highway ends and State Route 89 splits to the south, and then east, through the Plumas National Forest, to Portola and Beckwourth. The large Sierra Valley begins at the latter community, and SR 70 heads almost directly across, passing the north end of SR 49 at Vinton and the south end of SR 284 at Chilcoot before crossing Beckwourth Pass, which the railroad takes the Chilcoot Tunnel under, and descending slightly to end at U.S. 395 at Hallelujah Junction.|$|E
