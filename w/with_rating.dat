500|$|When {{developing}} the characters for the game, Sakaguchi {{did not have}} a positive opinion of how popular the game would become. However, after the staff designed the graphics and the gameplay, he was surprised by the work, commenting that it was more interesting. The characters were designed by Koji Matsuoka and illustrated by Tetsuya Nomura. When the game was localized for an English release, translators had to change alcohol-based names with soda-pop names due to problems <b>with</b> <b>rating</b> boards. This resulted in several jokes being lost in translation. The game's English title was changed from [...] "Brave Fencer Musashiden" [...] to [...] "Brave Fencer Musashi" [...] in order to avoid confusing non-Japanese players about the titular character's name, as [...] "Musashiden" [...] means Musashi's story.|$|E

2500|$|Behavioral Checklists and Scales: {{behaviors}} are more definite than traits. [...] The critical incidents method (or critical incident technique) concerns [...] "specific behaviors indicative of {{good or bad}} job performance". [...] Supervisors record behaviors of what they judge to be job performance relevant, and they keep a running tally of good and bad behaviors. [...] A discussion on performance may then follow. [...] The behaviorally anchored rating scales (BARS) combine the critical incidents method <b>with</b> <b>rating</b> scale methods by rating performance on a scale but with the scale points being anchored by behavioral incidents. [...] Note that BARS are job specific. In the behavioral observation scale (BOS) approach to performance appraisal, employees are also evaluated {{in the terms of}} critical incidents. In that respect, it is similar to BARS. However, the BOS appraisal rate subordinates on the frequency of the critical incidents as they are observed to occur over a given period. The ratings are assigned on a five-point scale. The behavioral incidents for the rating scale are developed {{in the same way as}} for BARS through identification by supervisors or other subject matter experts. Similarly, BOS techniques meet equal employment opportunity because they are related to actual behavior required for successful job performance.|$|E
