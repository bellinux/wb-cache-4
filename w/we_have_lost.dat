25|$|The most general {{interpretation}} of entropy is {{as a measure}} of our uncertainty about a system. The equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system. This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.|$|E

25|$|Lloyd George told Wilson {{that he was}} to be the British Military Representative on the Supreme War Council, {{and that}} {{although}} he disliked his politics he admired him “as a man & a soldier” and that the future of the war rested in his shoulders – Milner told him much the same, adding that it was “the eleventh hour”. Hankey also wrote to Lloyd George that Wilson was uniquely qualified for the job, owing in part to his close relations with the French Army and personal friendship with Foch. Wilson accompanied Lloyd George, Smuts and Hankey to the Rapallo Conference which set up the SWC (7 November). When he arrived on 5 November he met Robertson who had gone on ahead to supervise the transfer of British reinforcements to Italy – under questioning from Wilson Robertson said that he would not have done anything differently {{over the last two years}} – which Wilson thought “curious”, noting that “since he has been CIGS <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> Roumania, Russia & Italy & have gained Bullecourt, Messines & Paschendal (sic)”.|$|E

The Queen was devastated, {{and ordered}} her household, {{along with her}} daughters, to move from Windsor to Osborne House, the Queen's Isle of Wight residence. Helena's grief was also profound, and she wrote to a friend a month later: [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> nothing can ever replace, and our grief is most, most bitter...I adored Papa, I loved him more than {{anything}} on earth, his word was a most sacred law, and he was my help and adviser...These hours were the happiest of my life, {{and now it is}} all, all over." ...|$|E

In paying tribute the following day, Lord Addison said that Lang was [...] "not only a great cleric but a great man... <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> in him a Father in God."

500|$|Wenger managed Nagoya for {{the final}} time on 28 August 1996 and {{delivered}} a farewell speech, thanking the fans in Japanese. Assessing his time in Japan, biographer Jasper Rees felt Wenger had left a mixed legacy at the club, as the immediate success was followed by fluctuating league finishes; {{it was not until}} 2010 that Nagoya (under Stojković) won their first title. Wenger continues to speak fondly of his career in Japan and once likened the country to his ancestral home: [...] "It has beautiful things that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> in Europe, beautiful things that make life good." [...] He also credited the culture for improving his temperament and rediscovering his passion for the game. Wenger returned to Japan as a television pundit for the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, and a decade later, took Arsenal to face Nagoya in a pre-season friendly.|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{publicly}} {{skeptical about}} the Republican strategy that precipitated the U.S. federal government shutdown of 2013 and U.S. debt-ceiling crisis of 2013 in order to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act; in October 2013 he {{voted in favor of}} the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved them and said, [...] "Republicans have to understand <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> this battle, as I predicted weeks ago, that we {{would not be able to}} win because we were demanding something that was not achievable." [...] Similarly, he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year. [...] By early 2014, McCain's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been [...] "disastrous and harmful". [...] McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama's foreign policy, however, and in June 2014, following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president's entire national security team to resign. [...] McCain said, [...] "Could all this have been avoided? ... The answer is absolutely yes. If I sound angry it's because I am angry." ...|$|E
500|$|Besides the {{official}} honours, Shackleton's Antarctic feats were greeted in Britain with great enthusiasm. Proposing {{a toast to}} the explorer at a lunch given in Shackleton's honour by the Royal Societies Club, Lord Halsbury, a former Lord Chancellor, said: [...] "When one remembers what he had gone through, one {{does not believe in}} the supposed degeneration of the British race. One does not believe that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> all sense of admiration for courage [...] endurance". The heroism was also claimed by Ireland: the Dublin Evening Telegraph's headline read [...] "South Pole Almost Reached By An Irishman", while the Dublin Express spoke of the [...] "qualities that were his heritage as an Irishman". Shackleton's fellow-explorers expressed their admiration; Roald Amundsen wrote, in a letter to RGS Secretary John Scott Keltie, that [...] "the English nation has by this deed of Shackleton's won a victory that can never be surpassed". Fridtjof Nansen sent an effusive private letter to Emily Shackleton, praising the [...] "unique expedition which has been such a complete success in every respect". The reality was that the expedition had left Shackleton deeply in debt, unable to meet the financial guarantees he had given to backers. Despite his efforts, it required government action, {{in the form of a}} grant of £20,000 (2008: £1.5 million) to clear the most pressing obligations. It is likely that many debts were not pressed and were written off.|$|E

500|$|By June 1813 Belgrano {{set up a}} base in Potosí with an army of 2,500 men, {{to prepare}} an attack on Upper Peru. Goyeneche moved to Oruro and resigned, being {{replaced}} by Joaquín de la Pezuela. Belgrano administrated the zone and tried to revert the bad impression left by the previous campaign of Juan José Castelli. Belgrano initiated {{good relations with the}} natives as well. Belgrano's plan was to attack the royalists from the front and the sides, with the aid of the armies of Cárdenas and Zelaya. Both armies were near 3,500 men. However, the royalists obtained an important advantage by defeating Cárdenas and getting possession of his papers, which gave them insight into the patriotic plans. Belgrano was taken by surprise at Vilcapugio on 1 October, and initially gained the upper hand against the royalist troops, who started to flee. However, when Pezuela saw that the patriotic armies were not following, he reorganised his forces, returned to the battle, and won. There were barely 400 survivors. Belgrano said: [...] "Soldiers: <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> the battle after so much fighting. Victory has betrayed us by going to the enemy ranks during our triumph. It does not matter! The flag of the nation still swings in our hands!". After gathering his army at Macha, where he received reinforcements from Cochabamba, Belgrano was ready for another engagement with Pezuela, whose troops were not in a better situation. On 14 November, Belgrano was again vanquished by the royalists at Ayohuma, and was forced to withdraw the remains of his army towards Potosí and from there to Jujuy.|$|E
