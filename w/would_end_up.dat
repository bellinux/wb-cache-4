5|$|Sharaf {{writes that}} Reich's {{personality}} changed after {{his experience in}} Oslo. He became socially isolated and kept his distance even from old friends and his ex-wife. His students in the United States came to know {{him as a man}} that no colleague, no matter how close, called by his first name. In January 1940 he wrote to Lindenberg to end their relationship once and for all, telling her that he was in despair and that he believed he <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> dying like a dog.|$|E
5|$|Society {{became more}} liberal (as seen, for instance, in the {{achievements}} of the Polish Film School and the creation of such controversial movies as Ashes and Diamonds), and a civil society started to develop, but half-hearted democratization was not enough to satisfy the Polish public. By the time of the March 1968 events, Gomułka's thaw would be long over, and increasing economic problems and popular discontent <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> removing Gomułka from power in 1970ironically, in a situation similar to the protests that once had propelled him to power.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment {{found that}} the solar PV would have little impact on the country's {{greenhouse}} gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.|$|E

5|$|The {{competitiveness}} {{of the teams}} continued the following year. Co-captains Ron Guidry and Willie Randolph had led the Yankees to first place {{two weeks after the}} All-Star break started. On July 28, the Yankees fell out of first place, and the Red Sox won their second division title in three years. Boston went on to face the Oakland Athletics in the 1988 American League Championship Series, but <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> getting swept.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to continually retain or return gifted experts (Experten) to front line battle proved extremely costly, {{resulting in the}} death in combat {{of many of the}} earlier experts and aces. This, coupled with the acute shortage of well trained pilots and the fact that by 1943 they were facing a better equipped and well-trained enemy, meant the life expectancy of even the most gifted was tragically short. Author John Weal says that, although other Geschwaderkommodore <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> dying in combat, nothing would showcase the changing fortunes of Luftwaffe fighter forces than the death of Walter Oesau.|$|E
5|$|Despite Paramount's {{failure to}} build a {{national}} broadcast television network, the company retained KTLA, and executives at Paramount continued to toy {{with the idea of}} entering the television medium once more. Paramount sold its library of shorts and cartoons in separate deals to U.M. & M. TV Corporation, Associated Artists Productions and Harvey Comics (the Superman cartoons were already sold to National Comics when Paramount's license to Superman expired). In 1957, Paramount sold most of its pre-1950 sound live action feature film library to EMKA, Ltd., a subsidiary of MCA. The live action films <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with what became Universal Television after MCA bought Universal Pictures in 1962. KTLA was eventually sold to Golden West Broadcasters, a company owned by actor and singer Gene Autry, for $12 million in 1964.|$|E

McCormack <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> participating {{in a total of}} five games in the major league between 1980 and 1981 and spent nine years playing in the minor leagues for the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Tigers farm teams. McCormack later managed the Reading Phillies (Eastern League) and served as the bench coach of the Long Island Ducks (Atlantic League) for a short period, but was replaced.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, local {{production}} of the F-20 was discussed with India. A move was also made in the 1980s to market the aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force with a license production manufacture of the aircraft. It was evaluated by a Pakistani contingent in the United States, with the F-20 being flown by Abbas Mirza, a senior Pakistani air force fighter pilot. Of {{the components of the}} F-20, the radar <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being the most successful; Taiwan selected it for the Ching-kuo, South Korea also adopted it for the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle trainer aircraft, and the radar was used in the multinational FMA IA 63 Pampa. As sales prospects were not apparent early on, GE sold their radar division, which was eventually acquired by Lockheed-Martin.|$|E
5|$|Mid-way in the march, Frederick finally {{realized}} that he <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> facing his enemy, instead of approaching from behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make {{an assault on the}} Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that he could turn the Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he moved more troops around so that the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.|$|E

5|$|The next {{trip was}} up to Anchorage, for the Northern Lights Invitational, a three-day, eight-team tournament. The first game was an easy win against Akron, in which Summitt played her bench frequently. The semi-final game, against Texas A, was not much more difficult. The Ladies won handily, 105–81, leading {{by as much as}} 25. Texas A's 81 points <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being the most a team would score on Tennessee that season. The {{championship}} game was against Wisconsin, a team ranked in the top 10, but this ranking did not mean much, as the team ended 1997 with an 87–66 victory. The Meeks were named to the All-Tournament team.|$|E
5|$|To {{maximize}} {{their chances of}} success, Square searched for a Western company to assist with releasing the PC version. Eidos Interactive, whose release of Tomb Raider had turned them into a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a triangular shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts. The PC version <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> providing the source code for subsequent ports.|$|E
5|$|Water <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> {{reaching}} areas {{over two}} miles (3km) {{away from the}} Red River, necessitating the evacuation of all of East Grand Forks and 75% of Grand Forks. School was canceled in both cities {{for the remainder of}} the term, as were classes at the University of North Dakota. The river crested at 54.35feet (16.6m) on April 21 and the river level would not fall below 49feet (14.9m) until April 26. The flood reached higher levels than the prior most severe flood in 1826. Because water drained so slowly out of the most low-lying areas, some homeowners could not visit their damaged property until May. By May 30, the Red River had receded below flood stages everywhere in North Dakota.|$|E

5|$|Due to the war, the SAFA {{suspended}} its {{competition from}} 1916 through to 1918. Despite this official suspension, {{a group of}} South Australian clubs decided to form their own league in 1916 and the money generated would be put toward the war effort. The Railways Football Club {{was one of the}} clubs that participated in this competition and managed to attract Harold Oliver to be the clubs captain. Unfortunately for the Railways, Oliver would only play one game for the Railways, and would instead return to Berri to focus on his farm. Later in the season, Oliver returned to Port Adelaide to play a few games for the club who was also partaking in the Patriotic League. Port Adelaide <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> winning the 1916 South Australian Patriotic League Grand Final defeating West Torrens 7.11 (53) to 1.13 (19). Harold Oliver played for Port Adelaide during the game and kicked a goal.|$|E
5|$|Following Roy's {{departure}} in 1995, the Canadiens {{fell into}} an extended stretch of mediocrity, missing {{the playoffs in}} four of their next ten seasons and failing to advance past {{the second round of}} the playoffs until 2010. By the late 1990s, with both an ailing team and monetary losses exacerbated by a record-low value of the Canadian dollar, Montreal fans feared their team <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> relocated to the United States. Team owner Molson Brewery sold control of the franchise and the Molson Centre to American businessman George N. Gillett Jr. in 2001, with the right of first refusal for any future sale by Gillett and a condition that the NHL Board of Governors must unanimously approve any attempt to move to a new city. Led by president Pierre Boivin, the Canadiens returned to being a lucrative enterprise, earning additional revenues from broadcasting and arena events. In 2009, Gillett sold the franchise to a consortium led by the Molson family which included The Woodbridge Company, BCE/Bell, the QFL Solidarity Fund, Michael Andlauer, Luc Bertrand and the National Bank Financial Group for $575million, more than double the $275million he spent on the purchase eight years prior.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1940, {{high-ranking}} German officials {{drafted a}} memorandum {{on the dangers}} of an invasion of the Soviet Union. They said Ukraine, Belorussia and the Baltic States <b>would</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> as only a further economic burden for Germany. It was argued that the Soviets in their current bureaucratic form were harmless and that the occupation would not benefit Germany. Hitler disagreed with economists about the risks and told his right-hand man Hermann Göring, the chief of the Luftwaffe, that he would no longer listen to misgivings about the economic dangers of a war with Russia. It is speculated that this was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had produced reports that predicted a net economic drain for Germany {{in the event of an}} invasion of the Soviet Union unless its economy was captured intact and the Caucasus oilfields seized in the first blow, and he consequently revised his future report to fit Hitler's wishes. The Red Army's ineptitude in the Winter War against Finland in 1939–40 convinced Hitler of a quick victory within a few months. Neither Hitler nor the General Staff anticipated a long campaign lasting into the winter, and therefore adequate preparations, such as the distribution of warm clothing and winterization of vehicles and lubricants, were not made.|$|E
