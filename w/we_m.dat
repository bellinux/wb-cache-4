40|$|The {{recognition}} of human gestures and facial expressions in image sequences {{is an important}} and challenging problem that enables a host of human-computer interaction applications. This paper describes a framework for incremental {{recognition of}} human motion that extends the "Condensation" algorithm proposed by Isard and Blake (ECCV' 96). Human motions are modeled as temporal trajectories of some estimated parameters over time. The Condensation algorithm uses random sampling techniques to incrementally match the trajectory models to the multi-variate input data. The recognition framework is demonstrated with two examples. The first example involves an augmented office whiteboard with which a user can make simple hand gestures to grab regions of the board, print them, save them, etc. The second example illustrates the recognition of human facial expressions using the estimated parameters of a learned model of mouth motion. 1 Introduction Motion is intimately tied with our behavior; <b>we</b> <b>m</b> [...] ...|$|E

With insufficient training samples, however, the network can not learn the function properly and popular model selection methods such as cross validation can not be used. We propose a scheme to generate virtual samples using a population of networks.

They can fit any continuous function with a desired precision. In practice, however, there are several factors which make it difficult to fit a continuous function accurately.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} {{study on the}} characteristics of liquid jets in different configurations. We consider jets injected perpendicular to gravity, jets injected parallel to gravity, and jets injected in a microgravity environment. We study the role played by gravity in the jet breakup length and in the dynamics of the droplets generated after breakup. We analyze droplets obtained in the dripping and jetting regimes, focusing the study on their size, trajectory, oscillation, and rotation. The particularities of the considered injection configurations are analyzed. In normal gravity conditions, in the dripping and jetting regimes, the breakup length increases with the Weber number. The transition between these regimes occurs at Wecr ˜ 3. 2. Droplets are notably larger in the dripping regime than in the jetting one. In the latter case, droplet mean size decreases as the liquid flow rate is increased. In microgravity conditions, droplet trajectories form a conical shape due to droplet bouncing after collision. When a collision takes place, coalescence tends to occur at low modified Weber numbers (<b>We</b> <b>m</b> 2). The surface of a droplet oscillates after bouncing or coalescence events, following a damped oscillator behavior. The observed oscillation frequency agrees with theoretical predictions.

40|$|Abstract. Scheduling a {{sequence}} of jobs released over time when the processing time of a job is only known at its completion is a classical problem in CPU scheduling in time sharing operating systems. A widely used measure for the responsiveness {{of the system is}} the average flow time of the jobs, that is, the average time spent by jobs in the system between release and completion. The Windows NT and the Unix operating system scheduling policies are based on the Multilevel Feedback algorithm. In this article, we prove that a randomized version of the Multilevel Feedback algorithm is competitive for single and parallel machine systems, in our opinion providing one theoretical validation of the goodness of an idea that has proven effective in practice along the last two decades. The randomized Multilevel Feedback algorithm (RMLF) was first proposed by Kalyanasundaram and Pruhs for a single machine achieving an O(log n log log n) competitive ratio to minimize the average flow time against the on-line adaptive adversary, where n is the number of jobs that are released. We present a version of RMLF working for any number m of parallel machines. We show for RMLF a first O(log n log n) competitiveness result against the oblivious adversary on parallel machines. <b>We</b> <b>m</b> also show that the same RMLF algorithm surprisingly achieves a tight O(log n) competitive ratio against the oblivious adversary on a single machine, therefore matching the lower bound for this case...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{epidermal}} cells, keratin intermediate filaments {{connect with}} desmosomes to form extensive cadherin-mediated cytoskeletal architectures. Desmoplakin (DPI), a desmosomal component lacking a transmembrane domain, has {{been implicated in}} this interaction, although most {{studies have been conducted}} with cells that contain few or no desmosomes, and efforts to demonstrate direct interactions between desmoplaldn and intermediate filaments have not been successful. In this report, we explore the biochemical nature of the connections between keratin filaments and desmosomes in epidermal keratinocytes. We show that the carboxy terminal "tail " of DPI associates directly with the amino terminal "head " of type II epidermal keratins, including K 1, K 2, K 5, and K 6. <b>We</b> <b>M</b> ANY cell types distinguish self from nonself by virtue of cell surface adherens junctions involving members of the cadherin family (for reviews, see Kemler, 1993; Garrod, 1993; Franke et al., 1992). While a number of cell types stabilize homophilic cadherin-mex~ated associations by connecting to an actin cytoskeletal network (Pasdar et al., 1991; Pasdar and Nelson, 1988), others, including heart muscle and epidermis, orchestrate cell adhesion through desmosomes, which connect to intermediate filament (IF) ~ networks (Garrod, 1993). Desmosomes are symmetrical membranous plaques that are several microns in diameter and ~ 100 um thick. Each half of the desmosome is derived from an adjacent cell, and IFs from both cells appear to loop through the cytoplasmic peripheries of the structure (Kell); 1966).
