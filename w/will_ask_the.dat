Likewise the town Futaba considered refusing any re-designation of the evacuation zones in the town.|$|E

This was a violation of rules established by the Flemish Government. The three mayors are all members of the FDF.

25|$|On 15 June 2007, the Government of Ontario {{announced}} its MoveOntario 2020 plan, {{that calls for}} a major overhaul and expansion of the Greater Toronto Area's transit systems, including the Transit City proposal, that will cost an estimated $17.5 billion in provincial and federal funding over a 12-year period. The provincial government proposes to provide two-thirds of the funds ($11.5 billion), and <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> federal government to pay the remaining one-third ($6 billion). However, Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government is currently not committed to this spending plan. The province's $17.5 billion MoveOntario 2020 plan calls for a total number of 52 transit projects in the GTA to be funded, with 95% of the projects completed by the year 2020.|$|E
500|$|The VR Disc {{was also}} {{released}} in the PAL region as a [...] "data disc" [...] titled Metal Gear Solid: Special Missions on October 29, 1999. Unlike the Japanese and American versions, Special Missions requires a PAL copy of the original Metal Gear Solid {{in order to be}} played. This change was done since the original Metal Gear Solid was released in multiple languages in Europe and Special Missions determines the language it uses based on which version of the original game the player owns. When the Special Missions disc is loaded into the PlayStation console, the game <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> player to switch the disc with the first disc from Metal Gear Solid in order to load voice and language data before asking the player to switch back to the Special Missions disc to start the game. This requirement renders Special Missions incompatible with PlayStation 2 consoles made prior to the SCPH-70000 model.|$|E
500|$|Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb– a mercenary. He and Mal {{met when}} they were on {{opposite}} sides of a dispute; Mal, while held at gunpoint, offered Jayne his own bunk and a higher cut than his current employer, so Jayne switched sides and shot his then-partners. In the original pilot, [...] "Serenity", he intimates to Mal that he did not betray him because [...] "The money wasn't good enough." [...] However, previously he had pointedly asked the Alliance agent whether he would be required to turn on the captain to help him, and in [...] "Ariel" [...] defends his actions in alerting the authorities regarding Simon and River by claiming he had not intended to betray Mal. He is someone who can be depended on in a fight. He tends to act like a [...] "lummox" [...] who thinks he is the smartest person in space, but occasional hints of intelligence peek through this façade, giving the impression that he acts dumber than he is. As Whedon states several times, Jayne is the man who <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> questions that no one else wants to. Even though he is a macho character, he has shown a particularly intense fear of Reavers, more so {{than the rest of the}} crew. Despite his amoral mercenary persona, he sends a significant portion of his income to his mother, again suggesting that there is more to his character than what he presents to the rest of the crew.|$|E

2500|$|A common {{process is}} for the pimp to first gain {{the trust of the}} victim, called the {{grooming}} stage. [...] They seek to make the victim dependent on them. [...] Once the victim is comfortable, the pimp moves to the seasoning stage, where they <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> victim to perform sexual acts for the pimp, which the victim may do because they believe {{it is the only way}} to keep the trafficker's affection. [...] The requests progress from there and it can be difficult for the victim to escape.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{government}} loses a [...] "non-confidence" [...] motion traditionally the Prime Minister <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Governor General {{to call an}} election. The Governor General when approached by the Prime Minister who has lost {{a vote of confidence}} will traditionally call an election. However it is not assured as some assume. The Governor General also has the right to call the leader of the party they think would be most {{likely to be able to}} form government and ask them if they can form the government. This happened in 1926 and is referred to as the King-Byng Affair.|$|E

When started, the timer gives an audible electronic tone and the shooter will begin the stage.|$|R
2500|$|Gerson of the Washington Post also {{described}} {{what he considered}} to be the very subversive nature of the Harry Potter books in the answer they offer to death. Voldemort believes that death must be mastered and [...] "beaten". In contrast, Harry accepts the necessity of his own death for the sake of love. Gerson also suggests that some <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> book series about tolerance also be a book series about religion. He answers that many others [...] "believe – not in spite of their faith but because of it – that half-bloods, werewolves and others should be treated with kindness and fairness. Above all, believers are called to love, even at the highest cost." ...|$|E

Usually, in such situations of financial difficulties the people <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> person to be patient until they collectively manage {{to come up with the}} necessary money. This is why you cannot put a price on a palm tree; you would not be able to sell it. Date trees do not have a price!

2500|$|On February 22, 2012 {{the format}} of Iron Chef Thailand has been changed to: the first 30 minutes {{of the program is}} where the Challenger Chef will present his/her [...] "Signature Dish with a Special Ingredient" [...] to the guests.

The last 30 minutes of the program is [...] "Cooking with Iron Chef". Guests learn how to cook from the Iron Chef and win the [...] "Best Student" [...] {{at the end of the}} program.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{acts of piracy}} in Eve are , gate camping, and small gang warfare. Every pirate {{corporation}} in Eve Online has its own preferred activities, strategies, and tactics. Some utilize cheap but high damage ships to [...] "suicide gank" [...] and kill players in high-security space (where they should theoretically be safe) quickly before CONCORD law enforcement units arrive to destroy them (thus [...] "suiciding"), {{in the knowledge that}} certain ships they destroy will be carrying valuable commodities or expensive gear capable of recovering the cost of the pirate vessels lost in the gank. Others choose to set up gate camping fleets consisting of varied ship types and roles capable of rapidly disabling and destroying any unwitting passersby, thereby locking down star systems and killing or robbing whoever tries to pass through. Other pirates choose to roam in very fast and versatile skirmish ships, such as interceptors, recons, or heavy assault ships, killing anyone they encounter in lightning attacks. On gaining the upper hand in a fight many pirates <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> victim for an ISK ransom, in exchange for sparing their ship or escape pod.|$|E
2500|$|Main game contestants {{are asked}} {{increasingly}} difficult general knowledge questions by the host. Questions are multiple choice: four possible answers are given (labelled A, B, C and D), and the contestant must choose the correct one. The 'D' answer {{on the first}} question (except in the Shuffle format like in the US version) is always incorrect and humorous. Upon answering a question correctly, the contestant wins {{a certain amount of}} money. In most versions, there is no time limit to answer a question; a contestant may (and often does) take as long as they need to ponder an answer. After the first few questions, the host <b>will</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> contestant if that is their [...] "final answer". When a contestant says [...] "final" [...] in conjunction with one of the answers, it is official, and cannot be changed. The first five questions usually omit this rule, because the questions are generally so easy that requiring a final answer would significantly slow the game down; thus, there are five chances for the contestant to leave with no money if they were to provide a wrong answer before obtaining the first guaranteed amount; going for 1,000 units of currency after winning 500 units is the last point in the game at which a contestant can still leave empty-handed.|$|E
