30|$|Invariably, new {{symbiotic}} partnerships will {{be borne}} {{out of the}} adaptive cascade. Although symbiotic partnerships are essential to adaptation, creating these partnerships cannot be done as a mandate from the top down. The government has mandated many “interagency task forces” designed to create partnerships between agencies that rarely talked to one another. But with a narrow set of allowable tasks and a required number of annual meetings, these task forces tend to become exercises in which representatives from each member agency, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> to make decisions, come to check off a box. Real symbiosis arises automatically when different entities {{find out that they}} can solve imminent problems better together than they could on their own. Symbiotic relationships may flash away as quickly as they were formed, or they may become long term partnerships, if both parties find at least some additional benefit from staying together. In this sense the central challenge of the adaptive cascade becomes the catalyst that new symbiotic partnerships are built around. The more perspectives that are brought in to address the challenge, the more opportunities to develop new symbiotic relationships emerge.|$|R
40|$|In {{the same}} moment that law schools are {{embracing}} neoliberal strategies {{in response to the}} economic crisis caused by declining admissions, students in the classroom have begun to agitate for advance content notices (or “trigger warnings”) to alert them to any potentially trauma-inducing course materials. For faculty <b>who</b> <b>have</b> already adopted a defensive posture in response to threats to eliminate tenure, this demand feels like an additional assault on academic freedom; one that reflects a distressing student-as-consumer mentality. From this vantage point, students are too easily cast as another group of adversaries when, in actuality, students are straw targets <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> compared to the real threat—the unchecked corporatization of legal education. This essay attempts to redirect faculty outrage back to the proper mark by decoupling the trigger-warning movement from the broader phenomenon of the neoliberal law school. It presents an alternate reading of trigger-warning mandates: as a student critique of legal pedagogy that demands access and opportunity for all students to fully engage in classroom discussions that can be difficult and are often painful. Trigger warnings give lie to the myth that law is based on dispassionate and objective legal analysis. Seen this way, trigger warnings invite students to become partners in the production of knowledge, while allowing faculty to maintain intellectually rigorous classroom environments. Faculty cannot afford to view students as antagonists. Instead, students should be enlisted as allies in our efforts to challenge the orthodoxy of market-based solutions to the legal education crisis...|$|R

40|$|The study {{reflects}} on how external policy {{intervention in the}} form of aid conditionalities constrains local policy-making processes in two post-colonial poor countries, Tanzania and Uganda. The particular case of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), a policy conditionality introduced by the World Bank in 1999, demonstrates aptly how policy sovereignty of these highly aid-dependent poor countries is being undermined. National constitutional institutions such as Parliaments play a marginal role in decision-making as the state budget mainly consists of development aid. Policy discussion involves a "free choice of one alternative" largely mandated by the World Bank and other donors within a global policy consensus. It is argued that national policy-making can no longer be separated from the global processes of development diplomacy. Public policy consultations represent a new conditionality attached to the PRSPs. The consultations have mainly empowered actors of "civil society" as representatives of the people {{at the expense of the}} elected Members of Parliament. This broadly reflects the changing configuration of political relationships and political authority in Tanzania and Uganda: policy-making circles around the "air-conditioned" and depoliticised sphere of development aid, steered by a narrow coalition of "technocrats" and donors. These policy communities in Tanzania and Uganda involve transnational networks of like-minded economists and other "policy professionals" exercising political power in an ultimately unaccountable manner. The paper concludes that this situation is contradictory to the expressed aims of democratisation of development aid. It is particularly problematic from the perspective of national Parliaments in Africa, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> to demand democratic accountability from the international patrons of their countries.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to orient the reader towards an art therapy which is {{conscious}} of external dynamics of power in western society. In order {{to do it is}} necessary to look at art therapy in the light of feminism and recent post-modern theories, which include critical theory and deconstruction. Critical theory is a social theory integrating the works of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud, which when merged with a feminist praxis (the active relationship between theory and practice) provides a method of critical analysis to investigate traditional therapeutic theories which gave rise to art therapy. The established therapeutic theories (for example Psychoanalysis, Jungian analytic psychology, family and systems theories) generally do not examine this culture 2 ̆ 7 s issues of power (organized in varying degrees around the four primary areas of class, race, gender and age) in relation to the construction of the individual. A critical analysis enables investigation into not only the construction of gender in society, but also the institutions that maintain and perpetuate oppression. One of the myths of traditional therapy is that it is value free or value neutral. 2 ̆ 2 Value free 2 ̆ 2 therapy functions as a mechanism of social control, implicitly supporting the status quo by 2 ̆ 2 therapising 2 ̆ 2 the client to adjust to or {{come to terms with the}} problematic situation. Unless these areas are taken into account, therapy becomes another site of reproduction for inequalities and injustices in society. Strategies of challenge regarding a gender aware art therapy for therapists both male and female will be suggested. There is potential for a socially conscious art therapy, in breaking away from traditional theories, to be in a position to offer a bond between individual insight and external social dynamics. Power inequalities in society lead those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> or control in their lives to suffer from various forms of distress, depression and mental disorders.

To rectify this situation and to increase input by the JSDF in policy matters, in the early 1980s the Joint Staff Office was enlarged to establish better lines of communication between the internal bureaus and the three staff offices.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{focuses on the}} rise and decline of sardine fishery at Monterey, California from 1900 until 1950. Monterey {{developed}} into the most important sardine fishing port on the West Coast of North America {{and one of the}} top fishing ports in the world during this time period. This study is not an attempt to pinpoint the exact reason for the decline of the sardine fishery; scientists are in agreement that natural fluctuations and overfishing led to the decline. Rather, this is a study of the process of managing a natural resource. The State Legislature was responsible for the fishery and relied on California Department of Fish and Game scientists to make recommendations. In addition, the fish processors, canners and fish reductionists, felt that they were {{in the best position to}} manage the fishery and exerted a considerable influence in Sacramento. 	Interestingly, the fishermen themselves <b>had</b> <b>little</b> to do with the management process, basically because they were immigrants <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> political <b>power</b> and worked, under contract, for the processors. The philosophical background of both the processors and fishery scientists were different. 	The fish processors came from a business background that developed during the Progressive Era. 	Their attempts to manage the sardine fishery were based on scientific management concepts; businessmen, they believed, were the best qualified people to manage an industry. In a similar manner the fishery scientists also came from a Progressive Era background and they too felt that the management of the sardine fishery should come out of the process of scientific management. 	However, they felt that decisions concerning the fishery should be made in light of scientific evidence, not the needs of business. One key to the management process was that there was no significant change in the set philosophy by either the processors or the fishery scientists. 	The result was a constant battle between the two groups over the control of the fishery. The legislature listened to the plight of the fish processors and sardines overfished before the major parties reached an agreement over the proper way to oversee the fishery...|$|R
40|$|Background: Child {{sexual abuse}} {{is a global}} public health and human rights concern. Despite beinga crime in most countries, and with {{well-known}} {{physical and mental health}} consequences, the majority of sexual offences are not reported. Child sexual abuse is a maltreatment form characterized by contact or non-contact acts perpetrated by adults or older children toward younger children <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> to resist. This thesis aims to understand the social context of child sexualabuse, and the perceived roles of parents, community, and key professionals in handling such incidents in urban Tanzania. Methods: A combination of qualitative and quantitative research designs were applied to four sub-studies performed in Temeke district, Dar es Salaam. Qualititative content analysis was conducted on 23 in-depth interviews to describe the perceptions of key professionals and their experiencesof handling cases of child sexual abuse, in addition, eight in-depth interviews with parents to capture their experiences of legal reporting of child sexual abuse incidents. Grounded theory was used to analyse 13 focus group discussions held with male and female community members to explore norm systems and community awareness related to child sexual abuse. Findings from these exploratory sub-studies paved the way for a school survey among 1359 students from 23 randomly selected secondary schools. Using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analyses, prevalence, risk factors, and health consequences of child sexual abuse were estimated. Results: Lack of working tools and financial support were perceived as major problems among the key professionals. Corruption at community and institutional levels was seen as jeopardizing justice. Community passivity and lack of knowledge about laws regulating sexual offences were identifiedas additional challenges for conducting fair investigations. The community perspective illustrated that children’s rights were challenged by lack of agency. Community awareness about child sexual abuse was clear {{but there was also a}} lack of trust in that the healthcare and legal systems were capable of handling such cases. Myths and cultural beliefs justified abuse. Disclosure of abuse was threatened by fear of stigma and discrimination. Parental interviews identified four types of sexual abuse incidents. The type most strongly associated with a determination to seek justice was one with an innocent child. The youth who was forced into sex elicited feelings of parental betrayal. The consenting, curious youth created uncertainty in how to proceed, while the transactional sex youth evoked feelings of parental powerlessness. Shame and stigma, but also fear of perpetrator retaliation and breach of confidentiality, were seen as challenges for disclosure. The school survey showed that 28 % (boys= 30 %, girls= 26 %) of the students were exposed to child sexual abuse, with boys more often affected than girls. Twenty-six per cent of boys and 19 % of girls reported being forced to look at pornography. Forced sexual intercourse was experienced by 9. 8 % of boys and 8. 7 % of girls. Abuse increased with age and diminished self-rated health. Perpetrators were most often neighbours, teachers and peers. In contrast, survivor confidants were most often teachers, family members and friends. Most survivors did not want any action taken for the abuse. Proportions of students <b>who</b> perceived <b>having</b> fair/poor health increased with severity of abuse comparing the none-abused (7. 0 % and 6. 3 % of boys and girls respectively) with the ever abused (26 % and 41 % of boys and girls respectively) and those reporting penetrative sex (35 % and 53 % of boys and girls respectively). Likewise, suicidal ideation and attempts increased with severity of abuse when compared with those not abused. Conclusions and recommendations: Sexual abuse of children poses a devastating social, and public health challenge. In Tanzania neither the community nor the health or legal institutions are adequately prepared to handle these cases. Educating the community, economically empowering women and strengthening the medico-legal system are needed to increase the opportunity for human,legal and fair investigations and reactions. A national child protection system is needed to address the complexities of abuse at different levels and to safeguard the rights of children in Tanzania...|$|R
40|$|Section 7 of the Charter of Rights was not {{intended}} by the framers to be a provision that authorized extensive judicial review of legislation. The protection of property was deliberately not included in its text {{in order to reduce}} its scope — and the potential for judicial review. and the phrase “the principles of fundamental justice” was intended to cover only procedural due process. Contrary to expectations in 1982, over the succeeding 30 years the Supreme Court of Canada has given an expansive interpretation to section 7 and used it to strike down a variety of laws, including the criminalization of abortion, criminal offences that lack the element of mens rea, “overbroad” laws, “disproportionate” laws and “arbitrary” laws. The last three categories permit the Court to review any law that has an effect on life, liberty or security of the person to determine whether the law is in fact fulfilling its objective, or undermining the objective by doing more harm than good. Under these categories, the Court has struck down restrictions on the liberty of convicted sex offenders, restrictions on the liberty of those mentally unfit to stand trial, the prohibition of private health care insurance, and the attempted closing of a safe injection site for drug addicts. at the time of writing, lower courts have struck down the Criminal Code provisions respecting prostitution and physician-assisted suicide, issues {{that will have to be}} resolved by the Supreme Court. The 30 -year history of section 7 has been remarkable, attracting criticism from those who deplore the shift of policy-making in a democracy from elected legislative bodies to unelected judges. And, of course, there is support for the decisions from those who believe that, even in a democracy, dysfunctional laws should be subjected to an independent, evidence-based review of their impact, especially on individuals who are unpopular or <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> political <b>power.</b> It is hard to predict whether this activist phase, in which the Supreme Court has so greatly expanded judicial review under section 7, will continue into the next 30 years.

40|$|Abstract Background In India, {{indigenous}} populations, {{known as}} Adivasi or Scheduled Tribes (STs), {{are among the}} poorest and most marginalized groups. 'Deprived' ST groups tend to display high levels of resignation and to lack the capacity to aspire; consequently their health perceptions often do not adequately correspond to their real health needs. Moreover, similar to indigenous populations elsewhere, STs often <b>have</b> <b>little</b> opportunity to voice perspectives framed within their own cultural worldviews. We undertook a study to gather policy-relevant data on the views, experiences, and priorities of a marginalized and previously enslaved tribal group in South India, the Paniyas, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> 'voice' or <b>power</b> over their own situation. Methods/design We implemented a Participatory Poverty and Health Assessment (PPHA). We adopted guiding principles and an ethical code that promote respect for Paniya culture and values. The PPHA, informed by a vulnerability framework, addressed five key themes (health and illness, well-being, institutions, education, gender) using participatory approaches and qualitative methods. We implemented the PPHA in five Paniya colonies (clusters of houses in a small geographical area) in a gram panchayat (lowest level decentralized territorial unit) to generate data that can be quickly disseminated to decision-makers through interactive workshops and public forums. Preliminary findings Findings indicated that the Paniyas are caught in multiple 'vulnerability traps', that is, they view their situation as vicious cycles from which {{it is difficult to}} break free. Conclusion The PPHA is a potentially useful approach for global health researchers working with marginalized communities to implement research initiatives that will address those communities' health needs in an ethical and culturally appropriate manner. </p...|$|R
40|$|If {{your husband}} calls, {{you have to}} go”: Understanding sexual agency among young married women in urban South India Background—Early {{marriage}} is common in many developing countries, including India, this study’s setting. Women <b>who</b> marry early <b>have</b> <b>little</b> <b>power</b> within their marriage, particularly in the sexual domain. Yet, research is limited on women’s ability to control their marital sexual experiences. Methods—We identified factors affecting sexual communication, an aspect of sexual agency, among married women ages 16 – 25, in Bangalore, India, and how factors associated with sexual communication differed from those influencing non-sexual agency. We ran ordered logit regression models for one outcome of sexual agency (sexual communication), and two outcomes of non-sexual agency (fertility control and financial decision-making). Qualitative data elucidated our findings. Results—Agency was more restricted in sexual (11. 3 % with high sexual communication) than non-sexual domains (25. 1 % with high financial decision-making agency and 32. 4 % with high fertility control). Feeling prepared before the first sexual experience {{was significantly associated with}} sexual communication (OR= 1. 8, p= 0. 014). Longer marriage duration (OR 2. 13, p= 0. 000) and having worked pre-marriage (OR 1. 38, p= 0. 038) were also significant. However, few other measures of women’s resources increased their odds of sexual communication. Education, having children, pre-marital vocational training and marital intimacy were significant for non-sexual but not sexual agency. Thus, factors associated with sexual communication differed from those associated with non-sexual agency. Conclusions—Policymakers seeking to enhance young married women’s sexual communication need to consider providing sex education to young women before they marry. More broadly, interventions designed to increase women’s agency need to be tailored to the type of agency being examined...|$|R
60|$|But Stephen did {{not come}} earlier, {{and there was another}} visitor--a nearer neighbor--who preceded him. When Philip entered the room, he was going merely to bow to Maggie, feeling that their {{acquaintance}} was a secret which he was bound not to betray; but when she advanced toward him and put out her hand, he guessed at once that Lucy had been taken into her confidence. It was a moment of some agitation to both, though Philip had spent many hours in preparing for it; but like all persons <b>who</b> <b>have</b> passed through life with little expectation of sympathy, he seldom lost his self-control, and shrank with the most sensitive pride from any noticeable betrayal of emotion. A little extra paleness, a little tension of the nostril when he spoke, and the voice pitched in rather a higher key, that to strangers would seem expressive of cold indifference, were all the signs Philip usually gave of an inward drama that was not without its fierceness. But Maggie, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> more <b>power</b> of concealing the impressions made upon her than if she had been constructed of musical strings, felt her eyes getting larger with tears as they took each other's hands in silence. They were not painful tears; they had rather something of the same origin as the tears women and children shed when they have found some protection to cling to and look back on the threatened danger. For Philip, who a little while ago was associated continually in Maggie's mind with the sense that Tom might reproach her with some justice, had now, in this short space, become a sort of outward conscience to her, that she might fly to for rescue and strength. Her tranquil, tender affection for Philip, with its root deep down in her childhood, and its memories of long quiet talk confirming by distinct successive impressions the first instinctive bias,--the fact that in him the appeal was more strongly to her pity and womanly devotedness than to her vanity or other egoistic excitability of her nature,--seemed now to make a sort of sacred place, a sanctuary where she could find refuge from an alluring influence which the best part of herself must resist; which must bring horrible tumult within, wretchedness without. This new sense of her relation to Philip nullified the anxious scruples she would otherwise have felt, lest she should overstep the limit of intercourse with him that Tom would sanction; and she put out her hand to him, and felt the tears in her eyes without any consciousness of an inward check. The scene was just what Lucy expected, and her kind heart delighted in bringing Philip and Maggie together again; though, even with all her regard for Philip, she could not resist the impression that her cousin Tom had some excuse for feeling shocked at the physical incongruity between the two,--a prosaic person like cousin Tom, who didn't like poetry and fairy tales. But she began to speak as soon as possible, to set them at ease.|$|R

60|$|It {{was five}} o'clock before Miltoun left the Bridge, and passed, like an exile, before {{the gates of}} Church and State, {{on his way to}} his uncle's Club. He stopped to {{telegraph}} to Audrey the time he would be coming to-morrow afternoon; and on leaving the Post-Office, noticed in the window of the adjoining shop some reproductions of old Italian masterpieces, amongst them one of Botticelli's 'Birth of Venus.' He had never seen that picture; and, remembering that she had told him it was her favourite, he stopped to look at it. Averagely well versed in such matters, as became one of his caste, Miltoun had not the power of letting a work of art insidiously steal the private self from his soul, and replace it with the self of all the world; and he examined this far-famed presentment of the heathen goddess with aloofness, even irritation. The drawing of the body seemed to him crude, the whole picture a little flat and Early; he did not like the figure of the Flora. The golden serenity, and tenderness, of which she had spoken, left him cold. Then he found himself looking at the face, and slowly, but with uncanny certainty, began to feel that he was looking at the face of Audrey herself. The hair was golden and different, the eyes grey and different, the mouth a little fuller; yet--it was her face; the same oval shape, the same far-apart, arched brows, the same strangely tender, elusive spirit. And, as though offended, he turned and walked on. In the window of that little shop was the effigy of her for whom he had bartered away his life--the incarnation of passive and entwining love, that gentle creature, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> given herself to him so utterly, for whom love, and the flowers, and trees, and birds, music, the sky, and the quick-flowing streams, were all-sufficing; and who, like the goddess in the picture, seemed wondering at her own existence. He had a sudden glimpse of understanding, strange indeed in one <b>who</b> <b>had</b> so <b>little</b> <b>power</b> of seeing into others' hearts: Ought she ever to have been born into a world like this? But the flash of insight yielded quickly to that sickening consciousness of his own position, which never left him now. Whatever else he did, he must get rid of that malaise! But what could he do in that coming life? Write books? What sort of books could he write? Only such as expressed his views of citizenship, his political and social beliefs. As well remain sitting and speaking beneath those towers! He could never join the happy band of artists, those soft and indeterminate spirits, for whom barriers had no meaning, content-to understand, interpret, and create. What should he be doing in that galley? The thought was inconceivable. A career at the Bar--yes, he might take that up; but to what end? To become a judge! As well continue to sit beneath those towers! Too late for diplomacy. Too late for the Army; besides, he had not the faintest taste for military glory. Bury himself in the country like Uncle Dennis, and administer one of his father's estates? It would be death. Go amongst the poor? For a moment he thought he had found a new vocation. But in what capacity--to order their lives, when he himself could not order his own; or, as a mere conduit pipe for money, when he believed that charity was rotting the nation to its core? At the head of every avenue stood an angel or devil with drawn sword. And then there came to him another thought. Since he was being cast forth from Church and State, could he not play the fallen spirit like a man--be Lucifer, and destroy! And instinctively he at once saw himself returning to those towers, and beneath them crossing the floor; joining the revolutionaries, the Radicals, the freethinkers, scourging his present Party, the party of authority and institutions. The idea struck him as supremely comic, and he laughed out loud in the street....|$|R
