2500|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco in 1957, I {{remember}} going to The Place at North Beach with Michael McClure.

I {{think it was}} part of a stovepipe, there was a doll's head in the vent, and it had wheels; it was like a cart (with a cane on it). -- Bruce Conner ...|$|E
2500|$|After his crash at Spa, Stewart {{became an}} outspoken {{advocate}} for auto racing safety. Later, he explained, [...] "If I have any legacy {{to leave the}} sport I {{hope it will be}} seen to be an area of safety because <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Grand Prix racing so-called precautions and safety measures were diabolical." [...] By Stewart's reckoning, a driver who raced for five years had a two-thirds chance of being killed in a crash.|$|E
2500|$|I kept {{up playing}} drums until I moved to London. I'd {{always wanted to}} be a good drummer and it's just ironic that I've turned out to be a bass player. The way I started playing bass was that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> London I was looking for a job, and the only place I could find one was in Macaris in Charing Cross Rd. I wanted to get {{something}} involved in music, and that seemed like a good place to be. But Macaris didn't sell drums, and so I lied and said I could play bass. They said, [...] "Fine, you sell the basses, and sweep up and get the coffees and whatever".|$|E

60|$|He {{was lying}} in the sun outside the hut <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> late <b>in</b> the afternoon, after a three-hours' climb {{followed}} by a porter carrying my small amount of luggage. He could not raise his hand, but his strangely brilliant eyes spoke their welcome.|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the lecture-hall {{that evening}} some one said: [...] "Come into the waiting-room; there's {{a friend of}} yours there who wants to see you. You'll not be introduced--you are to do the {{recognizing}} without help if you can." ...|$|E
60|$|Chicago was now {{full in the}} spot-light of the National Stage. In {{spite of}} the {{business}} depression which still engulfed the west, the promoters of the Columbian Exposition were going steadily forward with their plans, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the city about the middle of January, the bustle of preparation was {{at a very high}} point.|$|E
60|$|After taking maté I {{left them}} to settle their affairs, not doubting which {{would come out}} best from a trial of skill. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> sight of Peralta's trees I unsaddled and picketed my horses, then {{stretched}} myself out on my rugs. After the excitements and pleasures of that day, which had robbed me of my siesta, I quickly fell into a very sound sleep.|$|E
60|$|This {{made the}} thing {{a bit more}} plausible. <b>I</b> remembered that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> America about a year before, the {{proceedings}} had begun at some ghastly hour like six, and that I had been shot out on to a foreign shore considerably before eight.|$|R

50|$|Thomas Lyster of Rowton {{was eleven}} {{years of age}} in 1623, {{according}} to the visitations. He was a devoted adherent of King Charles I.

He was knighted for this act of loyalty.|$|R
60|$|The servant was {{standing}} idling {{at the front}} door, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> sight of the house. This, in itself, was unusual. He was a hard-working well-trained man.

Not the slightest appearance of disturbance was visible in his face.|$|E
60|$|Ladies and Gentlemen,--It {{is a great}} {{satisfaction}} to me {{that this}} question has been put by the Mayor, inasmuch as I hope I may receive it as a token that he has forgiven me those extremely large letters, which I must say, from the glimpse I caught of them <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the town, looked like a leaf from the first primer of a very promising young giant.|$|E

I walked London till the soles of my shoes were worn through, and my toes were blistered. I ate only enough to keep body and soul together." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, at {{the same}} time, Sima Zhao {{personally}} led an army out of the Luoyang with Jia Chong towards Chengdu. As Sima Zhao moved to lead his forces to station at Chang'an, Shao Ti told Sima {{that there was no}} need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng. Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' I replied, 'If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?' He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>in</b> Chang'an." ...|$|R
2500|$|Later, after Zhong Hui {{secretly}} accused Deng Ai {{of plotting}} a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted {{to lead his}} forces to station at Chang'an.

60|$|My new {{daughter}} was all important, {{but the new}} book could not be neglected. Hesper was scheduled for publication in October and copy {{must go to the}} printer in August, therefore I was forced to leave my wife and babe and go East to attend to the proof-reading and other matters incidental to the birth of another novel. Some lectures in Chicago and Chautauqua took up nearly two weeks of my time and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> New York, huge bundles of galley-proof were awaiting me.|$|E
6000|$|Biggs, of {{the great}} house of Higgs, Biggs, and Blatherwick, was our man of business: <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> London I heard {{that he had just}} set off to Paris after me. So we started down to Tuggeridgeville instead of going to Portland Place. As we came through the lodge-gates, we found a crowd {{assembled}} within them; and there was that horrid Tuggeridige on horseback, with a shabby-looking man, called Mr. Scapgoat, and his man of business, and many more. [...] "Mr. Scapgoat," [...] says Tuggeridge, grinning, and handing him over a sealed paper, [...] "here's the lease; I leave you in possession, and wish you good morning." ...|$|E
60|$|As for {{the general}} {{condition}} of the country, it was {{as it had been}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> it, to all intents and purposes. I had made changes, but they were necessarily slight, and they were not noticeable. Thus far, I had not even meddled with taxation, outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues. I had systematized those, and put the service on an effective and righteous basis. As a result, these revenues were already quadrupled, and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than before, that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief, and the praises of my administration were hearty and general.|$|E

60|$|We are now return'd {{back to our}} Settlement on the North Part of the Island; and I have singl'd {{out about}} 12 or 13 bold brave Fellows, with whom I am resolv'd to venture to the Gulph of Persia; twenty more of our Men have agreed to carry us thither as Passengers in the Sloop, and try their own Fortunes afterwards, for they allow we are enough to go together. We resolve, {{when we come to}} Bassaro, to {{separate}} into three Companies, as if we did not know one another; to dress ourselves as Merchants, for now we look like Hell-hounds and Vagabonds; but when we are well dress'd, we expect to look as other Men do. If I come thither, I purpose, with two more, to give my Companions the Slip, and travel as Armenians thro' Persia to the Caspian Sea, so to Constantinople; and I doubt not we shall, one Way or other, find our Way, with our Merchandize and Money, to come into France, if not quite Home to my own Country.

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{returned}} to Hobart Town, where drink was obtainable, I drank as of old. The same <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> back <b>in</b> Australia. On the contrary, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> sailed from Australia on a tramp steamer commanded by an abstemious captain, I took no drink along, {{and had no}} drink for the forty-three days' passage. <b>Arrived</b> <b>in</b> Ecuador, squarely under the equatorial sun, where the humans were dying of yellow fever, smallpox, and the plague, I promptly drank again--every drink of every sort that had a kick in it. I caught none of these diseases. Neither did Charmian nor Nakata who did not drink.|$|R
60|$|Seventy or eighty per cent. of the {{population}} of China are engaged in agriculture. Rice and tea are the chief products of the south, while wheat and other kinds of grain form the staple crops in the north.[34] The rainfall is very great in the south, but in the north it is only just sufficient to prevent the land from being a desert. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> China, in the autumn of 1920, a large area in the north, owing to drought, was afflicted with a terrible famine, nearly as bad, probably, as the famine in Russia in 1921. As the Bolsheviks were not concerned, foreigners had no hesitation in trying to bring relief. As for the Chinese, they regarded it passively as a stroke of fate, and even those who died of it shared this view.|$|E
60|$|You {{perceive}} {{that he is}} a pleasant text for me. It is easy to write about him. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> September, lord how black the prospect was--how desperate, how incurably desperate! Webster and Co. had to have a small sum of money or go under at once. I flew to Hartford--to my friends--but they were not moved, not strongly interested, and I was ashamed that I went. It was from Mr. Rogers, a stranger, that I got the money and was by it saved. And then--while still a stranger--he set himself the task of saving my financial life without putting upon me (in his native delicacy) any sense that I was the recipient of a charity, a benevolence--and he has accomplished that task; accomplished it at a cost of three months of wearing and difficult labor. He gave that time to me--time which could not be bought by any man at a hundred thousand dollars a month--no, nor for three times the money.|$|E
60|$|In {{the famous}} sortie which we made upon the twenty-third, I {{was of course}} among the {{foremost}} in the melee, and found myself, after {{a good deal of}} slaughtering (which it would be as disagreeable as useless to describe here), in the court of a small inn or podesta, which had been made the head-quarters of several Queenite officers during the siege. The pesatero or landlord of the inn had been despatched by my brave chapel-churies, with his fine family of children--the officers quartered in the podesta had of course bolted; but one man remained, and my fellows were on the point of cutting him into ten thousand pieces with their borachios, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the room time enough to prevent the catastrophe. Seeing before me an individual in the costume of a civilian--a white hat, a light blue satin cravat, embroidered with butterflies and other quadrupeds, a green coat and brass buttons, and a pair of blue plaid trousers, I recognized at once a countryman, and interposed to save his life.|$|E

40|$|Temporary {{organizations}} {{are known to}} provide flexibility for industries that rely on them, but we know little about their implications for how work is accomplished and coordinated. In this paper, I propose that common portrayals of temporary organizations as ephemeral and unstable are inaccurate: Temporary {{organizations are}} in fact organized around structured role systems whose nuances are negotiated in situ. This paper analyzes one type of temporary organization, film projects, exploring {{the way in which}} roles both organize immediate work and maintain continuity across different projects. On each film set, role expectations are communicated through practices of enthusiastic thanking, polite admonishing, and role-oriented joking, which enable crew members to learn and negotiate role structures. Two important structural characteristics of film projects provide the organizational context within which coordination takes place: interorganizational career progression and projects as temporary total institutions. By showing how these structural elements and role enactments support one another, this work generates a more complete understanding of the conditions that affect coordination, including role duration, expectations of future interaction, and visibility of work. Key words: coordination; roles; temporary organizations It is 6 a. m. <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrive</b> <b>in</b> Rittenhouse Square for the first scene of the shoot, as instructed by the location manager.

5000|$|Well {{into the}} 1980s, when nearly every other local {{television}} news broadcast {{began with the}} latest news, KOLN began its newscasts with the weather report as a service to its mostly rural audience.
