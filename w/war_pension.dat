5|$|Following the German {{defeat in}} World War I, Hipper retired on 13 December 1918 from {{the navy and}} lived a quiet life; he {{received}} a full <b>war</b> <b>pension.</b> During {{the chaos of the}} German Revolution of 1918–1919, Hipper hid from radical revolutionaries by assuming a false name and moving frequently. He wrote a letter to Adolf von Trotha, the new fleet commander, expressing his approval of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919. After the revolution was over, Hipper moved to a house in Altona near Hamburg.|$|E

In 1949, Honner moved to Sydney with his family, taking up residence at Seaforth and after this he assumed the chair of the No. 2 <b>War</b> <b>Pension</b> Assessment Appeal Tribunal, undertaking the same duties as he had in Perth. In Sydney, Honner became involved with the United Nations Association (New South Wales Division) and between 1955 and 1957 he served as the association's president. Between 1961 and 1963, he also served as President of the Liberal Party of New South Wales. He was the first Catholic to undertake the role.|$|E

500|$|According to {{historian}} R. Hal Williams, Harrison had a [...] "widespread {{reputation for}} personal and official integrity". Closely scrutinized by Democrats, Harrison's reputation was largely intact {{when he left}} the White House. Having an advantage few 19th Century Presidents had, Harrison's own party, the Republicans, controlled Congress, while his administration actively advanced a Republican program of a higher tariff, moderate control of corporations, protecting African American voting rights, a generous Civil <b>War</b> <b>pension,</b> and compromising over the controversial silver issue. Historians have not raised [...] "serious questions about Harrison's own integrity or the integrity of his administration." ...|$|E

[...] Governor-General Sydenham denied a 27 February 1841 petition which she sent, seeking to have her son to take over James's customs position.

Working from a trailer in a run-down area of North Hollywood, Hubbard sold a number of science fiction stories that included his Ole Doc Methuselah series and the serialized novels The End Is Not Yet and To the Stars. However, he remained short of money and his son, L. Ron Hubbard Jr, testified later that Hubbard was dependent on his own father and Margaret's parents for money and his writings, which he was paid at a penny per word, never garnered him any more than $10,000 prior to the founding of Scientology.

The battery was among the last Confederate troops east of the Mississippi River to surrender on May 10, 1865, at Meridian, Mississippi. [...] The Compiled Service Records of the unit members confirm that most of the men were paroled at Meridian, Mississippi, on May 10, 1865.

2500|$|Empire Emerald sailed for Milford Haven on 14 March, {{arriving}} {{the next}} day. Whilst {{she was in}} port, her captain, Edward Butcher had to go ashore to receive orders for the Convoy. During {{his return to the}} ship, an accident occurred which later resulted in the amputation of his leg below the knee. In 1953, he was unsuccessful in a <b>war</b> <b>pension</b> for the injury as it was deemed not to be directly attributable to the war. Empire Emerald joined Convoy ON 77, which departed from Liverpool on 17 March and dispersed at [...] on 28 March. She left the convoy and proceeded to the Belfast Lough, arriving on 20 March and sailing four days later to join Convoy ON 79, which departed from Liverpool on 23 March and arrived at Halifax on 7 April. Her destination was New York, where she arrived on 7 April, departing five days later for Halifax, where she arrived on 20 April. Empire Emerald then joined Convoy HX 186, which departed that day and arrived at Liverpool on 2 May. She was carrying a cargo of paraffin and petrol. Her destination was the Clyde, where she arrived on 2 May.|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, 1808, {{there was}} a {{ceremony}} to lay the cornerstone of a planned vault. A grand ceremony of re-interment followed on May 26, 1808. A small square building stood above the 1808 vault with an eagle mounted {{at the point of}} the roof. [...] It was located on a triangular plot of land near the Brooklyn Navy Yard waterfront (Wallabout Bay) in what is now called Vinegar Hill. A wooden fence with thirteen posts and bars painted with the names of the original thirteen states was erected in front. At the entrance through the fence, an inscription said: [...] "Portal to the tomb of 11,500 patriot prisoners, who died in dungeons and prison-ships, in and about the City of New York, during the Revolution." [...] The remains were put in long coffins made of bluestone. Extra space was provided in case more bones were discovered during continuing renovations in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Little was done to repair or upkeep the vault and eventually, the original monument {{was in a state of}} disrepair and neglect. In 1839, Benjamin Romaine purchased the land where the Martyrs were buried, in a tax sale from Henry Reed Stiles for $291.08. Later that year on July 4, 1839, Benjamin Romaine made an appeal for support (governmental or civic) to build a monument. In this appeal, Romaine talked about the monument and his intention to use his Revolutionary <b>War</b> <b>pension</b> for the monument. On January 31, 1844, Benjamin Romaine died and was also interred in the crypt as he had been a prisoner of war on the ships.|$|E
