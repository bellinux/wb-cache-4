5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all <b>well</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E

The Vatican received many contemporary complaints about Orsenigo as nuncio; for example, Cardinal Theodor Innitzer, the Archbishop of Vienna, wrote to Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione in 1939, stating that Orsenigo was too timid and ineffectual. The German episcopate was divided on Orsenigo; Bishop Konrad von Preysing {{wrote a letter to}} the Vatican in 1937 calling Orsenigo too sympathetic with the Nazis, but Cardinal Adolf Bertram, the chairman of the German Bishops Conference, wrote a letter of praise recommending that Orsenigo be allowed to stay. von Preysing had a history of correspondence with Orsenigo, but became frustrated upon receiving the following response: [...] "charity is <b>well</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> but the greatest charity is not to make problems for the church".|$|E
2500|$|In late 1958, {{having won}} 56 {{national}} and international singles and doubles titles, Gibson retired from amateur tennis.

[...] "Being the Queen of Tennis is all <b>well</b> <b>and</b> <b>good,</b> but you can't eat a crown. Nor can you send the Internal Revenue Service a throne clipped to their tax forms.

[...] In 1959 she signed to play a series of exhibition matches against Karol Fageros before Harlem Globetrotter basketball games.

2500|$|On 10 October 1939, Britain refused Hitler's {{offer of}} peace and on 12 October, France did the same. Colonel-General Franz Halder (Chief of the General Staff of OKH), {{presented}} the first plan for Fall Gelb (Case Yellow) on 19 October. This was the pre-war codename of plans for a campaign in the Low Countries: the Aufmarschanweisung N°1, Fall Gelb (Deployment Instruction No. 1, Case Yellow). Halder's plan {{has been compared to}} the Schlieffen Plan, the name given to the German strategy of 1914 in the First World War. It was similar in that both plans entailed an advance through the middle of Belgium. Aufmarschanweisung N°1 envisioned a frontal attack, sacrificing a projected half million German soldiers to attain the limited goal of throwing the Allies back to the River Somme. Germany's strength for 1940 would then be spent; only in 1942 could the main attack against France begin. When Hitler raised objections to the plan and instead advocated for a decisive armoured breakthrough as had happened in the invasion of Poland, Halder and Brauchitsch attempted to dissuade him, arguing that while the fast-moving mechanised tactics were all <b>well</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> against a [...] "shoddy" [...] Eastern European army, they would not work against a first-rate military like the French.|$|E
2500|$|Eyvind Earle joined Walt Disney Productions in 1951 first {{employed}} {{as an assistant}} background painter for Peter Pan before being promoted as a full-fledged background painter in the Goofy cartoon, [...] "For Whom the Bulls Toil" [...] and the color stylist of the Academy Award-winning short, Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom. For Sleeping Beauty, Earle said he [...] "felt totally free to put my own style" [...] into the paintings he based on Hench's drawings stating [...] "Where his trees might have curved, I straightened them out…. I took a Hench and took the same subject, and the composition he had, and just turned in into my style." [...] Furthermore, Earle found inspiration in Italian Renaissance utilizing works from Albrecht Dürer, Pieter Bruegel, Nicolaas van Eyck, Sandro Botticelli, as well as Persian art and Japanese prints. When Geronimi became the supervising director, Earle and Geronimi entered furious creative divisions. Geronimi commented that he felt Earle's paintings [...] "lacked the mood {{in a lot of}} things. All that beautiful detail in the trees, the bark, and all that, that's all <b>well</b> <b>and</b> <b>good,</b> but who the hell's going to look at that? [...] The backgrounds became more important than the animation. He'd made them more like Christmas cards." [...] Earle left the Disney studios in March 1958, before Sleeping Beauty was completed, to take a job at the John Sutherland studio. As a result, Geronimi had Earle's background paintings softened and diluted from their distinctive medieval texture.|$|E
