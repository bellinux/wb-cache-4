50|$|Phylloxerans are aphid-like {{insects that}} are {{parasitic}} hemipterans on deciduous trees and perennial fruit crops. They feed on leaves and roots and are cecidogenic {{which means they}} induce galls to form. They have very complex life cycles with cyclical parthenogenesis and host alternation. Basically, here is briefly {{what happens in the}} life cycle: A female fundatrix hatches from an overwintering egg on the primary host which is usually a woody plant before bud burst stimulating a gall to form on the young leaves. Winged oﬀspring in the following or third generation migrate in spring to the secondary host (usually an herbaceous). Then, many winged and wingless generations may be produced on the secondary host before winged migrants return to the primary host in autumn. Males and mating females mate on the <b>winter</b> <b>host</b> and produce overwintering eggs.|$|E

50|$|The ciliate {{protozoan}} Orchitophrya stellarum {{is sometimes}} a parasite of the common starfish.It normally lives on the outer surface of the starfish feeding on sloughed-off epidermal tissue. It appears to become parasitic when the host starfish has ripe gonads and is a male. It enters the starfish through the gonopores, the orifices where gametes are released. There may be a pheromone that alerts it {{to the fact that}} the testes are ripe and causes it to change its behaviour. As different species of starfish breed at different times of year, Orchitophrya stellarum may move from one species to another in accordance with their reproductive cycles. In the Atlantic Ocean, it may alternate between parasitising Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens during the spring and summer and the <b>winter</b> <b>host</b> may be Leptasterias spp.. The ciliate has been found in the testes of all these species. When inside the gonad, it phagocytoses the sperm thus rendering the starfish infertile. Researchers have found a change in the sex ratios of affected populations with fewer males than females being present with the males being consistently smaller than the females.|$|E
50|$|Orchitophrya stellarum {{is often}} {{associated}} with sea stars and other invertebrates, living on their outer surface and feeding on sloughed-off epidermal tissue.

In the Atlantic Ocean, the <b>winter</b> <b>host</b> may again be Leptasterias spp. but the spring and summer hosts are likely to be Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens. The ciliate has been found in the testes of all these species. When inside the gonad, it phagocytoses the sperm thus rendering the starfish infertile. Researchers have found skewed sex ratios of affected populations with fewer males than females being found, and males being consistently smaller than females. The researchers thought it likely that there was increased mortality among infected males.|$|E
50|$|Like many rust diseases, G. sabinae {{requires}} {{two different}} hosts to complete its life cycle {{from year to}} year. Juniper is the <b>winter</b> <b>host</b> and pear {{is the most common}} summer host. Spores (called aeciospores) are produced from the fungal lantern-shaped growths which protrude from the blisters {{on the underside of the}} pear leaf which become airborne and infect junipers. This fungus overwinters in swellings or galls on infected twigs and branches of susceptible juniper plants. In the spring after a rain or heavy dew, the galls on the juniper produce tiny dark horn-like growths that become covered with an orange-brown gelatinous mass called telia. The corresponding stage on the pear trees is known as aecia. The telia and aecia release wind borne resting or hibernating spores (called teliospores and aeciospores) capable of infecting susceptible pear leaves and Juniper respectively. Spores produced from the fungus-induced swellings on juniper stems can be infectious up to 6 km. The disease causes a yellow-orange spot that turns bright red on leaves of pear trees. The disease can be particularly damaging on pear, resulting in complete defoliation and crop loss if not treated. The fungus feeds on the living cells of the host plant and is not capable of surviving on dead plant material, and so must either alternate with a different host or produce resting spores to pass the dormant season. Pear rust is a regulated disease in some countries.|$|E

Issues related with the application of overwintering egg numbers to predict the occurrence of soybean aphid were studied in this paper. The ratio of <b>winter</b> <b>host</b> numbers to summer host numbers and overwintering egg quantity in different areas of Jilin Province were compared. Based on data about overwintering egg quantities in winter hosts, Rhamnus davaricus, aphid numbers in early and pre-peak infestation stage from 1961 to 1981 in Gongzhuling district and aphid infestation level in Siping district, the relationship between overwintering egg quantity, and aphid number were analyzed.

Fungal endophytes were isolated from healthy plant parts such as stem, root, rhizome, and inflorescence employing standard isolation methods. One thousand five hundred and twenty-nine fungal isolates were obtained from 5200 fragments. Stem fragments harbored more endophytes (80. 37 %) than roots (19. 22 %). 31 fungal taxa comprised of coelomycetes (65 %), hyphomycetes (32 %), and ascomycetes (3 %).

40|$|ABSTRACT Zygina rhamni Ferrari (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Typhlocybinae) is a mesophyll-feeding {{leafhopper}} that infests grapevine, Vitis vinifera L. This leafhopperÕs overwintering {{strategy and}} {{the dynamics of}} its vineyard colonization, relative to {{the distance between the}} grapevines and the <b>winter</b> <b>host</b> plants and different grapevine vegetative densities, are described herein. This species shows a facultative heteroecious life cycle. In autumn, it migrates from vineyards to bramble, Rubus gr. fruticosus, and rose, Rosa chinensis Jacquin. On these host plants, females lay eggs that start to hatch at the end of March. Adults that developed on bramble colonize grapevines beginning in May; the leaf fall of rose, which takes place during the Þrst half of April, probably causes the death of unhatched eggs and nymphs. Wefound that overwintering females can move back to vineyards and lay eggs until early June. The dynamics of vineyard colonization by the leafhopper involved initial concentration in areas close to bramble (MayÐearly July) with subsequent, progressive spread through the vineyards, with concentration in areas of high vegetative density. Leafhopper presence was negligible in areas of vineyards with levels of vegetative density below a certain threshold...|$|E
40|$|Host {{choice and}} winter-host leaving in emigrants of bird cherry–oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus), were {{investigated}} in the laboratory. In settling choice tests, emigrants {{collected from the}} <b>winter</b> <b>host,</b> Prunus padus, preferred this plant over a summer host, oats. Emigrants which had left P. padus for up to 24 h did not express a preference as a group, and those which had left for 24 – 48 h preferred oats. Eighty seven percent of emigrants caged as fourth-instar nymphs on P. padus leaves abandoned the host by {{the second day of}} adult life, and apparently did not subsequently return to the leaf. In an olfactometer, P. padus leaves which had supported spring generations of R. padi were repellent to emigrants. Volatiles were entrained from uninfested and R. padi-infested P. padus using cut twigs in the laboratory as well as intact twigs on a tree in the field. Entrainment extracts from uninfested P. padus had no effect on emigrants in the olfactometer, whereas those from twigs infested with nymphal emigrants were repellent. The study indicates that in R. padi, host-alternation is driven by behavioural changes which occur in individuals as well as between morphs...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{sequences}} of the mitochondrial COI gene of forty eight European and two Turkish population samples of Myzus cerasi from different winter hosts (Prunus spp.) {{were subjected to}} phylogenetic analyses. The analysed M. cerasi samples emerged as paraphyletic relative to a Myzus borealis sample used as an out-group, and formed two major clades in neighbor joining, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference trees, corresponding to subspecies living specifically on Prunus avium and P. cerasus.

40|$|Cixiid planthoppers are {{considered}} of major economic importance, {{as they can}} transmit phytoplasmas responsible for many plant diseases. While thorougly studied in vineyards, the epidemiology of stolbur phytoplasma, transmitted by Hyalesthes obsoletus Signoret, was rarely investigated on minor crops as lavender, where it leads to ‘yellow decline’ disease and large economic losses. The objective {{of this paper is}} to understand the effect of the local landscape characteristics on the presence and density of H. obsoletus in the ‘Plateau de Valensole’, southern France. Potential host plants of H. obsoletus were surveyed in three contrasted zones (in terms of crops and disease intensity), by uprooting plants and capturing adults in emergence traps. The localization and potential movements of H. obsoletus from the host plants towards lavandin (infertile hybrid of lavender) were determined using yellow sticky traps. Clary sage plants were found as major hosts of H. obsoletus. Flying insects were also caught in fields of lavandin, although emergence traps and plant uprooting did not confirm this crop as a <b>winter</b> <b>host,</b> i. e., as a reservoir for the insect. Based on one zone, we showed that attractiveness may depend on crop (clary sage or lavandin) and on its age, as well as on the distance to the supposed source field. These results suggest that clary sage could be an important host of H. obsoletus, whose density largely varies between zones. Genetic studies would be required to confirm the role of clary sage in the dissemination of yellow decline of lavandin...|$|E
