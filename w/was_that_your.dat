6000|$|... ‘Not I alone,’ {{returned}} my father, {{lowering his}} voice; ‘for see where {{these have been}} scraped away. Am I right? <b>Was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> secret store?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{unfortunately}} true. The trouble <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> brother lives a {{long way}} off, and you led {{me to believe that}} your money was running out." ...|$|E
5000|$|Paracha: Your honor, my {{question}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> executive order <b>is</b> applicable around the earth? ...|$|R

5000|$|Q: So what you’re saying <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{relationship}} in the United States has been with one individual. Is that correct? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I alone," [...] {{returned}} my father, {{lowering his}} voice; [...] "for see where {{these have been}} scraped away. Am I right? <b>Was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> secret store?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We heard {{yesterday}} morning from Mr. Merridrew," [...] he commenced. [...] "He made us a remittance which was four hundred pounds {{short of what}} we expected. His explanation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> lordship had received that sum from him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I meant, Lord Miltoun, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{class is}} the driest and most {{practical}} in the State--it's odd if it doesn't save {{you from a}} poet's dreams. Good-night!" [...] He passed out on to the lawn, and vanished.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's an houri!" [...] exclaimed William. [...] "Gad, I'm {{almost done}} for! She's a lotus-blossom!—But <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> ring she's wearing, Tempest?" ...|$|R
50|$|A {{discretionary}} housing payment {{cannot be}} paid if {{the reason for}} shortfall <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> benefit has <b>been</b> reduced to recover an overpayment.|$|R
6000|$|... '"I don't {{know about}} his uncle," [...] said Allo, [...] "but the trouble with you, Parnesius, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> General thinks well of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Consider, sir, {{that the}} object <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{liability}} should be limited. Thousands of pounds were passing through my hands in that time, and therefore these four audits were, as one might say, insufficient for {{the object of the}} bond.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> best? Were those your {{vast and}} solid? Riches, opinions, politics, institutions, to part obediently {{from the path}} [...] of one man or woman! The centuries, and all authority, to be trod under the foot-soles of one [...] man or woman! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I don't {{really see}} {{why you want to}} talk to ME about it. And if you are {{thinking}} that such a story would go down for a moment with Joan as an evidence of your reformation, you're completely out, Dick. <b>Was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> idea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Even {{a mother}} should not throw her worship away like <b>that.</b> The fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> brother will ruin you both if this goes on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{teeth and}} {{digestion}} are unaccustomed to our food; perhaps {{it might be}} wiser for you to return in the hamper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a direct}} materialization," [...] confessed Mrs. Joyce. [...] "My own feeling <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{grandfather}} sent it to assure us of your mother's return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "During the brawl. Apparently one of {{his efforts}} got home on your elbow instead of your {{expressive}} countenance, and whether it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> elbow was particularly tough or his wrist particularly fragile, I don't know. Anyhow, it went. It's nothing bad, but it'll {{keep him out of}} the game tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We did; and, with my testimony, {{how could}} you doubt the fact, or her either? But we {{suppressed}} the true explanation of these letters, and that <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> father thought it right the young leddy should pass for his daughter for a while, on account o'some family reasons that were amang them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have the}} power," [...] {{she said with}} slight coldness, [...] "to buy most things. By the by, I was {{thinking}} only just now, how sad it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> partner did not live. He shared the work with you, didn't he? It seems such hard lines {{that he could not}} have shared the reward!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'The result,' he said, 'if I may venture on {{somewhat}} delicate matters, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{depression of}} spirits infects {{your wife and}} family, even your servants?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, we {{were all}} mad, as you may well imagine, at being {{detained}} so long there. Our only hope <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> small force {{would not be able}} to fight its way through, until our advance took the spirit out of the natives. Certainly they fought very pluckily, in their attacks upon the force that had crossed; and that action came very close to being a serious disaster.|$|E
60|$|FRANKLYN. I know that. I {{know who}} you are. And the earth-shaking part of it {{to me is that}} though you were placed in that {{enormously}} responsible position, neither I nor anyone else knows what your beliefs are, or even whether you have either beliefs or principles. What we did know <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> Government was formed largely of men who regarded you as a robber of henroosts, and whom you regarded as enemies of the people.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{coming to}} that," [...] he told her. [...] "Please be patient. I {{want to remind}} you of {{something}} else. So far as I remember, my only request, when I gave you your liberty and half my income, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> friendship with the Draconmeyers should decrease. Almost the first persons I see on my arrival in Monte Carlo are you and Mr. Draconmeyer. I learn that you came out with them and that you are staying at the same hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be so, Spy," [...] {{answered}} the Saracen, {{looking at him}} with sombre, contemptuous eyes. [...] "It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> life will pay the price." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Garnache, with an {{ever-increasing}} tartness, [...] "there is a by-word has it 'Much laughter, little wit.' In confidence won, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> case, monsieur?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him with a saucy smile. [...] "Have I driven you into a corner at last? And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> way of getting out of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "We will say ten o'clock then?" [...] With consummate ease of manner {{he turned to}} Tommy. [...] "I must confess, Mr. Beresford, that it was {{something}} of a surprise to me to see you here this evening. The last I heard of you <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> friends were in grave anxiety on your behalf. Nothing had been heard of you for some days, and Miss Tuppence was inclined to think you had got into difficulties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear I did {{not express}} myself well," [...] apologised Constance. [...] "But I have grown a little morbid, perhaps, through {{knowing that the}} few friends I have, who knew my husband, had formed a {{somewhat}} disparaging and greatly mistaken opinion of him. I am sorry they knew him so little; but it is perhaps natural for us to think little of any man until he succeeds. What I meant to say <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> words did not sound as if they came only from your lips." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The trouble {{should be}} welcome," [...] said Sir Geoffrey, [...] "and more welcome the danger, which should come {{on such an}} account. My plan <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> ladyship should have honoured Martindale with a few days' residence, {{which might have been}} kept private until the search after you was ended. Had I seen this fellow Bridgenorth, I have no doubt I could have {{compelled}} him to act discreetly; but he is now at liberty, and will keep out of my reach; and, what is worse, he has the secret of the priest's chamber." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{one thing}} plain to be seen, Anne," [...] said Marilla, [...] "and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{fall off the}} Barry roof hasn't injured your tongue at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The message, mon ami, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> friend {{comes into}} these parts {{and would have}} a night's lodging at the manor house of Tilford for the love and respect <b>that</b> he bears <b>your</b> family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed?" [...] {{answered}} the Lady Hermione; [...] "and who may Dame Ursley <b>be,</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> wise choice has associated {{with me in}} the difficult task of advising a fool?" ...|$|R
