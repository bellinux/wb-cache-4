5|$|Over {{much of her}} childhood, Michelena’s parents toured {{with the}} Emma Abbott Grand Opera Company a {{traveling}} theatre company that performed famous operas translated to English for American audiences. Beatriz's father in later life taught music {{and worked as a}} vocal coach and, {{at the time of his}} death, was serving as president of Arrillaga Musical College, San Francisco. Beatriz and her sister Vera were trained by their father in classical voice and drama studies, and they followed in his footsteps by beginning singing careers of their own. Vera first appeared onstage in the Princess Chic Opera company (1901) at 17, taking a leading role in The Man from China (1904). Beatriz, too, performed with Princess Chic in 1901, taking chorus roles suitable for a child of 11. By mid-1904, with Vera busy pursuing her career in New York, Fernando Michelena settled in San Francisco, California to teach voice. There, he raised Beatriz and continued to train her, a soprano, in operatic vocal techniques. He passed his stage experience to his daughter: the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> as another person, the way to make simple but authoritative gestures, and the way to build intensity over the span of a performance. Maria Antonia Field, a Californian writer, would later chronicle her time as a student of Michelena’s father in her book, Five Years of Vocal Study under Fernando Michelena.|$|E

The risk of cold storing perishable food, without an assured <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> and sell it, puts the economic viability of expensive cold storage in doubt. In the absence of organised retail competition and with a ban on foreign direct investment in multi-brand retailers, foreign direct investments are unlikely to begin in cold storage and farm logistics infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|In walking, and {{for many}} animals running, the motion of legs {{on either side of}} the body {{alternate}}s, i.e. is out of phase. Other animals, such as a horse when galloping, or an inchworm, alternate between their front and back legs. An alternative to a gait that alternates between legs is hopping or saltation, where all legs move together. As a main means of locomotion, this is usually found in bipeds or semi-bipeds. Among the mammals saltation is commonly used among macropods (kangaroos and their relatives), jerboas, springhares, kangaroo rats, hopping mice, gerbils, and sportive lemurs. Certain tendons in kangaroo hind legs are very elastic, allowing kangaroos to effectively bounce along conserving energy from hop to hop, making hopping a very energy efficient <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> around in their nutrient poor environment. Saltation is also used by many small birds. Frogs and fleas also hop.|$|E
25|$|Connie and Edward argue and, out {{of anger}} and frustration, Edward says {{that he wanted to}} kill her instead of Paul.

As Connie is burning the photographs of her and Paul in the fireplace, Edward says he will turn himself in. Connie objects, saying they will find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> on. The two then appear to go about living a normal life. One night, while driving, with Charlie sleeping in the backseat, Edward stops the car at an intersection. Connie whispers to Edward that they could leave the country and assume new identities, and Edward agrees to the idea. Connie then starts crying, and Edward consoles her. It is revealed that Edward has stopped his car near a police station, implying he is about to leave their car and turn himself in.|$|E

25|$|Netball {{rules do}} not permit players to let their landing foot touch the ground again if it is lifted at all while in {{possession}} of the ball, so players can take 1.5 steps while holding the ball. Pivoting does not count as a step. Players are entitled to balance {{on the other foot}} if the landing foot is lifted. An infraction of this rule is usually called stepping or travelling , as in the similar rule in basketball. Consequently, the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the ball towards the goal is to throw the ball to a teammate. The ball can be held by a player for less than three seconds at any time. A player may tap or deflect the ball, let it bounce and then take possession and throw it. The player cannot catch the ball with both hands, drop it and pick it up again; this is called a replayed ball. The duration before it is called a drop is determined by the umpire. These rules, combined with the restrictions on where one player of a particular position can move, ensure that everyone on the team is regularly involved in play.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the only}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> {{in the game}} is on foot, once Roll Caskett repairs a support car, {{she is able to}} {{directly}} take Mega Man to specific areas. In Legends, large gems called Refractors are used as a power source. Small shards of them can be exchanged for money, and in the game, enemies that are destroyed will often drop these Refractor Shards. When shards are picked up, the equivalent amount of Zenny, the game's basic unit of currency, is added automatically. The health of Mega Man can be increased through the game in the shops, while it can be recovered through packs bought at shops, obtaining red spheres from defeated opponents or by asking the character Data to recover Mega Man's health. Mega Man also has a Life Shield which reduces the damage that he can receive from enemies. The damage caused by enemies can also be reduced by obtaining upgrades to Mega Man's armor or his helmet. Mega Man's interactions with characters from the game can also affect the price of objects. If the player makes Mega Man be rude with characters, prices from objects will be increased and the dialogues with people will also change.|$|E
