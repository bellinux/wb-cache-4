This was conjectured to {{be solved}} by the Kelvin structure, and this was widely believed for over 100 years, until disproved by {{the discovery of the}} Weaire–Phelan structure. The surprising discovery of the Weaire–Phelan structure and disproof of the Kelvin conjecture is one reason for the caution in accepting Hales' proof of the Kepler conjecture.|$|E

The surface of implants that contact the body might be made of a biomedical material such as titanium, silicone or apatite depending on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> functional. In some cases, implants contain electronics, e.g. artificial pacemakers and cochlear implants. Some implants are bioactive, such as subcutaneous drug delivery devices in the form of implantable pills or drug-eluting stents.|$|E

25|$|Programs are set {{up around}} the country in hopes to educate {{individuals}} with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.|$|E

It occurs in living beings {{in the form of}} phosphate, which is ubiquitous in biochemistry, chiefly in the form of C-O-P (carbon, oxygen and phosphorus), C-P, or P-O-P linkages to form life.

Evolutionary biology provides one set of criteria for identifying these characteristics and for designating relative importance among them. Genotypic universality, automaticity, and adaptation are examined as potential criteria for identifying important species-typical characteristics.
