He can choose to not work at all, since he has an {{endowment}} of Π dollars from being a shareholder. [...] Let us instead consider the more realistic case of him deciding {{to work for a}} few hours. His labour consumption choice can be illustrated in figure 4: ...|$|E
500|$|One night, Hud takes Lonnie out {{and they}} prevail in a drunken barroom brawl. Back at the ranch he {{reflects}} on the past (when he and Lonnie's father did the same thing), revealing his feelings about his brother Norman's death and his father's coldness to him. When they enter the house Homer confronts Hud, accusing his son of trying to corrupt Lonnie. They argue, with Hud accusing Homer of hypocrisy and resentment of him for Norman's death. Homer replies that his disappointment in Hud began before the accident; Hud cares about no one but himself, and is [...] "not fit to live with". Hurt and angry, Hud retorts [...] "My mama loved me, but she died" [...] as he walks away. When Lonnie tells Homer {{that he was too}} harsh and other people act like him, Homer replies that one day he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> for himself what is right and wrong.|$|E

2500|$|GamePro's McKinley Noble {{commented that}} he {{anticipated}} the English release of Platinum. 1UP.com commented that fans {{will not be}} left [...] "wanting", stating [...] "once you venture back down the Pokémon rabbit hole, you won't be coming up again for a while." [...] IGN's Craig Harris commented that those looking for something particularly new in Platinum such as a new method of control would be disappointed, adding that the controls felt [...] "clumsy". However, he noted that those who played Diamond and Pearl will enjoy it for its new features and available Pokémon. In another preview, Harris commented {{that those who have}} played Diamond or Pearl <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether the new features are worth buying the game for, while those who have not should buy it if interested in playing a Pokémon game.|$|E
2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{his plans for}} the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was [...] "way too late, way too little.... So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Another {{trade-off}} {{is to use}} {{a somewhat}} less reliable, but more secure, verification service, but to include an expiration date for each of the verification sources. How long this [...] "timeout" [...] should be is a decision that requires a trade-off between availability and security that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>decided</b> in advance, at the time of system design.|$|R
6000|$|... "At about {{eleven o'clock}} to-morrow morning," [...] he announced, [...] "I shall have the {{pleasure}} of calling upon you. I trust that you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> take the house." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] he returned, {{in a tone}} {{of quiet}} indifference, [...] "we shall see. It is quite clear to every one with a grain of sense that people can't live comfortably under two masters; the people <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> that matter for {{themselves}} before long." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{all three}} artists from each team have performed, the coach <b>will</b> then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> which artist {{they want to}} give a [...] "fast pass" [...] to and put {{straight}} through to the semi-final. The voting lines for the remaining artists will then open after all twelve artists have performed, in a format change compared to previous series, the four artists with the fewest votes, regardless of which team, will leave the competition.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the blind}} auditions finish, the battle rounds will begin where the coaches will pair two singers on each team {{to compete against}} each other singing the same song on stage. The coaches <b>will</b> then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> which {{contestant}} <b>will</b> stay and which will be eliminated. After a series of eliminations, live performances will occur where the public can decide which singer will represent the Arab World as [...] "The Voice." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a report}} in the {{newspaper}} Wales on Sunday, John Walker, then National Treasurer for the BNP, said that the union is likely to contribute funds to the party: [...] "There probably will be a political levy at some stage to the BNP just as other unions raise money for Labour. It is quite possible and feasible that when Solidarity becomes fully functional some element of funds raised will be donated to the BNP, but that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>decided</b> through consultation with the membership." ...|$|R
6000|$|The smile grew {{a trifle}} plainer in Gallwey's eyes. [...] "As {{a matter of}} fact, and, {{although}} I am quite aware that {{there will probably be}} trouble about it, I am not going.

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{the general}} replied. [...] "You had better think the matter over, {{and let me}} know {{tomorrow}} how you had best proceed. It is not an enterprise to be undertaken without thinking it over in every light. You <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> whether you will go alone, or take anyone with you; when and how you will land; how you will regain the ships. You will, of course, have carte blanche in all respects." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was half}} an hour later when Appleby came out, and found them waiting still. “I {{understand}} you are going on to see Miss Wayne, and I should be glad to drive you over,” said Melton. “Then as you can’t get back here to‐night you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> which of us shall have the pleasure of entertaining you.

5000|$|January 22 - During a {{visit to}} France, André Boisclair meets Ségolène Royal, Socialist {{candidate}} for the 2007 presidential election. At this occasion, Royal expresses her support for the [...] "liberty and sovereignty" [...] of Quebec. After being criticized by several French media and French and Canadian politicians, such as prime minister Stephen Harper and opposition leader Stéphane Dion, Royal clarifies her thought by saying {{that she was not}} interfering in Canadian internal affairs or trying to dictate Quebec's policy, but that the future of Quebec <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>decided</b> by Quebecers.|$|R
6000|$|She pondered, but {{her face}} was kindly and her voice very gentle as she said: [...] "I don't want to seem unkind now in your hour of grief, but I can't wear the ring." [...] His eyes filled with tears, and she added: [...] "I'll keep it for you. The real {{question}} between us <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>decided</b> {{some time in the}} future--when we know each other better. You need not think of paying me. Go and see your relation. It may be a rich aunt come to adopt you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{constitutional}} debate surrounding executive {{authorization of}} warrantless surveillance is principally about {{separation of powers}} ("checks and balances"). If, as discussed above, no [...] "fair reading" [...] of FISA {{can be found in}} satisfaction of the canon of avoidance, these issues <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>decided</b> at the appellate level, by United States courts of appeals. It should be noted that in such a separation of powers dispute, the burden of proof is placed upon the Congress to establish its supremacy in the matter: the Executive branch enjoys the presumption of authority until an Appellate Court rules against it.|$|R
6000|$|And now, {{apart from}} all {{problems}} of manoeuvring, of {{rules of the}} road, of {{the judgment of the}} men in command, away from their possible errors and from the points the Court <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide,</b> if we ask ourselves what it was that was needed to avert this disaster costing so many lives, spreading so much sorrow, and to a certain point shocking the public conscience--if we ask that question, what is the answer to be? ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there is}} this question: Accepting the {{position}} of the two ships when they saw each other as correctly described in the very latest newspaper reports, it seems clear that it was the Empress of Ireland's duty to keep clear of the collier, and what the Court <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> is whether the stopping of the liner was, under the circumstances, the best way of keeping her clear of the other ship, which had the right to proceed cautiously on an unchanged course.|$|E
60|$|As for the Atlantic flora, you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> for yourselves {{whether you}} accept {{or not the}} theory of a sunken Atlantic continent. I confess that all {{objections}} to that theory, however astounding it may seem, are outweighed in my mind {{by a host of}} facts which I can explain by no other theory. But you must judge for yourselves; and to do so you must study carefully the distribution of heaths both in Europe and at the Cape, and their non-appearance beyond the Ural Mountains, and in America, save in Labrador, where the common ling, an older and less specialised form, exists. You must consider, too, the plants common to the Azores, Portugal, the West of England, Ireland, and the Western Hebrides. In so doing young naturalists will at least find proofs of a change in the distribution of land and water, which will utterly astound them when they face it for the first time.|$|E

50|$|Conflict Short of Warfare: As US {{precision}} {{targeting capability}} improves, adaptive adversaries {{will seek to}} avoid direct, unambiguous action that will provoke a violent US response. Instead, they will seek {{to remain in the}} grey shadowland between peace and war, avoiding US strengths, while attacking US weaknesses in subtle ways. Understanding this, future adversaries will “fight stupid or fight asymmetrically” and the Army should prepare for the latter. Subtle nuances of both international and US law will affect leader’s decision-making processes as the traditional definition of an enemy combatant becomes increasingly obsolete. As adversaries avoid becoming easily identifiable targets, Soldiers <b>will</b> increasingly <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> not just how but if the employment of violence will best serve national interests.|$|R
50|$|Future {{decisions}} of the Rasau’s authority <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>decided</b> and passed through provincial and tikina meetings and documented with NLTB records. As the records stand the Rasau is currently the Chieftain for Lomaloma Tikina and Lomaloma koro and the Yavusa and Matagali that fall within this domain. Lomaloma Tikina comprises 10 villages and they are as follows: Lomaloma (Nakoro), Sawana, Susui, Narocivo, Namalata, Uruone, Levukana, Dakuilomaloma, and Tuvuca. These villages are located {{on the island of}} Vanua Balavu except for Tuvuca, which lies between Vanua Balavu and Lakeba and near the Island of Nayau, all of which are located in the Lau group of islands, which form part of the island nation of Fiji.|$|R
60|$|A free {{communication}} by discretionary residence {{is necessary to}} all the other purposes of communication. For what purpose are the Irish and Plantation laws sent hither, but as means of preserving this sovereign constitution? Whether such a constitution was originally right or wrong {{this is not the time}} of day to dispute. If any evils arise from it, let us not strip it of what may be useful in it. By taking the English Privy Council into your legislature, you obtain a new, a further, and possibly a more liberal consideration of all your acts. If a local legislature shall by oblique means tend to deprive any of the people of this benefit, and shall make it penal to them to follow into England the laws which may affect them, then the English Privy Council <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> upon your acts without those lights that may enable them to judge upon what grounds you made them, or how far they ought to be modified, received, or rejected.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor should I, Dias; but you see, if we linger {{too long}} {{we may find}} it {{impossible}} to retire, we may be so hemmed in {{that there would be}} no chance of our getting through. For the day of course we are safe. The savages <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> among themselves whether to give the matter up, seeing that they are sure to lose many lives before they overpower us. Then, if they determine to attack us, they will have to settle how it is to be done. Numbers of them will go up to the top of the hills on both sides and try to find a point at which they can make their way down; others, perhaps--which would be still more serious--may go farther up into the hills to find a spot where they could come down and issue out by the upper gorge, and then our retreat would be altogether cut off. All this will take time, so we may feel sure that no attack will be made to-day." ...|$|E
60|$|And, first, I am {{to state}} to your Lordships, by the {{direction}} of those whom I am bound to obey, the principles on which Mr. Hastings declares he has conducted his government,--principles which he has avowed, first in several letters written to the East India Company, next in a paper of defence delivered to the House of Commons explicitly, and more explicitly in his defence before your Lordships. Nothing in Mr. Hastings's proceedings is so curious as his several defences; and nothing in the defences is so singular as the principles upon which he proceeds. Your Lordships <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> not only upon a large, connected, systematic train of misdemeanors, but an equally connected system of principles and maxims of government, invented to justify those misdemeanors. He has brought them forward and avowed them {{in the face of}} day. He has boldly and insultingly thrown them {{in the face of the}} representatives of a free people, and we cannot pass them by without adopting them. I am directed to protest against those grounds and principles upon which he frames his defence; for, if those grounds are good and valid, they carry off a great deal at least, if not entirely, the foundation of our charge.|$|E
6000|$|With {{regard to}} the letter I sent you, my opinion {{is that there is}} [...] a Parnell party and a {{separation}} or civil war party, and the [...] question which is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the upper hand <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>decided</b> [...] in a limited time. My earnest recommendation to everybody is not [...] to commit himself. Upon this rule, under whatever pressure, I [...] shall act as long as I can. There shall be no private negotiation [...] carried on by me, but the time may come when I shall be obliged to [...] speak publicly. Meanwhile I hope you will keep in free and full [...] communication with old colleagues. Pray put questions if this [...] letter seems ambiguous....|$|R

A Deliberation condition requires subjects to think about their evaluation of the objects, allowing both conscious and unconscious thought. A third Control condition requires subjects to report their answer immediately, allowing only for minimal conscious and unconscious thought.|$|R
50|$|Immanuel Kant, in the 18th century, {{argued that}} {{right and wrong}} are founded on duty, which issues a Categorical Imperative to us, a command that, of its nature, ought to be obeyed. An action is only truly moral if done {{from a sense of}} duty, and the most {{valuable}} thing is a human <b>will</b> that <b>has</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> act rightly. <b>To</b> <b>decide</b> what duty requires, Kant proposes the principle of universalizability: correct moral rules are those we could will everyone to adopt.|$|R
