Da Matta felt his team had learnt more from the series previous race on a superspeedway which he believed would help him in California <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to win. Having moved from 16th to eighth in the points standings with a victory in Laguna Seca and a second-place finish in Germany, Papis stated that he was focused on the race and hoped he would clinch his first victory in a 500-mile event despite having not managed to finish a race on a superspeedway in 2001. Bruno Junqueira was excited to race in Fontana and hoped that he could clinch his second victory of the year.|$|E
5|$|Arnold, whose {{business}} activities {{before the war}} had included sailing ships to Europe and the West Indies, carefully chose the site <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern Plattsburgh, New York), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains wanted to fight in open waters where {{they might be able}} to retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that the primary purpose of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{admitted}} the Count of Artois and his nephews the Dukes of Angoulême and Berry into the king's council in May 1814, upon its establishment. The council was informally headed by Prince Talleyrand. Louis XVIII took a large {{interest in the}} goings-on of the Congress of Vienna (set up to redraw the map of Europe after Napoleon's demise). Talleyrand represented France at the proceedings. Louis was horrified by Prussia's intention to annex the Kingdom of Saxony, {{to which he was}} attached because his mother was born a Saxon princess, and he was also concerned that Prussia would dominate Germany. He also wished the Duchy of Parma to be restored to the Parmese Bourbons, and not to Empress Marie Louise of France, as was being suggested by the Allies. Louis also protested the Allies' inaction in Naples, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> the Napoleonic usurper Joachim Murat removed in favour of the Neapolitan Bourbons.|$|E

5|$|On {{a sticky}} wicket, Toshack {{initially}} struggled, bowling his characteristic leg stump line. England struggled to 117 {{runs for the}} loss of five wickets (5/117) {{at the end of the}} fourth day despite many interruptions caused by rain. Norman Yardley and captain Wally Hammond had defied the Australian bowlers since coming together at 5/66. On the fifth and final morning, captain Don Bradman advised him to pitch straighter and at a slower pace. Before play began Bradman took him down the pitch and showed him exactly <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> him to bowl and even make him bowl a practice over alongside to make sure he got it right. Having started the day wicketless, Toshack dismissed Yardley and Hammond in the space of 13 runs to break the English resistance and finished with an economical 3/17 from 17 overs as England were bowled out for 141. Bradman enforced the follow-on, and with Lindwall indisposed, Toshack took the new ball with Miller. He continued where he finished in the first innings, taking four of the first six wickets (Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, Hammond and Yardley) as the English top order were reduced to 6/65. He ended the innings with 6/82 as England were bowled out twice in a day to lose by an innings and 332 runs. The remaining four Tests were less successful: only in one innings did he take more than one wicket. In the Second Test at Sydney the pitch favoured spin bowling and Toshack only bowled 13 overs without taking a wicket as Australia claimed another innings victory. He took match figures of 2/127 on a flat pitch in the Third Test in Melbourne, removing Len Hutton and Compton. During the match, Toshack came in to bat in the second innings with Australia nine wickets down. He defended stubbornly and ended unbeaten on two as his partner Lindwall went from 81 to 100 to score the fastest Test century by an Australian, in 88 balls. Toshack was more productive in the drawn Fourth Test in Adelaide, where he took match figures of 5/135 from 66 eight ball overs in extreme heat, including the wicket of Hammond twice, Edrich and Joe Hardstaff junior. Ahead of the final Test, Toshack removed Compton, Edrich and Godfrey Evans in a drawn match for Victoria against the tourists. He took only one wicket in the Fifth Test as Australia sealed the series 3–0 with a five-wicket win. Toshack finished the series with 17 wickets at a bowling average of 25.71. His first-class season was not as productive as in his debut year; he took 33 wickets at an average of 30.93 in eleven matches, making him the sixth highest wicket-taker for the season. Toshack had a particularly unsuccessful time in the two Sheffield Shield matches against arch-rivals Victoria, which were lost by heavy margins of an innings and 114 runs, and 288 runs respectively. In the first match he took 0/133 after Australian team-mate Miller hit three sixes from his opening over. In the second match he took a total of 3/144. Victoria went on to win the title.|$|E

25|$|Haystacks, or Hay Stacks, is a hill in England's Lake District, {{situated}} at the south-eastern end of the Buttermere Valley. Although not of any great elevation (597m, 1,958ft), Haystacks {{has become one of}} the most popular fells in the area.

25|$|She {{referred}} to her early girlhood as the most eventful part of her life. There was the long journey to Vermont the summer she was 18 months old, and her young mother’s death only four days after reaching the state which it had been hoped would give her health. There was the sojourn in New York, where William had established himself in business, and <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> his little daughter’s company. Clear and vivid was her memory of that trip down the Hudson River taken with her father when she was three years old, and of their arrival at the small boarding school on then fashionable Bleeker Street. At six, {{she was back in}} Middlebury, browsing in her father’s large and well chosen library —she could not remember the time when she {{did not know how to}} read— a library established in a newly-built house four miles up the Otter from Middlebury village in a quarter of the town called Farmingdale, a house presided over by a new step-mother. Here, also she recited daily lessons to her father and did her daily “stent” of sewing or knitting. Dorr grew to womanhood in a home of culture and refinement, and it is here where she began writing as a little child. It is here also that the father engaged in business again, and devoted himself chiefly to the development of the Rutland marble quarries. The home also included her half-brothers, Edward H. Ripley and Major General William Y. W. Ripley, both of whom became prominent officers in the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|At AAA's {{previous}} major event, Rey de Reyes on March 18, 2012, rudo stable El Consejo {{picked up}} their first win in AAA, when Máscara Año 2000 Jr., El Texano Jr. and Toscano defeated Dr. Wagner Jr., Electroshock and Heavy Metal in a six-man tag team match, with Máscara Año 2000 Jr. pinning Wagner Jr. for the win, following interference from El Consejos masked accomplice El Hombre de Negro ("The Man in black"). In {{the weeks that}} followed Rey de Reyes, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. kept making challenges towards Wagner Jr. for a singles match, while El Consejo as a whole also feuded with Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador of rudo stable La Sociedad. This would, on April 30, drive longtime rivals and real-life brothers, Wagner Jr. and Silver King to make peace with each other and team up against Máscara Año 2000 Jr. and El Texano Jr. After losing as a result of another interference from El Hombre de Negro, the brothers shook hands to signal the end of hostilities between the two. On June 1, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. pinned Wagner Jr. in a rematch from April 30 and afterwards challenged him to a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuestas, which Wagner Jr. accepted and named Triplemanía XX as the place, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> the match to take place. A third match between Máscara Año 2000 Jr. and El Texano and the Wagner brothers took place on June 16 and ended with El Consejo picking another win with help from El Hombre de Negro, who during a post-match beatdown unmasked and revealed himself as Máscara Año 2000, the legitimate father of Máscara Año 2000 Jr., who on April 30, 1993, had lost his mask to Perro Aguayo in the semi-main event of the first Triplemanía. In an interview on AAA's NotiAAA program, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. accepted the Mask vs. Mask match for Triplemanía XX and vowed to prove his family's superiority over the Wagner family by placing Wagner Jr.'s mask in his family's display cabinet. On June 30, Máscara Año 2000 Jr. defeated Wagner Jr. in a singles match with help from his father, after which the Mask vs. Mask match was made official for Triplemanía XX. On July 27 at the final AAA television taping before Triplemanía XX, the promotion recreated a famous segment from 1993, when Máscara Año 2000 hit Perro Aguayo with a glass bottle prior to their Triplemanía match, by having Máscara Año 2000 Jr. hit Dr. Wagner Jr. with a glass bottle to a win a No Disqualification match between the two, leaving his adversary bloodied in the ring heading into their Mask vs. Mask match.|$|E
