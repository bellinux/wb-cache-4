5|$|The game {{begins with}} Dutch (Adam Baldwin), Romeo (Nolan North), and Mickey (Alan Tudyk) {{discussing}} the Covenant ship above New Mombasa, with the Rookie asleep nearby. Buck (Nathan Fillion) arrives and introduces Dare (Tricia Helfer). Romeo wakes the Rookie {{and the team}} enter their HEVs and drop through the atmosphere; at the last minute, Dare changes their trajectory to miss the ship. The Covenant ship enters slipspace, sending a shockwave toward the ODSTs; the Rookie's pod collides with Mickey's and crashes into a building on the ground, knocking him unconscious for six hours. He awakens and proceeds to find clues as to <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> squadmates.|$|E
5|$|As the day wears on, Michael becomes {{convinced}} that <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{office is a}} hate crime and an act of terrorism. Believing it to have been perpetrated by someone in the office, he begins to lose his faith in his employees, whom he considers his friends. Michael tries talking to his former boss Ed Truck (Ken Howard), who tells him {{that he does not}} need to have his employees be his friends. But his mood changes drastically when he finds out the prank was carried out by his obnoxious friend Todd Packer (David Koechner). Michael instantly finds the joke hilarious, and his faith in his friends is restored. At the end of the day, Jim is cheered up when he finds that all seven of his voicemail messages were left by Pam throughout the day. Jim is seen driving home, and Pam's voicemails act as a voice-over, closing out the episode.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Nesbitt {{appeared}} in Wall of Silence, a fact-based drama about {{the aftermath of}} the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover exactly <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son. He had only just completed Bloody Sunday when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.|$|E

25|$|Twelve {{years went}} by before Raleigh {{decided to find out}} <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> colony. Led by Samuel Mace, this 1602 {{expedition}} differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors' wages so {{that they would not be}} distracted by privateering. However, Raleigh still hoped to make money from the trip, and Mace's ship landed in the Outer Banks to gather aromatic woods or plants such as sassafras that would generate a decent profit back in England. By the time they could turn their attention to the colonists, the weather had turned bad and they were forced to return without even making it to Roanoke Island. By this time, having been arrested for treason, Raleigh was unable to send any further missions.|$|E

Back at the mental hospital, The Evil Queen visits Hyde again, and uses her magic to free him from the cuffs and they walk out of the cell together, linking arms.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} free {{practice}} crash between Nakajima and Jarvis, Davidson called for cars to {{be equipped with}} brighter flashing rain lights and that <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> co-driver was [...] "every driver's worst nightmare". He suggested Formula One rain lights provided by McLaren Electronic Systems were brighter than those employed in the World Endurance Championship. Toyota's technical director Pascal Vasselon believed Nakajima's lack of reaction time along with the absence of flashing rain lights contributed to his injury. Christopher Reinke, Audi Sport's Le Mans Prototype manager, stated such a measure had been discussed but the issue was complex, while the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's (ACO) sporting manager, Vincent Beaumesnil, said he was unsure that brighter lights would have assisted Nakajima. In early June, the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the ACO, required all Le Mans Prototype cars carry additional flashing rain lights {{at the rear of}} their cars from the 24 Hours of Le Mans onward after the FIA's Endurance Committee observed their usage under wet weather conditions and felt there was an improvement in visibility.|$|E
500|$|The {{story for}} [...] "Release" [...] was {{developed}} by John Shiban and David Amann; the teleplay was written by Amann. Kim Manners helmed the directing of the episode. [...] "Release" [...] was originally going to be written by Shiban alone, but he later turned the script over to Amann because he was needed elsewhere at the time. Shiban had been desiring {{to write a story}} like [...] "Release" [...] for a while. The character of Hayes was crafted as an ambitious character, inspired by the works of Arthur Conan Doyle: he was written to be either a [...] "brilliant guy who's solving crimes with his amazing intuition", comparable to Sherlock Holmes, or [...] "a guy who's actually doing those crimes and playing a game", like Professor Moriarty. Shiban and Amman came up with a story wherein Scully encounters a [...] "genius" [...] from her classes at the FBI Academy at Quantico. Later on, they extrapolated on the story, allowing the [...] "genius" [...] crime solver to help John Doggett find out <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son, Luke Doggett.|$|E
500|$|While filming was {{underway}} {{for the seventh}} season, {{many members of the}} crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, [...] "There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show {{that it was time to}} call it a day." [...] Because the show's producers felt that the show was nearing its end, many story arcs were ended in the season. The fourth episode, [...] "Millennium" [...] was written as a way to bring closure to the recently cancelled Carter-created series of the same name. The episode features Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Frank for the last time. The eleventh episode, [...] "Closure", features Mulder discovering <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister. The idea to close the story arc received mixed reactions from various production and crew members. However, many of the show's producers realized that the time had come to answer one of the show's biggest questions. Paul Rabwin noted that, [...] "It's been seven years. I don't think any of us are going to miss Samantha Mulder. That device and motivation were very strong in the early years of the show. But as the years have gone by, the speculation kind of melted away." [...] As the season progressed, however, the idea of producing another season emerged. Paul Rabwin explained that, [...] "we found ourselves starting to get energized again. [...] As we got toward the end of the season, everyone was kind of hopeful." ...|$|E

In search of safety, the group of boys and Ishmael go to that village, but soon leave.|$|R

Encyc. i. 682, 684 8 and 13; comp.).|$|R
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the episode was mostly positive. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote highly of the episode and awarded it an A–. Handlen praised the episode's exploration of Mulder's mind, noting that the entry allowed the audience to see Mulder's views of the world. He argued that [...] "Mulder's desperate need to understand <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister [...] drives him to expect betrayal, because at least with betrayal, the world makes some kind of sense." [...] He did write, however, that he was [...] "a little disappointed at how [...] "Demons" [...] doesn't really hold up in retrospect from a story perspective," [...] but noted that [...] "what does work here is great." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode continued to strip away, in methodical fashion, Mulder’s psychological support system. [...] While there are some plot contrivances that are troubling, the episode as a whole comes together very well." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote that [...] "Demons" [...] works [...] "as a character study of Mulder" [...] and praised the episode's [...] "hyper-realistic flashback" [...] sequences. Vitaris, while calling {{the structure of the}} story [...] "not particularly imaginative", wrote that [...] "Mulder's condition is intriguing". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it [...] "the wrong episode at the wrong time." [...] The two argued that the attention given to Mulder's potential [...] "aneurysm" [...] are oddly juxtaposed next to Scully's real, life-threatening brain cancer. However, they did call the flashback sequences [...] "masterpieces of editing", but noted that their contents [...] "lack information".|$|E
