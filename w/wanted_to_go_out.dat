5|$|While in Washington, Lead Belly {{encountered}} {{several other}} incidents of segregation that {{are believed to}} have contributed to the impetus of the song. For instance, when Lead Belly, Lomax, and their wives <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to dinner together, they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them. Lead Belly was told that if he returned later without Lomax, he would be served.|$|E

25|$|This {{new version}} of Krypto has all the {{physical}} abilities of his pre-Crisis predecessor, but with a normal canine intellect. This initially causes {{a great deal of}} trouble for his new master when, for instance, he would scratch at a door to indicate he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and unintentionally gouged big chunks out of the door with his super strength, or inflicting grievous bodily harm when combating villains (since Krypto bites the way a regular canine would, only without being careful about his super strength). As a result, Krypto is for some time locked away in the Fortress of Solitude under the care of one of Superman's robots. This robot is programmed to emit the scent of the dog's real master. Superman has {{gone to great lengths to}} train the dog, and he now occasionally accompanies the Man of Steel on missions. Batman never misses an opportunity to poke fun at Krypto when Batman and Superman don't see eye-to-eye.|$|E

2500|$|Imagine {{that during}} the winter couples do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> but <b>want</b> <b>to</b> acquire more scrip for the summer. To compensate, the {{administration}} can lower the amount of extra scrip returned when parents <b>want</b> <b>to</b> borrow in the winter, and increase rates in the summer. [...] Depending upon {{the strength of the}} seasonality of babysitting, this might work. [...] But suppose the seasonality is so strong that no one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in the winter even when the administration sets its interest rates to zero. That is, suppose no parents <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> even when they can borrow money for free. In this hypothetical situation, the co-op has fallen into a liquidity trap.|$|R

"When I {{was writing}} it, I {{was sitting in}} a fourth-floor walk-up on Avenue-B, and there was this {{gorgeous}} Puerto Rican boy sitting across me that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on a date with, and I just wanted to get the song over with. I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that {{had a lot to do}} with the song. The freedom that I always feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen praised {{recording}} engineer Mark Rankin's contributions stating, [...] "I {{think it was}} pretty key to have Mark there. He went through the process with us, and now he's like a brother. He was completely an outsider to what we were doing, {{and that was the}} one thing that we consciously decided. For this record we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of our comfort zone, usually we’re around friends of ours. For this one, I think it was important to work with somebody who didn’t even know what some of our influences were.

2500|$|In November 2001, {{six months}} after the album's release, Skunkhour disbanded, {{frustrated}} by a lack of support from Universal, which was experiencing upheavals in Australia. Aya told Ritchie Yorke of The Sunday Mail that the difficulties with the label meant the band was unable to maximise its opportunities. He said: [...] "We decided that we'd rather move on now and look at some other possibilities while we're still drawing big crowds ... Unfortunately, the last album was only heard on Triple J and some community stations, so we didn't really reach the mainstream with it. This was despite our hopes that the album might have taken us to another level. It was given great reviews and we really thought the music got us back in touch with the fans. But overall, we just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on a high. We didn't want to overstay our welcome".|$|E

The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony [...] "had a very selective memory" [...] which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. [...] "That a mother would want to do something like that to her child just because she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and party," [...] he said. [...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E
