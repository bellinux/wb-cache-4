50|$|After John’s {{death in}} 1955, Marie decided to donate the {{property}} surrounding {{her home to}} the National Audubon Society after her death. The president of the Audubon Society at that time, John H. Baker, suggested that she go ahead and donate the property now {{so that she could}} see others enjoying the gift that she had given them. She agreed to do so and donated the land in 1956. Most of the property at that time was intensely used farmland and needed to be restored to its natural state. Natural areas had to be reestablished and nurtured. An existing barn was transformed into what is now the center and trails were built to provide access to the newly established habitats: stream, <b>woodland,</b> <b>meadow,</b> pond and marsh. Native wildflowers were taken from Marie’s garden and strewn along the small woods that were beginning to form. After only six months of work, the Aullwood Audubon Center was officially dedicated to the Dayton community on November 2, 1957.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAbstract: Ecological {{security}} {{is an important}} part of regional security and society stability, which is also becoming a hot issue at present. Based on landscape pattern index, constructed by fragmentation, isolation and dominance indexes, and soil erosion index, the ecological security characteristic in Yuan River watershed was analyzed using GIS and RS method. The landscape of Yuan River watershed were divided into six types, arable land, <b>woodland,</b> <b>meadow,</b> water, land for construction, and unused land. Results showed that land for construction, unused land and waters had higher integrated landscape pattern index that suggested the three had lower ecological security in pattern changes compared to the other three. However, the soil erosion levels of woodland, arable land and meadow were relatively higher which implied these three land types were liable to losing soil. The soil erosion index of the upper reaches of Yuan River was 5. 05 times more than that of the low reaches, while the integrated landscape pattern index had not considerable variation. Landscape ecological security index based pattern and soil erosion could more comprehensive reflect the real ecological security situation. Land for construction, unused land and water had higher ecological security index compared to the other three. We should pay attention to woodland and arable land in the large proportion of total area in local environmental protection in the future...|$|E
