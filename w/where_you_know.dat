500|$|The album spawned five singles. While Corgan {{considered}} issuing [...] "Jellybelly" [...] as the album's first single, he told Chart it {{was passed}} over in favor of [...] "Bullet with Butterfly Wings" [...] because [...] "'Bullet's one of those songs <b>where,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> it's easy to sing along to and [...] ya gotta sell them records." [...] "Bullet with Butterfly Wings" [...] was The Smashing Pumpkins' first single to reach the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 22. [...] "1979", the album's second single, charted at number 12, becoming the band's highest-charting American hit. The [...] "Zero" [...] single was released as an EP with six b-sides.

500|$|Music writers offered various {{interpretations of}} the video's style and concept. David Peisner of Spin wrote of the close-ups {{featured}} in the music video, [...] "As the camera sucks him in, it feels intimate and intrusive, revealing and voyeuristic". Music critic Jim Farber commented that D'Angelo's torso [...] "sways in grinding rhythm, tensing and releasing as his mouth curls in pleasure and his eyebrows narrow to measure an ecstatic contraction", while claiming that the video has [...] "nothing but close-ups of D'Angelo's buff body on the apparent receiving {{end of one of}} life's great payoffs". In his essay [...] "'Untitled': D'Angelo and the Visualization of the Black Male Body" [...] for his 1999 Wide Angle journal, journalist Keith M. Harris interprets the video to be a portrayal of D'Angelo's [...] "discursive play with masculinity and blackness". In his review of D'Angelo's Voodoo, Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters wrote of the video in contrast to most music videos in R and hip hop at the time, stating [...] "One could call the video for 'Untitled (How Does it Feel)' narcissistic, but in an era when most R videos are nothing but 'bling, bling' and booty, D'Angelo's bare naked torso was refreshing". On the video's camera range and angle, Stephen Hill, a senior vice president for BET, had stated [...] "It stopped just north of the line <b>where,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> we would have had issues". A 2008 press release for D'Angelo described the music video as [...] "featuring D'Angelo as a shirtless Adonis that catapulted him into the stratosphere and firmly cemented his place as the reigning King of Soul." ...|$|E

[...] He praised the detailed backstory, artwork, atmosphere and sound effects, but criticised the navigation and the graphics; [...] "It's old-school gaming at its worst in terms of the limitations of the technology.

2500|$|Originally {{expected}} for a March 2006 release, the album had two title changes and three unofficial releases until its official release the following year. Initially {{scheduled for a}} July 11, 2006 release, the album's original draft, entitled My Story, was eventually shelved {{in favor of a}} revamped version with a different vibe. Although manager Matthew Knowles initially insisted that the decision to push the release date from July 2006 was because more time would be needed to properly set up the project, Rowland later admitted that she had been unsatisfied with the album's direction, and thus, she asked to rework with a stable of new record producers on the project. Speaking of the delay and the original track listing, she told Billboard: [...] "it was basically a list of songs that I put together about the past three years of my life, with love and relationships", and added: [...] "And I remember listening to the record, and I was just like, 'I don't want this to be too deep to <b>where,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> [...] lose people.' And the record was too full of midtempos and ballads, so I wanted to bring it up a little bit." ...|$|E
2500|$|As scripted by writer Rockne S. O'Bannon, Alien Nation was {{originally}} called, Future Tense. The film {{took some of}} its concept from the TV series In the Heat of the Night, with science fiction elements integrated in the plot. During production, the film had a working title called, Outer Heat, which essentially was an amalgam of In the Heat of the Night and a 1960s science fiction TV series, The Outer Limits. Jack Collis emphasized that the film was not a [...] "space epic" [...] but more of an action film. He admitted, [...] "We did build a spaceship, but it's a simple thing that you see on a TV monitor describing the landing of the aliens several years ago, before they became assimilated into our society. It gives us a background {{but not a lot}} of detail, ..." [...] Collis noted that the film was even [...] "reminiscent of the work I did in Cocoon." [...] An earlier draft of the film was actually written by director James Cameron in 1987, but his name however, was not credited in the final cut of the film. One conceit of the script was that immigrations officials ran out of names for the 300,000 aliens, and began to name them after familiar appellations of the past. Actor Mandy Patinkin's original name for his character was set to be George Jetson. However, three days before the start of shooting, Hanna-Barbera wouldn't allow the name to be used. Expressing his disappointment, Patinkin said, [...] "I assumed that the name of the character I agreed to play was George Jetson. And I was pretty pissed off that there was a screw-up and that the name couldn't be used." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I thought it made a tremendous difference to the piece that the guy's name was George Jetson because it gave a cartoon feeling, an innocence that was important to the movie's whole idea. It's a great loss to the piece that we couldn't recover, a great misfortune that couldn't be solved. It would have helped a lot." [...] In reference to the cartoon character, the producers would leave in the name [...] "George" [...] as a substitute. Patinkin added, [...] "Everything in the script is Jetson, everything on the makeup is labeled Jetson, we always refer to him as Jetson. Not even George, but Jetson. So in our minds, he's George Jetson. So as far as I'm concerned, anybody who sees the movie, they're watching George Jetson no matter what the hell they call him." [...] To understand his role of being a police officer, Patinkin spent two weeks hanging out with the New York City Police Department. He took their training course, joined them on patrol, and spent time with them at the firing range. Commenting on the character development of Francisco, he said [...] "It's one of the better jobs that people from his race have acquired. He feels very {{proud of the fact that}} he's able to be a cop." [...] In 2013, when asked about his role in the film, Caan initially replied, [...] "Why would you bring up that?" [...] before stating, [...] "Yeah, well, I don’t know. I don’t have too many... I mean, I loved Mandy Patinkin. Mandy was a riot. But... I don’t know. It was a lot of silly stuff, creatively. And we had this English director who I wasn’t really that fond of. I mean, nice guy, but... it was just one of those things <b>where,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> you don’t quit, you get through it. It certainly wasn’t one of... I wouldn’t write it down as one of my favorite movies. But it was pretty popular." ...|$|E
