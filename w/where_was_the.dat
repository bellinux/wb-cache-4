While initially looking forward to Blunt's performance, he believed the [...] "black-belt minx" [...] actress was [...] "never really allowed to let rip. All that coiled feline sensuality stay coiled". He thought the queen's relationship with Prince Albert [...] "very, very unsexy", as their devotion [...] "makes for a boring film". Bradshaw did praise the power dynamics around Victoria, but concluded [...] "I spent an hour and three-quarters waiting for this film to start. <b>Where</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> tang and the zing and the oomph of Fellowes's cracking script for Robert Altman's Gosford Park?" ...|$|E
500|$|Poe's early detective fiction tales {{featuring}} C. Auguste Dupin {{laid the}} groundwork for future detectives in literature. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said, [...] "Each [...] is a root from which a whole literature has developed.... <b>Where</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?" [...] The Mystery Writers of America have named their awards for excellence in the genre the [...] "Edgars". Poe's work also influenced science fiction, notably Jules Verne, who wrote a sequel to Poe's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket called An Antarctic Mystery, also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields. Science fiction author H. G. Wells noted, [...] "Pym tells what a very intelligent mind could imagine about the south polar region a century ago." [...] In 2013, The Guardian cited The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket {{as one of the greatest}} novels ever written in the English language, and noted its influence on later authors such as Henry James, Arthur Conan Doyle, B. Traven, and David Morrell.|$|E

2500|$|C. Auguste Dupin is {{generally}} acknowledged {{as the first}} detective in fiction. The character served as the prototype for many that were created later, including Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle and Hercule Poirot by Agatha Christie.

2500|$|No <b>where</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{analysis}} {{of the difference in}} press fractions more astute than in the Champagne wine region where Dom Pérignon was recorded in 1718 by biographer Canon Godinot to have laid out these specifications for how the press fractions of juice destined to be Champagne should be handled. First the pressing were to happen quickly, as soon after harvest as possible to keep the juice at its freshest and to avoid any coloring from the red wine grapes of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. The [...] free run vin de goutte was considered too delicate and lacking on its own to make fine Champagne and it was sometimes discarded or used for other wines. The first and second pressings (called tailles or cut since the pomace cake was literally cut with ropes, chains or paddles to remove it between pressings) were the most ideal for sparkling wine production. The juice of the third pressing was considerable acceptable but the fourth pressing (called the vin de taille) was rarely used and all other pressings after that (the vins de pressoirs were considered too harsh and colored to be of any value in Champagne production.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "false-photograph" [...] task {{is another}} task {{that serves as}} a measure of theory of mind development. In this task, {{children}} must reason about what is represented in a photograph that differs from the current state of affairs. [...] Within the false-photograph task, either a location or identity change exists. In the location-change task, the examiner puts an object in one location (e.g., chocolate in an open green cupboard), whereupon the child takes a Polaroid photograph of the scene. [...] While the photograph is developing, the examiner moves the object to a different location (e.g., a blue cupboard), allowing the child to view the examiner's action. [...] The examiner asks the child two control questions: [...] "When we first took the picture, <b>where</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> object?" [...] and [...] "Where is the object now?". [...] The subject is also asked a [...] "false-photograph" [...] question: [...] "Where is the object in the picture?" [...] The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object {{at the time of the}} question. However, the last question might be misinterpreted as: [...] "Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?" [...] and therefore some examiners use an alternative phrasing.|$|E
