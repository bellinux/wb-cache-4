40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} effects {{of physical activity}} on plasma total- and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and derived variables in <b>Western</b> <b>Samoan</b> men who differ in rural/urban residence and occupation. Rural agriculturalists have significantly higher HDL cholesterol and HDL:total ratio than men employed in either physically active or physically sedentary occupations in an urban setting. Total cholesterol levels do not vary significantly, but when the differences in HDL cholesterol are accounted for, the means for agriculturalists and active workers are significantly lower than those for sedentary workers who do not play sports. These differences in HDL- and non-HDL-cholesterol levels are consistent with measures of physical activity among the groups. Variation in physical activity due to residence and occupation in <b>Western</b> <b>Samoan</b> men is related to lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but not to total cholesterol levels, and some effects may be secondary to differences in body composition.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} theme of {{continuity}} and change in <b>Western</b> <b>Samoan</b> education. It does so by looking at recent policy documents and at accounts {{of the history of}} education in Western Samoa written over more than a century. It compares the treatments of continuity and change in the policy documents and in the histories to show the extent to which both reflect a similar view of the place of continuity and change in <b>Western</b> <b>Samoan</b> culture and education. The study documents and analyses current education policies and strategies in Western Samoa through the two key documents which outline the broad policy directions for education and the strategies for achieving them, respectively, supplemented by Department of Education Annual Reports. It outlines the process of redeveloping policies from early to mid- 1990 s and the general character of the policies as a whole, and looks more closely at statements of the purposes of education, curriculum and pedagogy, and outcomes of the policies in terms of the distribution of educational provision and participation in education. Throughout, these policies are shown to reflect concern with both the maintenance of traditional Samoa culture – the fa’aSamoa – and the need to change to adapt to the demands of a modern global economy. It also examines a range of historical accounts of Western Samoa and, in particular, the history of education through four periods of development: traditional society, the missionary period, colonial rule, and early independent Western Samoa. It uses three types of account: accounts that are written in, or close to the periods to which they refer, such as missionary accounts of <b>Western</b> <b>Samoan</b> society and education in what is identified as the missionary period; late twentieth century histories of Western Samoa; and historical overviews used to frame late twentieth century official reports. The analysis of these accounts focuses on the purposes of education in different periods, curriculum and pedagogy, and the outcomes of education, again in terms of the distribution of educational provision and participation in education. It analyses these histories in terms of continuity and change, and argues that such histories suggest that <b>Western</b> <b>Samoan</b> history has always been characterised by a balance between continuity and change: the fa’aSamoa has adapted to changing circumstances in ways that have allowed it to maintain core values, but resisted changes that would threaten those core values. Finally, the thesis compares the understandings {{of the ways in which}} continuity and change have been balanced as suggested in the histories with those to be found in the policy documents. It argues that throughout its history, Western Samoa has maintained the strength of its indigenous tradition and cultural values. At the same time, since the arrival of the missionaries, it has selectively welcomed and adopted western practices and values, simultaneously adapting itself to them, and them to its own traditional practices and values. Current policies appear to continue this tradition of selective adaptation to change while continuing to maintain core values of the fa’aSamaoa. This suggests that the policies are well calculated both to hold the support of the <b>Western</b> <b>Samoan</b> people, and to enable Western Samoa to holds its place in the global community...|$|R
50|$|The German Empire governed the <b>western</b> <b>Samoan</b> islands from 1900 to 1914. “Over all, {{the period}} of German rule was the most progressive, economically, {{that the country has}} experienced.” Wilhelm Solf was {{appointed}} the colony’s first governor. His actions and conduct became “… paternal, fair and absolute.” In 1908, when the non-violent Mau a Pule resistance movement arose, Solf did not hesitate to banish the Mau leader Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe to Saipan in the German Northern Mariana Islands.|$|R
