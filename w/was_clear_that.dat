5|$|After {{a heated}} week of pre-fight confrontations, fans were expecting {{something}} special from Danny Garcia vs. Zab Judah. And the fighters delivered, though in an unanticipated fashion. From early on it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the bad blood would not adversely impact the fight, as both men fought strong technical fights.|$|E
5|$|After it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Austria-Hungary {{had lost}} World War I, the Austrian {{government}} {{decided to give}} Viribus Unitis, along {{with much of the}} Austro-Hungarian fleet, to Yugoslavia, the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. This move would have avoided handing the fleet to the Allies, since the new state had declared neutrality. Following the transfer, she was renamed Yugoslavia.|$|E

5|$|By 1924, {{there was}} {{distinct}} pressure on {{space in the}} halls of residence, and it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> more rooms were needed. The existing halls were full and so South Stoneham and South Hill were extended by covering their outbuildings.|$|E
5|$|By February 1326, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Isabella was {{involved}} in a relationship with the exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power. The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this had no effect.|$|E
5|$|By July 1918, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the German Spring Offensive on the Western Front, {{which had}} forced the {{postponement}} of offensive plans in Palestine, had failed, {{resulting in a}} return to trench warfare on the Western Front.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1850s it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> France {{was unable}} to match British {{building}} of steam warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required.

5|$|In the 1824 presidential election, Sharp alienated {{some of his}} {{constituency}} {{by supporting}} his former House colleague John C. Calhoun instead of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. When it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Calhoun's bid would fail, Sharp threw his support behind Andrew Jackson. He served as secretary of a meeting of Jackson supporters in Frankfort on October 2, 1824.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Edward now {{regarded}} the struggle {{not as a}} war between two nations, but as the suppression of a rebellion of disloyal subjects. This brutality, though, rather than helping to subdue the Scots, had the opposite effect, and rallied growing support for Bruce.|$|E

Seale writes that Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, when it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was interested only in saving himself.|$|E

5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} moved into dark skies, {{and although it}} faded as it receded from the Sun it remained {{one of the most}} prominent objects in the sky. On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E. Barnard, began to notice that the comet's nucleus was elongated and broken into two pronounced bright balls of light, and by 17 October it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> it had broken into at least five fragments. Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E

5|$|Arise is {{the fourth}} studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, {{released}} in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. Upon its release, the album received top reviews from heavy metal magazines such as Rock Hard, Kerrang! and Metal Forces. Arise is considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the music on Arise was mostly in the same death/thrash style as their previous album, Beneath the Remains, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Sepultura sound was acquiring an experimental edge.|$|E
5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the race was}} close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, {{an increasing number of}} immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse {{to be cut}} away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals {{in an effort to}} engage the beached French ship. For more than two hours Hotham's ship worked its way inshore until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E

5|$|By 1877 it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the {{situation}} had become impractical. After letters were published in The Field deriding the state of affairs {{it was decided to}} unite the kicking game under one set of laws. By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E
5|$|By 1939, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> war was looming, and {{the team}} began to turn their primary {{attention}} from ASV back to AI. A new set, built by combining the transmitter unit from the latest ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939.

Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany.|$|E
