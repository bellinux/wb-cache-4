5|$|Differences in {{wettability}} between surfaces {{that are}} similar in structure are {{due to differences in}} the packing of the atoms. For instance, if a surface has branched chains, it will have poorer packing than a surface <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> chains.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such as {{electric}} eels, {{can produce}} powerful electric currents, {{strong enough to}} stun prey. Other fish, such as knifefish, generate weak varying electric fields to detect their prey; they swim <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> backs to avoid distorting their electric fields. These currents are produced by modified muscle or nerve cells.|$|E
5|$|The He 111 design quickly {{ran through}} a series of minor design revisions. One of the more obvious changes started with the He 111F models, which moved from the {{elliptical}} wing to one <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> leading and trailing edges, which could be manufactured more efficiently. The dimensions of the new design had a wing span of 22.6m (74ft 1¾in) and an area of 87.60m² (942.90ft).|$|E

5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed {{to make it more}} difficult to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> lines.|$|E
5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E
5|$|Two-page book embeddings with a fixed {{partition}} of the edges into pages {{can be interpreted}} as a form of clustered planarity, in which the given graph must be drawn {{in such a way that}} parts of the graph (the two subsets of edges) are placed in the drawing in a way that reflects their clustering. Two-page book embedding has also been used to find simultaneous embeddings of graphs, in which two graphs are given on the same vertex set and one must find a placement for the vertices in which both graphs are drawn planarly <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> edges.|$|E

5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
5|$|After strong grass court {{seasons in}} 2012 and 2013, Murray was seeded third for the 2014 Wimbledon Championship, behind Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, who were seeded {{first and second}} respectively. He began his title defence <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> sets wins over David Goffin and Blaž Rola, {{defeating}} the latter {{for the loss of}} just two games. Murray continued his good form, defeating Roberto Bautista Agut and Kevin Anderson, the 27th and 20th seeds, again in straight sets to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon quarterfinal. Murray's defence then came to a halt as Grigor Dimitrov ended his 17 match winning-streak on the grass of Wimbledon (this includes the 2012 Olympics) with a straight sets win, meaning Murray failed to reach the semifinals {{for the first time since}} 2008. After his defeat at the Championships, Murray dropped to 10th in the world, his lowest ranking since 2008.|$|E
5|$|At the US Open, Robson {{returned}} after intensive rehab {{on her wrist}} injury and began her campaign against Spain's Lourdes Domínguez Lino, whom Robson had lost to twice previously. After winning a scrappy first set, Robson powered through the second at love. In the second round, Robson faced world No. 75 Caroline Garcia of France, and won in two tight sets. Robson then fell in straight sets in the next round to Li Na {{in the same place}} they had played last year, where Robson had won. The fifth seed Li powered 11 aces to beat her 12-year younger opponent, Robson in straight sets. After a break of around three weeks, Robson returned to action at the Guangzhou Open, a tournament in which she was a finalist the previous year. She started strongly, <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> sets wins over qualifier Jovana Jakšić in the first round, and Zheng Saisai of China in the second round. She subsequently lost to another Chinese player in Zheng Jie, despite taking the first set 6–1.|$|E

5|$|Selective {{breeding}} for desired traits {{was established}} as a scientific practice by Robert Bakewell during the British Agricultural Revolution in the 18th century. One of his most important breeding programs was with sheep. Using native stock, {{he was able to}} quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The Lincoln Longwool was improved by Bakewell and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was hornless and had a square, meaty body <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> top lines. These sheep were exported widely and have contributed to numerous modern breeds. Under his influence, English farmers began to breed cattle for use primarily as beef. Long-horned heifers were crossed with the Westmoreland bull to create the Dishley Longhorn.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the Test, the Australians moved onto their next match against Derbyshire, where Miller scored 57 and took 3/31 in the first innings but bowled only two overs as Australia won by an innings. In a rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, Miller took 2/41 in the hosts' first innings of 197 before {{compiling}} a hard-hitting 84. Coming in to join Hassett with the score at 2/67, he struck five sixes and seven fours. He hit one of the sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into the crowd. Miller also attacked the Glamorgan captain Wilf Wooller, hitting him over the sightscreen <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> drives from consecutive balls and lofting a third six over long off. He was finally dismissed while attempting another six; Australia's first innings was washed out at 3/215.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{began his}} 2013 season by {{retaining}} his Brisbane International title, defeating Grigor Dimitrov {{in the final}} in straight sets. Trying to win his second Major in a row, he began the 2013 Australian Open well with a straight sets victory over Dutchman Robin Haase. He followed this up <b>with</b> <b>straight</b> set victories over João Sousa, practice partner Ričardas Berankis and French No. 14 seed Gilles Simon. In the quarterfinals he cruised past Jérémy Chardy in straight sets {{to set up a}} semifinal clash with Roger Federer. After exchanging sets, Murray eventually prevailed in 5 sets, recording his first Grand Slam tournament triumph over Federer. With this victory, each member of the ATP's most dominant quartet of the previous four years (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray) had beaten the other three at the Majors. This victory set up Murray's third consecutive Major final appearance, and second in a row against Djokovic. After taking the first set in a tiebreak, Murray was eventually defeated in four sets. His defeat in this final meant that Murray became only the second man in the Open Era to achieve three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, the other being Stefan Edberg.|$|E
