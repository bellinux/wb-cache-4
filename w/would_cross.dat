5|$|Allen {{traveled}} {{along the}} southeastern {{banks of the}} Richelieu River, up to Sorel, where he crossed that river and continued up the southern shore of the St. Lawrence to Longueuil. According to Allen's account, he met Brown there, {{and the two of}} them then hatched a plan to attack Montreal. Brown <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the river with 200 men at La Prairie, upriver from Montreal, and Allen, with his Americans and 80 Canadians under the command of Loiseau and Duggan, two of Livingston's captains, <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the river at Longueuil, below the city, and the two forces would, after a prearranged signal, converge on the city itself.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} took place in 1811 to consider how the situation could be improved. Two engineers, Edward Martin and David Davies, proposed {{an extension of the}} canal {{to the top of the}} Gwendraeth valley, and another which <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> Pinged marsh and would terminate at Llanelli. This would pass through Pembrey, providing improved access to the harbour. The proposal was adopted, and an Act of Parliament passed on 20 June 1812 created The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company. The Act envisaged an upper terminus beyond Cwmmawr at Cwm y Glo, and a series of feeder canals or tramroads to connect to the pits and levels where extraction of coal was taking place. It listed a total of 13collieries which would be served in this way. Wharfs at the Llanelli terminus would be built next to the dock owned by the Carmarthenshire Railroad Company. Special provision, including the construction of a lock and weir, was made for the point where the new canal <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the existing Ashburnham Canal.|$|E

5|$|As {{the party}} recuperated, Shackleton {{realised}} that {{the boat was}} not capable of making a further voyage to reach the whaling stations, and that Vincent and McNish were unfit to travel further. He decided to move the boat to a safer location within King Haakon Bay, from which point he, Worsley and Crean <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the island on foot, aiming for the station at Stromness.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, plans arose {{to create a}} new highway link {{on the south side of}} Lake Simcoe to connect Highway400 and Highway12. The route for this {{extension}} was announced on June30, 1978. It was to follow 11th Line from Highway400 east to the Holland Marsh, where it <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> towards the northeast onto the alignment of Ravenshoe Road (York Road32). The extension would traverse the length of Ravenshoe Road to Lakeridge Road (Durham Road23), where it would zig-zag onto Concession Road7 to end immediately north of Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|From Jupiter's surface—or rather, {{from just}} above its cloudtops—Amalthea would appear very bright, shining with a {{magnitude}} of −4.7, {{similar to that}} of Venus from Earth. At only 8 arcminutes across, its disc would be barely discernible. Amalthea's orbital period is only slightly longer than its parent planet's day (about 20% in this case), which means it <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> Jupiter's sky very slowly. The time between moonrise and moonset would be over 29 hours.|$|E

5|$|Gum-digging was {{the major}} source of income for {{settlers}} in Northland, and farmers often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land. By the 1890s, 20,000 people were engaged in gum-digging, of which 7000 worked full-time. Gum-digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas; Auckland families <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the Waitematā Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management of the problem.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July, {{when the}} British judged the tide high {{enough for the}} French ships to cross the sandbar, d'Estaing sailed instead from his {{position}} outside New York harbour. He sailed south initially before turning northeast toward Newport. The British fleet in New York, eight ships of the line {{under the command of}} Lord Richard Howe, sailed out after him once they discovered his destination was Newport. D'Estaing arrived off Point Judith on 29 July, and immediately met with Major Generals Nathanael Greene and Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, to develop a plan of attack. Major General John Sullivan's proposal was that the Americans <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> over to Aquidneck Island's (Rhode Island) eastern shore from Tiverton, while French troops using Conanicut Island as a staging ground, <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> from the west, cutting off a detachment of British soldiers at Butts Hill on {{the northern part of the}} island. The next day, d'Estaing sent frigates into the Sakonnet River (the channel to the east of Aquidneck) and into the main channel leading to Newport.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of air}} {{transport}} meant that the division's two available brigades had to be transported by sea. They <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the Mediterranean in four Royal Navy cruisers with their escorts. If the landing was successful, the British 78th Infantry Division in Sicily and the 8th Indian Infantry Division in the Middle East, {{under the command of}} British V Corps, under Lieutenant General Charles Walter Allfrey, would be sent to reinforce the landings.|$|E

5|$|A new route was {{launched}} by Bømlo Mayor Malvin Meling, who proposed a pontoon bridge which <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> Stokksundet. He {{was inspired by}} the plans to build what would become the Nordhordland Bridge north of Bergen. In 1973, the municipal councils of Bømlo, Stord and Fitjar decided to launch a planning process, which concluded that a pontoon bridge between Sørstokken and Foldrøyholmen would be optimal. The report also considered bridges across the Fitjar Archipelago and a crossing via Spissøy and Føyno. There were protests from Wichmann Motorfabrikk who were concerned about their operations if the sound was closed for shipping traffic. Similar protests also came from the shipping industry, who wished to continue using Stokksundet; the protests were not remedied by the plans including a suspension bridge across Foldrøysundet. To illustrate their point, one shipowner let two of his ships cross in the middle of Foldrøysundet. The shipping industry received support from Norwegian Coastal Administration and the plans were abandoned in 1974.|$|E
5|$|After Cold Harbor, Lee and the Confederate {{high command}} {{were unable to}} {{anticipate}} Grant's next move, but Beauregard's strategic sense allowed {{him to make a}} prophetic prediction: Grant <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the James River and attempt to seize Petersburg, which was lightly defended, but contained critical rail junctions supporting Richmond and Lee. Despite persistent pleas to reinforce this sector, Beauregard could not convince his colleagues of the danger. On June 15, his weak 5,400-man force—including boys, old men, and patients from military hospitals—resisted an assault by 16,000 Federals, known as the Second Battle of Petersburg. He gambled by withdrawing his Bermuda Hundred defenses to reinforce the city, assuming correctly that Butler would not capitalize on the opening. His gamble succeeded, and he held Petersburg long enough for Lee's army to arrive. It was arguably his finest combat performance of the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E

5|$|In May 2005, {{opposition}} MP Gurmant Grewal accused Dosanjh and the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Tim Murphy, {{of attempting}} to bribe him with an ambassadorship and a senate seat for his wife, Nina Grewal, if he <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the floor or abstain from a crucial upcoming vote. Grewal released tapes he secretly recorded of the conversation between Dosanjh, Grewal, and Murphy. Dosanjh claimed innocence and accused Grewal of altering the tapes to imply wrongdoing and the Prime Minister dismissed calls to remove Dosanjh from cabinet. Audio analysis concluded that the tapes were altered and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not pursue any criminal investigations. Nevertheless, fellow MP John Reynolds {{filed a complaint with}} the Law Society of British Columbia accusing Dosanjh of violating the Criminal Code and the society's Professional Conduct Handbook. The Law Society reviewed the affair and concluded that Grewal had attempted to elicit rewards for his compliance but cleared Dosanjh and Murphy of misconduct charges.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 renumbering, Route 8 was renumbered to Route 94, {{which was}} {{extended}} northeast past Newton along former Route 31 to the New York state line, matching NY 94 across the border. It was initially only marked south of Hamburg, as {{none of the}} route north of Hamburg was state-maintained. Originally, Route 94 began at the now razed Delaware Bridge, where US 46 <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> into Pennsylvania. Route 94 would wind right and north-east a few to Columbia, where it joined its current route. In December 1953, both the Portland–Columbia Toll Bridge and Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge opened. That year a section of Old Mine Road was rebuilt and aligned as a four lane freeway between Columbia and the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. Following this, US 46 was rerouted over the first several miles of Route 94 between the Delaware Bridge and Columbia, and Route 94 was cut back to Columbia, near the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. Here, US 46 would end and US 611, <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge from Pennsylvania and follow the freeway north to the Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge. The freeway portion that US 611 followed {{became a part of}} I-80 in 1959. When US 611 was removed from New Jersey by 1969, Route 94 was extended to the state line on the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge. Also by this time, the unsigned portions of Route 94 north of Newton were signed. In 1973, this whole area was realigned into a complex interchange as the New Jersey portion of Interstate 80 was completed.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, other {{difficulties}} were surfacing. Sharon {{reported to}} Southern Command that {{one section of}} the roller bridge, being towed by Erez's brigade, had been damaged and that the engineers needed a few hours to repair it. He also requested additional forces to help secure the corridor, noting the stiff resistance facing Reshef's brigade. Sharon's report prompted Bar-Lev to alert Adan to prepare to open the corridor with his division. Sharon argued for Adan's division to cross the canal on rafts and to proceed with Operation Abiray-Lev without waiting for the bridges. Both Gonen and Bar-Lev rejected Sharon's suggestion since, without a secure corridor to the canal, Israeli forces on the west bank would be threatened with encirclement. Subsequently, Bar-Lev ordered that no more Israeli forces or equipment <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> to the west bank until the bridges had been laid.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} phase, Impetigo, the 43rd Division would move forward to relieve all Scottish {{infantry}} {{north of the}} Odon. The 15th Division would then assemble across the river and expand the bridgehead by capturing several important villages. In the final phase, codenamed Goitre, elements of the 43rd Division <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> the river to hold the area taken, while the 15th Division would continue to expand their bridgehead. The 11th Armoured Division would attempt to force a crossing over the River Orne and advance on their final objective of Bretteville-sur-Laize. The 4th Armoured Brigade, although attached to the 11th Armoured Division, was restricted to operations between the Odon and Orne to protect the Corps flank and {{to be in a}} position to attack westwards or towards Caen, as necessary.|$|E
5|$|London Bridge was {{the only}} {{physical}} connection between the City and {{the south side of}} the river Thames and was itself covered with houses. It had been noted as a deathtrap in the fire of 1632 and, by dawn on Sunday, these houses were burning. Samuel Pepys observed the conflagration from the Tower of London and recorded great concern for friends living on the bridge. There were fears that the flames <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> London Bridge to threaten the borough of Southwark on the south bank, but this danger was averted by an open space between buildings on the bridge which acted as a firebreak.|$|E
5|$|On September 6, a non-tropical {{low over}} the {{northern}} Bahamas became more organized and formed into Tropical Depression Sixteen between Andros and Grand Bahama. Shortly after forming, the tropical depression moved over Grand Bahama and moved north parallel to the Florida coastline. The computer models initially predicted two distinct possibilities for the storm's future, with some models indicating the storm <b>would</b> <b>cross</b> over Florida and enter the Gulf of Mexico while others indicated that it would stay offshore {{and move to the}} northeast. The official forecast from the National Hurricane Center followed the first set of guidances, though with low confidence. The storm strengthened to become Tropical Storm Ophelia early on September 7 and became a hurricane briefly the next day.|$|E
