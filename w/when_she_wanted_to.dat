500|$|Although Monroe's typecast screen persona as a dim-witted but sexually {{attractive}} blonde was {{a carefully}} crafted act, audiences and film critics believed {{it to be}} her real personality {{and that she was}} not acting in her comedies. This became an obstacle in her later career, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> change her public image and pursue other kinds of roles, or to be respected as a businesswoman.

500|$|Although the British Regency {{lasted only}} from 1811 to 1820, Heyer's romances were set between 1752 and 1825. As noted by {{literary}} critic Kay Mussell, the books revolved around a [...] "structured social ritual — the marriage market {{represented by the}} London season" [...] where [...] "all {{are in danger of}} ostracism for inappropriate behavior". Her Regency romances were inspired by the writings of Jane Austen, whose novels were set in the same era. Austen's works, however, were contemporary novels, describing the times in which she lived. According to Pamela Regis in her work A Natural History of the Romance Novel, because Heyer's stories took place amidst events that had occurred over 100years earlier, she had to include more detail on the period in order for her readers to understand it. While Austen could ignore the [...] "minutiae of dress and decor", Heyer included those details [...] "to invest the novels... with 'the tone of the time'". Later reviewers, such as Lillian Robinson, criticized Heyer's [...] "passion for the specific fact without concern for its significance", and Marghanita Laski pointed out that [...] "these aspects on which Heyer is so dependent for her creation of atmosphere are just those which Jane Austen... referred to only <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show that a character was vulgar or ridiculous". Others, including A. S. Byatt, believe that Heyer's [...] "awareness of this atmosphere — both of the minute details of the social pursuits of her leisured classes and of the emotional structure behind the fiction it produced — is her greatest asset".|$|E

500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to.</b> Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E

[...] As they grew into adulthood, she arranged their marriages, bought houses for them, and even chose furniture for their houses. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see her married children, she summoned rather than invited them.

When he was 14 or 15, he secretly followed Deng Dang to the battles against the Shanyue tribes. Deng Dang was shocked to see his teenage brother-in-law in battle, so he scolded Lü Meng and warned him to stop. Lü Meng refused to listen so Deng Dang told Lü Meng's mother about this. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> punish him, Lü Meng said, [...] "It is difficult to survive in poverty.

2500|$|In {{everyday}} interactions Genie became steadily {{more willing}} and able to speak during her stay with the Riglers, often spontaneously contributing to an ongoing discussion and sometimes doing so even if the conversation did not initially involve her and was not specifically about her. She was generally more willing to start or enter conversations on topics which interested her, although she would sometimes attempt to join in a conversation on other matters. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> talk about a particular subject she would sometimes allow the topic to change, but often persisted by repeating herself even after someone made multiple efforts to discuss something else. Otherwise she normally went along with a topic somebody else raised, and when attempting to enter an ongoing conversation she would try to say something relevant. If she could not say something semantically related to a topic, she sometimes tried to join in using other means; Curtiss recalled one dinner conversation at the Riglers' home in 1972 in which several people used the word [...] "tenant", and in an effort to contribute Genie said the word [...] "ten" [...] and held up ten fingers.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was seen}} as a great natural talent with a fantastic mezzo-soprano, but she had an easygoing {{character}} which made her indolent and uninterested in developing herself. [...] As her natural ability made many things simple for her, she never bothered to read notes—instead, she asked someone from the orchestra to sing and play her the part, and after hearing it, regardless of what instrument was used, she was able to sing it without much effort. The quality of her performance was said to have been dependent upon whether she liked a part or not, and she was described as bad and screamy in parts she did not care for, mediocre in parts she was indifferent to, and fabulous in parts she liked. [...] "If she pleased to adjust herself to the situation - and she could, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> - then this voice was irresistibly enchanting, intoxicating. The poetry of voice was something no singer knew more than she". [...] She was called the [...] "Malibran of Sweden", as Orvar Odd wrote: [...] "A Malibran without learning but what voice, oh, thou nightingales!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In Season 2, Liz {{declared}} {{that she and}} Jack [...] "are friends", {{and seems to be}} welcome in Jack's office at any time. The two joke often about their various personal and work-related problems, and increasingly offer each other advice. Jack has even surpassed Pete as Liz's most trusted confidant. This relationship culminated when Jack, after being told he was to be the next Chairman of General Electric, named Liz as his Vice President and successor. In essence, Liz and Jack have developed into each other's best sounding boards. For example, when Liz believed herself to be pregnant, her first reaction was to go to Jack's office (then occupied by the daughter of G.E.'s CEO) and, when ultimately she was unable to speak with him face to face, she left multiple messages on his phone. When Jack heavily embarrassed himself at a business retreat, Liz took the attention away from him by doing improvisation, including holding open her blouse to reveal her white bra. Jack was clearly moved and appreciative of her actions. She has done similar things multiple times, sacrificing her dignity for Jack's overall public appearance, as evidenced when she kissed Jack's business rival Devon Banks on security camera footage so she could extort him. Jack responded to this by saying [...] "Well played". Another example is in the episode [...] "I Do Do", when she stalled for him in front of a church, expanding her small reading to involve a guitar song and random readings from the Bible. Liz has a pregnancy scare in [...] "Cooter", and leaves a series of messages on Jack's voicemail as she goes through a series of emotions. The pregnancy test {{turns out to be a}} false reading, and Jack flies from Washington, D.C to New York, showing up at her door to comfort her. When Liz struggled with intimacy issues, Jack talked her through them and helped her get to the root of the problem. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> give up on herself and break up with Carol Burnett, Jack didn't allow her to, telling her [...] "You deserve a guy like Carol and he deserves you because, I'll only say this once a decade: you're great".|$|E
