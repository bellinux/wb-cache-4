5|$|The {{clarinet}} is {{prominent in}} Bulgarian wedding music also; {{it is an}} offshoot of Roma/Romani traditional music. Ivo Papazov is a well-known clarinetist in this genre.

5|$|The inauguration {{ceremony}} {{was conducted by}} the civic authorities and by the surviving, and still powerful, Guild of StGeorge, and combined elements of a public festival and a religious carnival. Four whifflers (city officials carrying swords) marched ahead of the procession to clear a path. Behind the whifflers, the incoming and outgoing mayors rode side-by-side, preceded by trumpeters and standard-bearers carrying the banners of England and St George, and followed by the city's Sheriffs and Aldermen in ceremonial gowns of violet and red, respectively. The procession was flanked by the city's waits (musicians playing loud wind instruments, usually the shawm) (a mediaeval double reed <b>wind</b> <b>instrument</b> with conical wooden body), and accompanied by dick fools (clowns carrying wands and wearing red and yellow gowns adorned with bells and cats' tails) and a man costumed as a dragon.|$|E

5|$|The {{islands of}} Curaçao, Bonaire, Aruba, Sint Eustatius and Saint Martin share musical styles, {{as well as}} {{maintain}} their own sets of folk and popular dances, ranging from the impromptu Statian road block to calypso, zouk and soca. African, indigenous and European ancestry predominate, though more recent immigrants have brought musical styles from Lebanon, China and India. In popular music, the islands are known for the Combined Rhythm, like local favorites the Happy Peanuts and Expresando Rimto i Ambiente. Kaseko music from the mainland country Suriname is also popular. Traditional music of Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, however, is primarily African, characterized {{by the use of}} complex, highly developed polyrhythms, dance styles and drums like the tambú. Other African-derived instruments include metal percussion rods, agan, the rasp wiri, aerophones like the cachu trumpet, becu transverse double-reed <b>wind</b> <b>instrument,</b> and the bow benta.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{music is}} a {{significant}} aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the Great Highland Bagpipe, a <b>wind</b> <b>instrument</b> consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. Bagpipe bands, featuring bagpipes and various types of drums, and showcasing Scottish music styles while creating new ones, have spread throughout the world. The clàrsach (harp), fiddle and accordion are also traditional Scottish instruments, the latter two heavily featured in Scottish country dance bands. There are many successful Scottish bands and individual artists in varying styles including Annie Lennox, Amy Macdonald, Runrig, Boards of Canada, Cocteau Twins, Deacon Blue, Franz Ferdinand, Susan Boyle, Emeli Sandé, Texas, The View, The Fratellis, Twin Atlantic and Biffy Clyro. Other Scottish musicians include Shirley Manson, Paolo Nutini and Calvin Harris.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Weather Bureau {{office was}} moved to 2nd floor of the {{original}} Boise Air Terminal Building at Gowen Field on December 19, 1939. All operations at the U.S. Federal building and the old Boise Airport were transferred to the new office by February 20, 1940. In addition to the surface weather observations of temperature, precipitation and wind, Radiosonde observations which began September 1, 1939 at the downtown airport, were moved to a small building north of the Boise terminal building at Gowen Field in 1940. A new balloon inflation building was built east of the terminal in October 1954 with a dome on top to hold the signal receiving equipment. The building {{was moved to}} the NIFC campus in August 1969 where it is still being used today. The temperatures and precipitation were taken near the airport terminal building through 1969 though they were moved periodically to accommodate the growing airport. The <b>wind</b> <b>instrument</b> was moved several times through 1969 {{from the top of the}} United Hanger to the top of the terminal building to field northwest of the runway. The office remained on the 2nd floor of the terminal building until June 1969.|$|E

40|$|High {{intraoral}} pressure generated {{when playing}} some <b>wind</b> <b>instruments</b> {{has been linked}} to a variety of health issues. Prior research has focused on Western classical instruments, but no work has been published on ethnic <b>wind</b> <b>instruments.</b> This study measured intraoral pressure when playing six classes of ethnic <b>wind</b> <b>instruments</b> (N = 149) : Native American flutes (n = 71) and smaller samples of ethnic duct flutes, reed instruments, reedpipes, overtone whistles, and overtone flutes. Results are presented {{in the context of a}} survey of prior studies, providing a composite view of the intraoral pressure requirements of a broad range of <b>wind</b> <b>instruments.</b> Mean intraoral pressure was 8. 37 mBar across all ethnic <b>wind</b> <b>instruments</b> and 5. 21 +/- 2. 16 mBar for Native American flutes. The range of pressure in Native American flutes closely matches pressure reported in other studies for normal speech, and the maximum intraoral pressure, 20. 55 mBar, is below the highest subglottal pressure reported in other studies during singing. Results show that ethnic <b>wind</b> <b>instruments,</b> with the exception of ethnic reed instruments, have generally lower intraoral pressure requirements than Western classical <b>wind</b> <b>instruments.</b> This implies a lower risk of the health issues related to high intraoral pressure.

25|$|In the 1980s, the folgerphone was developed. It is a <b>wind</b> <b>{{instrument}}</b> (or aerophone), classifiable as a woodwind {{rather than}} brass instrument despite being made of metal, {{because it has}} a reed (cf. saxophone). It is made from an alto sax mouthpiece, with copper tubing and a coffee can. Although it uses sax parts, it is a cylindrical bore instrument, and thus part of the clarinet family.|$|E

25|$|The flute is {{a family}} of musical {{instruments}} in the woodwind group. Unlike woodwind instruments with reeds, a flute is an aerophone or reedless <b>wind</b> <b>instrument</b> that produces its sound from the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument classification of Hornbostel–Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown aerophones. A musician who plays the flute {{can be referred to}} as a flute player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist.|$|E
25|$|Instruments used in {{traditional}} Azeri music include the stringed instruments tar (skin faced lute), the kamancha (skin faced spike fiddle), the oud, originally barbat, and the saz (long necked lute); the double-reed <b>wind</b> <b>instrument</b> balaban, the frame drum ghaval, the cylindrical double faced drum naghara (davul), and the goshe nagara (naqareh) (pair of small kettle drums). Other instruments include the garmon (small accordion), tutek (whistle flute), daf (frame drum) and nagara (drum) (barrel drum).|$|E
25|$|The Q of a brass {{instrument}} or <b>wind</b> <b>instrument</b> {{needs to}} be high enough to pick one frequency out of the broader-spectrum buzzing of the lips or reed. A vuvuzela is made of flexible plastic, and therefore has a very low Q for a brass instrument, giving it a muddy, breathy tone. Instruments made of stiffer plastic, brass, or wood are higher-Q. An excessively high Q can {{make it harder to}} hit a note. Q in an instrument may vary across frequencies, but this may not be desirable.|$|E

During the first day of band camp (rookie camp), the prospective members are taught basic marching techniques used within the ISUCF'V'MB. The marching portion of the audition is an evaluation of these learned techniques. Twirler, flag, and drumline auditions are held at different times during the summer. Flag auditions take place in the spring, and the drumline auditions take place on the Saturday before the whole band reports to camp in August. Candidates for the twirler positions perform a routine of songs of performance caliber showcasing their skills in front of the director, followed by an interview.|$|E
