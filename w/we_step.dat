500|$|After {{the show}} ended, several media outlets {{reported}} that Madonna {{may have been}} drunk during the performance; however, Madonna blasted these reports, by responding: [...] "Thanks for supporting me. Too bad people don't know the art of acting and playing a character. I could never do any of my shows high or drunk. And yes underlying {{all of this is}} sexism and mysongony [...] which proves that not only do we not get equal pay but we are still treated like heretics if <b>we</b> <b>step</b> out of line and think outside the box! Sexism is alive and kicking but i am #livingforlove." ...|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where <b>we</b> <b>step</b> into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{was once}} {{described}} by Fortune magazine in 1993 as [...] "corporate America’s leading environmentalist." [...] Johnson {{was committed to}} environmental causes, stating, [...] "We must make sure that <b>we</b> <b>step</b> softly on the land... Once you destroy an old growth forest, or a special plant in the Amazon, or a reef around an atoll, it's gone forever." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "As I {{have said}} on {{numerous}} occasions, {{we are not}} going to stand for this in Birmingham. And if necessary we will fill the jail full and we don't care whose toes <b>we</b> <b>step</b> on. I am saying now to these meddlers from out of our city the best thing for them to do is stay out if they don't want to get slapped in jail. Our people of Birmingham are a peaceful people and we never have any trouble here unless some people come into our city looking for trouble. And I've never seen anyone yet look for trouble who wasn't able to find it".|$|E
2500|$|... "Long {{years ago}} we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when <b>we</b> <b>step</b> out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when {{the soul of a}} nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment we take the pledge of {{dedication}} to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1914 {{he volunteered}} for the Royal Bavarian Infantry Lifeguards Regiment and was given a commission. He served {{on the front lines}} for 46 months and fought in France, Serbia, Slovenia, Italy and Romania. He saw action at the Battle of Verdun, the Battle of Caporetto, the Battle of the Somme, and the Lys Offensive. By his own account he never fired a shot and was never wounded, [...] "though bullets went through my shirt and coat." [...] Dürckheim {{considered}} his war experience fundamental to his later enlightenment: [...] "I discovered...that it was in facing death that <b>we</b> <b>step</b> forward toward true life. That experience was later a part of my teaching: by accepting death, we discover and receive life which is beyond life and death." ...|$|E
60|$|The door of Briony Lodge was open, and {{an elderly}} woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> from the brougham.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>stepped</b> {{between the}} {{principal}} actors in this scene, which only {{the passion of}} Altascar made tragical, but Tryan, with a humility but ill concealing his triumph, interrupted,-- ...|$|R

2500|$|The American philosopher Eric Hoffer {{employed}} Montaigne both stylistically and in thought. In Hoffer's memoir, Truth Imagined, {{he said of}} Montaigne, [...] "He {{was writing}} about me. He knew my innermost thoughts." [...] The Welsh novelist John Cowper Powys expressed his admiration for Montaigne's philosophy in his books Suspended Judgements (1916) and The Pleasures of Literature (1938). Judith N. Shklar introduces her book Ordinary Vices (1984), [...] "It is only if <b>we</b> <b>step</b> outside the divinely ruled moral universe that we can really put our minds to the common ills we inflict upon one another each day. That is what Montaigne did {{and that is why}} he is the hero of this book. In spirit he is on every one of its pages..." ...|$|E
2500|$|I compare {{human life}} to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, {{the doors of the}} rest being as yet shut upon me—The first <b>we</b> <b>step</b> into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think—We remain there a long while, and {{notwithstanding}} the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of the thinking principle—within us—we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man—of convincing ones nerves that the World is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness, and oppression—whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd {{and at the same time}} on all sides of it many doors are set open—but all dark—all leading to dark passages—We see not the balance of good and evil. [...] We are in a Mist—We are now in that state—We feel the 'burden of the Mystery,' To this point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages. [...] Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them. [...] he is a Genius and superior to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them—Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton ...|$|E

60|$|Our {{boat was}} waiting for us at Kingston just below bridge, and to it we wended our way, and round it we stored our luggage, and into it <b>we</b> <b>stepped.</b>|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> out {{on to the}} lawn, one of the under-gardeners--a mere lad--passed us {{on his way to}} the house, with {{a letter}} in his hand. Miss Halcombe stopped him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was. <b>We</b> <b>stepped</b> {{behind the}} rocks {{to find out}} what sort of men you were. And I guess you are just our kind," [...] added Merwell, with a sickly grin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I dinna ken," [...] Tom answered; {{and added}} hopefully, [...] "if it's t'ither, we'll mayhappen find oot before <b>we</b> <b>step</b> over Ling Crag." ...|$|E
60|$|Here then, <b>we</b> <b>step</b> aside {{a moment}} from {{following}} {{the fortunes of}} Somerset, and proceed to relate the strange and romantic episode of THE BROWN BOX.|$|E
6000|$|... "Supposing <b>we</b> <b>step</b> {{in there}} for a few minutes, while you and Mr. Passmore meet Mr. Haskers," [...] he cried. [...] "We'll come out when you say so." ...|$|E
6000|$|When <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> {{from the}} train the {{stationmaster}} asked us if we were the three Miss Youngs. Alberta pleaded guilty, and he said, [...] "Well, here's a letter for you then." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{saying she}} swung the secret panel that {{separated}} {{us from the}} apartment in which I had found her, and <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> through once more into {{the presence of the}} other prisoners.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>stepped</b> down {{on to the}} platform. Louis, {{for some}} reason, seemed {{slightly}} nervous. He {{glanced up at the}} clock and watched the few late arrivals with an interest which was almost intense.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Vuyning, with a smile. [...] "But, suppose <b>we</b> <b>step</b> {{aside to}} a quieter place. There is a divan--a café over here that will do. Schrumm {{will give us}} a private corner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Belding, I {{certainly}} {{would prefer a}} conference with you right now," [...] interposed the elder Chase, cutting short Belding's strange speech. [...] "There are other matters--important matters to discuss. They've got to be settled. May <b>we</b> <b>step</b> in, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is coming}} to sup, then," [...] said the doctor, staring in the {{direction}} indicated. [...] "What say you, Paul, suppose <b>we</b> <b>step</b> up?" [...] Just then a curtain near by lifted, and from a private building a few yards distant the queen entered, unattended.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> {{into the}} {{carriage}} {{one of the}} stable-lads held {{the door open for}} us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.|$|R
60|$|We went out, {{down the}} garden path. Lettie held her skirts {{carefully}} {{gathered from the}} ground. A nightingale began to sing in the twilight; <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> along in silence {{as far as the}} rhododendron bushes, now in rosy bud.|$|R
60|$|We {{left the}} city by a late {{afternoon}} train, and already twilight had ceased to linger. As <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> blindly into the early winter darkness {{at the end of}} our short journey, the voice of Sidney Sanderson sounded pleasant and assuring.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely some prodigious merry-making {{is going}} on," [...] exclaimed he [...] "I have laughed very little since I left home, sir, {{and should be}} sorry to lose an opportunity. Shall <b>we</b> <b>step</b> round the corner by that darkish house and take our share of the fun?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very good,' replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; 'but {{no doubt}} they will bring that about for {{themselves}} in the fulness of time, and if <b>we</b> <b>step</b> in to forestall them, {{it seems to me}} that we shall be performing a very Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to Oliver's, which is the same thing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{could not}} have chosen your time better, Madame Fontaine. My work is done for to-day." [...] She paused, and looked at Jack, ostentatiously busy with his keys. The wisest course would be to leave him in the window-seat, harmlessly employed. [...] "Shall <b>we</b> <b>step</b> into the dining-room?" [...] she suggested, leading the way out. [...] "Wait there, Jack, till I return; I may have another good mark to put in my pocket-book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the last}} year of this trade; they're getting {{machines}} to do away with us," [...] said the sweated one mournfully, as <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> over the woman with the breasts grossly naked and waded anew through the cheap young life.|$|R
60|$|The {{small change}} was made, <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> on board, and the ropes were cast off. Jones, Holmes, and I {{sat in the}} stern. There was one man at the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors forward.|$|R
60|$|The lift {{came to a}} {{standstill}} at the third floor and <b>we</b> <b>stepped</b> out on to the corridor. The Count's servant followed me to my room, deposited the box on {{a chair at the}} foot of the bed and wished me good-night.|$|R
