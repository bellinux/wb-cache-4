5|$|As 91 {{votes are}} needed to elect the Governor from the 180-member body and Democrats and Progressives held 112 seats, it was {{considered}} unlikely that Milne would win. Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line <b>with</b> <b>how</b> their individual districts voted. Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to the results in their district, the vote {{would result in a}} 90–90 tie. Milne disagreed with this calculation and claimed voting according to district outcome would result in his winning 93–87.|$|E

He was previously signed to Machinima prior to his partnership with Maker. PewDiePie expressed feeling neglected by the network, which operates as a rival to Maker.

5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned <b>with</b> <b>how</b> identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side <b>with,</b> <b>how</b> non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, when {{analysts were}} given {{a tour of the}} Enron Energy Services office, they were {{impressed}} <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the employees were working so vigorously. In reality, Skilling had moved other employees to the office from other departments (instructing them to pretend to work hard) to create the appearance that the division was larger than it was.

5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E

Pixar met with Disney, telling them that the film would have to be redone. Disney disagreed, and noted that Pixar did not have enough time to remake the film before its established release date. Pixar decided that they simply could not allow the film to be released in its existing state, and asked Lasseter to take over the production. Lasseter agreed, and recruited the first film's creative team to redevelop the story. To meet Disney's deadline, Pixar had to complete the entire film in nine months.|$|E
5|$|Metro {{planners}} {{designed the}} system with passenger safety and order maintenance as primary considerations. The open vaulted ceiling design of stations {{and the limited}} obstructions on platforms allow few opportunities to conceal criminal activity. Station platforms are built away from station walls to limit vandalism and provide for diffused lighting of the station from recessed lights. Metro's attempts to reduce crime, combined <b>with</b> <b>how</b> the station environments were designed with crime prevention in mind, has contributed to Metro being among the safest and cleanest subway systems in the United States. There are nearly 6,000 video surveillance cameras used across the system to enhance security.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth of}} commercialism in English {{football}} {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s {{paved the way for}} Arsenal and other prominent clubs to seek the possibility of setting up a new top-flight division. Unhappy <b>with</b> <b>how</b> income was distributed to the lower leagues and wanting to exploit television rights, Arsenal and 21 other First Division clubs handed a notice of resignation from the Football League by August 1991. The breakway division, entitled the Premier League, was administered by The Football Association and received financial backing from Sky Television. Arsenal finished 10th in the inaugural season; the club did well in other competitions, winning a unique FA and League Cup double. They were victorious in the 1994 Cup Winners' Cup Final, and came close to defending the trophy in 1995, before losing to Real Zaragoza.|$|E

5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>how</b> much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows.

The pneuma first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg. The pneuma then makes the other organs develop.|$|E
