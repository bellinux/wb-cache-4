5|$|I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{trying to}} make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA residually finite (profinite) group G <b>is</b> <b>just</b> {{infinite}} {{if every}} non-trivial (closed) normal subgroup of G is of finite index. This paper considers {{the problem of}} determining which (closed) subgroups of finite index of a <b>just</b> infinite group <b>are</b> themselves <b>just</b> infinite. If G <b>is</b> <b>just</b> infinite and not virtually abelian, we show that G <b>is</b> hereditarily <b>just</b> infinite {{if and only if}} all maximal (closed) subgroups of finite index <b>are</b> <b>just</b> infinite. This result will be used to show that a finitely generated pro-p group G <b>is</b> <b>just</b> infinite if and only if G has no non-trivial finite normal subgroups and Φ(G) has a just infinite open subgroup...|$|R
