40|$|This paper uses a {{data set}} of daily sales {{at a single}} {{gasoline}} station over a seven year period to determine if consumers respond to relative price changes among the three <b>grades</b> of <b>gasoline.</b> Based on the reasoning of Alchian and Allen (1964) and Barzel (1976), market shares of higher quality gasoline should increase {{at the expense of}} regular <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> when overall gasoline prices increase. The empirical results do not conform to this expectation. We find instead that the consumers in this sample responded to higher gasoline prices by switching to mid <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> from premium <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> leaving the market share of regular gasoline unchanged.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{optical and}} thermal {{properties}} of normal <b>grade</b> and <b>winter</b> <b>grade</b> {{palm oil biodiesel}} were investigated. Surface Plasmon Resonance and Photopyroelectric technique were {{used to evaluate the}} samples. The dispersion curve and thermal diffusivity were obtained. Consequently, the variation of refractive index, as a function of wavelength in normal grade biodiesel is faster than <b>winter</b> <b>grade</b> palm oil biodiesel, and the thermal diffusivity of <b>winter</b> <b>grade</b> biodiesel is higher than the thermal diffusivity of normal grade biodiesel. This is attributed to the higher palmitic acid C 16 : 0 content in normal <b>grade</b> than in <b>winter</b> <b>grade</b> palm oil biodiesel...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} be {{certified}} as Top Tier, a gasoline must pass a series of performance tests that demonstrate specified levels of: 1) deposit control on intake valves; 2) deposit control on fuel injectors; 3) deposit control on combustion chambers; 4) prevention of intake-valve sticking. Gasoline marketers agree when they sign on to Top Tier program that all their <b>grades</b> of <b>gasoline</b> meet these standards. However, premium <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> may have yet higher levels of detergent additives.Typically, Top Tier gasolines will contain {{two to three times}} the amount of detergent additives currently required by the EPA. The extra additives are estimated to cost less than a cent per gallon. In addition to the detergent additive requirement, Top Tier gasoline cannot contain metallic additives, because they can be harmful to a car's emissions-control systems.|$|R

5000|$|The {{production}} MKS {{rides on}} Ford's D3 platform. The MKS features an independent suspension with MacPherson struts and rearward-facing lower L-arms with a 26 mm stabilizer {{bar in the}} front and a multilink coil over shock setup with stamped steel lower control arms and cast upper control arms in the rear; [...] "Lincoln Drive Control" [...] with continuously controlled damping (CCD) available as optional feature. The car features four-wheel antilock disc brakes (12.25 in rotors {{in the front and}} 12.75 in rotors in the rear) with standard AdvanceTrac traction control and Roll Stability Control (RSC). Front-wheel drive (FWD) is standard while all-wheel drive (AWD) is optional. In a significant departure from the MKS Concept and past Lincoln flagship sedans, the production MKS does not offer a V8 engine. In the place of the 4.4 L Ford/Yamaha V8 found in the MKS Concept, the production MKS is powered by an all-aluminum 3.7 L Duratec DOHC V6, a larger bore derivative of the Duratec 35 and a member of Ford's Cyclone engine family. The engine was designed to accept either regular <b>grade,</b> 87 octane <b>gasoline</b> or premium <b>grade,</b> 91 octane <b>gasoline.</b> Using regular <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline,</b> the 3.7 L V6 produces 273 hp (204 kW) at 6250 rpm and 270 lb·ft (366 N·m) of torque at 4250 rpm. Using premium <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> results in a small boost in output to 275 hp (205 kW) at 6250 rpm and 276 lb·ft (374 N·m) of torque at 4250 rpm. Power from the MKS' V6 is transmitted to the wheels via Ford's 6F50 6-speed automatic transmission. The transmission is equipped with SelectShift which simulates the operation of a manual transmission. A road test by Car and Driver magazine of an AWD-equipped MKS recorded acceleration from zero to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds and a quarter-mile in 15.7 seconds at 90 mi/h km/h. Testers noted the MKS' heavy weight of over 4300 lbs. Ford introduced its EcoBoost V6, an all-aluminum, twin-turbocharged, direct injection 3.5 L DOHC V6, in the 2010 MKS arriving in showrooms in the summer of 2009.|$|R

5000|$|In 1987, {{after all}} other Standard Oil {{descendants}} had minimized {{use of the}} name Standard, Standard of Ohio, proud to be the original corporate component of Standard oil, sought to corporately rebrand itself under the Standard name, while continuing to use the Sohio brand in Ohio. However, later that year BP bought the 45% of Sohio it did not already own and assumed control. Among the first changes was the rebranding of all Sohio and Boron stations to 'BP' in 1991.The Boron name was used outside of Ohio in neighboring states, like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia. Boron was also the branding of its premium <b>grade</b> <b>gasoline</b> along with its regular grade fuel [...] "Extron"(formerly [...] "Ex-tane" [...] later [...] "Octron") and its unleaded version [...] "Cetron" [...] introduced in 1970.|$|R
