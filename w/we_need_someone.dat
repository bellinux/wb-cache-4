500|$|At the 2014 San Diego Comic Con International, Marvel Comics {{announced}} an ongoing series titled S.H.I.E.L.D., {{to be set}} in the mainstream Marvel Universe and written by Mark Waid, beginning December 2014. Featuring art by a rotating group of artists including Carlos Pacheco, Alan Davis, and Chris Sprouse, the series is led by Agent Phil Coulson, and sees the canonical introduction of the characters Melinda May, Jemma Simmons, and Leo Fitz—who originated from the television series—to the Marvel comics universe, who Waid noted would be given [...] "the Marvel Universe spin." [...] Waid described the series as [...] "done-in-one. Coulson {{and his team have}} a mission, and if <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> for a mission, everyone in the Marvel Universe is available as a potential Agent." [...] Waid added that though the comic does not share events with the television series, it will maintain the characters' relationships and personalities. Marc Guggenheim relaunched the comic as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for Marvel Comics' All-New, All-Different Marvel line, and introduced the television series' character Grant Ward to the Marvel comic universe in May 2016.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} general acclaim from critics and fans, and in 2010 {{it became the}} most-viewed video in YouTube history, up to that point. Tim Stack from Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "amazing" [...] and added, [...] "I don't think Gaga has ever looked prettier than in the close-ups where she's more stripped down." [...] Jennifer Cady of E! was also impressed by the video and commented, [...] "This music video really makes us appreciate everything Gaga actually brings to pop music. She's exciting to watch, plain and simple. ... <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> like Gaga to really bring it. To put actual thought and care into her product so that it feels alive". Issie Lapowsky of New York Daily News thought Gaga laid the [...] "theatrics on thick" [...] in the video but complimented her for wearing minimal makeup, calling it [...] "refreshingly normal". Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times said that the video brought back his faith in performance art, and that [...] "Gaga brings enough [...] on her own, thank you very much." [...] He also thought the set for the video [...] "worthy of a feature-length film". Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone felt that the scenes from the music video were reminiscent {{of the work of}} Stanley Kubrick. He added that in [...] "Bad Romance" [...] Gaga portrays her craziest ideas yet.|$|E
500|$|By 2001, {{the project}} had become {{stranded}} in development hell. In a Q panel at Comic-Con 2007, Gaiman remarked, [...] "I'd rather see no Sandman movie made than a bad Sandman movie. But I {{feel like the}} time for a Sandman movie is coming soon. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> who has the same obsession with the source material as Peter Jackson had with Lord of the Rings or Sam Raimi had with Spider-Man." [...] That same year, he stated that he could imagine Terry Gilliam as a director for the adaptation: [...] "I would always give anything to Terry Gilliam, forever, so if Terry Gilliam ever wants to do Sandman then as far as I'm concerned Terry Gilliam should do Sandman." [...] In 2013, DC President Diane Nelson said that a Sandman film would be as rich as the Harry Potter universe. David S. Goyer announced in an interview in early December that he would be producing an adaptation of the graphic novel, alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Neil Gaiman. Jack Thorne was hired to write the script. On October 16, 2014, Gaiman clarified that while the film was not announced with the DC slate by Warner Bros., it would instead be distributed by Vertigo and announced with those slate of films. Goyer told Deadline.com in an interview that the studio was very happy with the film's script. According to Deadline.com, the film was to be distributed by New Line Cinema. In October 2015, Goyer revealed that a new screenwriter was being brought on board to revise the script by Jack Thorne and stated that he believed the film would go into production the following year. In March 2016, The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Eric Heisserer was hired to rewrite the film's script. The next day, Gordon-Levitt announced that he had dropped out due to disagreements with the studio over the creative direction of the film. On November 9, 2016, i09 reported that Heisserer had turned in his draft of the script but left the film, stating that the film should be an HBO series instead.|$|E
5000|$|We found Benedict Cumberbatch fairly early. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> a {{very good}} actor, someone {{young enough to be}} {{believable}} as an aristocratic, an almost slightly dislikeable character who is an adolescent in terms of his views of the world, his upbringing. But <b>we</b> also <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> who could hold the screen for four and half hours, in every scene. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> with experience who was not only {{a very good}} actor, but also with terrific comic timing. Benedict was the ideal answer to that.|$|R
5000|$|On {{choosing}} {{to work with}} King Creosote, Heath said: [...] "We came to Kenny because we felt {{he had a great}} storytelling ability in his lyrics. We knew that to get across some of the complexity of the sequences <b>we</b> wanted, <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> who could translate feelings and stories into song." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the absence}} of Hajra and Rahi I felt alone and under greater {{responsibility}} to survive with the future of school. In those difficult days sometimes I felt week enough and thought {{to shut down the}} school, stop my mission for a while specially when facing financial brake down and short of faculty. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> as brilliant as Rahi with same dedication along with young teachers.|$|R
2500|$|Dot Scott, {{president}} of the local branch of the NAACP, said she had heard from victims' relatives that the shooter spared one woman (Sanders' mother) so she could, according to him, tell other people what happened. He asked her, [...] "Did I shoot you?" [...] She replied, [...] "No." [...] Then, he said, [...] "Good, 'cause <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> to survive, because I'm gonna shoot myself, and you'll be the only survivor." [...] According to the son {{of one of the}} victims, who spoke to that survivor, the shooter allegedly turned the gun to his own head and pulled the trigger, but only then discovered he was out of ammunition. Before leaving the church, he reportedly [...] "uttered a racially inflammatory statement" [...] over the victims' bodies. The entire shooting lasted for approximately six minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Moore's form had dipped {{enough for}} Ramsey to {{choose not to}} select him for the return game at Wembley which England had to win to qualify. Any other result would send Poland through. Being {{replaced}} by Norman Hunter in defense and Peters as the skipper for that match, Moore is understood to have asked Ramsey if this meant {{he was no longer}} required, to which Ramsey replied: [...] "Of course not. I need you as my captain at the World Cup next year." [...] It never happened, as England could only draw 1–1. During the Wembley match, Hunter attempted to make a tackle but instead trod on the ball and lost it, a similar error to Moore's lost possession in Chorzów, which allowed Poland to quickly counterattack and score thanks to Shilton's mistake. Allan Clarke equalised with a penalty, but England could not score again as goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski blocked numerous English chances. Moore later told how he sat alongside Ramsey on the bench and kept urging him to make a substitution, but Ramsey was hesitant to do so. When Kevin Hector finally did come on for Martin Chivers after 85 minutes Moore could be seen on TV yanking down Hector's tracksuit bottoms while Ramsey sat immobile. Moore, later, said to David Miller [...] "you could 'feel' the minutes escaping. I said to Alf, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> to go through the middle. He just nodded. We couldn't get Kevin out there quick enough. We almost threw him onto the pitch." [...] Hunter was in an inconsolable state as he was led off the pitch by Harold Shepherdson, and by Moore, whose place in the side he had taken. [...] England's failure to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup signalled the end of Ramsey's reign as national team manager as he was sacked six months later.|$|E
60|$|VARINKA. Heaven is my witness, Little English Father, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> who is {{not afraid}} of him. He is so strong! I hope you will throw {{him down on the}} floor many, many, many times.|$|E
5000|$|Both Kaushik and Negi did {{influence}} {{the development of}} the film after being approached by Sahini. Sahini first met with Kaushik and later recalled that, [...] "M K Kaushik and his girls taught us all we knew about hockey. Then he recommended Negi to us, because when we finished writing and finished casting, <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> to train the girls. Negi assembled a team of hockey players to train the girls." ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{signed to}} Simon back in 1998 {{and he was}} brilliant, but then came the {{development}} of The X Factor and American Idol. Simon became famous himself and his interests went that way rather than on Westlife. We almost felt a little bit unloved with Simon Cowell, if I was to be honest. We had it (full time support) with Simon but he got so busy and would {{do it at the}} very last minute and <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> who was on it all the time.|$|R
2500|$|During the 2008 Presidential election, Miller {{endorsed}} Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for president. At the Michigan Republican convention, she explained, [...] "When {{deciding what}} candidate I {{wanted to be}} our next President of the United States I knew <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> who would continue the fight against terrorism, who has proven leadership and who has the record and experience of managing government and improving the economy. Again and again {{on the most important}} issues facing America I came to the same conclusion, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the man <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to lead our nation." ...|$|R
50|$|One common {{situation}} in which adjectives appear postpositively in English is when they qualify compound indefinite pronouns: something, anyone, nobody, somewhere, etc. Examples: <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> strong; Going anywhere nice?; Nothing important happened.|$|E
5000|$|By 1910 she {{was married}} to John J. Gleason. Five years later, Wood {{explained}} that she enjoyed the acting life because it made marriage optional: [...] "With the ability to earn money and take care of ourselves, we don't have to stay tied to a husband we detest, just because <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> to support us." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{took over}} {{the helm of the}} Tourism Department from Joseph Ace Durano. Early speculations also pointed to showbiz talk host Boy Abunda as the new head of the Department of Tourism (DOT) but Abunda {{declined}} the post. In appointing Lim, Aquino said: Tourism is seen as one of the key venues for increasing jobs in the country. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> who has proven competence in this field".|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Rossellini was a {{recurring}} character {{on the television}} series Alias. In that same year, she also appeared in the Canadian film The Saddest Music in the World, directed by Guy Maddin. In 2004, she played the High Priestess Thar in the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Legend of Earthsea, and director Robert Lieberman stated that Rossellini [...] "brings a very big persona to the screen. She carries {{a great deal of}} beauty. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> who had a feeling of authority to be this kind of mother superior type {{and at the same time}} not be totally dour and unattractive." ...|$|R
500|$|Levine {{stated that}} [...] "looking for Jesse {{was a really}} tough hunt. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> who could go from an {{introverted}} boy in an isolated world to someone who completely taps into his imagination and becomes a confident, brave leader in Terabithia. That's {{a heck of a}} range for such a young actor." [...] Josh Hutcherson was not their first choice for the role of Jesse Aarons, but they settled with him because they [...] "felt the chemistry between AnnaSophia Robb and him". Hutcherson said that the project appealed to him because of [...] "the real life day-to-day drama as well as the arc of the character Jesse".|$|R
5000|$|People praised Samms as a {{successful}} replacement in 1985, but David Hofstede called her the [...] "Worst. Recast. Ever." [...] in 2004, blaming the producers rather than Samms. A 1985 article in The Hollywood Reporter criticized the recast, and {{a spokesman for the}} show told Redbook, [...] "People have gotten hung up on the fact that Emma doesn't look anything like Pamela Sue. But the creators said, 'Look, that's not what we wanted to do. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> who could capture the character.'" [...] Hofstede wrote that [...] "Samms never settled into the role, and could only make the best of a bad situation as her character was dropped into one ridiculous plotline after another." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I have {{considered}} running for state representative because it's {{the right thing}} to do. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> with a good education, a good personality, someone that comes from our area to represent the 89th District. When you set back and look at all the wonderful people we have that do not step up, and you think they should step up, you have to look in the mirror. So, I looked in the mirror." ...|$|E
50|$|When there's only done in {{the most}} extreme occasions-like if the umpire hasn't turned up at a footy match and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> to fill in. Bob might have some {{important}} fourteenth line of an equation to solve, some huge problem of Australia's defence, but I'll ring him and say 'We haven't got an umpire! and then he just drops everything. or if a first-year player has forgotten his jersey, that's a classic one. Then Bob will come and lend him the 130.|$|E
5000|$|In filing {{once again}} for Congress, Holloway said that he {{considers}} himself the only candidate who can defeat McAllister, whose reputation was damaged by a scandal {{earlier this year when}} a video was published showing the married congressman kissing a former female staffer and the wife of a friend of McAllister's. He said: [...] "I was disappointed in McAllister and still am. He had a golden opportunity and blew it. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> who can serve the district with integrity, and I believe I'm the best one for the job." ...|$|E
5000|$|Director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi wanted Bill Pullman for {{the lead}} {{character}} of Harry. [...] "When we started casting, I knew right away that Bill was our man to play Harry ... He's an absolute natural for the part—intelligent, wry, and charmingly good looking." [...] Producer Kerry Rock saw Bill in more practical terms: [...] "Bill was {{the cornerstone of the}} casting process. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> the right age, who was enough of a name, who could do the humor as well as being scary and believably violent at the tough spots of the story." [...] Co-star Bruno Kirby also found Bill to be the perfect match: [...] "The great thing about Bill is that he looks very straight, but if you look him in the eye, there's a real crazy sense of humor there." ...|$|R
2500|$|Regarding Johannes' contributions, Adkins stated: [...] "He's {{an amazing}} solo artist. We met {{him and he}} just had the best ideas. For {{what we wanted to}} do he felt like the right guy. We have a better idea of what we want now, so <b>we</b> didn't <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> that was heavy-handed. We wanted someone to be more like a partner, an ideas guy with fresh ears." ...|$|R
500|$|Also in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, {{alongside}} Mark Wahlberg in {{the action}} film Max Payne, based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role. Max Payne was relatively successful at the box office, grossing $85 million worldwide but was panned by critics, with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast. Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was [...] "horribly miscast {{as some sort of}} undersized, warble-voiced crime boss". Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, [...] "Mila just bowled us over..... She wasn't an obvious choice, but she just wears Mona so well. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> somebody who had to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park." [...] She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film.|$|R
5000|$|Producer Akshay Kumar {{announced}} {{the film in}} 2012. When the promos of the movie were released at first, people heard actor Salman Khan's voice and assumed that he was {{playing a role in}} the movie or maybe he was the narrator. Later, the director Umesh Shukla went on to clarify that Salman's voice was only being used in the promos of the movie. The director was quoted telling IANS, [...] "He (Salman) will not be narrating in the film. He has that voice. My film is a light-hearted comedy and <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> who can do justice to the visuals." ...|$|E

5000|$|It took a {{long time}} to cast the {{complete}} Tavernier family. Once EastEnders became a success, the producers had no difficulties in finding [...] "good actors" [...] who wanted to join the cast; however, what became hard was finding families—combinations of performers who [...] "look and sound as though they could be related." [...] According to producers Corinne Hollingworth and Pat Sandys, the Taveriner family were especially difficult as four generations of the family were being featured. Hollingworth has commented [...] "The most difficult job we've had was finding six black actors who fitted the bill for the Tavernier family. Here <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> two teenagers who looked around fifteen but were actually older, had left school and had mature attitudes to work. They had to love music, hanging around in tracksuits and most important, they had to look as if they could be twins. And for Clyde, <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> who looked as though he'd been a boxer but also seemed thoughtful." ...|$|R
500|$|A retired superhero who {{has since}} made his {{identity}} public. At first Snyder wanted Jude Law (a {{big fan of the}} character) for the part, but said that Goode was [...] "big and tall and lean," [...] which aided in bringing [...] "this beautiful ageless, German superman" [...] feel to the character. Goode interpreted Veidt's back-story to portray him with a German accent in private and an American one in public; Goode explained Veidt gave up his family's wealth and traveled the world, becoming a self-made man because he was ashamed of his parents' Nazi past, which in turn highlighted the themes of the American Dream and the character's duality.

5000|$|In the 1980 presidential election, Sinatra {{supported}} Ronald Reagan {{and donated}} $4 million to Reagan's campaign. He sponsored the initial fundraising {{campaign in the}} northeast, raising over $250,000 in Boston. Sinatra referred to Reagan as [...] "the proper man to be the President of the United States ... it's so screwed up now, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> to straighten it out." [...] Reagan's victory gave Sinatra his closest relationship with the White House since the early 1960s. Sinatra arranged Reagan's Presidential gala, {{as he had done}} for Kennedy 20 years previously. In 1984, Sinatra returned to his birthplace in Hoboken, bringing with him President Reagan, who {{was in the midst of}} campaigning for the 1984 presidential election.
