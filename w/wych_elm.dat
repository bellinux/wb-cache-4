5|$|The house, {{along with}} Dinefwr Castle, {{have since been}} {{restored}} by the National Trust and Cadw respectively. It is a three-storey castellated structure, built from grey stone, with four tall towers in each corner, with sloping slate roofs. The front features a grand central porch. Two rooms {{are open to the}} public, including a tearoom and exhibition in the basement and ground floor which contain numerous displays related to the history of the estate and occupants. The deer park which surrounds the property was landscaped by Capability Brown in 1775. The surrounding woodland consists mainly of oak and <b>wych</b> <b>elm.</b> Newton House is cited {{as one of the most}} haunted houses in Wales, noted in particular for its ghost of Walter the Butler, a former employee whose tobacco smoke purportedly wafts through the air.|$|E
5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and <b>wych</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the cultivar 'Daveyi' is a natural hybrid of <b>Wych</b> <b>elm</b> and Cornish elm; likewise 'Exoniensis'. The botanist F. J. Fontaine conjectured that the cultivar Ulmus 'Purpurea' is related to the Cornish Elm.|$|E
25|$|At {{the bottom}} of granite valleys and on the {{siliceous}} riverbanks, there are very typical formations of ash with Pyrenean oak, especially {{at the foot of}} thin interior mountain ranges. The sheltered gorges of the Serranía de Cuenca have mixed riparian forests of lime and hazel trees, with ashes, willows and <b>Wych</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus glabra).|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the areas}} where trees grow, there is a {{surprising}} diversity. There are at least 43 varieties and/or species of broadleaf trees on the island, and over a dozen types of conifer. Amongst the coniferous trees are silver and noble firs, juniper, European and Japanese larch, Sitka spruce, and Scots pine. The broadleafs include laburnum, <b>wych</b> <b>elm,</b> three types of oak, four kinds of cherry tree, alder, sycamore, sweet chestnut, walnut and various other fruit trees.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} of ornamental elms was the ball-headed graft narvan elm, Ulmus minor 'Umbraculifera', cultivated from time immemorial in Persia as a shade tree and widely planted in cities through much of south-west and central Asia. From the 18th century to the early 20th century, elms, whether species, hybrids or cultivars, {{were among the most}} widely planted ornamental trees in both Europe and North America. They were particularly popular as a street tree in avenue plantings in towns and cities, creating high-tunnelled effects. Their quick growth and variety of foliage and forms, their tolerance of air-pollution and the comparatively rapid decomposition of their leaf-litter in the fall were further advantages. In North America, the species most commonly planted was the American elm (Ulmus americana), which had unique properties that made it ideal for such use: rapid growth, adaptation to a broad range of climates and soils, strong wood, resistance to wind damage, and vase-like growth habit requiring minimal pruning. In Europe, the <b>wych</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus glabra) and the Field Elm (Ulmus minor) were the most widely planted in the countryside, the former in northern areas including Scandinavia and northern Britain, the latter further south. The hybrid between these two, Dutch elm (U. × hollandica), occurs naturally and was also commonly planted. In much of England, it was the English Elm which later came to dominate the horticultural landscape. Most commonly planted in hedgerows, it sometimes occurred in densities of over 1000 per square kilometre. In south-eastern Australia and New Zealand, large numbers of English and Dutch elms, as well as other species and cultivars, were planted as ornamentals following their introduction in the 19th century, while in northern Japan Japanese Elm (Ulmus davidiana var. japonica) was widely planted as a street tree. From about 1850 to 1920, the most prized small ornamental elm in parks and gardens was the Camperdown elm (Ulmus glabra 'Camperdownii'), a contorted weeping cultivar of the <b>Wych</b> <b>Elm</b> grafted on to a non-weeping elm trunk to give a wide, spreading and weeping fountain shape in large garden spaces.|$|E
25|$|The nearby meadows at Plaster's Green Meadows are {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because it is an}} area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral grassland community of a type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora. The site is characterised by the nationally rare Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and Crested Dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and dominant grasses include Sweet Vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus), while Quaking Grass (Briza media) and Yellow Oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) are also frequent. There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort (Serratuta tinctoria), Dyer’s Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), Common Knapweed, Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), Devil’s-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), Betony (Stachys officinalis) and Spiny Restharrow (Ononis spinosa). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of Cowslip (Primula veris), Fairy Flax (Linum catharticum), Glaucous Sedge (Carex flacca), Lady’s Bedstraw (Galium verum) and occasional Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor). The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), <b>Wych</b> <b>Elm</b> (Ulmus glabra), English Elm (Ulmus procera), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and Field Maple (Acer campestre). Hedgerow trees include Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa), Holly (Ilex aquifolium) and Oak (Quercus sp).|$|E
500|$|The {{forests are}} {{composed}} of diverse species of deciduous and coniferous trees and {{a great variety of}} wildflowers. An important element of the region's flora, apart from the rich variety of plant species, is the high degree of endemism in Balkan (23%) and Greek species (5.8%). Recent studies on the flora of the National Park counted 873 vascular plants, including more than 250 medicinal, aromatic, and poisonous taxa. The park's forests are abundant in species associated with the cool local climate, such as <b>Wych</b> <b>Elm,</b> Nettle-leaved Bellflower, Horse-chestnut and Large-leaved Linden. In the valley of the Vikos Gorge, Platanus orientalis form an azonal gallery forest {{along the banks of the}} Voidomatis. The woodland in the mountain area around the village of Papingo is characterized by the predominance of different juniper species, such as Juniperus communis, foetidissima, oxycedrus and excelsa. In the upper hills Juniperus foetidissima dominates, with exceptionally high (more than [...] ) trees. At higher altitudes, pure conifer forests of either pine or fir are found.|$|E
50|$|Hosts {{are known}} to include English elm (U. minor 'Atinia'), <b>wych</b> (Scots) <b>elm</b> (Ulmus glabra), American elm (Ulmus americana), Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila), Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia) as well as complex hybrids such as 'Homestead'.

5000|$|<b>Wych</b> <b>elms</b> fastigiate {{when young}} but {{broadening}} with age {{are not uncommon}} in the tree's native range, {{and some of these}} have been cultivated. A clone called U. glabra fastigiata was cultivated in Silesia by the Berndt Nursery, Zirlau, Schweidnitz, in the early 20th century. Specimens of a cultivar called U. montana fastigiata supplied by the Späth nursery to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1902 may survive in Edinburgh, as it was the practice of the Garden to distribute trees about the city (viz. the Wentworth Elm); the current list of Living Accessions held in the Garden per se does not list the plant. Catalogue evidence from the Späth nursery, however, suggests that the U. montana fastigiata supplied to RBGE may have been Exeter Elms.|$|R
50|$|In England the Conservation Foundation {{has begun}} propagating, distributing and {{planting}} clones of surviving indigenous elms, including field elms (but not the highly susceptible English elm), {{as part of}} a scheme to return elms to city and countryside. The Foundation is currently running two elm programmes: the 'Great British Elm Experiment' and 'Ulmus londinium', an elm programme for London - these use saplings cultivated through micropropagation from mature parent elms found growing in the British countryside: parent trees are monitored for disease, while saplings are offered free to schools and community groups, who are asked to monitor their trees' progress on the Foundation's online elm map; elms are available at a small price to others who do not qualify for a free tree; in London, places with 'elm' in their name are offered a sapling - in an attempt to find out why some elms have survived while others succumbed to Dutch elm disease. The spread of DED to Scotland has focused attention on a small number of <b>Wych</b> <b>elms</b> U. glabra surviving in areas of high infectivity, prompting the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh to begin a programme of cloning of the trees and inoculation of their saplings with the fungus, with a view to determining innate resistance (2010).|$|R
500|$|To {{the north}} of the river bank {{northwest}} of Langport are the Aller and Beer Woods and Aller Hill biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Aller and Beer Woods is a Somerset Wildlife Trust reserve. It consists of large blocks of semi-natural ancient woodland along the west-facing slope of Aller Hill, overlooking King's Sedgemoor. The reserve is about [...] and the underlying geology of most of it is Lias limestone. Prior to the 20thcentury it appears to have been managed for centuries as traditional coppice woodland, and it provides an outstanding example of ancient escarpment woodland. The woodland is a variant of the calcareous ash/wych elm stand-type, with pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) the dominant canopy trees throughout, and with scattered concentrations of <b>wych</b> <b>elm</b> (Ulmus glabra). Ancient woodland indicators include small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), and wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), both of which are locally common. Plants of particular interest include bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), greater butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and the very rare Red Data Book species purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum). Aller Hill contains three species of plant which are nationally rare and a further three which are of restricted distribution in Somerset. The central area contains a sward dominated by sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) in combination with yellow oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) and quaking-grass (Briza media). Salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor) forms a major component of the sward with the two nationally rare species rough marsh-mallow (Althaea hirsuta) and nit-grass (Gastridium ventricosum), also present.|$|E

2500|$|Elm {{propagation}} methods {{vary according}} to elm type and location, and the plantsman's needs. Native species may be propagated by seed. In their natural setting native species, such as <b>wych</b> <b>elm</b> and European White Elm in central and northern Europe and Field Elm in southern Europe, set viable seed in ‘favourable' seasons. Optimal conditions occur after a late warm spring. After pollination, seeds of spring-flowering elms ripen and fall {{at the start of}} summer (June); they remain viable for only a few days. They are planted in sandy potting-soil at a depth of one centimetre, and germinate in three weeks. Slow-germinating American Elm will remain dormant until the second season. Seeds from autumn-flowering elms ripen in the Fall and germinate in the spring. Since elms may hybridize within and between species, seed-propagation entails a hybridisation risk. In unfavourable seasons elm seeds are usually sterile. Elms outside their natural range, such as Ulmus procera in England, and elms unable to pollinate because pollen-sources are genetically identical, are sterile and are propagated by vegetative reproduction. Vegetative reproduction is also used to produce genetically identical elms (clones). Methods include the winter transplanting of root-suckers; taking hardwood cuttings from vigorous one-year-old shoots in late winter, taking root-cuttings in early spring; taking softwood cuttings in early summer; grafting; ground and air layering; and micropropagation. A bottom heat of 18 degrees and humid conditions are maintained for hard- and softwood cuttings. The transplanting of root-suckers remains the easiest and commonest propagation-method for European Field Elm and its hybrids. For 'specimen' urban elms, grafting to wych-elm root-stock may be used to eliminate suckering or to ensure stronger root-growth. The mutant-elm cultivars are usually grafted, the ‘weeping' elms 'Camperdown' and 'Horizontalis' at , the dwarf cultivars 'Nana' and 'Jacqueline Hillier' at ground level. Since the Siberian Elm is drought-tolerant, in dry countries new varieties of elm are often root-grafted on this species.|$|E
50|$|In {{form and}} foliage, {{the trees are}} broadly {{intermediate}} between the two species. F1 hybrids between <b>Wych</b> and field <b>elm</b> are fully fertile, but produce widely variant progeny. Many also inherit the suckering habit of their field elm parent. Both Richens and Rackham noted that examples in the East Anglian hybridization zone were sometimes pendulous in form.|$|R
50|$|In North America 'Major' {{is grown}} at several arboreta {{and along the}} streets of Portland, Oregon. The {{cultivar}} is also grown in parks and avenues in Australia, notably in Melbourne, and in New Zealand. The two earliest Avenues of Honour in Australia, at Eurack (begun in 1916) and Digby (begun 1917) were both planted with Dutch Elm. The celebrated Avenue of Honour at Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, planted in 1918, is mainly of Dutch Elm grafted on to <b>wych</b> or English <b>Elm.</b>|$|R
