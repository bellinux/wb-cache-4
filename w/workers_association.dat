5|$|A {{vote was}} held on 3 May 1965 in which the {{committee}} voted to strike against Coachella Valley grape growers. Although the strikers weren't able to negotiate {{a contract with the}} growers, they did succeed in winning higher wages. Following the success in Southern California, on 8 September 1965 the Agriculture Workers Organizing Committee voted to strike against grape growers in Delano, California, where the grape season starts in September. This strike became the first time Mexican workers, due to the decision of Cesar Chavez, did not break a strike of Filipinos; later, on 16 September 1965, Chavez's National Farm <b>Workers</b> <b>Association</b> joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on the picket lines. These strikes occurred around the same time when younger Filipino Americans began a period of political self-reflection and awakening.|$|E

The organizational structure hardly differed from that of the UON. The main ideological difference was the distance it maintained to the Portuguese Socialist Party. The CGT's daily newspaper was called A Batalha. In 1922 the union became officially recognized and joined the International <b>Workers</b> <b>Association</b> (IWA).|$|E

50|$|Union of Informal <b>Workers</b> <b>Associations</b> (UNIWA) is Ghana's first {{national}} trade union for {{workers in the}} informal economy.
