500|$|A {{significant}} {{element of}} delusion permeated his thinking: Bundy was always surprised when anyone noticed {{that one of}} his victims was missing, because he imagined America to be a place <b>where</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> invisible except to themselves.

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first episode, Wishology includes references from three recent films: The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. In Timmy's first trilogy wish, Timmy—under his alias Teo—is dressed as Neo from The Matrix, while his school teacher, Mr. Crocker, is dressed as Neo's antagonist, Agent Smith. Timmy dodges Mr. Crocker's lasers in a style similar to that seen in The Matrix. [...] After doing so, he jumps off a building and lands on, and crushes, a Volkswagen New Beetle. In his second trilogy wish, the group arrives at Middle-earth. Timmy is dressed as Frodo; Wanda and Poof are dressed as Hobbits; and Cosmo takes the appearance of Gollum. In the third, Harry Potter-themed trilogy wish, <b>where</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> in a Quidditch match, Timmy is dressed as the film's main character, Harry Potter, Vicky is dressed like Voldemort, and Poof {{takes the form of a}} quidditch snitch.|$|E

500|$|The first {{preliminary}} results were {{announced by the}} State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico at around 4:00. At around 6:25pm, Luis Fortuño's campaign director Angel Cintrón announced {{that there was a}} tendency against the amendments in the results so far. During a press conference, he said [...] "It's not what we expected, it's different to our projections, and we have to accept it." [...] However, he added that the results weren't definitive yet since there were still more than 50% of votes to count. Thomas Rivera Schatz, President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, also acknowledged the defeat saying that the amendments his party had proposed [...] "weren't accepted and that people don't want to amend the Constitution". He added that there could have been some misinformation in the process. [...] The results on the absolute bail bill means that [...] "Puerto Rico remains {{the only place in the}} Western Hemisphere <b>where</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> entitled to bail regardless of the alleged crime." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Getting Ready for Christmas Day" [...] {{was one of}} the album’s {{earliest}} completed songs, and {{it contains}} a sample from a 1941 sermon by the Reverend J.M. Gates. The sermon inspired the song’s creation, with a certain rhythmic tone to his oration that interested him. Simon heard the sermon on a box set titled Goodbye Babylon, which consists early 20th century Americana. It came together quicker than other songs, with Simon recording his guitar live. The track also references his nephew, who served multiple tours in the Iraq War. [...] "The Afterlife" [...] concerns a man dying and getting to heaven, where he waits in line to meet with God, <b>where</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> [...] "filling out forms and waiting in line to catch 'a glimpse of the divine.'" [...] While in line, he unsuccessfully hits on a woman. When he finally meets God, he is taken aback, and can only spout gibberish. The point of the song is that having questions for God would cease to be relevant if one were to confront God face-to-face due the enormity of such a theoretical situation.|$|E

500|$|A {{man named}} Roy McComb (Zak Orth) confesses to his priest {{that he sees}} visions of bad things, {{including}} a bus <b>where</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> going to die. Simultaneously with this scene, a man enters a bus, unleashes a canister emitting gaseous fumes, and steals a backpack before quickly getting off. The Fringe team arrives soon after, {{only to find the}} fumes have hardened into an amber-like substance, trapping and killing those inside. Walter (John Noble) studies the substance and concludes it started out as a gas and then solidified, suffocating the passengers. While looking at a victim's video footage, Olivia (Anna Torv) discovers a backpack is missing, and traces it back to one of the victims, a Federal employee with undercover connections to a drug cartel. They interview her [...] "handler", who comes to identify her body. The Fringe team finds out about Roy, and search through his apartment, believing he is behind the bus and other Pattern-related terror attacks. They soon realize all of his drawings are dated before the incidents took place, despite the fact that several of them were never made public. In an interrogation, Roy tells Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) he's been receiving his visions for nine months, roughly when they began seeing Pattern-related attacks.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the accusation, both Guillaume and Conrad are distraught, to the point of [...] The clever Liénor, however, her {{reputation}} slandered, unmasks the seneschal with a ruse. She has a belt and other gifts sent to the seneschal, supposedly from the Chatelaine of Dijon, whom he had courted, with promises that the Chatelaine is ready to grant him his wishes. The messenger convinces the seneschal to wear the belt under his clothes. Liénor then goes to Conrad's court, <b>where</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> struck by her beauty, and pretends to be a maiden who was raped by the seneschal and has thus acquired intimate knowledge of his body and his clothing; she reveals he has a belt under his clothes. The belt is discovered under his clothes and a trial by ordeal is proposed. The seneschal's innocence is proven in an ordeal by water: he has never had sex with the maiden. When Liénor reveals that she is in fact Guillaume's sister, the seneschal's earlier claim of having deflowered her is proven a lie. The seneschal is shackled and incarcerated, and the wedding is celebrated with great pomp. On the wedding night, Conrad's happiness is greater than that of Tristan or Lanval; the next morning, [...] "no one who asked [...] for a costly gift was refused." [...] As for the seneschal, Liénor implores Conrad to be merciful, and he is sent away as a Templar to join a crusade.|$|E
500|$|Likewise, {{in their}} article [...] "Wake up call from 'Stars on the Ground'" [...] for the Indian Journal of Psychiatry, T. S. Sathyanarayana Rao and V. S. T.

They also felt it blended [...] "modern professional knowledge" [...] with a [...] "humane approach" [...] in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the [...] "present age <b>where</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> in a restless hurry". The pair wrote, [...] "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. We seem to be heading {{to a state of}} mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" [...] The film depicts how [...] "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan [...] "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities". Overall, the pair found a [...] "naive oversimplification" [...] in the film. With India [...] "only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability", however, they [...] "easily [...] under artistic license".|$|E

Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show <b>where</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting {{that we were going to}} make it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E
500|$|The Demi-fiend goes {{in search}} for his friends and faces these groups. Both Chiaki and Isamu are distraught by the Vortex World and decide to move on their own {{rather than relying on}} their friend's power, while Takao realizes she is being used by Hikawa and decides to go on her own quest to create her desired world. To do this, she allies with Aradia, a former deity from the Shadow Vortex. After this point, all the {{supporting}} characters are seeking to ally with a powerful entity from the Shadow Vortex and create their own Reason, a powerful inner philosophy of life {{that can be used to}} mold the new world. To do this, a large quantity of an energy called Magatsuhi is needed, which each character begins hoarding. Hikawa's Shijima Reason wants a world of stillness and conformity in the service of a peaceful world; Chiaki's Yosuga Reason seeks a world where the strong rule supreme and destroy the weak; and Isamu's Musubi Reason wishes for a world <b>where</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>is</b> an individual who can live without reliance on others. Others also attempt to form a Reason, including Futomimi, who wishes to free the world's Manikins from their servitude, and Takao, who wants a world where people value life and have freedom. Both die before they can realize their wishes, and Takao gives the Demi-fiend an artifact that will enable him to remake the world. Hijiri, revealed to be a manikin doomed to reborn and suffer repeatedly for an unspecified [...] "sin" [...] against the Great Will, also attempts to gather enough Magatsuhi to remake the world, but is thwarted and sacrificed by Isamu to create his own Reason. Additionally, the Demi-fiend can fulfill a request from Lucifer to collect eight Candelabra from Fiends.|$|E
