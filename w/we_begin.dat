His loving parents were killed in a violent car crash; Oscar and Linda, devoted to each other, were sent to different foster homes; Oscar moved to Tokyo and earned money through drug dealing until he could afford to bring Linda to live with him; Oscar sleeps with his friend Victor's mother in return for extra money to help bring his sister over; Linda found work as a stripper for the nightclub owner Mario, to Oscar's distress; Oscar increased the scope of his dealing operations and started using potent psychedelics—in particular, DMT—more frequently; Alex discovered that Oscar slept with Victor's mother; and finally, we again see Oscar meet Victor at The Void to sell him drugs, only to be shot in the bathroom.|$|E

25|$|A more {{sophisticated}} method, described by Redelmeier, {{has been used}} by many authors as a way of not only counting polyominoes (without requiring that all polyominoes of order n be stored in order to enumerate those of order n+1), but also proving upper bounds on their number. The basic idea is that <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> with a single square, and from there, recursively add squares. Depending on the details, it may count each n-omino n times, once from starting from each of its n squares, or may be arranged to count each once only.|$|E
25|$|It {{is after}} this that <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to find Mary Hanford Ford {{herself as a}} member of clubs.

Circa 1882, Ford was visible entertaining visitors. Another early club Ford was involved in was the Social Science Club; she was visible working with it in 1884. Ford's daughter Lynette was born on 6 June 1883.|$|E

25|$|A very {{different}} kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{himself did}} not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give {{knowledge}} a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:Once <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to question {{whether there is a}} common faculty of taste (a sensus communis), we are easily led down the path to relativism. And this is what did happen after Kant - so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.|$|E
25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is {{a vision}} of the world within which we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E

500|$|Circa 1800 BC, the Norte Chico civilization {{began to}} decline, with more {{powerful}} centers appearing {{to the south}} and north along the coast, and to the east inside the belt of the Andes. Norte Chico's success at irrigation-based agriculture may have contributed to its being eclipsed. One researcher notes that [...] "when this civilization is in decline, <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> to find extensive canals farther north. People were moving to more fertile ground and taking their knowledge of irrigation with them." [...] It would be a thousand years before the rise of the next great Peruvian culture, the Chavín.|$|E
