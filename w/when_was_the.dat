In his first innings Richardson too failed to score a run <b>when</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> victim of a poor umpiring decision. He was given out leg before wicket off the bowling of off-spinner Shivlal Yadav though he had hit the ball. He was more successful in the second innings, making 26 before he was bowled, and the match ended in a draw.|$|E

David Bianculli of New York City's Daily News wrote, [...] "After watching Britney Spears' [...] special last week, Twain's act will {{seem like an}} exercise in restraint. It'll also seem like someone singing, rather than lip-syncing." [...] Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant gave Up! Close & Personal a negative review. He found himself straining to hear Alison Krauss and Union Station, and asked, [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last time you tuned in to a star's special to hear the background singers?" [...] Furthermore, {{he would have preferred}} the band to duet with Twain, rather perform backup for her. Catlin also criticized Twain's decision to model the show after Presley's 68 Comeback Special, believing she did so with far less efficiency. [...] "Not only is she not Elvis, she's not even Alison", he concluded. Allmusic rated Up! Close and Personal three out of five stars.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{this was}} {{addressed}} in {{an issue that}} bordered on breaking the fourth wall where Sister Shannon took her ward Jason to the Big Apple Con comics convention where he bought a copy of [...] "Battle Nun Areola".

Ultimately acknowledging that there were bigger problems to face and that she should not take such fantasy too seriously, she decided to let Jason keep his comic. She thought [...] "Why I've never even read the book..." [...] Indeed, despite such a strange portrayal of religion and Catholicism, the Church and its clergy are portrayed as a force for good and are shown in a positive heroic light, almost without exception. When Areala was accused of being a [...] "bad girl" [...] comic, Lyga countered that the second issue of his Areala series [...] "had not a single punch thrown. <b>When</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last time anyone saw a so-called 'bad girl' comic without a fight scene?"
