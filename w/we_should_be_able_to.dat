25|$|In {{order to}} get an {{estimate}} of the critical speed, we use the fact that the condition for which this kinematic solution is valid corresponds to the case where there is no net energy exchange with the surroundings, so by considering the kinetic and potential energy of the system, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> derive the critical speed.|$|E
25|$|More subtly, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} {{our next}} action {{based on the}} results of previous actions. To do this, Haskell has an operator >>= (pronounced bind) with type IO a → (a → IOnbsp&b) → IOnbsp&b. That is, the operand on the left is an I/O action that returns a value of type a; the operand on the right is a function that can pick an I/O action based on the value produced by the action on the left. The resulting combined action, when performed, performs the first action, then evaluates the function with the first action's return value, then performs the second action, and finally returns the second action's value.|$|E
25|$|The {{report on}} Duke Wiser, {{mentioned}} above, {{on the other}} hand confirms Hasels point of view: Duke von Wiser, who had been given administrative powers over the forestry department in Friedrichstal, {{had been a member of}} Hubertia since 1877. Krutina {{on the other hand}}, who originated the quoted report, was just as well a member of Hubertia. If one would assume that Kurtina sides with Wiser due to their connection within their common fraternity, then <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> deduct supportive words instead of criticism. What surprises though is that the report itself speaks in a critical, if not negative, tone where Krutina denies Wiser any passion for his work: He refers to him as a mediocre hunter, something that is unlikely to be said between friends portraying each other outside. If there would have been unfair connections between members of Hubertia, then Krutina's reporst would likely have resulted in a more positive view of Wiser and the situation.|$|E

500|$|The {{military}} {{ordered a}} flight test using liquid rather than solid fuel in early 1942. Upon the United States' {{entry into the}} Second World War in December 1941, the Group realized they could be drafted directly into military service if they failed to provide viable JATO technology for the military. Informed by their left-wing politics, aiding the war effort against Nazi Germany and the Axis powers was {{as much of a}} moral vocation to Parsons, Forman and Malina as it was a practical one. Parsons, Summerfield and the GALCIT workers focused on the task and found success with a combination of gasoline with red fuming nitric acid as its oxidizer; the latter, suggested by Parsons, was an effective substitute for liquid oxygen. The testing of this fuel resulted in another calamity, when the testing rocket motor exploded; the fire, containing iron shed fragments and shrapnel, inexplicably left the experimenters unscathed. Malina solved the problem by replacing the gasoline with aniline, resulting in a successful test launch of a JATO-equipped A-20A plane at the Muroc Auxiliary Air Field in the Mojave Desert. It provided five times more thrust [...] than GALCIT-27, and again reduced takeoff distance by 30%; Malina wrote to his parents that [...] "We now have something that really works and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help give the Fascists hell!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins {{describes}} {{an approach to}} life-extension that involves [...] "fooling genes" [...] into thinking the body is young. Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to Peter Medawar. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> prevent these genes from switching on, and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do so by [...] "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".|$|E

However, this approach is characterized by major theoretical and ethical limitations which make this procedure unfeasible.

2500|$|Further, this {{formulation}} {{does not}} treat {{the rate of}} profit as a price determined by supply and demand.

These refer to the basic profits that the owners of capital must receive {{in order to stay}} in business in their sector. Third, while neoclassical economics assumes that the [...] "normal" [...] rate of profit is determined by aggregate production (as discussed above), this formulation takes the rate of profit as exogenously given. That is because the whole neoclassical theory of profit-rate determination is being questioned: if we can go from the marginal product of capital to the profit rate, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> go from the profit rate to the marginal product.

By then, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> defeat the rebels easily. If we do nothing now and wait for reinforcements to arrive, by then it'll be much more difficult to separate the rebels into 'good' and 'bad' camps and turn those in the 'good' camp to our side.
