5|$|Paint-like gels (which are {{dispensed}} from {{pipes and}} can be transported through portals) impart certain properties to surfaces or objects coated with them. Players can use orange Propulsion Gel to cross surfaces more quickly, blue Repulsion Gel to bounce from a surface, and white Conversion Gel to allow surfaces to accept portals. Only one type of gel can be effective on a certain surface at a time only. Some surfaces, such as grilles, cannot be coated with a gel. Water can block or <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> gels, returning the surface or object to its normal state.|$|E
5|$|September 13–September 14, 1944– The 1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane {{parallels}} the coastline as a Category2 hurricane, {{with a minimum}} pressure of 965mbar occurring in Cape May. The hurricane causes severe flooding, a storm surge of up to 9.6feet (2.9m), and intense waves of up to 40feet (12m) in height. Along the entire coastline, strong winds gusting to 125mph (201km/h) destroys hundreds of homes and damages thousands, while the ferocious waves <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> fishing piers and boardwalks along the coastline. In all, the hurricane causes $25million (1944USD, $306million 2008USD) in damage and 9deaths in the state.|$|E

5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> or destroy cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E
5|$|Floods are {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E

5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or studded tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona I {{planted a}} pair of royal fig trees {{at the far end}} of the Bevato {{compound}} and stood between them when addressing the public. These were later complemented by additional fig trees planted all around the courtyard by Ranavalona II and jacarandas planted by the French during the colonial period. The figs that shade the esplanade are believed to be imbued with hasina enhanced by the bones and skulls of sacrificed zebu and special marking stones that pilgrims from across Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion and Comoros have come to place around them. Pilgrims gather in this courtyard to celebrate the Fandroana ceremony, during which time the sovereign historically engaged in a ritual bath to <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> the sins of the nation and restore order and harmony to society. Today, pilgrims celebrate by offering sacrifices or prayers to honor, appease or commune with their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E

5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding to the word of God and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can have the power to <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is a pledge to live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back the hypocrisy of legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E

25|$|Similar toilets were in use {{throughout}} the Roman Empire from the 1st through 5th centuries AD. A very well-preserved example are the latrines at Housesteads on Hadrian's Wall in Britain. Such toilets did not flush {{in the modern}} sense, but had a continuous stream of running water to <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> waste. With {{the fall of the}} Roman Empire, these toilet systems fell into disuse.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} fashion to streamworking, much use was made of water {{for the removal of}} the {{overburden}} and gangue. When digging large gullies the overburden, which consisted at least partly of decomposed granite ("growan"), was loosened with picks, and then water was used to <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> the unwanted material instead of manhandling it. Means of collecting, diverting and storing water were always associated with openworks. In some cases when only poor sources of water were available complex systems of reservoirs were built.|$|E
25|$|Pail closets, outhouses, and cesspits {{were used}} to collect human waste.

However, most cities {{did not have a}} functioning sewer system before the Industrial era, relying instead on nearby rivers or occasional rain showers to <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> the sewage from the streets. In some places, waste water simply ran down the streets, which had stepping stones to keep pedestrians out of the muck, and eventually drained as runoff into the local watershed.|$|E

25|$|By the 16th century, cesspits and cesspools were {{increasingly}} {{dug into the}} ground near houses in Europe {{as a means of}} collecting waste, as urban populations grew and street gutters became blocked with the larger volume of human waste. Rain was no longer sufficient to <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> waste from the gutters. A pipe connected the latrine to the cesspool, and sometimes a small amount of water washed waste through. Cesspools were cleaned out by tradesmen, who pumped out liquid waste, then shovelled out the solid waste and collected it during the night. This solid waste, euphemistically known as Nightsoil, was sold as fertilizer for agricultural production (similarly to the closing-the-loop approach of ecological sanitation).|$|E

25|$|In {{a gloomy}} bar, Raoul contemplates his {{relationship}} with Christine. He is joined by Meg, who tells him she swims each day to <b>wash</b> <b>away</b> the stress of working. She tells Raoul that he must leave with Christine and Gustave and {{runs out of the}} bar ("Why Does She Love Me?"). Raoul says he is not afraid of the Phantom. Suddenly, the Phantom reveals himself to Raoul and they make a bet that if Christine sings, the Phantom wins and if she doesn't, Raoul wins. If Raoul wins the bet, the Phantom will pay his debts and Raoul can leave with Christine and Gustave. However, if The Phantom wins, Christine and Gustave will remain in America with him and Raoul must return to Paris alone. The Phantom also leads Raoul to question Gustave's paternity ("Devil Take the Hindmost"). Fleck, Squelch and Gangle appear to advertise Christine's appearance at Phantasma ("Invitation to the Concert"). That night, Meg performs a strip-tease about her choice of swimming costumes ("Bathing Beauty"). She successfully impresses the audience, but Madame Giry reveals to Meg that the Phantom did not watch the performance, saying it was for nothing ("Mother, Did You Watch?").|$|E
