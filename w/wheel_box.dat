50|$|Southern Pacific Railroad's AC-12 {{class of}} cab forward steam {{locomotives}} {{was the last}} class of steam locomotives ordered by Southern Pacific. They were built by Baldwin Locomotive Works during World War II, with the first, number 4275, entering service on October 27, 1943, and the last, 4294, on March 19, 1944. The locomotives were effectively a conventional 2-8-8-4 locomotive running in reverse; the tender being coupled at the smokebox end of the locomotive. This {{was made possible by}} the use of oil-firing. The distinct features of these locomotives include: a streamlined front with white band, an air horn on the front, a streamlined pilot, a SP 12 <b>wheel</b> <b>box</b> tender, and air compressors mounted on the smokebox. Southern Pacific used these locomotives all over its system, but they were extremely famous for working on Donner Pass & Cascade Summit.|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} of the aeromechanical behavior of low-pressure blades {{represents one of}} the main challenges in the Steam Turbine Industry. The evaluation of forced response and damping is critical for the reliability of new designs and usually requires expensive validation campaigns such as <b>Wheel</b> <b>Box</b> Tests (WBT). A WBT consists of one or more blade rows assembled on a rotor and spun at the desired rotating speed in a vacuum cell, with synchronous excitation provided by various sources. The WBT provides accurate information about the blade modes frequency, the alternating response level, and allows the evaluation of the mechanical damping. Given the large effort in terms of costs and time associated to the experimental activity, the possibility to rely on the output of a numerical code either during the first steps of a new design or to investigate the effect of minor changes to a current design would be extremely beneficial to the development of future products. In order to compute the non-linear forced response of shrouded blades of steam turbines, custom numerical solvers must be developed, since commercial finite element (FE) solvers do not perform this kind of analysis in the frequency domain. In this paper, the forced response of a blade with shrouds of a low pressure steam turbine is computed and numerical results are compared with the experimental <b>Wheel</b> <b>Box</b> Tests performed at GE Oil & Gas. The calculations require a three-step procedure: in the first step, a non-linear static analysis is performed in ANSYS® in order to compute the actual contact area on the shroud surface and the distribution of static normal loads, then a reduced order model of the blade is generated in ANSYS® taking into account the stiffening effect on the blade of the pre-stress due to the centrifugal force, finally the reduced model is imported in a numerical code and the non-linear forced response of the blade is computed. The numerical code solves the balance equations of the system in the frequency domain, by means of the Harmonic Balance Method, imposing cyclic symmetry boundary conditions of the system. An interpolation procedure is implemented in order to manage the non-perfectly matching meshes of the shroud contact surfaces, while the tangential and normal contact stiffness is computed with a numerical model based on the contact mechanics principles. The numerical and the experimental results around some of the critical resonances of the system are compared in order to assess the reliability and accuracy of the numerical tool for its future implementation in the mechanical design practice of the blade...|$|E
40|$|TutorialLow Pressure stage design {{characteristics}} play a {{key role}} in steam turbine product line as they typically set limits to the maximum turbine flow and rotating speed and have a strong influence on the overall turbine efficiency. LP stages design presents a combination of structural and aerodynamics challenges that oblige the manufacturers to develop and test the design well in advance with respect to the turbine design schedule. For the same reason (development complexity) an LP stages design is usually scaled to cover a wide range of rotating speed and annulus area. The set of scaled LP stage is referred to as LP stage family. 10 years ago the author?s company has started the design of a new family of LP stages for power generation and mechanical drive application. The initial phase of the development has focused on the design, manufacturing and experimental validation (<b>wheel</b> <b>box</b> test and full scale turbine test) of the master size for the reaction product line. Then master size design has been scaled to generate a wide family of LP stages. In parallel to this activity the application of this LP stage family on the impulse product line has been carried out leading to a hybrid rotor design. Eventually the dynamic behavior of the scaled blades design has been experimentally validated employing a combination of strain gages and tip timing frequency test. This paper will present a comprehensive review of all the phases of development and the major experimental results on the master and on the scaled designs with the intent to share the key technical aspects involved in the development of this components...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} several results {{regarding the}} lateral and longitudinal control {{systems that have}} been applied for the automation of an articulated bus, using a rolling <b>wheeled</b> <b>box</b> system with special design that moves inside a guide rail. Nowadays, transport systems are achieving major advances by the incorporation of automation based technologies.

The automation of an articulated bus provides combined advantages of both conventional bus and train, because it can ascend slopes of 15 % and turn on curves of low radius. This transport modality is an interesting, low cost and friendly option. In this paper an experimental setup for the development of lateral and longitudinal control of the articulated bus is presented. Comprised by an experimental mobile platform (articulated bus) fully instrumented and a ground test area of asphalt roads inside CSIC installations, this experimental facility allows full testing of automatic driving systems...|$|R
