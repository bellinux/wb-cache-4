50|$|<b>Within</b> 36 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> a {{tropical}} cyclone's center, the pressure begins {{to fall and}} a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the cyclone's direction. <b>Within</b> 24 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as <b>the</b> bar <b>of</b> {{a tropical}} cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. <b>Within</b> 18 <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center's approach, squally weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. <b>Within</b> six <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center's arrival, rain becomes continuous. <b>Within</b> an <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the eye moves overhead. Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. By 36 hours after the center's passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.|$|R

His American co-driver, Sergio Cresto, also died when the Lancia plunged down a ravine and exploded. The fatal crash had no close {{witnesses}} and the only remains of the car were the blackened spaceframe, {{making it impossible to}} determine the cause of the crash. <b>Within</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash, Jean-Marie Balestre, then President of the FISA, had banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season, ending rallying's popular supercar era.|$|E
5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results, {{paramilitary}} groups had begun attacking people and setting fires around the capital Dili.

Islamic gangs attacked Dili's Catholic Diocese building, killing two dozen people; the next day, the headquarters of the ICRC was attacked and burned to the ground. Almost one hundred people were killed later in Suai, and reports of similar massacres poured in from around East Timor. The UN withdrew most of its personnel, but the Dili compound had been flooded with refugees.|$|E

Permission was eventually granted on 15 January, but the British considered this confrontation to be the cause of much subsequent ill will against the Western powers in Zanzibar.|$|E

5|$|Glenn Robinson III, son {{of former}} first overall NBA draft pick Glenn Robinson, {{verbally}} committed on September 14, 2010 as the first commitment in Michigan's class of 2012. On March 26, 2011, Michigan received its second verbal commitment {{of the class of}} 2012 from Canadian wing guard Nik Stauskas. On November 3, Mitch McGary, who was ranked as the number two prospect in the nation at the time, announced his verbal commitment to Michigan. <b>Within</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commitment, ESPN announced that Michigan ranked as the fifth best class in the nation. Each of the three signed a National Letter of Intent with the team on November 9. After several other schools announced their commitments, the signing of McGary moved Michigan from outside the top 25 at the end of October to the number 7 class in the nation by mid-November, according to ESPN. That November, McGary, Robinson and Stauskas ranked 3, 34, and 79, respectively, in the Rivals.com Class of 2012 Top 150.|$|E
5|$|Papa Stour's {{most recent}} {{shipwreck}} occurred on 9 December 1977 when the Aberdeen trawler Elinor Viking A278, skipper Alec Flett, foundered on the Ve Skerries. The Aith Lifeboat {{came to the}} scene {{but was unable to}} get near enough to rescue the crew because of the sea conditions. At the request of Alec Webster, Coastguard Station Officer, Lerwick, a volunteer crew in a British Airways Sikorsky S61N helicopter from Sumburgh Airport was scrambled. They managed to winch all the boat's crew to safety <b>within</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grounding, despite the storm force winds. The helicopter crew later received a number of awards for bravery. There was no loss of life, but this incident prompted the building of a lighthouse on the skerries in 1979, and may also have been the example required for the formation of the present Search and Rescue helicopter unit, based at Sumburgh Airport.|$|E
5|$|<b>Within</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first {{shots from}} the Royal Battery, the French {{defenses}} opposite fell silent, the only return fire coming from more distant flanking batteries. British fire intensified at noon when a battery of mortars opened a bombardment, and at 16:30 flags of truce were raised over the city's bastions. Clermont's offer requested a 24-hour ceasefire to negotiate terms, but Braithwaite allowed only until 08:00 the following morning, during which time the construction of British earthworks would continue. Clermont, isolated and unsupported, accepted the terms, and the following morning Braithwaite's army entered the city and took possession, although the French garrison had seized liquor supplies during the night and were too drunk to surrender formally.|$|E

5|$|In India, the Hindi {{version of}} Ra.One was {{released}} across more than 4,000 plus screens worldwide- 3,100 screens in 2,100 theatres, breaking {{the record for}} the widest Bollywood release previously held by Bodyguard (2011). The Tamil and Telugu versions were released on 275 prints and 125 prints respectively. A week before the release, multiplex owners throughout India decided to allot 95% of the total available screen space to the film. Overseas, Ra.One was released in 904 prints. This including 600 prints in Germany, 344 prints in the USA, 200–300 prints in South Korea, 202 prints in the UK, 79 prints in the Middle East, 75 prints in Russia, 51 prints in Australia, 49 prints in Canada and 25 prints in New Zealand and Taiwan. In early October 2011, a partnership deal was being finalised by the distributors to allow the film to be released in China across 1,000 prints. In addition, the film was released in Pakistan and non-traditional territories like Brazil, Spain, Italy, Greece and Hong Kong. The 3D version was released in 550 screens across the world. Ra.One was noted for the extensive use of digital prints, reportedly making up 50–60% of the total release; in India, the film was exhibited in over 1,300 digital theatres, breaking the record previously held by Bodyguard. The wide digital release was implemented to lower distribution costs, make the film accessible to a wider audience and reduce piracy. However, despite the measures taken, pirated versions of Ra.One were available on the Internet <b>within</b> <b>hours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film's release.|$|E
