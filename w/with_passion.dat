This metaphoric Radha (soul) finds new liberation in learning more about Krishna, bonding in devotion and <b>with</b> <b>passion.</b>|$|E

Younger critics who wrote columns in Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, and L'Oeuvre were more reserved, some of them even welcomed the Cubists with sympathy; in Paris-Journal, the free spirited poet André Salmon wrote an account of Room 41 that was full of intelligence and sympathy. The most important thing for Gleizes was that the younger generation of critics had been won over by Cubism.|$|E

The song was the last track {{to be added to}} the album as it was submitted late by songwriters Andrea LaRusso and Peggy Stanziale. Madonna pushed for the song's inclusion on Like a Virgin as she particularly liked its lyrics. Musically, the song is a drum beat driven dance track featuring instrumentation from guitars and vocals from a choir and a guitar solo played by Nile Rodgers, who also produced the song. The lyrics are an extended metaphor for fashion and sex, comparing dressing up <b>with</b> <b>passion.</b> A live performance from Madonna's first tour was used as the music video.|$|E

She did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was near-sighted and talked with a minor lisp during childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children's party, showing logical acumen at that early age. She was taught to cook and clean, as were most girls of the time, and she took piano lessons. She pursued none of these activities <b>with</b> <b>passion,</b> although she loved to dance.|$|E

[...] Oprah Winfrey called Ebert's death the [...] "end of an era", as did Steven Spielberg, who also said that Ebert's [...] "reviews went far deeper than simply thumbs up or thumbs down.

500|$|As a child, David Seidler {{developed}} a stammer, which he believes {{was caused by}} the emotional trauma of World War II and the murder of his grandparents during the Holocaust. King George VI's success in overcoming his stammer inspired the young Seidler, [...] "Here was a stutterer who was a king and had to give radio speeches where everyone was listening to every syllable he uttered, and yet did so <b>with</b> <b>passion</b> and intensity." [...] When Seidler became an adult, he resolved to write about King George VI. During the late 1970s and 1980s he voraciously researched the King, but found a dearth of information on Logue. Eventually Seidler contacted Valentine Logue, who agreed to discuss his father and make his notebooks available if the Queen Mother gave her permission. She asked him not to do so in her lifetime, and Seidler halted the project.|$|E

[...] Serrano commented on the presentation of Jimmy Wales during the film, [...] "In the end, I came out of the theater thinking of him as a three-dimensional figure, very much a man <b>with</b> <b>passion</b> but neither completely good or evil.
