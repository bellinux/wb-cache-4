"Although {{the right}} of silence, in {{contrast}} to the right to counsel, can be exercised passively (by not speaking), a suspect’s initial reticence does not inherently convey to a reasonable police officer that the suspect wishes to exercise a right to silence and terminate the interview.

Sanchez also commended the game's sound effects and music, stating that both aspects are [...] "dead on for a member of the Wipeout family". Bedigan enjoyed the soundtrack, saying that every song was [...] "addictive" [...] and [...] "suits the game's 'extreme' feel". Kauderer thought that the game had an exceptional soundtrack, stating that since the use of licensed music in Wipeout 2097, the franchise had [...] "changed the face of the industry forever", although he opined that Wipeout Fusion had lost [...] "that cool edge". Davis praised the [...] "hard hitting" [...] techno soundtrack; saying that it was a type of music [...] "you'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> even when you weren't playing the game".

[...] "Wipe Your Eyes" [...] starts with [...] "crooning by a chipmunk-like voice", and after that Levine professes [...] "I’m here to wipe your eyes" [...] to his broken-hearted romantic interest. Brittany Frederick of StarPulse criticized {{the opening of the}} song labeling it as [...] "jarring nonsensical sounds"; the sounds can also be heard in the background. However, according to her, [...] "they're minor issues with an album that is bound to get at least one song other than 'Payphone' stuck in your head." [...] Alt Rock Live's Keaton Fletcher in a review of Overexposed, wrote that the beginning of the song makes you ask yourself [...] "do you really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> this song?" [...] However, he concluded that after its first thirty seconds it sounds like typical Maroon 5 song on which you feel smooth sexuality.

Los Angeles Times music critic Enrique Lopetegui wrote that the album is [...] "basically {{a continuation of the}} singer's favorite turf - ... woman-melting ballads."

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Phantom Phorce was generally positive with Uncut {{stating that the}} album features an [...] "inspired overhaul" [...] of tracks from Phantom Power, the Western Mail describing the record as a [...] "mind-bending collection that radically re-works each track from the original record to create something entirely different, but equally appealing" [...] and musicOMH calling it [...] "an innovative and thoroughly enjoyable set of remixes". Some reviews {{pointed out that the}} album compares favourably with other remix albums with The Guardian calling Phantom Phorce [...] "stimulating and often rather beautiful, bucking the trend set by most other self-indulgent and pointless remix albums" [...] and the NME stating that [...] "hearing a rock band get the remix treatment is usually a mildly diverting experience rather than a life-changing one. So it's an extremely pleasant surprise to be faced with a whole album of the buggers ... and be thoroughly entertained." [...] Q stated that the commentary by 'Kurt Stern' {{was one of the best}} features of the album and The Times expressed surprise that these [...] "'amusing interludes' between tracks are actually funny", however Pitchfork Media found that 'Stern' [...] "gets in the way more than he helps" [...] and claimed that, by the time the listener had heard the full album he or she would [...] "likely consider redubbing it without [...] contributions". Reviewing Phantom Phorce for DiSCORDER magazine, Jordie Yow called it [...] "good, but not exceptional" [...] and claimed that the remixes simply made him <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the original versions of the tracks while website Angry Ape was scathing, calling the album a [...] "bland & uninspiring package to put you off remixes for life" [...] and suggested that it was merely a [...] "cash-in" [...] by the band.|$|E

2500|$|However, in {{his book}} In Search Of Africa, Manthia Diawara states that hip hop is really a voice {{of people who are}} marginalized in modern society.

[...] The problem may not be that female rappers {{do not have the same}} opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts; it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases. Industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men won’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> female rappers, so they are given fewer opportunities.|$|E

2500|$|Melody Maker ran {{a feature}} {{in which many}} pop musicians were asked whether they {{believed}} that the album was truly revolutionary or progressive. The author concluded that [...] "the record's impact on artists and the men behind the artists has been considerable."

I haven't spent much time listening to the Beach Boys before, but I'm a fan now and I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> this LP again and again." [...] Then a member of Cream, Eric Clapton, reported that everyone in his band loved the album.

2500|$|Reviews for City of Echoes {{were mixed}} but {{generally}} positive. Guitarist Laurent Schroeder-Lebec has {{described it as}} their [...] "pop album," [...] {{in reference to the}} fact that it classifies as their most accessible to a mainstream audience. As such, it can be differentiated from earlier material as it consists of [...] "shorter songs and expanded catchiness." [...] Tom Lynch of Newcity Chicago describes is as a [...] "colossal departure, a seemingly blatant shun of everything that came before. But not necessarily in a bad way". To that end, it has been praised as a rarity, as an instrumental album [...] "you actually <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> over and over again". A Spin review attributed this to a [...] "maturer" [...] approach, [...] "with the title track and the strongly melodic [...] "Bliss in Concrete" [...] achieving in five- or six-minute mini epics what used to take the band twice the time and effort." ...|$|E

Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Erika Ender showed their displeasure with the unauthorized use of the song for political purposes in Venezuela, criticizing Maduro's government and describing the use of the song as [...] "propaganda." [...] Fonsi said that he was never consulted or have he authorized the use of the song for political ends, [...] "less so {{in the context of the}} deplorable situation affecting a country that I love so much as Venezuela." [...] He also stated that his music is [...] "for all of those that <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it and enjoy it, not to use it as propaganda that tries to manipulate the will of the people that are crying out for their freedom and a better future." [...] Despite the criticism by the artists, President Maduro continued to use the remix promoting the election, using it during a cadena.

2500|$|Three downtempo ballads follow, called [...] "the kind {{of songs}} you wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> at all: the lyrics are boring {{at best and}} {{completely}} cliché at worst" [...] by one reviewer. The first, [...] "Don't Forsake Me" [...] is a torch song that was frequently compared to [...] "Too Hurt to Dance" [...] due to its lyrics about heartache. The song follows the retro sound Duffy had been previously known for and was called [...] "indebted to the pre-Beatles era". It was received negatively for [...] "paint {{too much of a}} resemblance" [...] to [...] "Warwick Avenue". The title song, which follows, is a love song that was again said to contain 1950s music references. The song features vinyl sounds and is sung to the accompaniment of an acoustic guitar. The final song in the trio of ballads is [...] "Breath Away", a 1960s-inspired ballad about love. Contactmusic.com [...] implied that the song is boring, saying that [...] " [...] hardly does anything to take our breath away", although it was said to [...] "showcase" [...] her vocal talents. Endlessly continues with two more up-tempo songs with a dance-orientated sound: [...] "Lovestruck" [...] and [...] "Girl", both called [...] "sassy" [...] and [...] "playful". The former is a disco song described as having [...] "the brashness of a Bond theme", with [...] "tragic undertones" [...] of a [...] "haunting creation". Lyrically, the song speaks of being so in love you are [...] "sleepless all night long", with the song opening [...] "It's a physical thing we got and I'm in paradise". The lyrical sentiment of [...] "My Boy" [...] is echoed in the latter, with the song being sung [...] "Girl, girl/Stay away, girl/Come back another day, girl/Better still don't come back ever stay away from here forever." [...] The album's final song, the string-led [...] "Hard for the Heart" [...] continues the soul pop sound of Rockferry and was described as a [...] "soulful pop confection" [...] by Uncut, whilst being labelled as the stand-out song on the album by many reviewers. The song's climax was compared to the song [...] "Hey Jude" [...] (1968) by The Beatles, whilst a reviewer for the BBC asserted that it [...] "unconsciously borrows from Coldplay's [...] "The Scientist"." [...] Entertainment Focus, on the other hand called it a [...] "lost Burt Bacharach classic", and Hammond's production skills were also praised on the song. It also received praise concerning Duffy's voice, something that was a feature of many critics' reviews, with Sputnik Music noting, [...] ""Hard for the Heart" [...] has the singer in an intensely emotional and surprisingly restrained moment. Her beautiful timbre finally gets to shine without choking out the sophisticated and apotheotic production, giving pulse and strength to a strikingly poetic composition." ...|$|E
