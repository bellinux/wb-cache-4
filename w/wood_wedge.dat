Introduction: The {{generator}} tested is in {{the power}} plant of the Manhattan Ice, Light and Power Company, Manhattan, Kansas. Its regular work is to carry the lighting load {{during the second half}} of the night. It is belt driven by a 14 ” x 21,” Erie City, simple, non-condensing engine of one hundred and fifty horse power capacity at ninety five pounds steam pressure. The engine’s normal speed is one hundred and seventy eight revolutions per minute. The power is transmitted by a pulley nine feet, three inches in diameter to a twenty one inch pulley on the generator shaft. The generator is manufactured by the General Electric Company, Schenectady, New York. It is the revolving field, stationary armature type and is self-excited from a direct current shunt generator carried on the same shaft. The armature windings of the alternator are of the distributed, “Barrel” type. The core is of cast steel punchings laid together with suitable ducts to insure good ventilation through all parts. The coils are from wound and are laid on the core and held in place by beach <b>wood</b> <b>wedges,</b> which are driven into slots over the coils. This allows the speedy removal of damaged coils. As the armature is stationary, the insulation can be made more secure. It these machines the armature insulation is required to withstand four or five times the normal working pressure...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility (AWWU) is {{performing}} upgrades to their water system. A challenging section {{of that system}} is an existing 6 -inch wire-wrapped wood stave water line {{that needs to be}} upsized to an 8 -inch line. The pipe was installed in the 1950 ’s and is failing. There have been 8 emergency repairs, 5 of which have occurred in the last 5 years. Some of the repairs were done by pounding <b>wood</b> <b>wedges</b> into the leaks. The pipe is 1, 160 feet long and is located in the G-H Alley between 10 th and 13 th Avenue in Anchorage, Alaska. The alleyway is very narrow and contains several major utilities including an 8 -inch gas line, a 12 -inch storm sewer, telephone/cable lines and an 8 -inch sanitary sewer. For much of the alignment, the gas line is located within about 3 feet of the water line. The water line is located 10 to 11 feet below grade. Three borings were advanced along the alignment by Golder Associates in Anchorage. All three borings were dry and indicated poorly graded sand with gravel at the depth of the waterline. Trenchless construction options were considered due to the presence of many utilities, lack of available room within the narrow ROW to perform open-cut work, and the regular use of the alley by residents. Four trenchless technologies were evaluated to replace the existing 6 -inch wire-wrapped wood stave pipe; horizontal directional drilling (HDD), pipe bursting, auger boring, and pilot tube microtunneling. This paper describes layout and design issues associated with each trenchless option considered and discusses the chosen method (pilot tube microtunneling) in greater detail...|$|R
5000|$|Original Stratocasters were {{manufactured}} {{with five}} tremolo springs, allowing the bridge {{set up to}} [...] "float". In the floating position, players can move the bridge-mounted tremolo arm up or down to modulate the pitch of the notes being played. Hank Marvin, Jeff Beck and Ike Turner used the Strat's floating tremolo extensively in their playing. As string gauges have changed, players have experimented {{with the number of}} tremolo springs. Modern Stratocasters are equipped with three springs as a stock option. While the floating bridge has unique advantages, the functionality of the [...] "floating" [...] has been accepted & disputed by many musicians. As the bridge floats, the instrument has a tendency to go out of tune during double-stop string bends. Many Stratocaster players opt to tighten the tremolo springs so the bridge is firmly anchored against the guitar body: in this configuration, the tremolo arm can still be used to slacken the strings and therefore lower the pitch, but it cannot be used to raise the pitch. (As the pitch can be raised through string bending, this can be a good compromise, depending on a player's style.) Some players, such as Eric Clapton and Ronnie Wood, feel that floating bridge has an excessive propensity to detune guitars and so inhibit the bridge's movement with a chunk of <b>wood</b> <b>wedged</b> between the bridge block and the inside cutout of the tremolo cavity and by increasing the tension on the tremolo springs; these procedures lock the bridge in a fixed position. Some Strats have a fixed bridge in place of the tremolo assembly; these are colloquially called [...] "hard-tails". There is considerable debate about the effects on tone and sustain of the material used in the tremolo system's 'inertia bar' and many aftermarket versions are available.|$|R

Unlike an axe, maul handles are normally straight and closer to round than the elongated oval axe handles tend to be. A maul's handle, unlike an axe, is intentionally used for levering as well as swinging. The handles are typically made from hickory, though synthetic fibreglass handles have become common.

In the early 1970s a triangular head design with an unbreakable metal handle was introduced called the [...] "Monster Maul." ...|$|R

If the wind died away and they were left in the doldrums - well, they didn’t worry. They anchored and caught themselves feeds of fish which they cooked on their little galley fires, the scent of frying re-bream mixing not unhappily with the aroma of guavas, grapes, and the big hautboy strawberries which now seem to have gone out of fashion. Then, when the tide turned, they would up with the anchor and drift down till they opened up to the harbour where there was always some sort of breeze.

5000|$|Joffre met Haig on 11 August, {{to press}} his policy of {{combined}} broad-front attacks, proposing {{an attack on}} 22 August, to advance from the Somme, northwards through Combles, Ginchy, High Wood and Thiepval, followed by an attack on 1 September, to take Bouchavesnes, Rancourt, Morval, Flers, Martinpuich, Courcelette and Grandcourt. Haig proposed a less ambitious attack, from the Somme to High Wood about 18 August to which Joffre agreed. Haig and Foch met on 19 August and arranged plans to capture Guillemont on 24 August, combined with French attacks from the Somme to Maurepas. Another attack was decided for 26 or 27 August, from Cléry to Le Forêt by the French and from <b>Wedge</b> <b>Wood</b> to Ginchy by the British. On 24 August, Haig criticised the Fourth Army headquarters, for failing adequately to supervise the planning of attacks, which had been too narrow and conducted with insufficient forces. Haig wanted an attack on Guillemont with [...] divisions, to ensure a continuous attack on the whole front and far more scrutiny by Rawlinson of subordinates {{in the preparation of}} attacks. The need to replace divisions opposite Guillemont, difficulties in co-ordination with the French and several days of rain from 25 August, delayed the next attack until 3 September.|$|R
25|$|Rawlinson {{discussed}} {{the situation with}} the commanders of the 55th, 2nd and 24th divisions and ordered that the next attack must be thoroughly prepared. Haig intervened to urge no delay on strategic grounds and {{discussed the}} problem posed by German defenders hiding in shell-holes and the débris of the village. Rawlinson met Fayolle later, to discuss the combined attack due on 11 August. On 10 August, XIII Corps reported that the attack would be ready by 17 August. The day was misty and rainy, which grounded aircraft {{and led to the}} attack being postponed for a day and ground taken by an advance of two companies of the 55th Division was abandoned, after the French attack was repulsed. Foch and Rawlinson met on 13 August, to plan an operation in which XIV Corps would attack Guillemont, after the French captured Maurepas and Angle Wood, followed by an attack by XIV Corps on <b>Wedge</b> <b>Wood</b> and Falfemont Farm, at dawn on 19 August. A combined attack on 22 August, from Le Forêt to Bois Douage by the French, prolonged from Leuze Wood to Ginchy by the British, was also arranged. Rawlinson and Fayolle agreed a preliminary attack for 16 August, from Angle Wood to south of Guillemont, which took place in hot weather, with special arrangements for counter-battery fire and communication. The British and French made a small advance but most of the captured ground was lost to a counter-attack overnight.|$|R
