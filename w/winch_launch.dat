50|$|The {{aircraft}} was originally {{sold to the}} Altosaurus Soaring Club of North Conway, New Hampshire for USD$595. This club was formed {{by a group of}} Harvard University skiers from the Schussverien Ski Club.

50|$|In the {{northern}} part of the airfield, gliders can perform high altitude <b>winch</b> <b>launches</b> with 2,600 cable, which makes this airfield almost unique in the world (together with the Rothenburg/Görlitz Airfield).|$|R
50|$|The Ballila first flew in 1939. Ten were built, serving all the gliding {{schools of}} the R.U.N.A. It could be <b>winch</b> <b>launched</b> and was {{straightforward}} to fly, training novice pilots to their B-certificate.|$|R
50|$|The {{first flight}} of the Milano was in 1932. About six Milanos and Romas were built. Designed to be <b>winch</b> <b>launched,</b> they were seen as a {{suitable}} aircraft on which to gain a B certificate for a 30 minute flight.|$|R
50|$|Although {{it rarely}} happens, a glider can {{be struck by}} lightning. Metal {{sailplanes}} are Faraday cages and thus should not be destroyed by a lightning strike. However, gliders made of wood or fibreglass can be destroyed. Moreover, modern sailplanes are filled with electronic devices that can be damaged by lightning. Also, any <b>winch</b> <b>launch</b> must be prohibited when a thunderstorm is less than 20 km away. Indeed, the air is electrified, and the cable will act as a lightning rod.|$|E
50|$|The first prototype, named 'Pionier' (registration SP-1598) {{was flown}} on 25 February 1956 by Stanisław Skrzydlewski at Bielsko, leading to {{modifications}} {{to improve the}} room in the cockpit, re-position the <b>winch</b> <b>launch</b> hook to increase directional stability during winch launching, and to increase {{the strength of the}} forward fuselage. Further improvements were made to the second prototype, SZD-15-2 Sroka (registration SP-1667), which flew on 1 February 1957. Production aircraft were designated SZD-15A, and 20 were built in ZSLS in Krosno, in addition to the two prototypes.|$|E
50|$|The {{two most}} common methods of {{launching}} sailplanes are by aerotow and by winch. When aerotowed, the glider is towed behind a powered aircraft using a rope about 60 meters (about 200 ft) long. The glider pilot releases the rope after reaching the desired altitude. However, the rope can be {{released by the}} towplane also in case of emergency. Winch launching uses a powerful stationary engine located {{on the ground at}} the far end of the launch area. The glider is attached to one end of 800-1200 metres (about 2,500-4,000 ft) of cable and the winch rapidly winds it in. The glider can gain about 900-3000 feet (about 300-900 metres) of height with a <b>winch</b> <b>launch,</b> depending on the head wind. Less often, automobiles are used to pull gliders into the air, by pulling them directly or through the use of a reverse pulley in a similar manner to the <b>winch</b> <b>launch.</b> Elastic ropes (known as bungees) are occasionally used at some sites to launch gliders from slopes, if there is sufficient wind blowing up the hill. Bungee launching was the predominant method of launching early gliders. Some modern sailplanes can self-launch with the use of retractable engines and/or propellers, which can also be used to sustain flight once airborne (see motor glider).|$|E
50|$|Runway 18C / 36C (1170m) is {{used for}} <b>winch</b> <b>launches,</b> in most cases 36C due to wind {{conditions}}.

50|$|Conceived as a rival to the Grunau Baby, it was {{the first}} product of the newly formed Sportflugzeugbau Göppingen Martin Schempp firm.

5000|$|The airport also widely serves {{recreational}} traffic, including having destinations {{served by}} regional air carriers Air Canada Express and WestJet Encore each with propjet flights to Edmonton and Calgary, along with charter traffic, and traffic {{caused by the}} high density {{oil and gas industry}} in the area. Currently the airport is served by a Flight Service Station, and is a Class [...] "E" [...] airspace.

5000|$|He {{was one of}} {{the student}} members of the Akaflieg Darmstadt who {{designed}} the revolutionary D-36 [...] "Circe". This team also included Heiko Fries, Klaus Holighaus and Gerhard Waibel.While the members of the Akaflieg built the D-36 (V1), a common friend of the students - Walter Schneider - built a second D-36 (V2) in his shutters factory. Walter Schneider almost killed himself in it when he took a <b>winch</b> <b>launch</b> with a disconnected elevator but he parachuted to safety. Soon after the success of the D-36 Walter Schneider asked Wolf Lemke to design and build gliders professionally in his shutters factory - which then became a glider manufacturer as well.|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the high}} {{take-off}} weight of the B13, the group decided in 1984 to design and construct a new more powerful winch to launch their gliders. Daimler-Benz donated a 320 HP 10-cylinder diesel engine including an axle and cable drums. In addition to achieving a higher performance, the project's aim was to make winch launching safer for modern gliders which have higher minimum speeds during a <b>winch</b> <b>launch,</b> especially on days {{when there is no}} wind or even a light tail-wind. By using big azimuth rollers and inclined inlet guides, the winch is designed to minimize the bending of the cable under load. The groups also designed automatic process controls for the pneumatically driven gearbox actuators;mounted on an all-wheel drive Tatra 148 chassis, the winch was finished in 1994 and has operated with DYNEEMA-plastics cables since 2004.|$|E

50|$|The Minibat was {{designed}} by Haig as a motor glider, but without self-launching capabilities, instead the aircraft is <b>launched</b> by aerotow, <b>winch</b> <b>launching</b> or auto-tow. The small chainsaw engine provides enough power to ensure a positive rate of climb and prevent land-outs, but not enough power for launching. The design goal was a glider with slightly greater performance than the Schweizer 1-26.|$|R
50|$|To {{comply with}} the DDR {{requirements}} {{the structure of the}} Bekas was primarily of wood with plywood skinning except for {{a small percentage of the}} wing surface. The undercarriage consisted of a sprung monowheel, set well forward of the centre of gravity, and tail-skid, which improved stability on the ground roll during <b>winch</b> <b>launching</b> but raised the cockpit sill hampering boarding the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500 ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.Winch launches are much cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch may also be used at sites where an aerotow could not operate, because of the shape of the field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short.

50|$|While {{his early}} {{schooling}} was idyllic, he was bullied and hated the bad food and harsh discipline at the Downs School, {{where he was}} sent as a border {{at the age of}} nine. The boys slept in three-sided huts with the fourth side open to the elements and here he contracted pneumonia followed by pleural empyema. He was ten years old and spent nearly a year recuperating at the Cadbury holiday home, Winds Point, high in the Malvern Hills. At thirteen, Crosfield went to Leighton Park School, a Quaker school in Reading, where his father had been head boy. He liked physics and maths and Crosfield chose to study engineering. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where his father had also read mechanical sciences. Crosfield was a founder member of the University's Gliding Club, where the flyers developed what they {{believed to be the first}} successful <b>winch</b> <b>launch,</b> using an old Buick they adapted for that purpose. Although Crosfield enjoyed Cambridge to the full, with parties, sports (rowing, squash, golf and gliding) and high jinks, he worked hard, noting he had 27 hours of lectures and workshops a week compared to 6 hours for some of his friends. He graduated in 1936 and spent six weeks in Munich to improve his German. Here he was shocked by the virulence of anti-Semitic propaganda, the thin and haggard political prisoners he passed building new autobahns and by Hitler's hate-filled yet strangely mesmerising radio speeches. On his return to England, he found that his reports of what was going on in Germany were met with disbelief.|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} thesis {{investigated the}} mechanisms leading to accidents during the <b>winch</b> <b>launch</b> of gliders. Initially, {{data from the}} accident database of the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation was studied. Critical phases of the launch were identied along with the associated probabilities and risks of accidents. From this data requirements to an aerodynamics model suitable for accident reconstruction were formulated. An instationary multipoint aerodynamics approach, based on blade element theory, met these demands. A "prescribed wake" model was then coupled with this multipoint aerodynamics approach to determine the induced velocities at all surfaces. The developed models were then validated and checked for plausibility with flight test data from a Schweizer SGS 1 - 36 sailplane. For the purpose of describing the relations between pilot and aircraft behavior as well as launch safety, a flight envelope limiting airspeed and pitch attitude was proposed. It was shown that the aircraft's radius of gyration along its pitch axis influences the path taken through the flight envelope. As a consequence, motorglider conversions of existing sailplane designs operate closer to the upper pitch boundary of the flight envelope. With this knowledge a generic 18 m class motorglider model was then implemented in the developed aerodynamics model and exposed to a hypothetical accident scenario. Here it was shown that under the presented circumstances {{the risk of a}} pilot-provoked stall of the horizontal stabilizer exists. Depending on the severity of the stall, a catastrophic accident might result...|$|E

5000|$|One Scud crashed {{early in}} the aircraft's career.

50|$|In gliding, wind {{gradients}} {{just above}} the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider.Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as <b>winch</b> <b>launches</b> or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden,or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceedingthe maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of thegradient.|$|R
40|$|A numeric {{simulation}} {{tool for}} simulating the <b>winch</b> <b>launch</b> of gliders has been realized and employed {{for a number}} of analyses. It comprises models of aircraft, pilot, winch, winch operator, cable, atmosphere and terrain. Results are in agreement with pilots' experience. The simulation framework is implemented in Matlab/Simulink. It is based on an existing flight dynamics simulation used e. g. to assess the application of actuators in sailplanes. Configuration has been kept fairly generic to allow modeling of different aircraft, winches, cables and conditions. A GUI allows easy change of parameters. The cable may be modeled either as a simple secant between winch and aircraft, where force variations along the cable are neglected. The alternative is a FEM representation with the cable separated into massless cylinder elements connecting mass points. This allows including aerodynamic forces acting on the cylinders and gravity acting on the mass points. The cylinders may also be assigned spring and damping constants to model elasticity effects. Finally, they also interact with the terrain. For the winch, an automotive drive train model was employed. The rotating parts act as a flywheel whose acceleration is determined by power input from the engine and power drain from the cable. Ground interaction is modeled for a set of discrete contact points including wheels, exposed structure elements like skids or wingtips and the cable elements. Each contact point has spring and damping constants to model the force normal to the terrain. Forces in the contact plane are calculated via friction coefficients. The humans in the loop are approximated by simple control elements, namely PID controllers. The winch operator controls the cable force at the winch using engine throttle. The glider pilot model is divided into three submodels controlling elevator, aileron and rudder. The elevator channel is responsible for airspeed, while bank angle (and thus heading rate) is controlled by aileron deflection. The objective of the rudder channel finally is to minimize the angle of sideslip. All pilot controller gains are scheduled by dynamic pressure. Human factors are included in terms of reaction time and neuromuscular delay. Analyses were carried out varying different simulation parameters like cable type, cable force, hook position, pilot behavior and wind influence. Results will be presented in the paper...|$|E
40|$|The {{simulation}} {{presented in}} this thesis illustrates {{some of the basic}} mechanisms governing the <b>winch</b> <b>launch</b> as it is practiced at many gliding sites worldwide. Whereas several comprehensive cybernetic models have been coupled in this simulation, areas still in need of improvement within each model have been pointed out for future enhancements. Results could be improved by including an aerodynamic ground effect model and properly modeling the ground to carry the glider and cable. Friction of the ground against the glider and cable should also be modeled in the future. More detailed aerodynamic data on the behavior of the glider in stalled ight needs to be implemented to strengthen the expressiveness of the performed safety analyses. It should also be attempted to gain data of actual winch types and depict a more modern driveline setup regarding a torque converter and other similar equipment and regard the effects of density altitude on engine performance. The numeric diculties having limited the minimum cable segment length need to be analyzed and solved to improve cable resolution. In the future, the virtual winch operator and pilot behavior need to be compared to actual human behavior. Enhancements of the control laws might regard aspects of fuzzy logic or adaptive control. Also, the enhancement of the simulation to include humans in the loop is thought to be possible. While the general operationability of winch launches has been proven in practice for several decades, it is also supported by the presented results. It has also been shown that the current methods of winch launching have found an acceptable compromise between performance and safety as no highly critical situations have been found in the reference launch. The existing regulations on tailwind operations are supported by the presented data and gusts seem to have little effect on the weak link force, considering the given wing loading. The destabilizing effect of a quick opening of the winch throttle on the glider's phugoid mode is shown, as well as the possibility of optimizing the tow hook location. Increases in release altitude are gained through changes in the cable type, tow distance and the maximum winch force. While studying the inuence of different physical forces on the cable, by varying the cable models, aerodynamic cable drag is identied as another major influence on release altitude, and is analyzed further by varying the drag coefficient. At last, the dynamics of an aggressively own launch is looked at and the results are in unison with the focus of current training curricula...|$|E
50|$|In 1925, Ursinus took {{yet another}} bold step by {{appointing}} Alexander Lippisch {{as head of}} the technical branch of the RRG. Lippisch advanced the work of RRG by designing and building ever more sophisticated gliders. Also in 1925 the ban on powered aircraft was partially lifted and soon the RRG started experimenting with motor gliders. In addition to the 'traditional' way of bungee-launching gliders, the RRG also developed <b>winch</b> <b>launching</b> and aerotowing to get gliders airborne.|$|R
50|$|However, aviation, {{particularly}} {{training at}} Upavon continued, with the grass runways and tarmac taxiways {{being used for}} training purposes by various RAF rotary-wing helicopters, and RAF C-130 Hercules. It was also home to gliding, mainly <b>winch</b> <b>launched.</b> The RAF Air Cadets, known as the Air Training Corps, used static winch-launched gliders of No. 622 Volunteer Gliding Squadron (VGS), along with the Army Gliding Association (AGA) Wyvern Gliding Club (which used self-propelled, winch-launched, and aero-towed gliders). These activities still continue at this present time.|$|R
25|$|Like {{sailplanes}} {{and hang}} gliders, paragliders use rising air (thermals) or ridge lift to gain height. This {{process is the}} basis for most recreational flights and competitions, though aerobatics and 'spot landing competitions' also occur. Launching is often done by jogging down a slope, but <b>winch</b> <b>launches</b> behind a towing vehicle are also used. A Paramotor is a paraglider wing powered by a motor attached {{to the back of the}} pilot, and is also known as a powered paragliders. A variation of this is the paraplane, which has a motor mounted on a wheeled frame rather than the pilot's back.|$|R
50|$|Aero-towing of gliders {{has been}} used as a launch method since the early 1930s. The FVA set about the study and design of an {{efficient}} glider tug with the FVA-19, as well as make large scale statistical studies of the efficiencies of aero-towing and <b>winch</b> <b>launching.</b> Design of the FVA-19 was completed but the purchase of a Piper Super Cub for aero-towing at the FVA gliding club made further work redundant.
