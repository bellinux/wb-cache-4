2500|$|In Northern Ireland 2010 Deputy Mayor of Newry and Mourne Council, Cllr Karen Mc Kevitt {{launched}} the Magnet Young Men's Health Event,' on Friday 19 November. The event {{was attended by}} men from across the district and representatives from local statutory, voluntary and community organisations were organised to celebrate 19 November as International Men's Day. Deputy Mayor, Cllr Mc Kevitt said, ‘It {{is a great idea}} to give an issue that has an international perspective a local focus. All men need to look after their health and take advantage of the services and help that is out there, as <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>do.</b> But it is particularly good to see an event that looks at the barriers that young men may be facing and brings together people from all organisations across the district to look at {{what can be done to}} work together to make things better.' The event offered opportunities for men to have health checks with experienced staff from Action Cancer, and speakers such as Ken Harland (University of Ulster's Centre of Young Men's studies), Peter Mc Donald, a senior child care worker from Giggles Daycare nursery, and local athlete Ronan Murtagh shared their own insight into the choices young men make and the opportunities that are out there for young men today. Also in attendance was Jerome Burns, Assistant Director, Department for Social Development. Jerome stated, ‘The department for Social Development is delighted to support local initiatives that work with young men to highlight inequalities in health.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Zubov of Kot-in-Action Creative Artel who {{developed}} the Steel Storm games complained in an interview about the trouble he had getting his games accepted into the Bundles, originally trying to push their game's first episode as a free bonus for the second Bundle, {{and then trying to}} get their full game into the third. Zubov recalls that he had heard [...] "nothing back" [...] until they made a [...] "last minute decision" [...] to include Steel Storm: Burning Retribution in the Humble Indie Bundle 3. Even then, Zubov further described his dissatisfaction with how payment was handled, saying that they were [...] "offered a tiny-tiny fraction of what HIB3 made, a very small (compared to the profits of HIB3) fixed amount of money" [...] even though, according to Zubov, [...] "when Steel Storm was released as a bonus, their sales jumped up significantly." [...] He also mentioned that despite claims by the organizers that their sales would [...] "sky rocket just because [...] were in the HIB3", their actual amount of sales remained relatively constant. Zubov noted that their inclusion in the third bundle [...] "did get a lot of users who redeemed their copy of Steel Storm on Steam and Desura" [...] and that they hoped this would help keep their [...] "current user base, which we gained with HIB3, interested in our upcoming games". He concluded his comments about his experiences by saying that [...] "only time will tell if HIB3 was [...] awesome deal or not. Maybe, maybe not. If it works out as a long term investment, it will be awesome indeed. If not, I will never ever participate in such capacity (as a bonus item for a small fixed payout) in the future HIB bundles. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>do</b> have bills to pay and families to feed, don't we?" ...|$|E
