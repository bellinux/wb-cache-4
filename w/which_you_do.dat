Smith who publicized her {{sending them to}} him and her identity as a niece of Joseph Smith, which upset her. She told him that [...] "To be crucified for a faith in which you believe is to be blessed. To be crucified for one in <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not believe is to be crucified indeed."

2500|$|However, what Huxley {{proposed}} was {{to create}} an edited version of the Bible, shorn of [...] "shortcomings and errors... statements to which men of science absolutely and entirely demur... These tender children [...] not be taught that <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not yourselves believe". The Board voted against his idea, but it also voted against the idea that public money {{should be used to}} support students attending church schools. Vigorous debate took place on such points, and the debates were minuted in detail. Huxley said [...] "I will never be a party to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools". The Act of Parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the Bible, but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught.|$|E

2500|$|Marie Avis Walker {{exploited}} a legal loophole, {{which had}} first been exposed by somebody who, {{earlier in the}} seventies, had applied for permission to build [...] "a small cabin of clay and wattles made, nine bean rows, and a hive for honey bee" [...] on the Isle of Innisfree. This application was rejected in a decision by Sligo County Council, who claimed that it would hinder public amenities. When Marie Avis Walker made use of the loophole, she was more successful. She was granted planning permission for a shopping centre development in which Frescati was retained in its entirety. The developers were concerned {{that she was able}} to do this, even though she was not the owner of the land. The law was changed as a direct result of this, and it is not possible now to seek planning permission for land <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not own. This event was important for another reason: though Marie Avis Walker proved that the shopping centre and Frescati House could co-exist, Roches rejected the possibility, and in doing so demonstrated their opposition to preserving Frescati.|$|E
2500|$|According to The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, shaytan in the {{singular}} and the plural shayateen {{are used in}} the Quran often interchangeably with Iblis, who is [...] "considered to be a particular shaytan." [...] In Islamic theology, Iblis is a being created from fire who was allowed to mingle with Angels in the heavens until he rejected the command of God to bow before Adam. When God created Adam, the first human, He said to the angels: [...] "And , when your Lord said to the angels, [...] "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority." [...] They said, [...] "Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?" [...] Allah said, [...] "Indeed, I know that <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know." [...] All the angels prostrate, but Iblis does not. Iblis justified his decision, because he claims to be better than a human: [...] " [...] said, [...] "What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you? [...] said, [...] "I am better than him. You created me from fire, and created him from clay." [...] Iblis requests a reprieve until the day of resurrection to try to mislead the people in any way he can. God reprieves Iblis but, He also warns that Iblis would have no authority over His ibād or [...] "servants". [...] "As for My servants, no authority shalt thou have over them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{absolute}} or infinite—the unconditioned {{ground and}} {{source of all}} reality—is yet apprehended by us as an immediate datum or reality; and it is apprehended in consciousness—under its condition, that, to wit, of distinguishing subject and object, knower and known. The doctrine of Cousin was criticized by Sir W Hamilton in the Edinburgh Review of 1829, and it was animadverted upon {{about the same time}} by Schelling. Hamilton's objections are as follows. The correlation of the ideas of infinite and finite does not necessarily imply their correality, as Cousin supposes; on the contrary, it is a presumption that finite is simply positive and infinite negative of the same—that the finite and infinite are simply contradictory relatives. Of these [...] " [...] the positive alone is real, the negative is only an abstraction of the other, and in the highest generality even an abstraction of thought itself." [...] A study of the few sentences under this head might have obviated the trifling criticism of Hamilton's objection which has been set afloat recently, that the denial of a knowledge of the absolute or infinite implies a foregone knowledge of it. How can you deny the reality of that <b>which</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know? The answer to this is {{that in the case of}} contradictory statements—A and not A—the latter is a mere negation of the former, and posits nothing; and the negation of a notion with positive attributes, as the finite, does not extend beyond abolishing the given attributes as an object of thought. The infinite or non-finite is not necessarily known, ere the finite is negated, or in order to negate it; all that needs be known is the finite itself; and the contradictory negation of it implies no positive. Non-organized may or may not correspond to a positive—i.e. an object or notion with qualities contradictory of the organized; but the mere sublation of the organized does not posit it, or suppose that it is known beforehand, or that anything exists corresponding to it. This is one among many flaws in the Hegelian dialectic, and it paralyzes the whole of the Logic. Secondly, the conditions of intelligence, which Cousin allows, necessarily exclude the possibility of knowledge of the absolute—they are held to be incompatible with its unity. Here Schelling and Hamilton argue that Cousin's absolute is a mere relative. Thirdly, it is objected that in order to deduce the conditioned, Cousin makes his absolute a relative; for he makes it an absolute cause, i.e. a cause existing absolutely under relation. As such it is necessarily inferior to the sum total of its effects, and dependent for reality on these—in a word, a mere potence or becoming. Further, as a theory of creation, it makes creation a necessity, and destroys the notion of the divine. Cousin made no reply to Hamilton's criticism beyond alleging that Hamilton's doctrine necessarily restricted human knowledge and certainty to psychology and logic, and destroyed metaphysics by introducing nescience and uncertainty into its highest sphere—theodicy.|$|E
