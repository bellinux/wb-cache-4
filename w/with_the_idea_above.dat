This paper reports on a new programme unit we have designed at Bournemouth University. Our overall approach encompasses the necessary competences, but also provides for a more holistic and flexible outcome – capability. We follow <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of authors such as Lester (1995), Fook et al. (2000), and Barnett & Coate (2005) who show that professional development {{is more concerned with}} approaches and processes rather than fixed knowledge and outcomes. They place importance on practitioners developing the ability to identify and interpret the multifaceted nature of situations whilst considering a range of alternative options, in order to deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> complexity and uncertainty of practice. The type of practice learning required to develop such skills, abilities and attributes is also necessarily rich in complexity. As Cheetham and Chivers (2001) point out there is no single theory of learning in the workplace and there is danger in placing too much reliance on a single approach. In accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>above</b> we advocate a mindset of continuing learning through critically reflective practice and collaboration <b>with</b> others. <b>The</b> presentation will discuss our learning materials and pedagogy, which aim to not only encourage and develop active, experiential, and critically reflective learning but also allow for the constructive and creative methods for the enabling of such learning. In this way we believe social workers may be educated to fully develop the professional capability or dynamic competence (Doel et al. 2002) that will enable themselves and others to function effectively in the complex world of practice.

30|$|International {{competitiveness}} {{is viewed}} as a strategic phenomenon inherent in the fields of international marketing, international business and international management, and refers to the attributes that make organizations more competitive than others in the global market. Organizations can be understood broadly as a region, a nation, an industry or perhaps a strategic group. Therefore, the term international competitiveness is a multi-level phenomenon working in the global market (Hult 2012). Porter (1990) argued that the competitiveness is created, not inherited and claimed that the source of competitiveness is the competitive advantage, which is created and sustained through a highly localized process. Porter (1990) described the competitive advantage as four main attributes that allow an organization to outperform its competitors. Those attributes, individually and as a system, constitute the Diamond Model of national advantage, which serves as a playing field that each nation establishes and operates for its industries. The competitiveness will increase when each of these attributes is improved. Based on Porter (1990) and D’Cruz and Rugman (1993), the Generalized Double Diamond Model (GDDM) introduced by Moon et al. (1995, 1998) viewed international competitiveness as a broader term to incorporate multinational activities and government in the Diamond Model. At the sector level, D’Cruz (1992) argued that international competitiveness of an industry is the collective ability of firms in that sector to compete internationally. According to Momaya (1998), international competitiveness at industry level is often considered as the results of strategies and actions of firms operating in that sector. Competitiveness is also represented by the relative productivity and its ability to create value added. It allows an industry to maintain and improve position in the global market and can only be assessed by comparing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same industry in another country (Depperu and Cerrato 2005). <b>With</b> all <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>above,</b> international competitiveness of an industry in short can be understood as its ability to compete internationally and can be measured through different attributes in comparison <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same industry in other nations.|$|R

The safety of the operational tunnels must be guaranteed when new shield tunnels are constructed in the immediate vicinity. To realize this aim. The conditions of the existing tunnels should be mastered to the largest degree. So an overall and thorough inspection to investigate the conditions were always performed beforehand. To guide the new nearby shield tunnel construction, it is a must to decide the allowed movements of the existing tunnels and tracks. To help make the execution plans, {{it is necessary to}} simulate effects of the new shield tunneling on the existing tunnels by numerical computations. The preparation work must be done in advance and can be done well <b>with</b> <b>the</b> findings of the computations. Whereas monitoring design and information management are indispensable to the information-oriented new nearby shield tunnel construction.

Key elements of the safety control framework, identified for a fully integrated design and construction procedure and based on the most recent and state-of-the-art experiences in mainland China, can be summarized and given below.|$|R
40|$|The Attainable Region is {{the set of}} all {{achievable}} states, for {{all possible}} reactor configurations, obtained by reaction and mixing alone. It is a geometric method that is effective in addressing problems found in reactor network synthesis. For this reason, Attainable Region theory assists towards {{a better understanding of}} systems of complex reaction networks and the issues encountered by these systems. This thesis aims to address two areas in Attainable Region theory: 1. To help improve the design and operation of batch reactors using Attainable Regions. 2. To further advance knowledge and understanding of efficient Attainable Region construction methods. Using fundamental concepts of mixing and attainability established by Attainable Region theory, a graphical method of identifying opportunities for improving the production rate from batch reactors is first presented. It is found that by modifying the initial concentration of the batch, overall production performance may be improved. This may be achieved in practice by retaining a fraction of the final product volume and mixing with fresh feed material for subsequent cycles. This result is counter-intuitive to the normal method of batch operation. Bypassing of feed may also be used to improve production rate for exit concentrations not associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> optimal concentration. The graphical approach also allows optimisation of batches where only experimental data are given. An improved method of candidate Attainable Region construction, based on an existing bounding hyperplanes approach is then presented. The method uses a plane rotation about existing extreme points to eliminate unachievable regions from an initial bounding set. The algorithm is shown to be faster and has been extended to include construction of candidate Attainable Regions involving non-isothermal kinetics in concentration and concentration-time space. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> obtained <b>above,</b> <b>the</b> application of Attainable Regions to batch reactor configurations is finally presented. It is shown that <b>with</b> <b>the</b> appropriate transformation, results developed from a continuous Attainable Region may be used to form a related batch structure. Thus, improvement of batch reactor structures is also possible using Attainable Regions. Validation of candidate Attainable Regions is carried out <b>with</b> <b>the</b> construction algorithm developed in this work...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGiven an H-closed {{extension}} Y of a Hausdorff space X, {{there is}} a unique continuous surjection from the Katětov extension of X to Y which leaves X pointwise fixed. The equivalence relations on the Katětov extension induced by such functions, as Y ranges over the collection of H-closed extensions of X, are characterized in this paper. Also, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for two H-closed extensions to induce the same equivalence relation on the Katětov extension. A cardinality argument, in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>ideas,</b> is used {{to show that the}} set of H-closed extensions of X cannot, in general, be characterized in terms of a set of relations on the set of subsets of X (such as proximity-like structures), nor by a set of collections of relations on X (such as uniformlike structures). For a given nonempty collection of H-closed extensions of X, the construction of an H-closed extension of X which is a supremum, in the projectively large sense, of the given collection is sketched. Constructions are given for projective maximum and minimal elements of the set of H-closed extensions of X inducing the same equivalence relation on the Katětov extension of X. All example shows that there is not necessarily a projective minimum element in this set. Those Hausdorff spaces for which the Katětov and Fomin extensions are the same are characterized as those with finite covers of almost H-closed subspaces...|$|R
30|$|In the 2 -[18 F]fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET study, {{while the}} SUVs decline in normal tissues in the post-injection period, those in tumors {{generally}} increase, {{indicating that the}} SUVs of normal and tumor tissues are dependent {{on the time of}} scan initiation after infusion. Therefore, it is important to initiate the scanning at a consistent time-point after the FDG injection. The SNM procedure guidelines for tumor PET imaging recommended that emission images should be obtained at least 45 min after injection of the radiopharmaceutical [30]. The EANM procedure guidelines for tumor PET imaging recommended a 60 -min interval between FDG administration and the start of image acquisition [31]. In contrast, MET accumulation in MET PET reaches a plateau in most normal organs. The MET accumulation in brain tumors and lung cancers also reached a plateau at 5 to 10 min after the radiotracer injection [32, 33]. These findings imply that after the plateau phase is reached, the SUVs of normal tissues and tumors in MET PET might be independent of the scan initiation time. In most previous studies, the scanning was initiated 15 min or later after MET injection (Table  1). Therefore, in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>idea,</b> their SUV values were consistent, despite the differing scan initiation times. It is noteworthy that the SUV values of brain tumors and lung cancers measured at 20 min after MET injection were significantly correlated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> uptake values estimated by repeated PET scan after MET infusion, metabolite-corrected arterial input function, and graphic analysis [34].|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{in order to develop}} test methods and procedures for measuring the variation of the stress intensity factor through the thickness in bimaterial specimens containing cracks within and parallel to the bond line using the frozen stress photoelastic method. Since stress freezing materials are incompressible above critical temperature, and since thick plates are to be employed which tend to produce a state of plane strain near the crack tip, the interface near tip fracture equations reduce to the classic form for homogeneous materials. Moreover, zero thickness interfaces do not exist when materials are bonded together. It was decided early on that it would be important to insure a uniform straight and accurate crack tip region through the thickness of the body to reduce scatter in the SIF distribution through the thickness. It was also observed that rubberlike materials which were desired to be modeled exhibited significant tip blunting prior to crack extension and that some blunting of the tip would provide a more realistic model. It should be noted that, in normal stress freezing photoelastic work, it is considered good practice to avoid utilizing data near bond lines in photoelastic models due to the bond line stresses which inevitably develop when two parts are bonded together. Thus, the present study involves certain exploratory aspects in deviating from standard practice in stress freezing work. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>ideas</b> in mind, several different test methods were investigated and are described in the following sections and appendices.

40|$|In {{the current}} thesis, {{there has been}} an attempt to study <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of <b>the</b> Greek educators-pedagogues as well as the intellectuals during 1839 - 1881, {{throughout}} the educational-pedagogic journals of that period -since {{at the same time the}} educational act is depicted, which is strongly connected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> <b>ideas.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> stages of the configuration of the pedagogic thought are being detected and the effort of the constitution of the pedagogic science in the Greek state is presented. All the fields of science are formed at this period in Greece <b>with</b> <b>the</b> pedagogic science not being an exception, neither being cut off of the general political-economical-ideological-cultural frame of that period, the constitution and organization of the Greek state, and the formation and depiction of the substitutes of its ideology. It is a period of fluidity, sometimes confusion, intense ideological processes and general search. The journals, which are studied, are located in the atmosphere described above. They were published during the 19 th century in the Greek state, particularly in Athens. More specifically, these journals are “Paidagogos” (1839 - 1840), “I Ephemeris ton Mathiton kai ton Filomathon” (19 / 10 / 1852 - 15 / 3 / 1881) and “Filistor” (01 / 1961 - 12 / 1862). These journals depict the agony and the efforts of the educators-pedagogues of that period to contribute to the constitution of the philosophy of the Greek educational system and its principles in the most representative way. Furthermore, they impress the request of the initiation of the pedagogic science in the Greek state. The research was initially developed in one historical descriptive level by categorizing the articles of the journals, using their subject as criterion, and by presenting their authors’ views in chronological order. This chronological presentation made to some degree the evolution, which is observed in <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> that are expressed, obvious.
