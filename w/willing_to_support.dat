5|$|As Romulus was {{an alleged}} usurper, Julius Nepos claimed to hold legally {{the title of}} the emperor when Odoacer took power. However, few of Nepos' contemporaries were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> his cause after he ran away to Dalmatia. Some historians regard Julius Nepos, who ruled in Dalmatia until being murdered in 480, as the last lawful Western Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Matthias Corvinus died on 6 April 1490. Ernuszt seized Pécsvárad Abbey, {{which had}} been held by the absent Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, but soon hurried to Buda to attend the Diet which {{assembled}} in late May to elect Matthias's successor. He was the only bishop to be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Matthias's illegitimate son, John Corvinus, in his bid for the throne.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Leo, another cardinal had died, {{reducing the number}} of cardinal electors in the May conclave to 59. At the beginning of the conclave Alessandro Peretti di Montalto supported Antonio Sauli. A significant number of the electors loyal to Pietro Aldobrandini, the nephew of Clement VIII, were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Sauli. Aldobrandini, however, opposed Sauli's election due to Sauli's previous opposition to electing Clement, and was able to prevent Sauli from reaching the two-thirds majority required for election.|$|E

5|$|Riefenstahl tried {{many times}} to make more films during the 1950s and 1960s, but was met with resistance, public protests and sharp criticism. Many of her filmmaking peers in Hollywood had fled Nazi Germany and were unsympathetic to her. Although both film {{professionals}} and investors were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> her work, most of the projects she attempted were stopped owing to ever-renewed and highly negative publicity about her past work for the Third Reich.|$|E

In June 2011, the Council on Foreign Relations recommended that the US government fully endorse the inclusion of Brazil as a permanent member of the Security Council. Brazil has received backing from other permanent members: Russia, the United Kingdom and France, and from the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), Chile, Indonesia, Finland, Slovenia, Australia, South Africa, Guatemala, Vietnam and the Philippines, {{as well as from}} the other G4 nations, who mutually support each other.|$|E

5|$|Willkie {{spent much}} of 1943 {{preparing}} for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run in it as candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie's appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans. In spite of this, the Republicans gained seats in both the House and the Senate, though they still remained in the minority. Few Republican members of Congress were by then <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Willkie, and he dropped to second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of likely voters in the party's 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie's progressive credentials. He spoke of appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all they would get by opposing it was oblivion.|$|E

25|$|Gierek's regime {{introduced}} wide-ranging (but ultimately unsuccessful) government {{reforms to}} revitalize the economy between 1970 and 1980. Another attempt to raise food prices resulted in the June 1976 protests. Jacek Kuroń was among the activists who defended accused rioters from Radom and other towns. The Workers' Defence Committee (KOR), established {{in response to the}} crackdown, consisted of dissident intellectuals <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> industrial workers, farmers and students who were struggling with and persecuted by the authorities throughout the late 1970s. During this period, the opposition circles were emboldened by the Helsinki Conference processes.|$|E
25|$|In August 1466, {{the conspirators}} acted. They {{received}} {{support from the}} Duke of Ferrara, who marched troops into the Florentine countryside {{with the intent of}} deposing Piero. The coup failed. The Florentines were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> it, and soon after their arrival, Ferrara's troops left the city. The conspirators were exiled for life. While the internal problems were fixed, Venice took the opportunity to invade Florentine territory in 1467. Piero appointed Federigo da Montefeltro, Lord of Urbino, to command his mercenaries. An inconclusive battle ensued, with the Venetians forces retreating. In the winter of 1469 Piero died.|$|E

25|$|Marie Antoinette {{continued}} {{to hope that}} the military coalition of European kingdoms would succeed in crushing the Revolution. She counted most on the support of her Austrian family. After {{the death of her}} brother Joseph in 1790, his successor, Leopold, was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> her to a limited degree. Upon Leopold's death in 1792, his son, Francis, a conservative ruler, was ready to support the cause of the French royal couple more vigorously because he feared the consequences of the French Revolution and its ideas for the monarchies of Europe, particularly, for Austria's influence in the continent.|$|E
25|$|For {{the idea}} to succeed, Pitt knew that he needed large scale public support in Ireland for the idea from both Protestants and Catholics, and as such Catholic Emancipation {{would need to be}} {{delivered}} along with the union.

The Catholic middle classes and the Catholic hierarchy, led by John Thomas Troy, the Archbishop of Dublin, were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the union if Catholic Emancipation did indeed follow. Only a group of Catholic barristers, most notably Daniel O'Connell, opposed the idea of union.|$|E
