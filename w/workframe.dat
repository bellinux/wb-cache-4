40|$|The {{paper will}} present a Design Environment with Emulation of Prototypes (DEEP) for {{designing}} hardware/software systems. The CAE tool DEEP consists of an integrated <b>workframe</b> for designing hardware/software systems and the Rapid Prototype Co-Emulator (RPCE) for hardware/software co-emulation and verification. For a flexible realization of the designed systems FPGAs by XILINX are widely used within the RPCE. Experience in prototype realizations will be presented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA global {{methodology}} {{dealing with}} fictitious domains {{of all kinds}} on orthogonal curvilinear grids is presented. The main idea is to transform the curvilinear <b>workframe</b> and its associated elements (velocity, immersed interfaces [...] .) into a Cartesian grid. On such a grid, many operations can be performed much faster than on curvilinear grids. The method is coupled with a Thread Ray-casting algorithm which work on Cartesian grids only. This algorithm computes quickly the Heaviside function related to the interior of an object on an Eulerian grid. The approach is also coupled with an immersed boundary method ($L^ 2 $-penalty method) or with phase advection with VOF-PLIC, VOF-TVD, Front-tracking or Level-set methods. Applications, convergence and speed tests are performed for shape initializations, immersed boundary methods, and interface tracking...|$|E
40|$|Multifrequency BioImpedance Analysis or BIA {{consists}} on {{the injection}} {{of a small}} limited alternating current into {{the human body and}} in the measurement of the induced impedance and phase angle from which resistance, reactance and eventually body volumes can be derived. Effective interpretation of BIA measurements requires a robust theoretical <b>workframe.</b> For the first time, the skin-electrode interactions are modeled. An electrical body model was developed adding to the traditional Cole-Fricke-Cole dipole a skin-electrode interface circuit. Then, this model is used to interpret raw bioimpedance measurements in order to increase the overall bioimpedance measurements accuracy from which resistance, reactance and body water volumes can be inferred. An experimental comparison between computer simulations and experimental data in a group of hemodialytic patients was performed. The final results show that higher accuracies exceeding from 100 % over the traditional Cole-Fricke-Cole model can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|Components and {{appliances}} {{of the technical}} facilities in buildings, dwellings and apartments {{get more and more}} intelligence by embedding microelectronic functions. But these developments are normally optimised and focused on a special technical segment of a system. This leads to a bundle of disadvantages like poor control concepts, complicated maintenance and only a little usage of the potentials of innovative information technologies. In this contribution an open system integration concept developed in the inHaus-Center of Intelligent House Systems, Duisburg and based on OSGi-middleware <b>workframes</b> will be focused. With this concept new system functions like integrated system control and integrated security-, safety- and energy-management can be realized...|$|R
40|$|Simulation {{and related}} {{technologies}} are fast evolving into strategical, practical tools to secure competitivity edge to industrial companies. During the rapid growing of new technological areas, pioneering users sometimes experience hard times and turbulent situations; usually they react with extreme caution, mainly {{for the missing}} vision of reliable <b>workframes</b> as a reference. Extreme caution, in turn, may lower company competitivity in today markets. The present contribution {{is one of the}} first attempts to depict the main relationships between model, animation, realistic simulation, physical simulation and their inter- and intra-play to arrive to synthetic environments and active support systems for strategic applications. Synthetic environments and active support systems are key components for effective Rapid Prototyping to be used with high profit by industrial companies. Current techniques are critically revised and presented into an organic scenario to serve as a basic reference for competitive critical assumptions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the synthesis of}} macroinstructions for dynamically reprogrammable FPGAs {{so that they may}} be easily generated, placed, and garbage collected at run-time. An overview of a dynamic logic caching computer that uses these macroinstructions is given and their use within this environment discussed. The synthesis of macro-instructions is illustrated with a basic example. Finally, the current state of development of a logic cache based computing platform and compiler/simulator <b>workframe</b> is presented. 1 Introduction Dynamically reconfigurable gate arrays can be used to implement time-sliced coprocessors. By changing the configuration in the gate array's static RAM during run time, the coprocessor changes function during the execution of the program to provide hardware support on an as-needed basis. Thinking of the co-processor as a hardware cache, operating {{in much the same way}} as a memory cache, can provide several important benefits for fast prototyping. The logic cache c [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work {{is to build a}} simple but robust predictor of binding energy changes upon mutation, once structural information is provided. Three different tools are being employed: First, given the wild type structure of a complex, mutations are modelled with Modeller, a powerful program extensively used in protein homology modeling. Using the <b>workframe</b> provided by the tool, 50 different models are created for each mutation. This model diversity helps to take into account protein flexibility and explore, more efficiently, the conformational space of interactions. Then, models are evaluated using Modeller DOPE assessment tool and pyDock scoring function. DOPE [7] is statistical-potential-based tool that evaluates the quality of a model. The pyDock scoring function [8] is formed by different energy terms (electrostatic, desolvation and van der Waals), and was originally designed to deal with protein-protein docking problems. However, due to its energetic basis, we wanted to test their ability to evaluate changes in binding energies...|$|E
40|$|Architecture design, {{also thought}} of more loosely as layout design {{within the context}} of {{conceptual}} design, is one stage of the mechanical design process that significantly impacts product performance in terms of manufacturing, assembly, modularity, product family variety, maintenance, etc. This design step is special because it marks an occasion when many effects, including geometric concerns, come into play simultaneously on a large scale. The purpose of this research is to investigate the architecture design phase and develop a new design method as there is currently no consensus regarding a best strategy for dealing with architecture design. The resulting method is based primarily on the development of a formal representation and a set of guidelines derived from an empirical product study. Each of these three main deliverables are assessed and validated as part of their development. Based on the concept of a mental model, a representation is developed which consists of a lexicon and a six element notation known as the architecture <b>workframe.</b> Terms of the lexicon provide a well-defined means to describ...|$|E
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{crisis has}} brought into attention the hedge funds activity, {{with respect to}} high performance achieved levels, management techniques employed and high professionalism of the management. Being focused on higher returns to the market indices, hedge funds differ substantially to traditional investment funds through the promoted investment strategies. In Europe, prior to the European Parliament’s Directive on Alternative Investment Funds Administrators (November 2010), hedge funds activity {{has been the subject}} of many controversial financial discussions. Alternative investment funds, especially hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds have been held responsible to some extent for the global financial crisis. An increased transparency, through a more rigorous control on their activity, applying common regulations for all investment funds operating in the European area, provides the circumstances for increased financial stability and for a limited risk and increased investor protection <b>workframe.</b> This study considers the need for market regulations on hedge funds activity, while analyzing the defining characteristics of adopted investment strategies and their performance. The analysis is performed using the comparison approach in order to compare hedge funds performance to classic investment funds and market indices performance. The analyzed time period is 2000 – 2010, in terms of managed assets and rates of return achieved, benefits and disadvantages in the investment process. Hedge funds, regulations, investment strategies, compared performance...|$|E
40|$|En este artículo nos {{proponemos}} dar cuenta del papel que ocupa el trabajo infantil en el marco de las estrategias de reproducción en hogares pobres, haciendo hincapié en el análisis de las prácticas y representaciones de los niños y sus padres frente al fenómeno. Dado que lo más frecuente es que el trabajo infantil se lleve a cabo en contextos familiares, centramos la mirada no sólo en el niño, sino también en su familia, observando los procesos de organización del trabajo, el lugar que tiene el trabajo infantil en la generación de ingresos monetarios y no monetarios en hogares pobres, los significados asociados a esta práctica y cómo repercute en las relaciones familiares el hecho de que sean los niños quienes también cooperen en la reproducción del hogar. Dados los interrogantes que planteamos, decidimos llevar a cabo una investigación con un abordaje de tipo cualitativo. El trabajo de campo lo desarrollamos durante los años 2004 y 2006 en un barrio con características de pobreza estructural situado en la periferia de la ciudad de La Plata. Allí seleccionamos al total de unidades domésticas que presentaban situaciones de trabajo infantil y realizamos entrevistas en profundidad a los niños trabajadores y sus padres. The rol {{played by}} working {{children in the}} <b>workframe</b> of social reproduction strategies {{in the homes of}} poor people is the aim of this article. Emphasis is here placed in analysing practices and representations of children and their parents vis-avis said phenomena. It is most frequent that work done by children is carried out in family contexts. Due to this fact, we focus not only in the child, but also his family, making observations on work organizative process, and the place the work done by children has in the generation of both financial and non-financial income sources in the homes of the poor. Observations are also made in the significance associated with this practice {{as well as on the}} impact in family relations made by the fact that children also cooperate in home social reproduction. Taking into considerations these points, we decided to do the investigation with an approach of the qualitatative type. Field work was made in 2004 and 2006 in a neighborhood with structural poverty features, located in the urban peripheral area of La Plata. There, we selected a total of home units showing situations involving children work, and we worked in depth while making interviews with the working children and their parents...|$|E
