25|$|The film {{features}} two {{allusions to}} Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo. Like that film, it features recurring images of spirals, {{such as the}} 'Spirale' Cafe behind Manni's phone box and the spiral staircase down which Lola runs. In addition, the painting on {{the back wall of}} the casino of a woman's head seen from behind is based on a shot in Vertigo: Tykwer disliked the empty space on the wall behind the roulette table and commissioned production designer Alexander Manasse to paint a picture of Kim Novak as she appeared in Vertigo. Manasse could not remember <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> in the film; therefore, he decided to paint the famous shot of the back of her head. The painting took fifteen minutes to complete. The bed sheets in the red scenes also feature spiral designs which add to the allusion.|$|E
500|$|According to {{producer}} Don Hahn, Beaumont's Belle is an [...] "incredibly passive" [...] character, {{the personality}} of whom he likened to those of Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, as well as American actress and animal rights activist Doris Day, describing them as women who are [...] "capable, but filling a role that women might fill in the 1950s and 1960s.” The filmmakers painstakingly reworked Belle into a more three-dimensional character by providing her with goals and aspirations beyond romance and marriage, while expanding her passive role into that of a more inquisitive heroine. Determined to have Belle resemble [...] "an unusual Disney heroine," [...] Woolverton deliberately molded her into an independent character {{who is not a}} princess, enjoys books and has little interest in marriage, and worked closely with Ashman to create a proactive heroine [...] "who was a thinker and a reader and she wasn’t about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> and she wasn’t a victim." [...] Although Belle being well-read is mentioned in the original fairy tale, it is hardly important to its plot. Thus, Belle's passion for reading was vastly expanded upon, borrowing from both the Little Woman character Jo March and Woolverton's own love of reading to further demonstrate the character's intelligence and open mind. Both Woolverton and O'Hara encouraged the filmmakers to emphasize the intelligent and book-loving aspects of Belle's personality. However, at times the animators struggled to fulfill Woolverton's vision. Originally, Belle was depicted constantly crying throughout her imprisonment; Woolverton resented this, arguing that the character was {{much more likely to be}} either searching for an escape or simply [...] "be intrigued that she was living in an enchanted castle" [...] than crying. [...] "Once everybody realized she wasn’t going to be this typical Disney female, they would go to the extreme ... She became bitchy"; the screenwriter argued that Belle would be [...] "too smart" [...] to act this way. A few years older than The Little Mermaids Ariel, Belles' love of reading makes the character more worldly and mature than her predecessor. Belle is believed by Henn to be [...] "probably" [...] the oldest of Disney's princesses, at 20 years of age.|$|E

60|$|Never {{before on}} a Sunday {{afternoon}} had Miss Drewitt known {{the streets of}} Binchester to be so full of people. She hurried on with bent head, looking straight before her, trying to imagine <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> There {{was no sign of}} the captain, but as they turned into Dialstone Lane they both saw a huge, shaggy, grey head protruding from the small window of his bedroom. It disappeared with a suddenness almost startling.|$|E

60|$|In the {{afternoon}} Euchre set off with Duane, {{and soon they}} reached Bland's cabin. Duane remembered it as the one where {{he had seen the}} pretty woman watching him ride by.

In the windows and upon the porch were evidences of a woman's hand. Through the open door Duane caught a glimpse of bright Mexican blankets and rugs.|$|E
60|$|Thus mused Godfrey, {{trying to}} picture to himself what Isobel looked {{like when she}} had stood by his side on that long-past autumn eve, and only succeeded in remembering exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> when she was kissing a rose with a certain knight in armour in a square garden, since for some perverse reason it was this picture that {{remained}} so painfully clear to his mind. Then he drifted off into speculations upon the general mystery of things of a sort that were common with him, and in these became oblivious of all else.|$|E

6000|$|I don't know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> {{sitting in}} that blessed nightcap, on a log of wood, outside the hut or cabin upon our raft. She would have rather resembled a fortune-teller {{in one of the}} picture-books that {{used to be in the}} shop windows in my boyhood, except for her stateliness. But, Lord bless my heart, the dignity with which she sat and moped, with her head in that bundle of tatters, was like nothing else in the world! She was not on {{speaking}} terms with more than three of the ladies. Some of them had, what she called, [...] "taken precedence" [...] of her--in getting into, or out of, that miserable little shelter!--and others had not called to pay their respects, or something of that kind.

60|$|The {{door and}} {{windows of the}} little house were open that balmy afternoon, and the bees were buzzing among the flowers which Cynthia had planted {{on either side of}} the step. Bob went up the path, and caught a glimpse of her through the entry {{standing}} in the sitting room. She was, indeed, waiting for the Coniston stage, and she did not see him. Shall I destroy the mental image of the reader who has known her so long by trying to tell <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like?</b> Some heroines grow thin and worn by the troubles which they are forced to go through. Cynthia was not this kind of a heroine. She was neither tall nor short, and the dark blue gown which she wore set off (so Bob thought) the curves of her figure to perfection. Her face had become a little more grave--yes, and more noble; and the eyes and mouth had an indescribable, womanly sweetness.|$|E

60|$|The cat, having lured Jims {{to where}} he wanted him, sat down and began to lick his paws. He was quite willing to be caught now; but Jims had no longer any idea of {{catching}} him. He stood very still, looking at the lady. She did not see him then and Jims could only see her profile, which he thought very beautiful. She had wonderful ropes of blue-black hair wound around her head. She looked so sweet that Jims' heart beat. Then {{she lifted her head}} and turned her face and saw him. Jims felt something of a shock. She was not pretty after all. One side of her face was marked by a dreadful red scar. It quite spoilt her good looks, which Jims thought a great pity; but nothing could spoil the sweetness of her face or the loveliness of her peculiar soft, grey-blue eyes. Jims couldn't remember his mother and had no idea <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like,</b> but the thought came into his head that he would have liked her to have eyes like that. After the first moment Jims did not mind the scar at all.|$|E
6000|$|How {{could they}} {{say these things}} of Rachel? Had any one {{yesterday}} seriously believed that Rachel was dying? They had been engaged for four weeks. A fortnight ago she had been perfectly well. What could fourteen days have done to bring her from that state to this? To realise what they meant by saying {{that she had a}} chance of life was beyond him, knowing as he did that they were engaged. He turned, still enveloped in the same dreary mist, and walked towards the door. Suddenly he saw it all. He saw the room and the garden, and the trees moving in the air, they could go on without her; she could die. For the first time since she fell ill he remembered exactly <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> {{and the way in which}} they cared for each other. The immense happiness of feeling her close to him mingled with a more intense anxiety than he had felt yet. He could not let her die; he could not live without her. But after a momentary struggle, the curtain fell again, and he saw nothing and felt nothing clearly. It was all going on--going on still, in the same way as before. Save for a physical pain when his heart beat, and the fact that his fingers were icy cold, he did not realise that he was anxious about anything. Within his mind he seemed to feel nothing about Rachel or about any one or anything in the world. He went on giving orders, arranging with Mrs. Chailey, writing out lists, and every now and then he went upstairs and put something quietly on the table outside Rachel's door. That night Dr. Lesage seemed to be less sulky than usual. He stayed voluntarily for a few moments, and, addressing St. John and Terence equally, as if he did not remember which of them was engaged to the young lady, said, [...] "I consider that her condition to-night is very grave." ...|$|E

Mrs Anthony had on a dressing-gown of some grey stuff with red facings and a thick red cord round her waist. Her hair was down. She looked a child; a pale-faced child with big blue eyes and a red mouth a little open showing a glimmer of white teeth. The light fell strongly on her as she came up {{to the end of the}} table. A strange child though; she hardly affected one like a child, I remember. Do you know," [...] exclaimed Mr Powell, who clearly must have been, like many seamen, an industrious reader, [...] "do you know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> to me with those big eyes and something appealing in her whole expression. She looked like a forsaken elf. Captain Anthony had moved towards her to keep her away from my end of the table, where the tray was. I had never seen them so near to each other before, and it made a great contrast. It was wonderful, for, with his beard cut to a point, his swarthy, sunburnt complexion, thin nose and his lean head there was something African, something Moorish in Captain Anthony. His neck was bare; he had taken off his coat and collar and had drawn on his sleeping jacket in the time that he had been absent from the saloon. I seem to see him now. Mrs Anthony too. She looked from him to me--I suppose I looked guilty or frightened--and from me to him, trying to guess what there was between us two. Then she burst out with a `What has happened?' which seemed addressed to me. I mumbled `Nothing! Nothing, ma'am,' which she very likely did not hear.|$|E
