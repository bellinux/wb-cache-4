5|$|Highway403 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with Highway401 {{on the outskirts}} of Woodstock. The eastbound lanes split from eastbound Highway401, whereas the <b>westbound</b> lanes merge into <b>westbound</b> Highway401.|$|E
5|$|The bridges along <b>westbound</b> I-270 over Washington Street were {{replaced}} and {{finished in the}} late 1990s, costing $12million. By the end of 1998, the bridges over Clear Creek near the I-76 interchange were completed. In February 2000, a connection between <b>westbound</b> I-270 and <b>westbound</b> US36 was completed, as was access between I-76 <b>westbound</b> and I-270 <b>westbound.</b> The eastbound section between US36 and I-76, including new bridges over Washington Street and Clear Creek, was completed in March 2002 and totaled $8.5million. Three years later, a flyover ramp was constructed connecting I-25 southbound to I-270 eastbound. However, access between I-270 eastbound and I-76 <b>westbound</b> still does not exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{interchange}} with Highway403 also initially remained unmodified {{from the}} design constructed in 1969, with access between <b>westbound</b> Highway403 and eastbound on the parkway being {{provided by a}} loop ramp and access between <b>westbound</b> on the parkway and <b>westbound</b> Highway403 requiring a left turn at a traffic light.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, a {{construction}} project {{began on the}} interchange with US10 at the route's northern terminus. This construction consisted of bridge replacement over US10, {{as well as a}} new ramp connecting northbound M-47 to <b>westbound</b> US10 that, unlike the old ramp, does not conflict with <b>westbound</b> traffic exiting onto southbound M-47.|$|E
5|$|Kitsap Fast Ferries {{charges a}} $2 {{eastbound}} fare and $10 <b>westbound</b> fare, offering monthly passes and PugetPasses for frequent passengers; reduced fare passengers are charged a $1 eastbound fare and $5 <b>westbound</b> fare. The regional ORCA card is accepted to pay one-way fares, along with exact cash and tokens.|$|E
5|$|Most weekend SLE trains {{also run}} local <b>westbound</b> in the morning, then express in the afternoon, {{stopping}} only at Guilford and Westbrook between Old Saybrook and State Street. Eastbound service is reversed. This is because Branford, Madison, and Clinton only have platforms on the eastbound track, and thus switching {{is needed to}} platform a <b>westbound</b> train.|$|E
5|$|Northbound, two lanes {{from the}} DVP {{are joined by}} a third from the {{eastbound}} collectors of Highway401. These narrow to two lanes before merging with a single lane from <b>westbound</b> Highway401 immediately south of Sheppard Avenue. An additional two lanes from <b>westbound</b> Highway401 converge and form a separate carriageway with no access to Sheppard.|$|E
5|$|Reconstruction of the MD 3 {{divided highway}} and the Glen Burnie Bypass was a complex {{operation}} that involved many temporary openings, lane shifts, {{construction of new}} roadways, and reconstruction of existing roadways over several phases over several years. The first improvement was {{the reconstruction of the}} I-695 interchange between 1987 and 1991. The modern ramps from I-97 to <b>westbound</b> I-695 and from eastbound I-695 to I-97 were built, eastbound I-695's ramp over these two ramps was constructed, and the loop ramp from I-97 to <b>westbound</b> I-695 was removed. I-97 from its interchange with MD 648 to the new Beltway ramps was reconstructed to Interstate Highway standards and expanded to six lanes between May 1993 and August 1995. Part of the functionality of the loop ramp to <b>westbound</b> I-695 was restored in October 1995 when another ramp from the Harbor Tunnel Thruway approach to <b>westbound</b> I-695 was added to allow access from I-97 to MD 648.|$|E
5|$|Route 495 officially {{begins at}} the exit 16E off-ramp from the {{northbound}} lanes of the New Jersey Turnpike near the boundary of Secaucus and North Bergen. The main roadway heads east through North Bergen as a freeway with three lanes in the eastbound and <b>westbound</b> directions, maintained by the NJTA. The route has an interchange with Route 3, with access to eastbound Route 3 and U.S. Route 1/9 (US1/9) for traffic in the eastbound direction and to <b>westbound</b> Route 3 in the <b>westbound</b> direction. Past this interchange, Route 495 becomes a six-lane freeway maintained by NJDOT that intersects US1/9 at a partial interchange, with a <b>westbound</b> exit and eastbound entrance. Past US1/9, the freeway has an interchange with County Route 501 (CR501, John F. Kennedy Boulevard), which uses 30th Street and 31st Street as collector–distributor roads. East of this junction, Route 495 enters Union City and heads through developed residential areas, passing under numerous streets. There is an eastbound exit and <b>westbound</b> entrance for Park Avenue, which provides access to Weehawken and Hoboken, where Route 495 becomes maintained by the PANYNJ. It enters Weehawken and comes to a <b>westbound</b> exit and eastbound entrance for Park Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Southbound, {{the freeway}} {{is divided into}} two {{carriageway}}s, both of which provide access to the DVP. The outer carriageway also provides access from Sheppard and to Highway401, including the <b>westbound</b> express lanes, while the inner carriageway is intended for DVP-bound traffic. The HOV lane also provides access to <b>westbound</b> Highway401 via a dedicated tunnel, which passes beneath the other southbound lanes.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>westbound</b> mochila {{reached its}} destination, San Francisco, on April 14, at 1:00a.m.|$|E
5|$|Train {{frequencies}} vary {{throughout the}} day, but generally operate every 2–5 minutes eastbound, every 5–15 minutes <b>westbound</b> to Uxbridge (Rayners Lane {{in the early}} mornings), and every 2–7 minutes <b>westbound</b> to Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3 and 5 or via the Heathrow Terminal 4 loop. Since 16 December 2016, Acton Town is also served by Night Tube trains between Cockfosters and Heathrow Terminal 5.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} was closed it was almost {{immediately}} modified. The western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and <b>westbound</b> tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The siding is mainly used to reverse <b>westbound</b> trains, but {{could also be used}} for servicing trains. The siding tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E
5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with left-hand entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been completed, with the ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, the ramp from <b>westbound</b> I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to <b>westbound</b> I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both <b>westbound</b> and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from <b>westbound</b> I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will also add four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|E
5|$|At Main Street, Church Street splits {{into a pair}} of one-way {{streets and}} becomes North and South Division Street. The route follows South Division eastward for two blocks to an {{intersection}} with Ellicott Street located one block north of Coca-Cola Field. At the junction, which includes the northern terminus of NY16, NY5 turns northward, rejoining NY5 <b>westbound</b> one block later at North Division. The route continues on Ellicott for nine blocks to the unidirectional East Tupper Street, where NY5 <b>westbound</b> separates from the route once more. NY5 eastbound, however, continues north on Ellicott for an additional block to the one-way Goodell Street. NY5 heads west on Goodell for two blocks before turning north onto Main Street, rejoining NY5 <b>westbound</b> at the intersection.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a <b>westbound</b> ramp from Tower Road is in {{the design}} process with an opening {{expected}} in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Continuing east-{{southeast}}erly along Washtenaw Avenue, M-17 {{meets the}} southeast corner of the EMU campus at Oakwood Avenue. The highway follows the southern edge of campus to Cross Street, where the highway splits to follow a one-way pairing of streets. Eastbound M-17 continues along Washtenaw Avenue while <b>westbound</b> traffic follows Cross Street. Eastbound traffic turns southward at Hamilton Street for two blocks before turning east along Michigan Avenue, meeting <b>westbound</b> Bus. US12. The two highway designations merge, running concurrently through downtown Ypsilanti. The section of Michigan Avenue between Hamilton and Huron streets is actually a wrong-way concurrency because although it is a two-way boulevard, the eastbound direction is M-17 and the <b>westbound</b> direction is Bus. US 12. Both directions of traffic for both highways rejoin at Huron Street, as the <b>westbound</b> M-17 traffic uses Huron Street north to Cross Street and <b>westbound</b> Bus. US 12 turns south along Huron Street. Northeast of the Huron Street intersection is Riverside Park. Michigan Avenue forms the extreme southern park boundary just before it crosses the Huron River. At Ecorse Road, M-17 turns south in Ypsilanti Township through a residential area, separating from Bus. US12. Ecorse Road turns east four blocks north of I-94/US12 and runs parallel to the freeway. Past Harris Road, US12 turns northeasterly on a separate expressway. Where it meets Ecorse Road, US12 follows Ecorse Road, replacing M-17. This junction marks the eastern terminus of M-17 west of Willow Run Airport.|$|E
5|$|Exit {{numbers are}} absent along the Creek Turnpike until the 51st Street South interchange, which is {{numbered}} as exit 28. Exit numbers are posted north of this interchange, continuing until the highway's terminus (exits 33A–B). The Creek Turnpike's exit numbering {{is used for}} the final two exits on the <b>westbound</b> Will Rogers Turnpike—the westbound-only Pine Street exit (exit 35) and the <b>westbound</b> I-44 ramp (exit 34).|$|E
5|$|In May 1905, {{after two}} years of negotiations, American-Hawaiian signed a {{contract}} with the Tehuantepec National Railway of Mexico, abandoning the Straits of Magellan route in favor of the Tehuantepec Route. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for <b>westbound</b> cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico's narrowest point, on the railroad. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while <b>westbound</b> cargoes were more general in nature.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a marked {{increase}} in passengers travelling to and from Parson Street. In the 2002/03 financial year, less than 4,000 passengers used the station; and in 2005, only six eastbound and eight <b>westbound</b> trains called at Parson Street each day, with 14,293 passengers using the station during the 2005/06 financial year. Since then, service levels have increased to 21 <b>westbound</b> trains and 18 eastbound per weekday, and passenger levels have more than quadrupled, to 102,654 in 2013/14.|$|E
5|$|MD 410 {{begins at}} {{a pair of}} {{junctions}} with MD 355 (Wisconsin Avenue) and MD 187 (Old Georgetown Road) {{on either side of}} Bethesda Station on the Washington Metro's Red Line in downtown Bethesda. <b>Westbound</b> MD 410 ends at the intersection of two-way MD 355 and the southern terminus of MD 187, which begins one-way northbound along Old Georgetown Road. Traffic from the southbound direction of MD 187 follows Woodmont Avenue and Montgomery Lane to the start of eastbound MD 410 at the intersection of MD 355 and Montgomery Avenue. MD 410 heads east as a one-way pairEastWest Highway <b>westbound</b> and Montgomery Avenue eastboundto the eastern edge of downtown Bethesda, where the two directions converge east of Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. From that intersection, which includes a U-turn ramp from Montgomery Avenue to <b>westbound</b> EastWest Highway, the state highway continues east as four-lane undivided EastWest Highway and crosses over the Capital Crescent Trail.|$|E
5|$|NY376 follows Raymond Avenue {{for about}} a mile (1.6km) to the hamlet of Arlington. Here, it meets US44 and NY55, both of which follow a one-way couplet along Haight Street (eastbound) and Maple Street (<b>westbound)</b> through the city of Poughkeepsie. In between the two streets, NY376 intersects Main Street (CR114). The route ends upon {{intersecting}} <b>westbound</b> US44 and NY55, {{at which point the}} routing of NY376 becomes an unnumbered town road named Van Wagner Road.|$|E
5|$|Route 57 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with US22 in Lopatcong Township, {{where the only}} movements possible here between the two highways are <b>westbound</b> Route 57 to <b>westbound</b> US22 and vice versa. The road heads to the east on the Morris and Essex Turnpike, a two-lane undivided road. The route heads through a mix of businesses and farm fields, with Norfolk Southern's Washington Secondary rail line paralleling {{the road to the}} south. The railroad line eventually runs farther to the south of Route 57 before the route crosses County Route 519 (Uniontown Road).|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} chevrons {{remained}} intact in the <b>westbound</b> lanes in Whitby until 2012, though the signs stating their use had been removed.|$|E
5|$|State {{maintenance}} ends {{just after}} the Jefferson Boulevard interchange, and the road — now maintained {{by the city of}} West Sacramento as Tower Bridge Gateway — crosses the new Garden Street at an at-grade intersection. This intersection replaced a partial trumpet interchange, oriented towards West Capitol Avenue with a missing <b>westbound</b> entrance, in 2007. After Tower Bridge Gateway crosses under the Union Pacific Railroad line that used to cross the Tower Bridge, it approaches an intersection with 5th Street. It was formerly a ramp that entered the <b>westbound</b> lanes from the intersection of West Capitol Avenue and 5th Street, which completed the former interchange at Riske Lane. Two blocks to the east, Tower Bridge Gateway approaches its final intersection in West Sacramento with 3rd Street. A <b>westbound</b> offramp formerly lead to West Capitol Avenue and 3rd Street, with eastbound access to Broderick to the north and the formerly industrial area to the south, now containing Raley Field.|$|E
5|$|The Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway {{begins in}} {{the west end of}} Hamilton at a large turbine {{interchange}} with Highway403, which also provides access to Mohawk Road from <b>Westbound</b> Highway403 and TheLinc.|$|E
5|$|The Maugans Avenue diamond {{interchange}} {{may have a}} loop ramp added from <b>westbound</b> Maugans Avenue to southbound I-81.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvanian is the {{replacement}} of the former Keystone service between New York and Pittsburgh. Prior to Amtrak, the route was known as the Duquesne, named after Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh, and operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Duquesne had a long history, finally becoming a daily New YorkPittsburgh train on October 25, 1959, numbered 16 eastbound and 25 <b>westbound.</b> With the start of Amtrak operations on May 1, 1971, the Duquesne was renamed the Keystone and renumbered 42 <b>westbound</b> and 43 eastbound with the first Amtrak timetable on November 14, 1971. The Keystone was discontinued on April 30, 1972.|$|E
5|$|The commute from Zoloti Vorota to the line's {{terminus}} at Syrets takes approximately 9 {{minutes and}} 5 seconds, while it takes 30 minutes and 55 seconds to commute to the Chervony Khutir terminus. The train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 2–13 minutes in either direction. The morning's first eastbound train departs {{from the station}} at 05:48, while the <b>westbound</b> train departs at 06:01. The evening's last eastbound departs at 00:15, while the <b>westbound</b> train departs at 00:30.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of the Creek Turnpike {{has been recognized}} {{as important to the}} country's economy, defense, and mobility by its inclusion in the National Highway System. In 2011, the highest average annual daily traffic (AADT) count was 26,900 vehicles eastbound and 26,476 vehicles <b>westbound</b> between the Yale Avenue and Memorial Drive interchanges. The lowest AADT counts, 4,426 vehicles eastbound and 4,463 vehicles <b>westbound,</b> were recorded between the 11th Street interchange and the northeastern terminus. Law enforcement along the Creek Turnpike is provided by Oklahoma Highway Patrol Troop XE, a special troop assigned to the turnpike.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>Westbound</b> Pony Express trip left St. Joseph on April 3, 1860 {{and arrived}} {{ten days later}} in San Francisco, California, on April 14. These letters were sent under cover from the East to St. Joseph, and never {{directly}} entered the U.S. mail system. Today {{there is only a}} single letter known to exist from the inaugural <b>westbound</b> trip from St. Joseph, Missouri to San Francisco, California. The mailing depicted below is on a pre-stamped (embossed) envelope, first issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1855, used five years later here.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-speed}} freeway {{connection was}} completed {{with the opening}} of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932. The Pulaski Skyway ramp at its eastern terminus was eventually replaced with two long outside ramps that were dedicated for eastbound and <b>westbound</b> traffic from the cut in Bergen Hill just west of JohnF. Kennedy Boulevard. On September14, 1938, a direct ramp, known as the Tonnele Circle Viaduct, opened over Tonnele Circle to connect <b>westbound</b> traffic with southbound U.S.Route1/9 Truck, which quickly connects to Route7 that leads to Interstate280.|$|E
5|$|The light zone {{lies between}} Highway401 and the QEW Eastbound {{as well as}} east of Highway404 <b>Westbound</b> 14:30 - 19:00 weekdays.|$|E
5|$|The line {{continues}} west {{through the}} 53rd Street Tunnel under the East River into Manhattan. After Lexington Avenue–53rd Street, the <b>westbound</b> tracks {{rise above the}} eastbound tracks. A flying junction after Fifth Avenue/53rd Street, ties the <b>westbound</b> tracks into the southbound local tracks of the IND Sixth Avenue Line, which begin here as a merge of these connection tracks and the IND 63rd Street Line. At that junction, the Sixth Avenue express tracks turn west under 53rd Street, just {{to the south of}} the Queens Boulevard Line. The two lines share platforms at Seventh Avenue, but no connecting tracks are present.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in London fare zone 1. On the Central line {{the station is}} between Tottenham Court Road and Chancery Lane, and on the Piccadilly line, it is between Covent Garden and Russell Square. Holborn is the only {{interchange}} between these lines. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally Central line trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:53 to 00:30 <b>westbound</b> and 05:51 to 00:33 eastbound. Piccadilly line trains operate every 2–6 minutes from approximately 05:42 to 00:28 <b>westbound</b> and 05:54 to 00:38 northbound.|$|E
5|$|When Kentuckian began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for {{eastbound}} cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for <b>westbound</b> cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while <b>westbound</b> cargoes were more general in nature. Kentuckian sailed in this service {{but it is}} not clear from sources whether on the east or west side of North America.|$|E
