40|$|The paper {{presents}} the velocity distribution calculated by numerical method in axial relative motion of a viscous and incompressible fluid into the impeller of a horizontal axis wind turbine. Simulations {{are made for}} different airflow speeds: 0. 5, 1, 3, 4, 5 m/s. The relative vortex on the backside of the blade to the trailing edge, and the vortices increase with the wind speed can be observed from the numerical analysis. Also the translational deformation-the deflection of the wind turbine blades for different values of the wind velocities {{has been established in}} this paper. The numerical simulations are made for the following speed values: 5 m/s, 10 m/s and 20 m/s. ANSYS CFD – Fluent was used both to calculate the velocities spectrum and to establish the translational blades deformations. The analyzed <b>wind</b> <b>impeller</b> has small dimensions, a diameter of 2 m and four profiled blades. For this small impeller the translational deformation increases with the wind velocity from 83 to 142 mm. For high wind velocities and large–scale wind turbine impellers, these translational deformations are about several meters, reason to /shut-down the impellers to wind velocities exceeding 25 m/s...|$|E

In {{order to}} ensure maximum {{effectiveness}} of wind turbines, the cabin must be accurate to the wind, only <b>wind</b> turbine <b>impeller</b> in the normal direction and the wind direction is agreed upon, {{to ensure that the}} wind turbine power absorption maximum, to ensure the normal operation of fan safety and full use of wind resources. Therefore, the wind vane and anemometer in the wind turbine system plays an important role, this study focused on the gold 1. 5 MW wind turbine with wind vane and anemometer common fault. ...|$|R
40|$|Keywords:Wind shear,Horizontal axis wind turbine, Aerodynamic performance, Three {{dimensional}} model Abstract: In {{order to}} accurately analysis the aerodynamic characteristic variations of wind turbines under shear, {{the influence of}} axial and shear on the aerodynamic characteristic of a horizontal-axis wind turbine is simulated in this paper by using a sliding grid method based on FlowVision. By using the TJÆREBORG wind turbine {{as the object of}} study, a three-dimensional model of a uniform wind flow can be created. The CFD calculation results, the experimental results and the Bladed results can be used to confirm the reliability of the model. In order to investigate the effect of wind shear with regard to three-dimensional unsteady flow characteristics and a three-dimensional flow field in a <b>wind</b> turbine <b>impeller,</b> an analysis of wheel wind speed of 11 m/s and an investigation of the influence of wind shear on turbine performance are carried out...|$|R
