5|$|You's was {{the first}} and only {{official}} execution ever to take place in Pacific County. A month after his arrest, a new act of the Washington State Legislature took effect which required executions for any future crimes to be carried out at the Washington State Penitentiary in <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla.</b>|$|E
5|$|The other {{speakers}} included Xerces Society senior conservation biologist Rich Hatfield, Intel {{educator and}} innovation manager Shashi Jain, and Gabe Sheoships, {{a citizen of}} the Cayuse and <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> tribes of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, who serves as education director for Friends of Tryon Creek, and is an adjunct faculty member at Portland State University.|$|E
5|$|The type {{locality}} for the Touchet Formation is {{the confluence}} of the Touchet River with the <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> River, originally noted by Richard Foster Flint in 1938. Numerous other exposures were subsequently identified throughout the basins of the former Lake Lewis and Lake Condon. Touchet-equivalent slackwater deposits are also present in the Willamette Valley near Portland (former Lake Allison).|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, German {{settlers}} {{from the}} Barossa Valley travelled upstream {{to settle in}} the eastern Riverina. Because of their religious distinctiveness as Lutherans, they preferred to form clustered German settlements. In 1867 and 1868 several land parcels were taken up in the Jindera area. 56 German farmers, in 1869, took six weeks to travel six hundred miles in covered wagons to establish the town of <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla.</b>|$|E
5|$|Also in 1847, Palmer {{traveled}} {{with his family}} to Oregon as captain of that year's major wagon train. While passing through the <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> Valley he met Marcus and Narcissa Whitman at their mission shortly before their deaths in the Whitman massacre—the event that precipitated the Cayuse War. Perhaps motivated by meeting the Whitmans, Palmer later returned to serve as a peace commissioner to tribes considering joining the Cayuse. At the outset of the war he was appointed as commissary-general of the Provisional Government’s militia forces.|$|E
5|$|In the Oregon Senate, Cornelius {{continued}} as a Republican representing Washington County {{and several other}} counties through the 1874 legislature. His service was interrupted by the American Civil War during 1862 session, when he was authorized by President Abraham Lincoln to raise a regiment of cavalry for federal service. He was chosen as colonel of the troops and they deployed to a military post at <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla,</b> Washington, where he assumed command. He resigned {{during the summer of}} 1862 and returned home.|$|E
5|$|Robert Bigham Brode {{was born}} in <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla,</b> Washington, on June 12, 1900, the son of Howard S. Brode, a {{professor}} of biology at Whitman College, and his wife Martha Catherine née Bigham. He was the second of a set of quadruplets, being born between his brothers Wallace and Malcolm, the fourth child died within weeks of being born. They also had an older brother, James Stanley. All four attended Whitman College, and went on to earn doctorates and have distinguished careers as scientists and academics.|$|E
5|$|The Touchet {{beds are}} one element {{in a chain}} of {{evidence}} which helped identify and define the progression of the Missoula Floods, which occurred around 16,450 to 13,750 yearsBCE. During the floods, flow through the Wallula Gap was slow enough such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis. Lake Lewis back-flooded up the Yakima, <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla,</b> Touchet and Tucannon River Valleys. In these relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters deposited the suspended materials eroded from the scabland regions north of Lake Lewis, and redeposited them in pronounced layers before receding.|$|E
5|$|US730 {{continues}} {{north from}} Oregon along Lake Wallula and around Clover Hill, reaching Wallula Junction in <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> County. The highway intersects its spur route and turns east towards its eastern terminus at US12 {{south of the}} community of Wallula. Every year, WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume, expressed in terms of AADT. In 2012, WSDOT calculated that the Washington section of US730 served between 1,500 and 2,400 vehicles per day.|$|E
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon is {{the most}} widely planted red grape variety in Washington state {{according}} to the Washington State Wine Commission. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance to the cold winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic. Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have seen some success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> Valley {{and parts of the}} Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{was playing}} semi-professional {{baseball}} in Clarinda, Iowa when in June 1976 {{he was selected}} in the seventh round of the amateur entry draft by the Detroit Tigers. The parties could not agree on a contract; Smith wanted a $10,000 ($ today) signing bonus, while the Tigers offered $8,500 ($ today). Smith returned to Cal Poly for his senior year, then in the 1977 draft was selected in the fourth round by the San Diego Padres, ultimately agreeing to a contract that included a $5,000 signing bonus ($ today). Smith spent his first year of professional baseball during 1977 with the Class A <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> Padres of the Northwest League.|$|E
5|$|The Touchet Formation was {{originally}} identified at {{the confluence of}} the Touchet River with the <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> River. It is also found at some distance up the Touchet River Valley. The number of layers observed decreases as one progresses up-valley, indicating that the floodwater lakes varied in depth and distance upstream from the various flood dams. Clastic dike intrusions are observed in some locations penetrating the layers vertically; the dikes are infilled with uniform-size fine-grained materials and are indications that the period between floods was long enough that the deposits dried, forming vertical cracks and allowing wind-blown eroded materials to infill the cracks.|$|E
5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla,</b> Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or bedding in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route730 (US730) is an east–west United States Highway, {{of which}} all but 6.08miles of its 41.78miles (9.78 of 67.24km) {{are within the}} state of Oregon. The highway starts in rural Morrow County in Eastern Oregon at an {{interchange}} with Interstate84 (I-84) and US30, located east {{of the city of}} Boardman. US730 travels east along the Columbia River as a continuation of Columbia River Highway No. 2 into Umatilla County, intersecting I-82 and US395 in the city of Umatilla. US730 and US395 form a short concurrency within the city before the highways part, with US730 continuing northeast into Washington. The highway travels through rural <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> County and ends at an intersection with US12 south of Wallula.|$|E
5|$|In 1847 the {{legislature}} met from December 7 to 28 at the Methodist Church in Oregon City. On {{the second day}} of this meeting at Main and Seventh streets, news of the Whitman massacre, which occurred on November 29, 1847, was delivered to {{the legislature}} by Governor Abernethy. This event would dominate the remainder of the session as the Provisional Government worked with the Hudson's Bay Company to send an army east to <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla.</b> Forty-two men under the command of Henry A. G. Lee were sent immediately to The Dalles in what {{was the beginning of the}} Cayuse War. A large force under the command of Cornelius Gilliam was then organized and sent to punish those responsible for the massacre. On December 23, the group created Benton District out of the southern section of Polk District, naming the new district for Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton. In the legislature, Robert Newell was chosen as the speaker of the group with Calvin W. Cook as clerk.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1853, Ezra and Oliver Meeker {{received}} a three-month-old letter from their father, stating {{that he and}} other family members wanted to emigrate, and would do so if Oliver Meeker could return to assist them. They immediately responded that Oliver would return to Indiana by early the following year, and put their plans on hold to prepare for and finance his journey by steamship and rail. In August 1854, Ezra Meeker received word that his relatives were en route, but were delayed and short on provisions. He quickly went to their aid, intending to guide them through the Naches Pass into the Puget Sound area. When he found his family's party close to the first Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> (near Richland, Washington), he learned that his mother and a younger brother had died along the Trail. He guided the survivors through the pass and to his claim on McNeil Island.|$|E
5|$|There are, loosely speaking, {{three main}} wine {{producing}} regions {{with a major}} presence {{in the state of}} Oregon, as defined by non-overlapping American Viticultural Areas. Two of them—the Willamette Valley AVA and the Southern Oregon AVA—are wholly contained within Oregon; a third, the Columbia Gorge AVA straddles the Columbia River and includes territory in both Oregon and Washington; however, this AVA is considered to be an Oregon AVA. Portions of the <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> Valley AVA, an area primarily in Washington (along with the Columbia Valley AVA, which contains it), descend into Oregon in the Milton-Freewater area. The Southern Oregon AVA was recently created as the union of two Southern Oregon winegrowing regions long considered distinct, the Rogue Valley and the Umpqua Valley. Several other smaller AVAs are found within some of these larger regions. The Snake River Valley AVA, which straddles Oregon's border with Idaho along the Snake River, is the first AVA to include a part of Eastern Oregon.|$|E
25|$|The Nez Perce {{were one}} of the tribal nations at the <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> Council (1855) (along with the Cayuse, Umatilla, <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla,</b> and Yakama), which signed the Treaty of <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{were the}} <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> people which lived along the <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> River {{and along the}} {{confluence}} of the Snake and Columbia River rivers, today they are enrolled in the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation.|$|E

25|$|It {{was common}} {{practice}} to use existing Indian trails to develop military roads, and only make necessary improvements {{for the movement}} of artillery or supply trains. Brevet Major Lugenbeel followed the long established Hudson's Bay Company brigade trail from the Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> area to Fort Colvile (Hudson's Bay Company), but {{had to leave the}} trail at current Orin-Rice Road, two miles south of Colville, when the southernmost land claims of the Hudson's Bay Company started. Washington Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens and the U. S. Army were ordered by the United States Department of State to honor land ownership claims by the Hudson's Bay Company. The road became the Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> Fort Colville Military Road. Lugenbeel's command arrived from Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> on June 20, 1859.|$|E

25|$|Ladd {{had a brief}} timeout for {{military}} service in the United States Army Air Forces First Motion Picture Unit. Ladd was initially classified 4-F unfit {{for military}} service because of stomach problems, but began his military service in January 1943. He was posted to the <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> Army Air Base at <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla,</b> Washington, attaining the rank of Corporal. He attended the Oscars in March 1943 and in September appeared in a trailer promoting a war loan drive, Letter from a Friend.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of gold {{on the upper}} Columbia River drainage {{in the summer of}} 1855 brought a large influx of miners into the area, trespassing on the land that was promised (during the <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> Council (1855)) to many of the tribes in the area, including the Yakima. This violation angered the tribes who felt that the promises that had been made to them by the United States government were not being honored. This led to a retaliation through the murder of the Indian agent for that area, thereby inciting the Yakima War. The local tribes were defeated, and Stevens held a peace council at Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> in September 1856 that brought an end to the Yakima War.|$|E
25|$|He {{attended}} Whitman College in <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla,</b> Washington, {{for three}} years before leaving {{to serve in the}} U.S. military during World War II. Following the war, Fearey graduated from the University of Washington in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in music.|$|E
25|$|In 1834, The Dalles Methodist Mission {{was founded}} by Reverend Jason Lee just east of Mount Hood on the Columbia River. In 1836, Henry H. Spalding and Marcus Whitman {{traveled}} west to establish the Whitman Mission near modern-day <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla,</b> Washington. The party included the wives of the two men, Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Hart Spalding, who became the first European-American women to cross the Rocky Mountains. En route, the party accompanied American fur traders going to the 1836 rendezvous on the Green River in Wyoming and then joined Hudson's Bay Company fur traders traveling west to Fort Nez Perce (also called Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla).</b> The group {{was the first to}} travel in wagons all the way to Fort Hall, where the wagons were abandoned at the urging of their guides. They used pack animals {{for the rest of the}} trip to Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> and then floated by boat to Fort Vancouver to get supplies before returning to start their missions. Other missionaries, mostly husband and wife teams using wagon and pack trains, established missions in the Willamette Valley, as well as various locations in the future states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.|$|E
25|$|Mullan {{had long}} {{planned to use}} his Army {{connections}} {{as a means of}} making money. He had purchased property and owned businesses in <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla,</b> and intended to return there to settle down and use his Army experiences in earning a fortune.|$|E
25|$|On August 5, 1860, Mullan {{returned}} west to Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla,</b> making {{repairs to}} the Mullan Road as he went. Following behind came Major Blake and his command. Mullan reached the Coeur d'Alene Mission about September 21, and Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> on October 8. Mullan found orders awaiting {{him at the}} fort, telling him to remain there during the winter to compile a report. Mullan remained at the fort only until January 1861, when he and Gustav Sohon traveled down Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, took the steamer Pacific to San Francisco, and booked passage on the Butterfield Overland Mail (a stagecoach) overland to St. Louis. The stage trip took 22 days. It's unclear if they arrived in Washington on February 13 or February 25.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} when Mullan reached Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla.</b> Mullan himself claims {{he did so}} in early April, but other {{evidence}} indicates he arrived on April 22. The Corps of Topographical Engineers had approved of 15 months of work at a budget of $85,000.|$|E
25|$|In September 1840, Robert Newell, Joseph L. Meek, {{and their}} {{families}} reached Fort <b>Walla</b> <b>Walla</b> with three wagons that they had driven from Fort Hall. Their wagons {{were the first to}} reach the Columbia River over land, and they opened the final leg of Oregon Trail to wagon traffic.|$|E
