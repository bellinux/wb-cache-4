5|$|East of Rochester, NY31 {{continued}} eastward to Jordan, {{utilizing the}} Rochester–Pittsford portion of legislative Route14, the Perinton–Jordan segment of Route20, and its current alignment between Pittsford and Perinton. From Weedsport to Jordan, NY31 used {{a slightly different}} routing. It initially exited the village on Clinton Road and followed that road to Jordan, where NY31 turned north and followed modern NY317 and NY31 north and east to modern CR84. NY31 turned north here, using <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> Old Route31, current NY31, and Downer Street to reach Baldwinsville. Within the village, NY31 followed Downer Street and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> NY48 along Syracuse Street between Downer and Genesee Streets. Outside of Baldwinsville, NY31 remained on its current routing to Cicero, where it followed a more northerly alignment along Lakeshore Road. It rejoined its modern alignment near the eastern town line, and followed it east to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> NY316 in Lenox. From here, NY31 went southeastward to NY5 in Oneida by way of modern NY316 and NY46.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route14, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} extended from Corning to Rochester via South Bristol and Pittsford. The majority of Route14 south of Pittsford was routed on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> NY64; however, {{in the vicinity}} of Bloomfield, Route14 broke from modern NY64 and used what later became NY20C to access Holcomb. At the same time, the portion of current NY64 that overlaps with US20 and NY5 was included in Route6, a cross-state highway connecting Albany to Buffalo. On March1, 1921, Route14 was altered to bypass Holcomb to the south on <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> NY64.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{established}} a statewide legislative route system that initially consisted of 37 unsigned routes. Much of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> NY31 west of Jordan {{became part of}} one of three routes, namely Route14, Route20, and Route30. Route30 began at the Niagara Falls city line (delimited by modern NY61) and followed current NY31 east to Sanborn, where it turned north onto modern NY429. The route followed current NY429 to Ridge Road in Porter, at which point it turned to follow Ridge Road eastward to <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> NY63 in Ridgeway. Route30 went south here, utilizing modern NY63 between Ridgeway and Medina. It rejoined <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> NY31 in the latter location and proceeded eastward on roughly current NY31 to the Rochester city line. In the vicinity of Brockport, however, Route30 was routed on West Avenue and modern NY19 instead. From the southeastern city line to NY96 in the village of Pittsford, Monroe Avenue (modern NY31) was part of Route14, which turned south onto South Main Street in the center of Pittsford. Lastly, the segment <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> NY31 between current NY31F and NY350 in the village of Macedon and NY317 in Jordan was part of Route20.|$|E
