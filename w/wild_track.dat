They were horses in the lee of a clump of trees beyond, above her. She pursued her way with bent head. She did not want to lift her face to them. She did not want to know they were there. She went on in the <b>wild</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E

I have always faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the <b>wild</b> <b>track</b> of the glen, side by side with him.|$|E

50|$|In 1955, Mitchell {{was sent}} on a {{training}} attachment to Lime Grove, {{where he worked}} on his first television documentary, a 15-minute contribution to an edition of the pioneering current affairs Special Enquiry, about teenagers. His idea was to combine extracts from tape-recordings {{as the basis of}} the film's soundtrack (a style known as <b>wild</b> <b>track),</b> for which he then found accompanying non-synchronous images. This was the basis of 'the Mitchell style', which he would refine during the rest of his work for the BBC. The 'Teenagers' film was enthusiastically received (not least by documentary filmmaker Karel Reisz) for its technical experimentation and impressionist portraiture of everyday life. This led to Mitchell's first television feature for the BBC in 1957, In Prison. This was the first film to be shot inside a prison in Britain - Manchester's Strangeways - during the making of which Mitchell spent a month in a prison cell.|$|E

50|$|Between December 1992 and January 1995, a {{collaborative}} project between the Governments of India and Russia, International Crane Foundation and Wild Bird Society of Japan {{was set up}} to save the Siberian crane. The project focused on releasing captivity bred cranes into the <b>wild,</b> <b>tracking</b> migratory routes of common cranes, and building up the resident crane population in the park. Although the project did not yield the desired results, the successful survival of introduced cranes in the park has given sufficient hope to develop a viable resident population in the future.|$|R

Finding the 1962 edition of 'Who's Who in Popular Music' in a waste basket, he conceived of relating music trivia to the audience between the songs, which led eight years later {{to the development of the}} successful [...] "American Top 40" [...] show format upon which he built his later career. A decade later, KNEW was the show's Bay Area affiliate, so Casey was again heard on [...] "Channel 91".|$|R
