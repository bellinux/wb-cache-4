She can teach us how to elect a President in a sane way; and also how to do it without throwing the country into earthquakes and convulsions that cripple and embarrass business, stir up party hatred in the hearts of men, and make peaceful people wish the term extended to thirty years. France can teach us--but enough of that part of the question. And what else can France teach us? She can teach us all the fine arts--and does. She throws open her hospitable art academies, and says to us, [...] "Come"--and we come, troops and troops of our young and gifted; and she sets over us the ablest masters in the world and bearing the greatest names; and she, teaches us all that we are capable of learning, and persuades us and encourages us with prizes and honors, much as if we were somehow children of her own; and when this noble education is finished and we are ready to carry it home and spread its gracious ministries abroad over our nation, and we come with homage and gratitude and ask France for the bill--there is nothing to pay.

30|$|This {{exploratory}} study examines what young {{men want to}} achieve through their clothing choices {{and what they want}} to avoid. We used an interview method to collect data. Researchers typically depend on an in-depth interview strategy when their primary strategy is capturing the deep meaning of individual experiences (Marshall and Rossman 2011). Thus, we chose to carry out one-on-one in-depth interviews in order to gain a deeper understanding of consumer motivations (Brannon 2010). The respondents were college men (n =  15) who were interviewed by three master graduate students about their clothing choices (e.g., “Describe the clothing you wear most often and why”), why and how they selected clothing to express their identities (e.g., “Does your clothing express your identity? If yes, how? If no, why?”), and how they avoided certain identities through their clothing choices (e.g., “Do you avoid certain clothing? If yes, what are some examples? And <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> to avoid them?”). Respondents were also asked demographic questions, such as age, parents’ income, major, marital status, country of origin, and ethnic group.|$|R

I know that Maheswara(Shiva) you want to marry, a half naked fellow, looks ugly, no one for sure knows his 'kula' and 'gotra', and how could you ever be happy with such a nomad. Listening to the suggestion of the batu brahman she got angry, and told Oh! Brahmana, ever after reading so much shastras you are still ignorant about Shiva, how foolish you are? I am not bothered whether he is old or young, ugly or handsome I am not marring him of his handsomeness, I am attracted towards him for his knowledge. I will not accept any one else other than him in marriage. Satisfied with all his test, Shiva appeared in his divine self. On the Jyeshta Shukla paksha Panchami they got married.|$|R

50|$|Many women choose home birth because {{delivering}} {{a baby in}} familiar surroundings is important to them. Others choose home birth because they dislike a hospital or birthing center environment, do not like a medically centered birthing experience, are concerned about exposing the infant to hospital-borne pathogens, or dislike the presence of strangers at the birth. Others prefer home birth because they feel it is more natural and less stressful. In {{a study published in}} the Journal of Midwifery and Women's Health, women were asked, <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> a home birth? The top five reasons given were safety, avoidance of unnecessary medical interventions common in hospital births, previous negative hospital experiences, more control, and a comfortable and familiar environment. One study found that women experience pain inherent in birth differently, and less negatively, in a home setting. In developing countries, where women may not be able to afford medical care or it may not be accessible to them, a home birth may be the only option available, and the woman may or may not be assisted by a professional attendant of any kind. Some women may not be able to have a safe birth at home, even with highly trained midwives. There are some medical conditions that can prevent a woman from qualifying for a home birth. These often include heart disease, renal disease, diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa, placenta abruption, antepartum hemorrhage after 20 weeks gestation, and active genital herpes. Prior cesarean deliveries can sometimes prevent a woman from qualifying for a home birth, though not always. It is important that a woman and her health care provider discuss the individual health risks prior to planning a home birth.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2005. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 46 - 47). iii, 47 leaves, bound 29 cmThe University of Hawai'i at Manoa Dance Program {{is producing}} dancers {{that are making}} a difference in the professional world of dance on O'ahu and the mainland. I selected five alumni/ae pursuing careers in dance who had completed their MFA degrees at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (hereafter UHM). I interviewed each of them over the telephone and via e-mail using a list of questions I created to question how their degrees relate to the positions they now hold. Each dancer graduated with an MFA degree in the past twenty years and continued to either dance professionally, teach at an educational institute, or both. I also interviewed four current MFA students in the Dance Program and asked them to share their personal aspirations and their hopes for the UHM Dance Program. Additionally, I selected three local modern dance companies that have ties to UHM through their dancers. I asked each Artistic Director how the University of Hawai'i Dance Program affects their company. My goal was to find how UHM is affecting graduate alumni/ae, present MFA candidates, and Artistic Directors of local companies. In what way did each dancer take what they learned at UHM and apply it to their everyday professional and personal lives? I am pursuing my MA degree at the University of Hawai'i. I started studying modern dance during my undergraduate time at UHM from 2000 - 2001, and obtained a minor in dance. I fell in love with modern dance, and decided to pursue a graduate degree. This research is relevant and interesting to me as it shows how a UHM dance degree affects other's in their lives, both personal and professional. I wanted to find how these alumni/ae were able to incorporate their passion for dance into a career, and how the university helped to contribute to the vitality of dance in the O'ahu community and on the mainland. In interviews I posed the same questions for each alumni/ae and current dancer at UHM. These questions were: Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> study dance before attending UHM? Did you perform professionally? Which dance styles <b>do</b> <b>you</b> associate the most with? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>chose</b> UHM for your MFA? When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> attend UHM? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> feel UHM made a positive influence on you? Who were your greatest influences at UHM? Did UHM push you further than expected or hoped on a physical or mental level? Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> teach dance? Where have you taught since graduating from UHM? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> teach your students what you learned from UHM? How does UHM compare to the school you are employed by? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> reflect back on your degree and time spent at UHM and how? Looking back, would you go to UHM and do it allover again? Would you recommend UHM to others? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think are UHM's strengths and weaknesses? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think local modern dance can survive on O'ahu without UHM? And I asked each subject to list anything they would like to add that I might have missed. My purpose was to find out if these dancers applied what they learned while obtaining their UHM degree in their current career. I wondered what the current degree candidates were hoping to achieve by completing their MFA degree from UHM. At the beginning of my interview process with the alumni/ae, I did not know if they used their UHM schooling or not. Were these former UHM dancers applying specific lessons gained during their degree pursuits? To what extent do they credit UHM for where they are with dance today? While wanting to discover if the UHM Dance Program is contributing to the vitality of local dance, I wanted to find if it contributes to the evolution of this artistic discipline locally. I believe my role in the process of interviewing the heads of current O'ahu dance companies is to be a facilitator of dialogue about dance and find insights for current and future students about the long term contributions of the UHM Dance Program for its graduates' careers in the local community and beyond as a performer and choreographer. A larger inferred question that my research analyzes is: Can local modern dance survive without the university...|$|R

In an interview with Melody Maker in 1997, Courtney Love revealed the significance of the choice of artwork included in the album: [...] Interviewer: [...] "The artwork shows a dress you wore in the early nineties as a sort of museum piece.

She was Henry VIII's wife who had her head chopped off. When I was little, I used to see these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just the idea of a woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and what happens if you take out the clip." ...|$|E
