50|$|Mary River Cod {{are subject}} to the usual story of woe. Incredibly {{abundant}} at the time of first European settlement, they were grossly overfished with nets, lines and explosives by the early European settlers and, as with other Maccullochella cods, were even used as pig feed. This overfishing, combined with the massive siltation of their habitats by land-clearing, destruction of riparian vegetation and cattle trampling river banks, and dams and <b>weirs</b> <b>blocking</b> migration, rapidly caught up with this large, slow-growing, long-lived Maccullochella cod species, as it has with all its close relatives.|$|R
5000|$|Wild {{populations have}} {{declined}} significantly, {{and a number}} of populations lost in upper reaches of rivers, due to dams and <b>weirs</b> <b>blocking</b> migration, mitigating floods and freshes, regulating flows, and releasing unnaturally cold water ("thermal pollution"), all of which interfere with migration, spawning, and recruitment. They are listed under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and classified as [...] "Vulnerable" [...] for management purposes. [...] Golden perch are extremely migratory and migration appears to have been important in maintaining populations over the length of rivers, particularly the upper reaches.|$|R
40|$|Low-environment impact {{structures}} {{have the}} advantage to conjugate both hydraulic functioning and environmental care. In particular, these structure typologies are widely used for river restoration both to control sediment transport and to dissipate flow energy. In the present paper, rock grade control structures, stepped gabion <b>weirs,</b> <b>block</b> ramps, and cross-vane weirs are analyzed and compared. Both similitudes and differences in terms of scour characteristics and dissipative efficiency are highlighted. The comparison shows that block ramps are the most efficient structures among those tested. Useful practical relationships are proposed in order to estimate both scour characteristics downstream of each structures and energy dissipation...|$|R
50|$|A {{major effort}} of the FOAL project has been to lower a <b>weir</b> that <b>blocked</b> {{upstream}} fish migration at Ty Nant Ddu, Pontypool. In 2008, salmon were spotted here. Additionally, similar efforts were made at the weir located near Cwmavon. To further improve fish stocks (especially salmonid) 'V' weirs were constructed to trap gravel and create suitable spawning habitats.|$|R
50|$|Today Australian {{grayling}} {{are threatened}} {{by a number of}} things. Dams and <b>weirs</b> <b>block</b> migration and also block floods and reduce base flows, both of which are important for habitat maintenance and for spawning and movement of grayling larvae and juveniles to and from the sea. Irresponsible forestry and farming practices degrade and fragment river environments through siltation and other effects. Exotic trout species threaten grayling through predation and competition. Scientific studies have shown native fish species similar in habitat and lifestyle such as spotted galaxias are severely depressed in number in rivers inhabited by exotic trout species (Ault & White, 1994), and are forced into sub-optimal feeding locations, feeding times and diets by aggressive competition from exotic trout species (McDowall, 2006). A chronic lack of exotic-trout-free habitat reserved for galaxias species and other native fish species in south-eastern Australia generally is a major concern.|$|R
5000|$|The Queanbeyan River was renowned as a {{beautiful}} river abounding in native Murray Cod, which once {{extended to the}} vicinity of Googong Dam, and native Macquarie perch, which extended to at least the headwaters of Googong Dam. Due to this abundance of native fish, the Queanbeyan River, along with the Molonglo River, was often known as the [...] "Fish River" [...] {{in the early days}} of settlement. Sometimes the Queanbeyan River was further distinguished by being called the [...] "South Fish River". On more than one occasion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries floods deposited live Murray Cod in the main streets of Queanbeyan. A variety of ills including introduction of exotic fish such as trout, overfishing, willow encroachment, siltation, and <b>weirs</b> <b>blocking</b> migration saw native fish populations in the Queanbeyan River close to extinction by the time Googong Dam was built.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: As <b>weirs</b> <b>block</b> the {{longitudinal}} connectivity of stream, fishway is normally installed to overcome blockage of migration and movement of aquatic organisms. Recently, three large weirs with fishways were constructed for {{efficient use of}} water in the Geum River {{which is one of the}} major rivers in South Korea. In this study, we monitored two types of fishway, Ice-harbor and complex type, installed at both ends of the Gongju weir in the Geum River using traps and PIT telemetry for three years (2012 – 2014). The complex type fishway consists of ice-harbor type and nature-like type fishway. The results showed that each species used fishway at different time, and it was related with ecological characteristics of each species. Attraction rate was higher at the Ice-Harbor type (8. 9 %) than complex type (4. 2 %). Passing rate was also higher at Ice- Harbor type (45. 1 %) than complex type (10. 8 %). Higher attraction rate of the iceharbor type may relate with large amount of water release from hydropower generator just beside of the Ice-harbor type. There were quite big difference between the passing rate of the Ice-habor type and complex type. The complex type fishway is three times longer than Ice-Harbor type, and this could be one of the factors that affect passing rate...|$|R
50|$|Exeter Quay, {{also known}} as Exeter Quayside, {{is a part of}} the city of Exeter next to the River Exe and the Exeter Ship Canal. It was first used as a port in prehistoric times when a {{sandstone}} ledge was used to unload the ships of overseas traders. However, by 1381 the Countess <b>Weir</b> had <b>blocked</b> the river to shipping. A canal was completed in 1566 to provide access for ships. Over time the number of ships using the quayside increased and so the quay was expanded in the late 17th century. Further expansion occurred in 1830 when a new canal basin was dug. However, in 1840 the railways reached Exeter and the shipping began to decline. The quayside no longer has any shipping but is now mostly used for leisure.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} the SPH (Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics) numerical method adapted to complex rheology and free surface flow. It {{has been developed}} to simulate the local effect of a simple obstacle on a granular flow. We have introduced this specific rheology to the classical formalism of the method and thanks to experimental devices, {{we were able to}} validate the results. Two viscosity values have been simultaneously computed to simulate "plugs" and "dead zone" with the same code. First, some experiments have been done on a simple inclined slope to show the accuracy of the numerical results. We have fixed the mass flow rate to see the variations of the flow depth according to the channel slope. Then we put a <b>weir</b> to <b>block</b> the flow and we analysed the dependence between the obstacle height and the length of influence upstream from the obstacle. After having shown that numerical results were consistent, we have studied speed profiles and pressure impact on the structure. Also results with any topography will be presented. This will have a great interest to study real flow over natural topography while using the model for decision help...|$|R

40|$|Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have {{experienced}} declines in numbers throughout their range due to historical overharvesting and more recent habitat degradation. Fragmentation and disruption caused by large dams on the rivers they inhabit have greatly impacted this species. Lake Sturgeon in Alberta {{are part of}} an Endangered population as defined by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. The goal {{of this study was to}} gather more information on the movement of Lake Sturgeon in the South Saskatchewan River in Alberta and Saskatchewan, to aid conservation. A sample of 123 Lake Sturgeon was tracked in this area for 24. 5 months using hydroacoustic telemetry, and a habitat survey gathered depth and substrate data for the study area. Lake Sturgeon had large ranges of movement, and individuals moved the second-highest range on record for this species. Movement varied by season, and adult Lake Sturgeon moved at higher rates and used greater reaches of the river than juveniles. Two possible spawning sites and three overwintering sites were identified, areas which should be left undisturbed by development. The large extent of movement observed in the study area emphasizes the need to leave the South Saskatchewan River system relatively unrestricted by dams and <b>weirs,</b> as <b>blocking</b> movement may have negative impacts on this population of Lake Sturgeon...|$|R
40|$|Present {{study is}} an effort to assess the {{composite}} effect of limestone aggregate and blast furnace slag on the mechanical characteristics of normal and high weight concrete at various structural units (barrage girders, main <b>weir</b> and <b>block</b> apron) of New Khanki Barrage Project, Punjab. Mix designs for different concrete classes falling under the domain of high and normal weight concrete were prepared after aggregate quality testing. On attaining satisfactory results of quality testing nine concrete mixes were designed (three for each class: A 1, A and B) by absolute volume method (ACI- 211. 1). The required compressive strength of normal and high strength was set at 6200, 5200 and 4200 Psi for the concrete types A 1, A and B respectively after 28 days (ACI - 318). For compressive strength assessment, a total 27 concrete cylinders were casted (9 -cylinders for each mix) and were water cured. The achieved average UCS of cylinder concrete specimens at 3, 7 and 28 days are 5170, 6338 and 7320 Psi for A 1 – type, 3210, 4187 and 5602 Psi for A-type and 2650, 3360 and 4408 Psi for B- type mix. It has been found that all concrete mixes for suggested classes attained target strength at age of 7 -days. The coarse aggregate (Margala Hill limestone) and fine aggregates (from Lawrancepur /Qibla Bandi quarries) used in all concrete mix designs have demonstrated a sound mechanical suitability for high and normal weight concrete. ...|$|R
40|$|The Yolo Bypass {{is one of}} two flood {{bypasses}} in the Sacramento Valley of California. The Yolo Bypass protects Sacramento {{and other}} riverside communities from flooding through a system of overflow weirs. These weirs connect the bypass to the Sacramento River as well as to various local creeks where the water is eventually drained into the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Although the Yolo Bypass floodplain has been demonstrated to benefit a suite of native fishes, particularly in flood years, {{little is known about the}} movement patterns and residence time of migratory fish such as white sturgeon in the Yolo Bypass. In cooperation with the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the Biotelemetry Lab at UC Davis implanted 68 white sturgeon with VEMCO V 16 coded acoustic telemetry tags. Using an array of VEMCOVR 2 W 69 kHz receivers, including those maintained by the California Fish Tracking Consortium, the sturgeon 2 ̆ 7 s movement patterns were monitored throughout the Yolo Bypass (a total reach of 38. 5 river kilometers) and into the San Francisco Bay. These fish face numerous barriers to migration through the Yolo Bypass under varying river flow conditions, the most significant of which being the Fremont <b>Weir,</b> which <b>blocks</b> sturgeon passage in all but completely inundated conditions. This presentation will address the migratory behavior of sturgeon in the Yolo Bypass and will specifically focus on the analysis of residence time, reach-specific behavior, pulse-flow dynamics relative to sturgeon movement, and sturgeon behavior at the various migratory barriers...|$|R
40|$|The {{pink salmon}} {{population}} (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) returning to Hokkaido, Japan, increased substantially from 1975 to 2000. Despite constant hatchery fry releases, the pink salmon catch exhibited a biennial oscillation indicating a fixed 2 -year life cycle {{and a large}} addition of wild fish. Using a mathematical model, Morita et al. (2006) determined that the observed increases in the Japanese pink salmon catch could be explained primarily by climate change, and they attributed production to wild fish production because increasing hatchery releases {{had little effect on}} abundance of returning adults. In Hokkaido, most major rivers have <b>weirs</b> completely <b>blocking</b> the upstream migration of fish in order to capture hatchery broodstock. Therefore, we assumed that rivers with weirs were unsuitable for natural spawning of pink salmon. To check this assumption and investigate the conditions of naturally spawning pink salmon in the Tokoro River, we conducted field surveys to visually inspect spawning streams for counts of pink salmon and redds. Fig. 1. Location of visual surveys conducted in three streams and the weir across the Tokoro River on the Okhotsk coast of Hokkaido. We visually surveyed three tributaries: Tokoro-Horonai, Kuma, and Nikoro Streams (Fig. 1) with survey lengths (areas) of 821 m (3, 454 m 2), 317 m (998 m 2), and 1, 152 m (12, 909 m 2; Table 1), respectively. In 2010, we quantified the number of pink salmon and redds once every 10 days from the beginning of August until the beginning of October. We could not determine when the redds were made, but we confirmed there was superimposition of the redds by subsequent arrival of salmon on the spawning grounds. We counted all redds found daily during the investigation. Throughout the survey, the weir was not submerged and functioned normally. All correspondence should be addressed to M. Iida...|$|R
