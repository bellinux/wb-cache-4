The majority of the settlers came from Yemen, with the next largest grouping from western Arabia, along with some Jews and Roman mercenaries.

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{official}} forms of their respective languages, the four linguistic regions of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms. The role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in the German-speaking regions, Swiss German dialects have become ever more prevalent since {{the second half of}} the 20th century, especially in the media, such as radio and television, and are used as an everyday language, while the Swiss variety of Standard German is almost always used instead of dialect for <b>written</b> <b>communication</b> (c.f. diglossic usage of a language). Conversely, in the French-speaking regions the local dialects have almost disappeared (only 6.3% of the population of Valais, 3.9% of Fribourg, and 3.1% of Jura still spoke dialects at the end of the 20th century), while in the Italian-speaking regions dialects are mostly limited to family settings and casual conversation.|$|E

Although a number of formal and informal techniques are available to instructors to incorporate writing skills into the classroom, many students have both oral and <b>writing</b> <b>communication</b> apprehension (CA).

This scenario approach combines education and entertainment to make learning easier and interesting. Students can be required to develop short stories where accountants are the key characters and heroes. The better short stories may be placed on the Internet for future students to review.

25|$|N'Ko {{literature}} is evolving into a literary language, termed kangbe 'clear language', {{that is based}} on a compromise dialect of several Manding languages. Mande speakers use kangbe to communicate in writing. For example, the word for 'name' in Bamanan is tɔgɔ and in Maninka it is toh. In <b>written</b> <b>communication</b> each person will write it tô in N’Ko, and yet read and pronounce it as in their own language.|$|E

25|$|Colonial rulers in French Indochina (1887–1954) made {{an effort}} to educate all Vietnamese, and a simpler writing system was found more {{expedient}} for teaching and communication with the general population.

25|$|The {{origin of}} {{typographical}} ligatures {{comes from the}} invention of writing with a stylus on fibrous material (like paper) or clay. Businessmen especially who needed a way {{to speed up the}} process of <b>written</b> <b>communication</b> found that conjoining letters and abbreviating words for lay use was more convenient for record keeping and transaction than the bulky long forms. The earliest known script, Sumerian cuneiform, includes many cases of character combinations that, over time, gradually evolve from ligatures into separately recognizable characters. Ligatures figure prominently in many historical manuscripts, notably the Brahmic abugidas, or the bind rune of the Migration Period Germanic runic inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Age of Bulgarian culture under Simeon I exerted {{considerable}} {{influence on}} the empire's transdanubian possessions. Old Bulgarian was established as the language of liturgy and <b>written</b> <b>communication</b> along with the Cyrillic script created in Bulgaria, which {{was used for the}} Romanian language until the 1860s; the first written text in the Romanian language, Neacşu's letter of 1512, illustrates this trend: it was written in Cyrillic, intermixed with Bulgarian sentences and phrases. To this day, a notable part of Romanian's core vocabulary is of Latinized South Slavic origin, although much of it was replaced by Romance and Classical Latin loanwords in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The Igbo {{people have}} long used Nsibidi ideograms, invented by the {{neighboring}} Ekoi people, for basic <b>written</b> <b>communication.</b> They {{have been used}} {{since at least the}} 16th century, but died out publicly after they became popular amongst secret societies such as the Ekpe, who used them as a secret form of communication. Nsibidi, however, is not a full writing system, because it cannot transcribe the Igbo language specifically. In 1960 a rural land owner and dibia named Nwagu Aneke developed a syllabary for the Umuleri dialect of Igbo, the script, named after him as the Nwagu Aneke script, was used to write hundreds of diary entries until Aneke's death in 1991. The Nwagu Aneke Project is working on translating Nwagu's commentary and diary.|$|E

40|$|This is an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} effects of the oral and <b>written</b> informative <b>communication</b> on sex and sexuality. The experiment was conducted at SMA in Bandung, the first class students being the experiment subjects. From the population (340 students), 78 students were picked up at random. The subjects were divided at random into three groups: the "oral" group (the listening group), the "written" group (the reading group), and the control group. Tests were given to the first group and the second group before and after the treatment, while test I and test II were given to the control group. The experiment aimed to test the following hypothesis: (1) There is {{a significant difference between the}} oral group and written group in their average knowledge on sex and sexuality; (2) There is a Significant difference between the male group and the female group exposed to both oral informative <b>communication</b> and <b>written</b> informative <b>communication</b> in their average knowledge on sex and sexuality; (3) There is a significant difference between the malegroup and the female group exposed to the oral informative communication, and between the male group and the female group exposed to the <b>written</b> informative <b>communication</b> in their average knowledge on sex and sexuality; (4) There is a significant difference between the male group exposed to the oral informative communication and the male group exposed to the <b>written</b> informative <b>communication,</b> and between the female group exposed to the oral informative communication and the female group exposed to the <b>written</b> informative <b>communication</b> in their average knowledge on sex and sexuality.

25|$|The Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066 saw the {{replacement}} of the top levels of the English-speaking political and ecclesiastical hierarchies by Norman rulers who spoke an Old French dialect called Old Norman, which in England developed into a variety called Anglo-Norman. Norman thus came into use as a language of polite discourse and literature, and this fundamentally altered the role of Old English in education and administration, even though many Normans of the early period were illiterate and depended on the clergy for <b>written</b> <b>communication</b> and record-keeping. Large numbers of words of French origin started to be borrowed into the English language, often existing alongside native English words of similar meaning, giving rise to such Modern English pairs as pig/pork, chicken/poultry, calf/veal, cow/beef, sheep/mutton, wood/forest, house/mansion, worthy/valuable, bold/courageous, freedom/liberty.|$|E
25|$|The rise of Islam in the 7th century led to {{the rapid}} rise of Arabic as a major {{literary}} language in the region.

This script also heavily influenced {{the development of the}} cursive scripts of Greek, the Slavic languages, Latin, and other languages. The Arabic language also served to spread the Hindu–Arabic numeral system throughout Europe.
