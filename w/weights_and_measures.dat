5|$|In 1824 the <b>Weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> Act imposed one {{standard}} 'imperial' system of <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> on the British Empire. The {{effect of this}} act was to standardise existing British units of measure rather than to align them with the metric system.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, the International Conference on <b>Weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> {{redefined the}} meter {{in terms of}} a red cadmium {{spectral}} line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths). This definition has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960, when at the General Conference on <b>Weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.|$|E
5|$|The International Prototype Kilogram was {{commissioned}} by the General Conference on <b>Weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (CGPM) {{under the authority of}} the Metre Convention (1875), and in the custody of the International Bureau of <b>Weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for <b>Weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>Measures</b> (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E

In 1948, the building was placed into the care of the Ministry of Works, who repaired the damage inflicted to the tower during the Second World War, and extensively restored the building, clearing the surrounding area and opening the tower for tourists. In the 21st century, the Jewel Tower is managed by English Heritage, receiving around 30,000 visitors each year.|$|E

5|$|The apothecaries' {{system or}} apothecaries' <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> is a {{historical}} system of mass and volume units that were used by physicians and apothecaries for medical recipes, and also sometimes by scientists. The English version {{of the system is}} closely related to the English troy system of weights, the pound and grain being exactly the same in both. It divides a pound into 12 ounces, an ounce into 8 drachms, and a drachm into 3 scruples or 60 grains. This exact form of the system was used in the United Kingdom; in some of its former colonies it survived well into the 20th century. The apothecaries' system of measures is a similar system of volume units based on the fluid ounce. For a long time, medical recipes were written in Latin, often using special symbols to denote <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{system of}} single <b>weights</b> <b>and</b> <b>measures</b> was {{introduced}} and in 1850 the Swiss franc became the Swiss single currency.

5|$|Although the originators {{intended}} {{to devise a}} system that was equally accessible to all, it proved necessary to use prototype units {{in the custody of}} national or local authorities as standards.
