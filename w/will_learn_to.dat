5|$|In {{some places}} they are mainly scavengers, feeding on carrion {{as well as}} the {{associated}} maggots and carrion beetles. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook-billed vultures, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. Plant food includes cereal grains, berries and fruit. They prey on small invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces, and human food waste. They store surplus food items, especially those containing fat, and <b>will</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the Arctic fox. They sometimes associate with another canine, the grey wolf, as a kleptoparasite, following to scavenge wolf-kills in winter. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered California condor, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced.|$|E

25|$|The 19th century Italian writer Arturo Graf {{gives this}} version of the legend in his 1889 book Il Diavolo : There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented with a desire to have {{children}} and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, {{for the first time in}} his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But why is he wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He <b>will</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.|$|E

500|$|The pop rock album {{opens with}} the curtain call, {{strengthening}} {{the impression of}} a live recording rather than a studio album. Carlile performed [...] "Shadow on the Wall", [...] "Turpentine", and [...] "The Story", which had appeared on Carlile's second studio album The Story (2007). [...] "Looking Out", [...] "Before It Breaks", [...] "I Will", [...] "Dreams", and [...] "Pride and Joy" [...] had all appeared on Give Up the Ghost. Believing in the cultivation of standards, Carlile included six cover versions in the set list, three of which appear on the album. [...] "Sixty Years On", originally written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, was arranged by Paul Buckmaster. Carlile, a fan of the [...] "dark" [...] string arrangements that appear on John's album Tumbleweed Connection (1970), contacted Buckmaster on the advice of her manager. Carlile first heard the Hanseroth brothers singing Paul Simon's [...] "The Sound of Silence" [...] in 2009 and asked them to perform it during the set. She does not contribute vocals to the version that appears on the album. Carlile's cover of Leonard Cohen's [...] "Hallelujah", also arranged by Buckmaster, is followed by a hidden track: a cover of Alphaville's [...] "Forever Young". Carlile said the following of Cohen's song: [...] "Hallelujah" [...] {{is going to be a}} standard that our grandkids, our great-great grandkids <b>will</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> sing in church. It's one of those really, really special songs. The thing that's going to make it that, besides that it's so great, is that everyone knows about it because hundreds of songwriters have been moved by that song and have covered it. And that's just something really important that we do in every generation.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{ubiquity of}} the {{internet}} and piracy, Rettig, Lindsay and LeFevre all cite the album's staggered release as a blunder to its performance in succeeding territories, with Japan taking priority by a full two months. In speaking to Rettig, Jepsen stated that more of her attention was focused on the artistic side of the album rather than its marketing aspects: [...] "Not that I wasn’t aware and involved and actively debating all of these things—singles and strategy—but at the time I probably trusted other people before myself, and I think that’s something that I took from this. I <b>will</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> value my own opinion on things just as much as I give that power away." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second question, [...] "how is operant {{behavior}} controlled?" [...] arises because, {{to begin}} with, the behavior is [...] "emitted" [...] {{without reference to}} any particular stimulus. [...] Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not. [...] For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, or a child, <b>will</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> press the lever only when the light is on. Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This [...] "three-term contingency" [...] (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only pair-wise associations.|$|E

2500|$|Russian Cosmist Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov {{advocated}} {{resurrection of}} the dead using scientific methods. Fedorov tried to plan specific actions for scientific research {{of the possibility of}} restoring life and making it infinite. His first project is connected with collecting and synthesizing decayed remains of dead based on [...] "knowledge and control over all atoms and molecules of the world". The second method described by Fedorov is genetic-hereditary. The revival could be done successively in the ancestral line: sons and daughters restore their fathers and mothers, they in turn restore their parents and so on. This means restoring the ancestors using the hereditary information that they passed on to their children. Using this genetic method it is only possible to create a genetic twin of the dead person. It is necessary to give back the revived person his old mind, his personality. Fedorov speculates about the idea of [...] "radial images" [...] that may contain the personalities of the people and survive after death. Nevertheless, Fedorov noted that even if a soul is destroyed after death, Man <b>will</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> restore it whole by mastering the forces of decay and fragmentation.|$|E
