2500|$|The group (MacKaye in particular) {{also made}} a point of {{discouraging}} violent, unwanted slam dancing and fistfights, which it saw as relics of the late 1970s/early 1980s hardcore punk era. Michael Azerrad quotes Mackaye, [...] "See, [...] have one form of communication: violence ... So to disorient them, you don't give them violence. I'd say, 'Excuse me, sir...'- I mean, it freaks them out – 'Excuse me, sir, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> cut that crap out?'" [...] Azerrad writes, [...] " [...] admonitions seemed preachy to some. And by and large, people would obey – it wasn't cool to disrespect Ian MacKaye." [...] Occasionally, Fugazi would have an unrepentant slam-dancer escorted from the concert, and give them an envelope containing a $5 refund (the group kept a stock of such envelopes in their tour van for these occasions).|$|E

6000|$|I {{smiled back}} at my {{companion}} as we drew near. [...] "This, Mrs Bowater," [...] said I, [...] "is Mr Anon. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> present him to Miss Thomasina of Bedlam?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Take a seat. And <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>please</b> to {{shut the}} street door first? I can't very well do it myself; because my back's so bad, and my legs are so queer.' ...|$|E
