5|$|Although the overtures to Orphée aux enfers and La belle Hélene are <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>and</b> {{frequently}} recorded, {{the scores}} usually performed and recorded were not composed by Offenbach, but were arranged by Carl Binder and Eduard Haensch, respectively, for the Vienna premieres {{of the two}} works.

Although Montgomery had only lived in New York for two years and had not sought political involvement, he was <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>and</b> respected in the area and he felt obliged to attend. He was reluctant to go, but nonetheless went to New York City, 80 miles south of Rhinebeck.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>and</b> for many years {{respected}} books about Wyatt Earp was the book I Married Wyatt Earp, originally credited as a factual memoir by Josephine Marcus Earp. Published in 1976, it was edited by amateur historian Glenn Boyer, and published by the respected University of Arizona Press. It was immensely popular for many years, capturing the imagination of people {{with an interest in}} western history, studied in classrooms, cited by scholars, and relied upon as factual by filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|Some have {{suggested}} the syndrome {{may be an}} inability by beekeepers to correctly identify known diseases such as European foulbrood or the microsporidian fungus Nosema apis. The testing and diagnosis of samples from affected colonies (already performed) makes this highly unlikely, as the symptoms are fairly <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>and</b> differ from what is classified as CCD. A high rate of Nosema infection was reported in samples of bees from Pennsylvania, but this pattern was not reported from samples elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} is not <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>and</b> {{appears to be}} {{naturally}} uncommon or rare across a widespread area; however, it is almost certainly under-reported due to its canopy lifestyle. The IUCN considers this species to be a species of Least Concern {{due in part to}} its large range. While the IUCN has not estimated the population size, it believes it is declining due to habitat loss.|$|E
5|$|The tombs were {{constructed}} and decorated by the {{workers of the}} village of Deir el-Medina, located in a small wadi between this valley and the Valley of the Queens, facing Thebes. The workers journeyed to the tombs through various routes over the Theban hills. The daily lives of these workers are quite <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>and</b> are recorded in tombs and official documents. Amongst the events documented is perhaps the first recorded worker's strike, detailed in the Turin strike papyrus.|$|E

5|$|As the {{microscopic}} world was expanding, the macroscopic world was shrinking. Botanists such as John Ray worked {{to incorporate the}} flood of newly discovered organisms shipped from across the globe into a coherent taxonomy, and a coherent theology (natural theology). Debate over another flood, the Noachian, catalyzed the development of paleontology; in 1669 Nicholas Steno published an essay on how the remains of living organisms could be trapped in layers of sediment and mineralized to produce fossils. Although Steno's ideas about fossilization were <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>and</b> much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists {{until the end of}} the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about issues such as the age of the earth and extinction.|$|E
5|$|Before their {{defeat in}} 1697 the Itza {{controlled}} or influenced much of Petén {{and parts of}} Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their capital was Nojpetén, an island city upon Lake Petén Itzá. The Kowoj were the second in importance; they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located around the eastern Petén lakes. The Yalain occupied a territory that extended eastwards to Tipuj in Belize. Other groups in Petén are less <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> <b>and</b> their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Icaiche, the Kejache, the Lakandon Ch'ol, the Manche Ch'ol, and the Mopan.|$|E
