500|$|On why {{he chose}} to return to television, Scorsese said [...] "What's {{happening}} the past 9 to 10 years, particularly at HBO, is what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> for in the mid-Sixties with films being made for television at first. We'd hoped there would be this kind of freedom and also {{the ability to create}} another world and create longform characters and story. That didn't happen in the 1970s, 1980s and in the 1990s I think. And of course ...HBO is a trailblazer in this. I've been tempted over the years to be involved with them {{because of the nature of}} long-form and their development of character and plot." [...] He went on to praise network HBO by saying, [...] "A number of the episodes, in so many of their series, they're thoughtful, intelligent [...] brilliantly put together... It's a new opportunity for storytelling. It's very different from television of the past." ...|$|E
500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped.</b> I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2014, it was {{reported}} that Kestrel had fallen months behind on loan payments to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation due to financing delays. Alan spoke on the matter saying, [...] "We're obviously still very excited about the program. We've made a lot of progress on the design, what we expect to build, what we expect to do with the FAA, but there are other frustrations. Certainly financing the project has been slower than <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> and expected." [...] It was also reported that the delay in financing had impacted hiring, causing the company to reduce its staff in Superior. The WEDC and Kestrel agreed upon new terms that would defer the payments until November 2014.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} are {{the more}} recent comments from Vice Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., deputy chief of naval operations for communication networks (OPNAV N-6) and deputy chief information officer, Department of the Navy. [...] "I believe that NMCI in 2008 is achieving much of what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> NMCI would achieve. It's leveled the playing field for security. It's allowed us {{to do things like}} push security patches that go through the whole enterprise that's on NMCI. If you look at NMCI historically, it was probably the first step for the Navy to move into what was then called Joint Vision 2010 and now is Joint Vision 2020. It's actually done that, and it's moving the Navy toward the U.S. Defense Department's goal of information superiority. So, I see {{a lot of good things}} with NMCI." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 12 August 1993, {{the band}} {{released}} their second album, Mezcal Head, produced by Alan Moulder and Swervedriver. Franklin and Hartridge credited Moulder {{for making the}} album sound [...] "big and clear" [...] and doing [...] "way more for us than <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> for." [...] The album debuted at number 55 in the UK and was critically acclaimed—NME asserted, [...] "you are defied not to sit back, ride its massive cadences, revel in its classical form and sleek lines, and... fall helplessly in love." [...] Later reviews praised it [...] "combined the best elements of shoegazing with grunge and even American indie rock" [...] and [...] "really is the lost classic of the shoegaze movement." [...] Its first single, [...] "Duel", garnered both NME's and Melody Maker's [...] "Single of the Week" [...] and hit number 60 on the UK chart (their highest charting single to date). The band shot two videos for the single: a self-produced snowboarding excursion at Mount Hood and a big-budget MTV effort set in downtown Los Angeles, which included new bassist George. Swervedriver set off touring for the album in the UK and then moved to North America in late 1993 to join Shudder to Think and The Smashing Pumpkins, solidifying a strong American following in the process.|$|E

60|$|True it is, as St. Paul says, that if in {{this life}} only <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>hope</b> in Christ <b>we</b> are of all men most miserable.

We do not care to spend our time in eating and drinking, mean covetousness, ambition, and the base pleasures of the flesh: we long after high and noble things, which we cannot get on earth, or at best only in fragments, and at rare moments; after the holiness and the blessedness of {{ourselves}} and our fellow-creatures. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>hope</b> in Christ for the next life as well as for this. Hope that in the next life He will give us power to succeed, where we failed here; that He will enable us to be good and to do good, and, if not to make others good (for there, we trust, all will be good together), to enjoy the fulness of that pleasure for which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been longing on earth--the pleasure of seeing others good, as Christ is good and perfect, as their Father in heaven is perfect.|$|R
