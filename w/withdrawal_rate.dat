25|$|Although the 4% initial {{portfolio}} <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rate</b> {{described above}} {{can be used}} as a rough gauge, it is often desirable to use a retirement planning tool that accepts detailed input and can render a result that has more precision. Some of these tools model only the retirement phase of the plan while others can model both the savings or accumulation phase as well as the retirement phase of the plan. For example, an analysis by Forbes reckoned that in 90% of historical markets, a 4% rate would have lasted for at least 30 years, while in 50% of the historical markets, a 4% rate would have been sustained for more than 40 years.|$|E
2500|$|A slow <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rate</b> {{significantly}} {{reduces the}} risk of a protracted and/or severe withdrawal state. Protracted withdrawal symptoms can be punctuated by periods of good days and bad days. When symptoms increase periodically during protracted withdrawal, physiological changes may be present, including dilated pupils as well as an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. [...] The change in symptoms has been proposed to be due to changes in receptor sensitivity for GABA during the process of tolerance reversal. A meta-analysis found cognitive impairments due to benzodiazepine use show improvements after six months of withdrawal, but the remaining cognitive impairments may be permanent or may require more than six months to reverse.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse work {{incentive}} effects from a recent change in the Australian tax and transfer system on sole parents. Two approaches are used in the analysis: microsimulation and quasi-experimental evaluation. Both approaches examine the effects on the probability of employment and average working hours. The results from both approaches show that the combined changes introduced in July 2000 involving reduced <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates,</b> changed family payments and lower income tax rates¯have increased labour supply for sole parents to a small extent. The results from microsimulation are slightly smaller than those estimated from a quasi-experimental approach using matching techniques to control for alternative influences. In addition, using microsimulation, the separate effects of the components can be estimated. It was found that reduced benefit <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates,</b> a reduction in the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates</b> and abolition of the sudden death for family payments, and lower income tax rates all increased labour supply. However, the replacement of tax rebates with additional non-income-tested family payments is estimated to have a negative effect on labour supply. ...|$|R

5000|$|Ironically, the 4% rule {{of thumb}} would, in many instances, mandate a more frugal level of {{retirement}} expenditures than a portfolio that was fully invested in government inflation-indexed bonds, such as U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). As of mid-October 2008, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) boasted real yields of approximately 3%.

5000|$|Unlike some {{existing}} benefits, such as Income Support, {{that have}} a 100% <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rate,</b> Universal Credit is gradually tapered away, like tax credits and Housing Benefit - so that, in theory, people can take a part-time job and still be allowed to keep {{some of the money}} they receive. Opinion on the effects of the benefit is divided. In theory, Universal Credit claimants should be better off taking on work, as the benefit will ensure they keep at least a proportion of the money they earn (as discussed here http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11414408/With-Universal-Credit-work-might-finally-pay.html). However, reductions in funding and changes to the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rate</b> meant that commentators {{on both sides of the}} political divide have questioned whether it will make work pay.

40|$|The main {{trust of}} this paper is to explore the inter-company {{variations}} in persistency experience for a sample of 99 U. K. life insurers, using data collected and published by the U. K. financial services regulator. Our first objective is to ascertain whether the undoubted differences in persistency among U. K. long-term insurers are random in nature (as opposed to having some systematic features). Our analysis indicates that there are systematic differences among insurers in <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates.</b> These differences suggest very strongly that persistency problems do not arise from random factors, but result instead from an inability of insurers to meet the service quality expectations of a wide range of customers. Our second main objective is to determine the nature of any systematic differences in persistency according to company size, efficiency, and ownership structure. We therefore use multivariate techniques to measure the relationship between <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates</b> and those aspects of service quality that are correlated with variables such as size, new business growth, the expense ratio, and the mutual/stock distinction. The findings suggest that mutual insurers have a better persistency record than stock insurers, offices with higher expense ratios tend to demonstrate significantly higher <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates,</b> and persistency seems to be negatively related to insurer size. ...|$|R
40|$|The Navajo Aquifer (N-Aquifer) is an {{important}} groundwater source that provides drinking water for the Navajo and Hopi tribes in Black Mesa, Arizona. In 1968, Peabody Western Coal Company, a private sector coal company, began coal strip mining operations with the usage of the N-Aquifer. Each year Peabody withdraws 1, 200 acre-feet {{of water from the}} N-Aquifer and extracts 8 million tons of bituminous coal to fuel the Navajo Generating Station (NGS) in Page, Arizona. Electricity generated from NGS is then used to pump 1. 6 million acre-feet of Colorado River water through a 333 mile canal system to Phoenix and Tucson. In result to Peabody’s industrial withdrawals, the N-Aquifer has dropped 200 to 400 feet. This research is to assess the usage of the N-Aquifer in comparing <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates</b> between Peabody mine and Navajo-Hopi communities. The study demonstrates that Peabody’s industrial <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates</b> of the N-Aquifer has far exceeded municipal <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates</b> of the Kayenta Well System and has caused spring discharge rates to decline among natural springs near Hopi villages. In addition, Peabody mine’s industrial <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates</b> surpassed groundwater model predictions used in the mine’s impact assessments. Although the depletion of the N-Aquifer is evident through USGS monitoring data and residential observations, the Cumulative Hydrologic Impact Assessment (CHIA) criteria, which is assessed by the Office of Surface Mining (OSM) – fails to resolve, identify, and evaluate current and prospective impacts of material damage among the N-Aquifer because it is dependent on hypothetical computer groundwater model results rather than physical data from groundwater monitoring wells. While 62 percent of the total groundwater withdrawals continue to be used for coal mining activity, it is critical that OSM revises the CHIA criteria that will provide an informative baseline data model and resolution to vertical leakage, spring discharge, and base flow in washes on the Black Mesa basin...|$|R

40|$|Background To reduce nursing shortages, {{accelerated}} nursing {{programs are}} available for domestic and international students. However, the <b>withdrawal</b> and failure <b>rates</b> from these programs may be different than for the traditional programs. The main aim of our study was to improve the retention and experience of accelerated nursing students. Methods The academic background, age, <b>withdrawal</b> and failure <b>rates</b> of the accelerated and traditional students were determined. Data from 2009 and 2010 were collected prior to intervention. In an attempt to reduce the withdrawal of accelerated students, we set up an intervention, which was available to all students. The assessment of the intervention was a pre-post-test design with non-equivalent groups (the traditional and the accelerated students). The elements of the intervention were a) a formative website activity of some basic concepts in anatomy, physiology and pharmacology, b) a workshop addressing study skills and online resources, and c) resource lectures in anatomy/physiology and microbiology. The formative website and workshop was evaluated using questionnaires. Results The accelerated nursing students were five years older than the traditional students (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates</b> from a pharmacology course are higher for accelerated nursing students, than for traditional students who have undertaken first year courses in anatomy and physiology (p[*]=[*] 0. 04 in 2010). The withdrawing students were predominantly the domestic students with non-university qualifications or equivalent experience. The failure rates were also higher for this group, compared to the traditional students (p[*]=[*] 0. 05 in 2009 and 0. 03 in 2010). In contrast, the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>rates</b> for the international and domestic graduate accelerated students were very low.
