5|$|There are {{numerous}} {{portions of the}} long-running British science-fiction television programme Doctor <b>Who</b> <b>that</b> are no longer held by the BBC. Between 1967 and 1978 the BBC routinely deleted archive programmes, for various practical reasons (lack of space, scarcity of materials, a lack of rebroadcast rights). As {{a result of the}} cull, 97 of 253 episodes from the programme's first six years are currently missing, primarily from seasons 3 through 5, leaving 26 serials incomplete. Many more were considered lost until recovered from various sources, mostly overseas broadcasters.|$|E
5|$|Historians are {{agreed that}} the {{introduction}} and conclusion were added by a different author {{than that of the}} Libellus. <b>Who</b> <b>that</b> was, however, is open to debate. The historian C. W. David felt that it was {{based on the work of}} the chronicler Symeon of Durham, which thus made a credible date for the creation sometime between 1109 and 1129. David also felt that the Vita was used by a later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, felt that although Symeon knew of the Libellus, there was no evidence that he used the Vita, which would leave the author of the Vita unclear.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are often}} awarded after record-breaking or near-record-breaking {{offensive}} seasons. Running back O. J. Simpson won {{the award for}} 1973 after rushing for a record 2,003 yards, becoming the first NFL player to rush for 2,000 yards in a season. When his record was broken by Eric Dickerson in 1984, Dickerson placed second in voting behind quarterback Dan Marino, <b>who</b> <b>that</b> year {{was the first to}} pass for 5,000 yards in a season. Marino's 5,084 yards stood as the record for 27 years before being broken by Drew Brees in 2011, who won that season's award. In turn, 2013 winner Peyton Manning set league single-season records for passing yards (5,477) and passing touchdowns (55).|$|E

5|$|Roger Stevens {{was working}} for the BBC as a film editor in the 1980s, and one morning, as he was {{travelling}} to work by train, he bumped into a BBC co-worker and they began to talk about Doctor Who episodes. The BBC projectionist mentioned that he had nine episodes of Doctor <b>Who</b> <b>that</b> Stevens could buy for £25. In the summer of 1981, Stevens bought The Space Museum episode one, The Abominable Snowmen episode two, The Moonbase episode four, Invasion of the Dinosaurs episode one, and three episodes of Carnival of Monsters. Stevens then contacted Ian Levine {{to find out what was}} missing from the BBC archive; Levine confirmed that The Abominable Snowmen episode two and Invasion of the Dinosaurs episode one were currently missing.|$|E

25|$|There {{may have}} been a single author for the gospel and the three epistles. Tradition {{attributes}} all the books to John the Apostle. Most scholars agree that all three letters are written by the same author, although there is debate on <b>who</b> <b>that</b> author is. Although some scholars conclude the author of the epistles was {{different from that of the}} gospel, all four works probably originated from the same community, traditionally and plausibly attributed to Ephesus, c. 90-110, but perhaps, according to some scholars, from Syria.|$|E

25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{agree that}} all three letters are written by the same author, although there is debate on <b>who</b> <b>that</b> author is. These three epistles are similar in terminology, style, and general situation. They are loosely associated with the Gospel of John and may result from that gospel's theology. These epistles are commonly accepted as deriving from the Johannine community in Asia Minor. Early references to the epistles, {{the organization of the}} church apparent in the text, and the lack of reference to persecution suggests that they were written early in the 2nd century.|$|E

The film starred Matthew Broderick as Shaw, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes, and Andre Braugher. The film re-established the now-popular image of the combat role African-Americans played in the Civil War, and the unit, often represented in historical battle reenactments, now has the nickname The Glory Regiment. First Sergeant Simmons is mentioned repeatedly in a documentary narrated by Glory actor Morgan Freeman, The True Story of Glory.|$|E
