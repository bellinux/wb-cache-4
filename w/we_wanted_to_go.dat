So it's basically dreaming and accomplishing your dreams. This video is me dreaming and being taken into this whole kind of maze.

The more I {{was listening to the}} thing and learning the song, I realized it set itself up to be a duet if <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> that route. When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} in lyrics between the version used in [...] version and the one released on Shades of Purple. The Shades of Purple version includes the line [...] "then you start kissing me, what's that about?" [...] In the Pokémon version, the lyric is [...] "then you said you love me, what's that about?" [...] When asked about the lyric change in an interview, M2M replied [...] "the Pokémon people didn't find it appropriate to have kissing in the lyrics, because it was for younger kids. We think [...] was stupid. The original version is on , and that's the one <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with." [...] M2M had not heard of Pokémon until the song was chosen for the soundtrack, as the franchise was not yet popular in Norway.|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, {{who worked with}} Madonna in her video for [...] "Borderline", was shot in Venice and partly in New York City in July 1984. Madonna was portrayed as a knowing virgin, a figment of the pornographic mind, as she walked through marble rooms, wearing a wedding gown. It alternated with scenes of a provocative-looking Madonna on board a gondola. She commented, [...] " [...] {{wanted me to be}} the modern-day, worldly-wise girl that I am. But then <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back in time and use myself as an actual virgin." [...] The video starts with Madonna boarding on a boat from the Brooklyn Bridge and travels to Venice. As she steps down into the city, she moves like a stripper and undulated sinuously. She wears a black dress and blue pants with a number of Christian symbol embedded jewelry around her neck. She sings the song at full volume as she watches a lion walking between the columns of the Piazza San Marco of Venice and along the statute of Saint Mark.|$|E

But <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> acoustic and a piece like [...] "Gallows Pole" [...] still had all the power of [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] because it allowed us to be dynamic.|$|E

Most of the step pyramids seen at the Maya city were models designed by Thomas E. Sanders. Sanders explained his approach: [...] "We wanted to set up the Mayan world, but we were not trying to do a documentary. Visually, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for what would have the most impact. Just as on Braveheart, you are treading the line of history and cinematography. Our job is to do a beautiful movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen praised {{recording}} engineer Mark Rankin's contributions stating, [...] "I {{think it was}} pretty key to have Mark there. He went through the process with us, and now he's like a brother. He was completely an outsider to what we were doing, {{and that was the}} one thing that we consciously decided. For this record <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out of our comfort zone, usually we’re around friends of ours. For this one, I think it was important to work with somebody who didn’t even know what some of our influences were. Someone completely out of the box for us, and I think he was key in making this record sound the way it does." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2010 On June 14, 2010 Kent {{announced}} their ninth studio album, En plats i solen (Swedish for [...] "A Place in the Sun") due for release on June 30, only {{seven months after}} the release of their previous studio album, Röd. Joakim has said about the recording of En plats i solen: We had a kind of idea {{that we were going to}} record an album very quickly this time, we had already some demos ready. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the studio, record and mix the album and then distribute it directly. Unlike the two previous albums, which were produced with Danish producer Joshua, En plats i solen is produced with Swedish producer Stefan Boman who worked with the band on Du & jag döden (2005). The band also released the first single from the forthcoming album, featuring the two A-sides Gamla Ullevi and Skisser för sommaren.|$|E

2500|$|Zombie was {{responsible}} for writing all of the album's songs, while he initially worked with Nine Inch Nails member Charlie Clouser to produce the album. Zombie and Clouser opted for a more [...] "electronic" [...] sound for the record, using various music software while working on the project. Clouser claimed [...] "It was me and him with a computer, {{trying to figure out}} a direction <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in. We had {{a pretty good idea of}} the kind of elements that would be included and an overall concept of the segues between songs and the musical interludes. We even started coming up with the core riffs for the album." [...] Early into the process of recording the album, Clouser became unable to work on the album due to other obligations; however, he recommended that Zombie worked with Scott Humphrey for the remainder of the album. Humphrey had previously worked with artists such as Metallica prior to producing the album. Due to his departure, the only song on the album produced by Clouser is [...] "Superbeast". Zombie stated that making the album was [...] "weird", and he didn't believe it would do well, as [...] "most debut solo records don't." ...|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] assented Parkins. [...] "They said they'd sell us tickets.
