50|$|Once {{they have}} {{finished}} growing, feathers are essentially dead structures. Over time, they become <b>worn</b> and <b>abraded,</b> {{and need to}} be replaced. This replacement process is known as moult (molt in the United States). The loss of wing and tail feathers can affect a bird's ability to fly (sometimes dramatically) and in certain families can impair the ability to feed or perform courtship displays. The timing and progression of flight feather moult therefore varies among families.|$|R

Early testing included materials screening programs to identify suitable cryogenic cage materials. A specially developed element tester that simulated {{the function of}} a ball bearing cage was used. Suitable materials must provide lubrication with an acceptably low <b>wear</b> rate, without <b>abrading</b> contacting surfaces. The most promising materials were tested in full scale bearings at speeds up to 4 MDN. Teflon, filled with 40 percent bronze powder, was the best performing material.

40|$|In {{metal forming}} at {{elevated}} temperatures the tools {{are subjected to}} thermal cycling, increased oxidation and wear which will influence the lifetime of the tools {{and the quality of}} the produced parts. In addition to this, the frictional behaviour will also change with temperature and this can affect the performance of the forming operation itself. One way of controlling friction and reducing wear is to utilise the latest developments in surface engineering and modify or coat the tool surface with some thermally stable layer. However, in the open literature there are very few studies pertaining to the high temperature tribological properties of surface coatings applied on to the tool steels and sliding against actual workpiece material. This study thus aims at experimentally investigating the friction and wear characteristics of a surface coated tool steel during sliding against ultra high strength boron steel at elevated temperatures. The surface coatings applied on the tool steel in this work were of TiAlN and CrN respectively. The tribological studies were conducted by using both a reciprocating tribometer as well as a pin-on-disc machine at temperatures in the range from ambient to 800 ºC. A 3 D optical surface profiler has been used for surface topography measurements and SEM/EDS have been used for investigating the resultant surface damage. The results have shown that the friction coefficient increases with temperature in unidirectional sliding. Wear of the coatings is negligible at room temperature but at 400 ºC the CrN disc is <b>worn</b> by <b>abrading</b> action of hard oxidised wear debris and the coating is removed to a large extent. In reciprocating sliding the friction also increases with temperature and the coatings are completely removed during sliding at 800 ºC. Godkänd; 2008; 20080615 (brap...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer composites {{are generally}} known to possess high strength and attractive wear resistance in dry sliding conditions. The behaviour of such composites performing in abrasive wear situations needs a proper understanding. Hence, {{in the present}} work of the three-body abrasive wear behaviour of two dimensional stitched carbon fabric, E-glass woven fabric and three dimensional E-glass woven fabric reinforced vinyl ester composites was investigated. Three-body abrasive wear tests were conducted using rubber wheel abrasion tester (RWAT) under different abrading distances at two loads, wherein the wear volume loss were found to increase and that of specific wear rate decrease. The {{results indicate that the}} type of fabric in vinyl ester have a significant influence on <b>wear</b> under varied <b>abrading</b> distance/loads. Further, it was found that carbon fabric reinforced vinyl ester composite exhibited lower wear rate compared to E-glass woven fabric reinforced vinyl ester composites.

40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: The {{increasing}} demand for endoscopic procedures poses new contamination challenges, given developing antimicrobial resistance worldwide and potential viral or prion diseases in populations at risk. We examined working channels from reusable luminal endoscopes used in recent years. Methods: Very sensitive fluorescence epimicroscopy {{was used to}} examine working channels from 6 decommissioned and 6 factory-new channels, as received, or following spiking and washing in the laboratory. Results: After a single contamination and wash test cycle, new channels retained approximately 75 ?pg/mm 2 of proteins; through 7 subsequent cycles residual proteins fluctuated between 25 and 75 ?pg/mm 2. Decommissioned channels harbored 1 ?–? 4 ?µg of proteins each, except in one gastroscope (33 ?µg), including up to 2 ?% amyloid proteins except in one gastroscope and one sigmoidoscope (with over 80 ?%); lumens showed <b>wearing</b> with established <b>abraded</b> biofilms in 3 cases. After spiking with scrapie-infected blood components and washing, residual protein levels in new channels varied following standard (17. 23 ?pg/mm 2), duplicated (2. 39 ?pg/mm 2) or extended (11. 3 ?pg/mm 2) washing; no changes were measured among the long-established contamination in old channels. Conclusions: Our observations suggest that wear effects in endoscope lumens may contribute to the adsorption of proteins, thus facilitating retention and survival of bacteria. As demonstrated by recent outbreaks worldwide despite recommended reprocessing, the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strains, and the estimated prevalence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in the UK particularly, combined with increasing demand for endoscopic procedures, call for sustained precautions and improved methods for the reprocessing of nonautoclavable, reusable surgical instruments...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of the Breakring vertical shaft impactor was investigated mathematically and experimentally. In particular, {{the performance of the}} crusher, the action of solids and air in the impeller and the mechanism responsible for the localised abrasion of the impeller wear parts were investigated. Computer programs were developed, which modelled the performance of the Breakring for impellers having simple, idealised wear part profiles. Contour plots were produced, which illustrated the dependence of impeller power, absolute particle exit speed and anvil angle for normal impact on the wear part sweep angle and the coefficient of friction between the feed material and the wear part. The significance of the contours was investigated. A computer program was developed, which modelled the action of a single particle in the Breakring impeller for wear parts having various complex profiles. The results indicated that the cause of the localised wear part abrasion was the reattachment of feed material to the wear part, following separation at the downstream end of the depression caused by action of material after entry to the impeller. The accuracy of the results was confirmed by the profiles of <b>abraded</b> <b>wear</b> parts and various other factors. A full-scale model impeller was constructed. The flow of air in the model and, following failure of the model, the flow of air and solids in a prototype impeller were investigated by a surface flow visualisation technique and high speed cinematography. The results neither verified the wear-mechanism outlined above nor indicated any other wear-mechanism. It was concluded that the wear mechanism indicated by the mathematical modelling was accurate and that there is no indication of abrasion by airborne fines...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Parameters for new {{manufacturing}} route of Cu casting reinforced with alumina fibers were elaborated. There was observed improvement of hardness and wear properties of composite materials comparing to the unreinforced copper and this indicates {{for the proper}} applied process parameters. Design/methodology/approach: Manufacturing of composite materials involves two stages, preparation of porous preforms and next their infiltration with molten Cu. Preforms exhibits semioriented arrangement of fibers and their open porosity makes possible the production of composite materials with 10 and 20 % by volume of Al 2 O 3 fibers (Saffil). Wear tests were carried out applying the pin-on-disc concept at constant sliding velocity and under two different pressures. Specimens were pressed against the cast iron counterpart prepared from standard brake disc material. Findings: Reinforcing of pure Cu with ceramic fibers results in the significant increase of hardness both by reducing the grain size and creating high level of residual stresses due to thermal mismatch of composite components. Fibers improves effectively wear resistance and under lower pressure of 0. 2 MPa, in relation to unreinforced Cu, composite with 20 % of fibers exhibits 6 times lower volume lost. Under smaller pressure wear process proceeded with plastic deformation of subsurface, cracking of reinforcement and transferring such segments to friction surface. Wear products containing hard fragments of alumina fibers as well as iron and copper oxides are transferred between surfaces and <b>abrade</b> <b>weared</b> parts. Thus only after friction against composite with 10 % of fiber wear of iron counterpart was relatively small. Research limitations/implications: Reinforcing of Cu by squeeze casting method requires application of the die from high temperature resistant steel tool. Preform preheated to high temperature before infiltration, should {{be transferred to the}} mold very quickly in order to keep temperature. Practical implications: Reinforced copper, locally reinforced, exhibit high hardness and wear resistance under applied pressures. Production of electronic devices where simultaneously the high thermal and electric conductivity and good wear resistance are required can be potential area of future applications. Originality/value: Investigations are valuable for persons, who are interested in Cu cast composite materials reinforced locally with ceramic fiber performs...|$|R
40|$|Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC) and {{titanium}} (Ti) alloys {{have been}} widely employed in the aerospace industry due to their high strength to weight ratios. For making a military aircraft body, these materials are usually stacked together with titanium alloys serving as the airframe, while CFC is the outer skin. Drilling is often performed in one shot from the CFC outer skin through to the titanium alloy airframe {{for the purpose of}} assembling them by mechanical means using rivets, screws, nuts and bolts. Conventional drilling of these CFC/Ti stacks, however, often results in two major issues; rapid tool failure and poor hole quality. This paper considers the potential of employing Ultrasonic Assisted Drilling (UAD) on stack materials in order to improve tool life and hole quality. Experiments comparing conventional drilling and UAD on CFC/Ti 6 Al 4 V stack using reground 6. 121 mm-diameter TiAlN coated tungsten carbide twist drills are presented. Reground drills were used by way of replicating typical current practice in industry. A constant cutting speed and feed rate of 50 m/min and 0. 05 mm/rev, respectively was used in both experiments. During UAD experiments, ultrasonic amplitude and frequency was fixed at 2. 6 µm and 42. 7 kHz, respectively. A total of 100 holes were drilled in the stacks during each drilling processes (conventional drilling and UAD). Machinability was assessed in terms of thrust forces, tool wear, hole diameter, CFC delamination and titanium burr. Thrust forces were measured using a dynamometer; tool wear was examined using an optical microscope and a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM); and holes diameter were measured using a bore micrometer. Hole defects; CFC entry delamination was examined and quantified using an optical microscope, while titanium exit burr were investigated using both an optical microscope and a depth gauge. The dominant types of tool wear during drilling of CFC/Ti 6 Al 4 V stacks were caused by titanium adhesion/fusion on the cutting edges. In addition, abrasive <b>wear</b> caused by <b>abrading</b> carbon fibres against cutting edges were also observed. Poor hole quality of the stacks included inconsistent diameter of CFC and titanium holes; CFC delamination at the hole entrance and burr formation as the drill exited the titanium. The difference in thrust forces produced by conventional drilling and UAD were minor. It was observed that UAD resulted in less tool wear rate and a reduction of adhered titanium alloy on the cutting edges, more consistent hole diameters and less titanium burr compared to conventional drilling. However, larger CFC delamination was observed during UAD than conventional drilling...|$|R

" [...] abstractThe failure of agitator blades was an issue of major concern in the leaching circuit of the Australian Magnesium Corporation (AMC) pilot plant in Gladstone. The aim of this project was to investigate the causes of the failure of the agitator blades and to make some recommendations to help avoid the problem in the future. At the start of this thesis, a comprehensive failure analysis was carried out {{in order to understand the}} potential failure mechanisms operating in the slurry tanks. A number of potential failure mechanisms were identified and these included erosive slurry wear of the rubber and chemical and/or thermal degradation of the rubber. These failure mechanisms may also act synergistically. An experimental programme of research was planned to investigate the separate influences of slurry wear and chemical and/or thermal degradation of the rubber. The results of these tests were then used to extend our understanding of the failure of the agitator blades. A slurry erosion test has been developed in order to quantify the erosion of bromobutyl rubber. The study investigated the effects of particle size, erosion time, slurry weight concentration and specimen velocity. Wear was measured using surface roughness measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the worn surfaces. The degree of wear was found to increase with increased particle size, slurry weight concentration and erosion time and the wear appear to be at a maximum at a nominal angle of impact of the particles of approximately 40 °. Wear appeared to decrease with increasing slurry velocities, but this may have been due to changes in particle shape. One of the key factors in the development of damage on the surface of the rubber was found to be <b>wear</b> of the <b>abrading</b> particles and the condition of the abrading particles needs to be taken into account when interpreting the results of slurry wear tests. In general the experimental results were found to be in good agreement with the predictions from the literature and a model has been developed in order to obtain a better understanding of slurry erosion. In addition to the slurry wear tests, the chemical degradation behaviour of In addition to the slurry wear tests, the chemical degradation behaviour of bromobutyl rubber was investigated by measuring hardness (shore A) and surface morphology of the rubber after exposure of the rubber to acid and water at 70 °C. In acid, the rubber hardness increased with time and whereas in water alone, the rubber hardness decreased. This indicated that the acid immersion had a hardening effect on the rubber and this may have played some part in the failure. From this work, it is apparent that both slurry wear and exposure to acid andlor temperature have an effect on the degradation of the rubber. Particle size and shape had a major effect on damage accumulation rates, with most damage occurring with large, sharp particles. For tests where the particle size was below 3. 35 mm the damage accumulation rate was insignificant. Morphological studies of the worn surfaces suggest that a major mechanism of damage was the formation of cracks which penetrated the rubber and exposed the underlying steel agitator blades to the acidic environment. Hardening of the rubber by exposure to the acid solution would have decreased the resilience of the rubber and may have increased the effect of the slurry wear on crack formation, but at this stage the coupled effects of slurry wear and chemical/thermal degradation have not been explored...|$|R
