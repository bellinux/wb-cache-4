50|$|The {{process of}} {{excavation}} is achieved {{in many ways}} depending {{on the nature of}} the deposits to be removed and time constraints. In the main, deposits are lifted by Trowel and Mattock and shovelled or carried from the site by <b>wheel</b> <b>barrow</b> and bucket. The use of many other tools including fine trowels such as the plaster's leaf trowel and brushes of various grades are used on delicate items such as human bone and decayed timber. When removing material from the archaeological record some basic guidelines are often observed.|$|R
50|$|The fine rock debris, {{known as}} cuttings, fell down the pilot hole; an {{estimated}} 500 kg of rocks fell down every hour.

50|$|The {{tools that}} were used {{at the time were}} similar to what gardeners use today. For instance, shears, rakes, hoes, spades, baskets, and <b>wheel</b> <b>barrows</b> were used and are still {{important}} today. There was even a tool that acted much like a watering can, called a thumb pot. Made from clay, the thumb pot has small holes at the bottom and a thumb hole at the top. The pot was submerged in water, and the thumb hole covered until the water was needed. A perforated pot was also used to hang over plants for constant moisture.|$|R
5000|$|Softscape {{refers to}} the live horticultural {{elements}} of a landscape.

This is a term that has been popularized in recent pop culture (2006 onwards) on television shows such as Home & Garden Television. The purpose of softscape is to lend character to the landscaping, create an aura, ambience, and reflect the sensibilities of the inhabitants.|$|R

50|$|Construction on {{the road}} began on 19 September 1919, built by {{approximately}} 3,000 returned servicemen as a war memorial for fellow servicemen {{who had been killed}} in World War I. An advance survey team progressed through dense wilderness at approximately 3 kilometres a month. Construction was done by hand; using explosives, pick and shovel, <b>wheel</b> <b>barrows,</b> and some small machinery, and was at times perilous, with several workers killed on the job; the final sections along steep coastal mountains being the most difficult to work on. Anecdotal evidence from ABC archives in 1982 suggested workers would rest detonators on their knees during travel, as it was the softest ride for them.|$|R
