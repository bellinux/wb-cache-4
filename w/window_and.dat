5|$|The chapel, {{which is}} on a small hill to the north east of the castle, was rebuilt in stone in the early 15th century. It was {{modified}} from the late 15th to late 16th century, when a Perpendicular Gothic, five-light east <b>window</b> <b>and</b> transepts were added. Bucks' engraving of 1728, shows a short nave and a large six-light west <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> that the chapel was disused by this time, as it had no roof. The west fa√ßade of the chapel was later demolished and the chancel arch was built up {{to form a new}} one with a Gibbs surround. A bell-turret was added c.1805. On the north and south sides of the chapel are two transeptal, semi-octagonal bays.|$|E

5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) <b>window</b> <b>and</b> she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a bad job so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy to wait in her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new <b>window</b> <b>and</b> make her a cup of tea.|$|E
