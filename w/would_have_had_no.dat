5|$|When Theobald died in 1160, most {{observers}} believed that Foliot {{was the leading}} candidate to become archbishop of Canterbury. Traditionally, the see of Canterbury had been held by a monk, {{at least since the}} replacement of Stigand by Lanfranc in 1070. Although Foliot was a Cluniac monk, they were a subset of the Benedictine Order and thus the cathedral chapter at Canterbury, which was Benedictine but not Cluniac, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> objections to him on that score. Foliot denied that he ever lobbied for the office, but John of Salisbury and Thomas Becket apparently believed that Foliot desired it.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus was {{the largest}} {{predator}} in its environment, while the only known large herbivores {{at the time were}} sauropods like Rapetosaurus. Scientists have suggested that Majungasaurus, and perhaps other abelisaurids, specialized on hunting sauropods. Adaptations to strengthen the head and neck for a bite-and-hold type of attack might have been very useful against sauropods, which would have been tremendously powerful animals. This hypothesis may also be supported by the hindlegs of Majungasaurus, which were short and stocky, as opposed to the longer and more slender legs of most other theropods. While Majungasaurus would not have moved as fast as other similar-sized theropods, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> trouble keeping up with slow-moving sauropods. The robust hindlimb bones suggest very powerful legs, and their shorter length would have lowered the animal's center of gravity. Thus Majungasaurus may have sacrificed speed for power. Majungasaurus tooth marks on Rapetosaurus bones confirm that it at least fed on these sauropods, whether or not it actually killed them.|$|E

5|$|On August 20, 2003, Delaware {{officials}} unveiled {{plans at}} a public workshop for a new bridge to replace the 1965 bridge and its 1976 addition. A tied-arch design spanning the inlet slightly west of the 1976 addition to the 1965 bridge, the new bridge {{would have had the}} longest arched span in the world, with a length of 1,000 feet (305 meters). With an estimated cost of $65 million, the new bridge <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> piers in the water, avoiding the scouring problems that had plagued the earlier spans. Delaware officials hoped that work could begin in the autumn of 2004 and be completed two years later. However, the tied-arch design deterred all but one bidder on the construction contract, and that bid came in much higher than expected and was more than DelDOT could afford at the time. By the autumn of 2005, a $200 million shortfall in the state transportation budget had delayed construction projects all over Delaware and forced the state to put plans for the new bridge on hold, and in the meantime rising labor and materials costs drove the cost of the bridge up to $200 million, $50 million above the budget.|$|E

25|$|From 2007 to 2010 {{there was}} a strong {{possibility}} that Devon's two-tier council structure might be reorganised. In December 2007, a bid by Exeter City Council to become a unitary council was referred by the Department for Communities and Local Government to the Boundary Committee for England, as they felt the application did not meet all their strict criteria. Had the bid succeeded, Devon County Council, headquartered in Exeter, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> local governmental control of the City of Exeter. The Boundary Committee was asked to look at the feasibility of a unitary Exeter in the context of examining options for unitary arrangements in the wider Devon county area, and reported back in July 2008 recommending a 'unitary Devon' (excluding Plymouth and Torbay), with a second option of a 'unitary Exeter & Exmouth' (combined) and a unitary 'rest of Devon'. This would have abolished lower-tier district councils which work together with Devon County Council. These proposals were put out to consultation until September 2008 and the Committee was expected to make final recommendations to the Secretary of State {{by the end of the}} year. As a result of a number of legal challenges to the process and also dissatisfaction on the part of the Secretary of State with the manner in which the Boundary Committee assessed proposals, a recommendation was unlikely until March or April 2009.|$|E

Themistocles was to prove himself a master of the new system; [...] "he could infight, he could network, he could spin... and crucially, he knew how to make himself visible." [...] Themistocles moved to the Ceramicus, a down-market part of Athens. This move marked him out as a 'man of the people', and allowed him to interact more easily with ordinary citizens. He began building up a support base among these newly empowered citizens: [...] "he wooed the poor; and they, not used to being courted, duly loved him back. Touring the taverns, the markets, the docks, canvassing where no politician had thought to canvas before, making sure never to forget a single voter's name, Themistocles had set his eyes on a radical new constituency" [...] However, he took care to ensure that he did not alienate the nobility of Athens.

500|$|Cancellara was not {{considered}} to be a favorite for the Amstel Gold Race, though {{he was part of the}} strong squad that the Leopard Trek team brought to the race.

Cancellara commented that he felt [...] "free as a bird" [...] in the Amstel, riding it for the first time since 2004, and that he was not under pressure to get a result. He identified Philippe Gilbert as the main favorite for the race, and promised not to ride against him as he felt his rivals had done to him in the cobbled classics. The race took place two days after Fränk Schleck's 30th birthday, further intensifying it as a goal for him. Cancellara and both Schleck brothers effectively stayed at the front of the race most of the day, but Cancellara and Fränk Schleck lost contact after crashing on the Gulperberg [...] from the finish. This left Andy Schleck alone to fend for victory, and his tactic was a solo attack launched from [...] out, on the Keutenberg. The tactic was nearly successful, as the younger Schleck brother occupied first position on the road with only [...] left to race, but a chase pack led by Gilbert overhauled him at that point. Visibly spent from his solo effort, Schleck had nothing left for the finale and finished 11th, 28 seconds down on race winner Gilbert. He stated after the race that he was satisfied with his effort, feeling that going for the win from so far out was his only play for victory without any teammates in the front group. He may have finished a few positions higher if he had stayed with the Gilbert group, but he almost certainly <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> chance for victory against the fast finisher Gilbert; thus, the solo attack was the correct move in his eyes, since his only ambition was victory.
