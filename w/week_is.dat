40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was {{analysed}} the physical and chemical parameters in lump cheese and Korbáčik cheese. Sensory evaluation was performed only in Korbáčik cheese. There was compared quality of Korbáčik cheese made from lump cheese ripened one and three weeks. The statistical analysis of the moisture showed significant differences (p  < 0. 001) among Korbáčik cheese made from raw material ripened one and three weeks. Average moisture of the Korbáčik made from cheese ripened one <b>week</b> <b>was</b> 44. 73 % and of the Korbáčik made from cheese ripened three <b>weeks</b> <b>was</b> 53. 73 %.
