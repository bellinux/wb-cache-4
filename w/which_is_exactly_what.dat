This means that in effect wavelength converters are needed instead, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> a transponder is. A transponder {{can be made up}} of two transceivers placed after each other: the first transceiver converting the 1550nm optical signal to/from an electrical signal, and the second transceiver converting the electrical signal to/from an optical signal at the required wavelength. Transponders that don't use an intermediate electrical signal (all-optical transponders) are in development.|$|E
25|$|During 1965 it {{was decided}} to make Northern Songs a public company to reduce their income tax burden. 1,250,000 shares were traded on the London Stock Exchange, which were worth 17 pence each ($0.28), but were offered at 66 pence ($1.09) each. Although the trade was scoffed at by various {{financial}} institutions, it was expected that the application lists would not remain open for more than 60 seconds, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> happened, as the lists were oversubscribed. After the offer was closed, Lennon and McCartney owned 15% each, worth £195,200 ($320,000), NEMS a 7.5% interest, and James and Silver (who served as Northern Songs' chairmen), controlling 37.5%, with Harrison and Starr sharing 1.6%. The remaining shares were owned by various financial institutions. At the same time, Lennon and McCartney renewed their previous three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973. Harrison also signed with the company in 1965, for a period of three years. To protect his interests, James took out a life insurance policy of £500,000 on Lennon and McCartney. By the summer of 1966, 88 songs by Lennon and McCartney had been recorded and released, amounting to 2,900 versions by different artists.|$|E

Schaffner added: [...] "True, the critics had been unfair, even vicious.

500|$|Co-writer James Wong {{felt that}} the changes {{he was asked to}} make to the script led to [...] "Shadows" [...] turning out to be [...] "an average episode", {{although}} he felt [...] "the director did a good job with it". His partner Glen Morgan had a similar opinion, calling it [...] "a little too ordinary, like you have seen it before, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> the network wanted at the time. Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode, calling it [...] "very well done, really great effects, and more of a meat-and-potatoes kind of story.

[...] The plot for [...] "Shadows" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 2000 by Ellen Steiber, under the title Haunted.|$|E

But Porter also said he had mixed feelings about Pam's decision to work for Michael and about the Charles Miner character, who he said might be too humorless and uncomfortable for the show. Travis Fickett of IGN felt it was disappointing and slow-paced compared to last week's episode [...] "New Boss": [...] "Things slow down a bit as we sort of repeat the awkwardness between Michael and new regional manager Charles Miner.

There is a lot of authority and a lot of strict regiment, and the kids lash out and take over the school and destroy the place." [...] The band's main goal for the video was for it to resemble an art piece, much in the same way they viewed the production of the album, to keep in line with tone. To this end, they enlisted director David LaChapelle. LaChapelle's input—which [...] "ranges from an evil prison warden cracking a whip at marching school kids to escapees ripping their uniforms and doing acrobatic moves down the hallways"—was regarded by the band as [...] "completely wacked out and twisted, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> we love." ...|$|E

A portfolio video created by lead technical artist Anders Bodbacka revealed that Larsa Solidor and Basch fon Ronsenburg from Final Fantasy XII were also to be featured. The setting was to be different from a normal Final Fantasy game, with familiar characters exploring a [...] "Nordic" [...] version of Final Fantasy, and [...] "primarily set in a massive fortress" [...] according to Linda Dahlberg, a Grin associate producer. Other landscapes such as plains, forests, deserts and snowfields were also designed.|$|E

Rumble said that this was because he and Campbell made sure that the album [...] "sounded big [...] it could compete on the world stage". Thematically, The Experiment is [...] "about love, heartbreak, getting what he wants and knowing he is in charge of his own destiny", although [...] "Let You Down" [...] is [...] "quite dark and weighty". Many of the song's discuss Rumble's own life experiences; some are reflective while others [...] "just try to get other people enthused about what they're doing with their lives".

Belle is prescribed with painkillers to help combat her anxiety disorder. However she becomes addicted to them.

Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO Networks praised the episode's writing and directing, {{explaining}} that [...] " [...] {{of the credit}} goes to Paul Lieberstein for his ruthlessly funny writing, but ol' J.J. really knows how to run with the material and make awkward situations just that much more painful with his direction, {{one of the best}} episodes of the series." [...] Buddy TV writer Oscar Dahl noted that [...] "besides a couple of crafty camera moves, his work was mostly invisible, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> you want from a director on The Office." [...] IGN's Brian Zoromski appreciated the spotlight on female characters Jan, Pam, and Karen, and thought there were [...] "quite a few great little moments this episode," [...] including [...] "a great Creed moment as he revealed he runs a fake ID company out of his car." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West enjoyed Karen conning Jim at the party, called Rashida Jones' performance [...] "brilliantly played"; West also liked Pam's newfound confidence, but believed she was [...] "dumb" [...] for telling Roy of her kiss with Jim.|$|E
500|$|Typically, when {{creating}} a manga chapter, an artist draws a rough draft or [...] "name", then {{a more detailed}} storyboard, and lastly the finalized version. However, Toriyama only draws a storyboard and then the final product simply because it is less work. He did not plan {{the details of his}} stories in advance. When he began the serialization of Dragon Ball, he had only prepared storyboards for three chapters. The author said that during its serialization he would wait about two days before his deadline to begin developing the storyboard. Starting around midnight, he would finish it around six in the morning and spend until that night inking, finishing everything in about a day-and-a-half. Unlike other artists, he had only one assistant helping him. Toriyama said that thinking only about the story for each chapter put him in some tight spots, particularly with Trunks' time travel. The only thing he has confidence in is his ability to connect a story back to an earlier aspect, making it seem to have been foreshadowing. The author used suggestions in fan mail he received, though generally doing the opposite of what was suggested. As an example, many fans told him not to kill Vegeta, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he did.|$|E

500|$|During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, [...] "I say {{my prayers}} {{for you and}} when I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you're {{at the head of}} the list." [...] Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others [...] "through the mercies of God". Many of the {{elements}} of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, [...] "This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible." [...] Jewett compares Mac's story to that of Abraham, because [...] "just like Sledge's story, [...] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God". As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> occurs, though—as Paul describes—Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: [...] "It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and to be grateful for him." ...|$|E
