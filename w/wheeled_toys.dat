50|$|Over time, the company's {{products}} {{evolved from}} old hay carts, laundry sets, and shovels into small toy wagons that grew in popularity and sophistication. Spoke and tin-rimmed wheels {{were replaced by}} stronger hardwood disc wheels, and finishes changed from wood dyes to colorful red enamels and glossy varnish. Over time, <b>wheeled</b> <b>toys</b> faded away and the product line was dominated by children's doll furniture that was originally finished in ivory and light green enamel, then later evolved to natural wood, maple and walnut finishes.|$|E
50|$|Overall, {{the degree}} of {{androgen}} exposure during prenatal and postnatal development may bias males and females toward specific cognitive processes, which are further reinforced through processes of socialization. The male interest in balls and <b>wheeled</b> <b>toys</b> may relate to the androgenised brains preference for objects that move through space. The higher levels of androgens in the developing male brain could elicit greater attraction to cars and balls, while lower levels of androgens elicit a preference for dolls and nurturing activities in the female brain.|$|E
5000|$|Toys {{for girls}} {{tend to be}} round and pink, while toys for boy tend to be angular and blue. The subtle {{characteristics}} of toys may differentially appeal to the developing brains of female and male children. [...] In a study of toy preferences of twelve- to 24-month-old infants, males spent more time looking at cars than females and females spent more time looking at dolls than males. No preference for color was found, and within each sex, {{both boys and girls}} preferred dolls to cars at age 12 months. Animal studies have lent further support for biologically determined gendered toy preferences. In a study of juvenile rhesus monkeys, when given the option between plush or <b>wheeled</b> <b>toys,</b> female monkeys gravitated toward plush toys, while male monkeys preferred toys with wheels. These findings suggest that gendered preferences for toys can occur without the socialization processes that we find in humans. [...] Female rhesus monkeys also tend to engage in more nurturing play activities, while males tend to engage in more rough-and-tumble play.|$|E
50|$|Hot Wheels Ultimate Racing {{features}} 26 vehicles {{based on}} Hot <b>Wheels</b> <b>toy</b> cars. The game features 11 courses, each one resembling real Hot <b>Wheels</b> <b>toy</b> racetracks. The courses are divided across four areas: Death Valley, Jungle, Metropolis, and Volcano. Each level features a major trap or enemy {{that must be}} avoided, such as giant boulders, a giant scorpion, and a giant octopus. The player can use turbo boosts to speed up in races, and slow motion to safely drift around corners; both abilities are depleted as they are used, and can be refilled by landing specific giant jumps or by avoiding the traps and enemies in each level. Performance upgrades, including better acceleration, improved handling, and new tires, can be won from races.|$|R

5000|$|During the 1950s, he {{also worked}} on systems for video filing of data {{utilizing}} magnetic or videotape to record documents, which could be read either on a monitor or from stop frame images. This process, along with mechanisms to control and manipulate the tape, were later licensed to Sony in 1974 for use in both audio and video cassette players. During this period, {{he also worked}} {{on a series of}} patents developing aspects of data and word processing technologies. He licensed twenty of these patents to IBM in 1981. IBM offered him a position running one of their research divisions, which Lemelson turned down because he wanted to remain an independent inventor. He also developed a series of patents on the manufacturing of integrated circuits, which he licensed to Texas Instruments in 1961. While working during this period on complex industrial products, ranging across the fields of robotics, lasers, computers, and electronics, Lemelson utilized some of the concepts in these more [...] "high tech" [...] areas and applied them to a variety of toy concepts, receiving patents for velcro target games, <b>wheeled</b> <b>toys,</b> board games, and improvements on the classic propeller beanie, among others. An exhibit of his toy inventions can be seen at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{childhood}} obesity {{can be addressed}} through study of how built environment characteristics can foster physical activity (PA) among preschool children. A sample of 355 behavior settings in 30 childcare center outdoor learning environments (OLEs) was studied using behavioral mapping techniques. Observers coded activity levels of preschool children across behavior settings. The level of PA observed in 6, 083 behavioral displays of children aged 3 to 5 was modeled using multi-level statistical techniques. Both adjacency and centrality of play settings {{were found to be}} important factors in increasing the degree of PA, net the effect of numerous other variables. In addition, child-to-child interaction was found to foster PA (more for boys than girls) whereas a teacher’s custodial actions limit PA. Results demonstrate that design of OLE form (particularly adjacency of behavior settings) and content (use of manipulable items such as <b>wheeled</b> <b>toys</b> and balls) facilitates higher levels of PA...|$|E
40|$|SummarySex {{differences}} in children's toy play are robust and similar across cultures [1, 2]. They include girls tending to play more with dolls and boys more with <b>wheeled</b> <b>toys</b> and pretend weaponry. This pattern {{is explained by}} socialization by elders and peers, male rejection of opposite-sex behavior and innate sex {{differences in}} activity preferences that are facilitated by specific toys [1]. Evidence for biological factors is controversial but mounting. For instance, girls who {{have been exposed to}} high fetal androgen levels are known to make relatively masculine toy choices [3]. Also, when presented with sex-stereotyped human toys, captive female monkeys play more with typically feminine toys, whereas male monkeys play more with masculine toys [1]. In human and nonhuman primates, juvenile females demonstrate a greater interest in infants, and males in rough-and-tumble play. This sex difference in activity preferences parallels adult behavior and may contribute to differences in toy play [1]. Here, we present the first evidence of sex differences in use of play objects in a wild primate, in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). We find that juveniles tend to carry sticks in a manner suggestive of rudimentary doll play and, as in children and captive monkeys, this behavior is more common in females than in males...|$|E
