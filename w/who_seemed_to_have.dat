5|$|The Vaishnava writers {{consisted}} of two groups <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no interaction with each other: the Brahmin commentators who typically wrote under the patronage of royalty; and the Bhakti (devotion) poets who played no role in courtly matters, instead taking the message of God {{to the people in}} the form of melodious songs composed using folk genres. Kumara Vyasa and Timmanna Kavi were well-known among the Brahmin commentators, while Purandara Dasa and Kanaka Dasa were the most famous of the Bhakti writers. The philosophy of Madhvacharya, which originated in the Kannada–speaking region in the 13th century, spread beyond its borders over the next two centuries. The itinerant haridasas, best described as mystic saint-poets, spread the philosophy of Madhvacharya in simple Kannada, winning mass appeal by preaching devotion to God and extolling the virtues of jnana (enlightenment), bhakti (devotion) and vairagya (detachment).|$|E

25|$|The Bohemians, {{desperate for}} allies against the emperor, applied to be {{admitted}} into the Protestant Union, which was led by their original candidate for the Bohemian throne, the Calvinist Frederick V, Elector Palatine. The Bohemians hinted Frederick would become King of Bohemia if he allowed them to join the Union and come under its protection. However, similar offers were made by {{other members of the}} Bohemian Estates to the Duke of Savoy, the Elector of Saxony, and the Prince of Transylvania. The Austrians, <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> intercepted every letter leaving Prague, made these duplicities public.|$|E
25|$|After the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, Emperor Nero {{accused the}} Christians as {{convenient}} scapegoats, who were later persecuted and killed. From that point on, Roman official policy towards Christianity tended towards persecution. During the various Imperial crises of the 3rd century, “contemporaries were predisposed to decode any crisis in religious terms”, {{regardless of their}} allegiance to particular practices or belief systems. Christianity drew its traditional base {{of support from the}} powerless, <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no religious stake in the well-being of the Roman State, and therefore threatened its existence. The majority of Rome’s elite continued to observe various forms of inclusive Hellenistic monism; Neoplatonism in particular accommodated the miraculous and the ascetic within a traditional Graeco-Roman cultic framework. Christians saw these practices as ungodly, and a primary cause of economic and political crisis.|$|E
25|$|The Pakistani opening pair, Azhar Ali and Fakhar Zaman, put on 128 runs before Ali was run out for 59 {{runs off}} the last ball of the 22nd over. Zaman, <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been out for 3 runs, only for a no ball by Jasprit Bumrah to save him, {{continued}} {{on his way to}} a 92-ball century – his first at ODI level – eventually falling to Hardik Pandya on the first ball of the 33rd over. He made 114 runs from 106 balls, which included twelve fours and three sixes. After his dismissal, the other Pakistani batsmen kept the score ticking over. Mohammad Hafeez plundered 57 not out from 37 balls, including four fours and three sixes. Pakistan eventually finished on 338/4 – their second-highest ODI score against India – after 50 overs. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the Indian bowlers, finishing with 1/44 from 10 overs (including two maidens).|$|E

25|$|It {{was a year}} of fire tiger in Jinki (the year 726). A monk {{from the}} Kii Province, Tōkōbō Yūkei was journeying in Adachigahara when the sun was about to set, and {{requested}} {{to be allowed to}} stay in a cave for lodging. An old lady lived in that cave. The old lady <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> kindly let in Yūkei then left the cave telling Yūkei that there was not enough firewood and she needed go outside to get some more but that during this time Yūkei must not look in the room further in. However, Yūkei opened the shutter out of curiosity, and when he peeked inside, there was a mountain of human bones piled up inside. Dumbfounded by this sight, Yūkei recalled a rumor of an onibaba at Adachigahara who would kill travelers and devour their blood and meat, and he got the feeling that this old lady was the rumored onibaba, so he fled the cave.|$|E
25|$|After {{the horrors}} of the Brisbane Test the MCC got to play another upcountry game played in a rodeo dustbowl. Hutton won the toss, batted and put on 112 with Bill Edrich (74), <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> regained his form, before he was out for 40. Peter May made 69 and Jim Wilson 61, but the last five wickets fell for 26 runs., from 291/5 to 317 all out, with the retired Queensland leg spinner Donald Watt taking 5/56 with help from fellow leggie Kenneth Jenkins (4/44). The innings had reduced the {{makeshift}} wicket to the consistency of a golf bunker and Hutton allowed it to be rebuilt for the next day. Opener Wilfred Brown top scored with 22 in the Country innings as they collapsed to 95 off 42.1 eight-ball overs with Peter Loader (3/22), Johnny Wardle (2/22), Bob Appleyard (2/18) and Tom Graveney (2/8) sharing the wickets. Hutton put them straight back in again and this time they did better, Brown making 78 and adding 108 for the second wicket with Renald Sippel (45), but Appleyard (7/51) spun his way {{through the rest of the}} batting order with some help from Graveney (2/49). The home team agreed to play past stumps so that the MCC could dismiss them, and the tourists won by an innings and 12 runs. This received some criticism in the Australian press, who forgot that Hutton had sportingly allowed the wicket to be remade.|$|E
25|$|It {{must have}} seemed like déjà {{vu all over again}} for England as they started day two, with Australia again poised for a large total. Border and Jones resumed and added a further 20 before Border was caught behind of Capel for 76. Jones was finally removed for 122, and Steve Waugh, <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> gone off the boil {{slightly}} following his blistering first three tests, went for a disappointing 14, clean bowled by Igglesden. Rain interrupted temporarily, but play soon resumed, and the South London crowd was then treated with a blistering display of low-order hitting from Queensland-born keeper Ian Healy, who battered 44 off 44 balls. His innings lasted less than an hour and contained six 4s, also taking the Australian total past 400 for the sixth time in as many tests. Eventually he fell, caught behind of the bowling of Derek Pringle, who then proceeded to tear into the tail, collecting the last four wickets. Although Trevor Hohns (30) and Merv Hughes (21) lasted long enough to take the Australian total to 468, the tourists were all out shortly before stumps. Enough play was left to force England to face an awkward few overs, and the Australians made the most of it, dislodging Graham Gooch LBW to Alderman for a third ball duck. England finished the day on 1 for 1, both not out batsmen yet to score.|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{her career}} in musical theater, Lopez re-entered the music scene upon her {{portrayal}} of the title role in the Selena biopic {{of the same name}} (1997). The role inspired her to launch a career in music; critics deemed it risky, noting that if she was unsuccessful in doing so, it would be an embarrassment and could damage her career. During the production of her debut album, On the 6 (1999), Lopez was aware that she received her recording contract on the premise of having an already established name in the entertainment industry; her goal for the album was to prove she had musical talent. The success of her debut single [...] "If You Had My Love" [...] and On the 6 came as a surprise to critics; their release made the [...] "popular actor even more popular", with both the music industry and the public becoming intrigued by [...] "this woman <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> so many different talents".|$|E

Beer was against the law. You could only drink shit like pints of peach schnapps". It consists of a two-note piano figure and a banjo part, over which Smith played a tape recording he had made of the wind howling outside his bedroom window. According to guitarist Marc Riley, [...] "He [...] just said he needed a tune, something Dylanish, and we knocked around on the piano {{in the studio and}} came up with that. But we hadn't heard the words until he suddenly did them." [...] The line [...] "Fall down flat in the Cafe Iol without a glance from the clientele" [...] describes an incident that had happened to Smith that morning. He had tripped in a nearby cafe and fallen across several tables.

500|$|Like many padres {{during the}} First World War, Keable reassessed his {{approach}} to his congregation. The men to whom he ministered, he came to believe, cared nothing for {{the finer points of}} Anglican theological dispute: from the church they wanted only [...] "entertainment and a barely spiritual form of practical Christianity." [...] Keable argued as much openly, suggesting that the Protestant chaplaincy in France should be amalgamated into the operations of the YMCA, and that only the Roman Catholic padres – <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> quite a different, more immediate relationship with their Celtic and Lancastrian companies – should remain. His public airing of these views attracted censure from the church (and particularly from Frank Weston, who was also serving), but reflected the openness that made him popular with the officers in France. A smoker, he was known to share whisky and sodas in the officers' mess, and – as does the title character in Simon Called Peter – to have become acquainted with a devoutly religious French prostitute.|$|E
500|$|Though the Vaishnava courtly {{writings}} in Kannada {{began with}} the Hoysala poet Rudrabhatta and the devotional song genre was initiated by Naraharitirtha, the Vaishnava movement began to exert a strong influence on Kannada literature only from the 15th century on. The Vaishnava writers consisted of two groups <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no interaction with each other: the Brahmin commentators who typically wrote under the patronage of royalty, and the Bhakti (devotion) writers (also known as haridasas) who played no role in courtly matters. [...] The Bhakti writers took the message of God {{to the people in}} the form of melodious songs composed using folk genres such as the kirthane (a musical composition with refrain, based on tune and rhythm), the suladi (a composition based on rhythm) and the ugabhoga (a composition based on melody). Kumara Vyasa and Timmanna Kavi were well-known among the Brahmin commentators, while Purandara Dasa and Kanaka Dasa were the most notable of the Bhakti writers.

500|$|Majora's Mask {{takes place}} {{a few months}} after [...] and begins with Link searching for his {{departed}} fairy, Navi. While riding through a forest in Hyrule on his horse Epona, Link is ambushed by the masked Skull Kid and his fairy accomplices Tatl and Tael, who steal both Epona and his musical instrument, the Ocarina of Time. Link follows them down a dark cave, where he confronts the Skull Kid, who curses him by turning him into a Deku Scrub. Tatl stops Link from going after the Skull Kid as the latter escapes with Tael through a door, but is then separated from them when the door closes behind them. Realizing she needs Link's help to find them, Tatl insists that they work together. Link follows the Skull Kid through the cave into the inside of the Clock Tower in the land of Termina. There, he meets the Happy Mask Salesman, <b>who</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been following him. The salesman offers to help Link heal his curse, in exchange for which he must retrieve both the Ocarina of Time and the Majora's Mask from the Skull Kid.
