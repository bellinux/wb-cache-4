5|$|Adrian Paul {{said that}} Vandernoot portrayed Lisa as a smoker to mark her {{out as a}} {{different}} character from Tessa. Paul also said that his lovemaking scene with Vandernoot had to reflect the different relationship between MacLeod and Lisa from that between MacLeod and Tessa. According to Paul, Lisa <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a temptress to MacLeod than was Tessa. According to Panzer, the original script featured Horton sending Lisa to kill MacLeod on the latter's barge. After reading the draft script, Adrian Paul thought the idea of Lisa trying to kill MacLeod on Tessa's grave would have a more dramatic effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero spawned {{an annual}} {{publication}} called G.I. Joe: Yearbook. G.I. Joe: Yearbook {{differed from the}} typical comic book annual publication in that it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a magazine. Each issue contained articles about the animated TV program, {{a summary of the}} comic book's plot to date, and one or two original stories written by Larry Hama. G.I. Joe: Yearbook ran until 1988.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Mayr and Peters {{described}} {{the anatomy of}} a very well preserved specimen of Archaeopteryx, and determined that its anatomy <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> non-avian theropods than previously understood. Specifically, they found that Archaeopteryx had a primitive palatine, unreversed hallux, and hyper-extendable second toe. Their phylogenetic analysis produced the controversial result that Confuciusornis was closer to Microraptor than to Archaeopteryx, making the Avialae a paraphyletic taxon. They also suggested that the ancestral paravian was able to fly or glide, and that the dromaeosaurids and troodontids were secondarily flightless (or had {{lost the ability to}} glide). Corfe and Butler criticized this work on methodological grounds.|$|E

5|$|Through {{studies of}} the present cloud {{structure}} and geology of the surface, combined {{with the fact that}} the luminosity of the Sun has increased by 25% since around 3.8billion years ago, it is thought that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion years ago <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that of Earth with liquid water on the surface. The runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and the rise of the levels of greenhouse gases that followed. Venus's atmosphere has therefore received a great deal of attention from those studying climate change on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Earth, Venus lacks a {{magnetic}} field. Its ionosphere separates the atmosphere {{from outer space}} and the solar wind. This ionised layer excludes the solar magnetic field, giving Venus a distinct magnetic environment. This is considered Venus's induced magnetosphere. Lighter gases, including water vapour, are continuously blown away by the solar wind through the induced magnetotail. It is speculated that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion years ago <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that of the Earth with liquid water on the surface. A runaway greenhouse effect may {{have been caused by}} the evaporation of the surface water and subsequent rise of the levels of other greenhouse gases.|$|E
5|$|After {{mismanagement}} {{during the}} late 1980s, Hibs were {{on the brink of}} financial ruin in 1990. Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Hearts, proposed a merger of the two clubs, but the Hibs fans believed that the proposal <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a hostile takeover. They formed the Hands off Hibs group to campaign for the continued existence of the club. This succeeded when a prominent local businessman, Kwik-Fit owner Sir Tom Farmer, acquired a controlling interest in Hibs. The fans were able to persuade Farmer to take control {{despite the fact that he}} had no great interest in football. Farmer was persuaded in part by the fact that a relative of his had been involved in the rescue of Hibs from financial ruin in the early 1890s. After the attempted takeover by Mercer, Hibs had a few good years in the early 1990s, winning the 1991 Scottish League Cup Final and finishing in the top five in the league in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Soon after Alex McLeish was appointed as manager in 1998, Hibs were relegated to the First Division, but immediately won promotion back to the SPL in 1999.|$|E

25|$|During the 1992 tour of Australia and New Zealand, Great Britain {{lost the}} first Ashes test 22–6 in Sydney.

25|$|Churchill {{claimed that}} the Germans must have {{suffered}} well over 15,000 casualties, while Admiral Cunningham felt that the figure <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> 22,000. Buckley, based on British intelligence assumptions of two enemies wounded for every one killed, gave an estimate of 16,800 casualties. The United States Army Center of Military History, citing {{a report of the}} Historical Branch of the British Cabinet Office, concluded that military historians accept estimates from 6,000–7,000 German casualties. The Australian Graves Commission counted about 5,000 German graves in the Maleme–Souda Bay area, at Rethymno and at Heraklion, that would have included deaths during the German occupation due to sickness, accidents or fighting with partisan forces.|$|E

Patients capable of working were asked to help with various duties, partly because of staff shortages in World War II. Unless considered dangerous, patients were allowed some liberties, such as being allowed to go fishing - an activity that provided patients with leisure time, while also helping the fishing business Truby King had long ago established at nearby Karitane.|$|E

25|$|The Joneses were {{assisted}} by many younger archaeologists and 'volunteers' from Britain and abroad {{including more than}} 3,000 students from many countries. The volunteers lived mainly in tents during the warmer months, but in the winter, occupied old caravans and sheds. The organisation of the camp, the feeding, the pay and the volunteers' welfare involved many individuals guided by terse memos signed by the initials 'muj'. Jones sometimes commented that it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a holiday camp than an archaeological dig. In {{the final stages of}} the dig, volunteers were supplemented by local unemployed people, funded by a government job creation scheme. Without this extra assistance, the excavation might not have been completed.|$|E
25|$|The Byzantinist John Birkenmeier {{argues that}} this array was {{dictated}} by the particular circumstances of the battle; the Byzantines knew the ground intimately as it was just beyond the walls of Constantinople, and {{were aware of the}} German dispositions, so that they did not need to use their horse archers as a scouting or screening force. Indeed, the Byzantine array <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that used by Alexios I Komnenos at the Battle of Philomelion in 1117, where the infantry were used to blunt enemy attacks allowing the cavalry to make controlled counter-attacks from behind the infantry's protective screen. In addition the lighter-armed troops, by being placed in the rear, could both cover a retreat or exploit a victory, depending on circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being an}} Islamic Sultanate, Mataram had never adopted Islamic culture, systems and {{institutions}} thoroughly. Its political system <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a syncretism of earlier Javanese Hindu civilisation merged with Islamic elements. The major formation {{took place during}} Sultan Agung's reign as he adapted Islam to the Hindu-Javanese tradition and introduced a new calendar in 1633 based on Islamic and Javanese practice. The arts during Sultan Agung's reign were a mixture of Islamic and Hindu-Javanese elements. The mainstream belief system was the Kejawen tradition, while the Islamic beliefs was held {{by a handful of}} kiyai or ulama religious elite clustering around Kauman area near court's mosque. The Javanese court ceremonies, culture and rituals of Mataram still bears Hindu-Buddhist elements. Javanese cultural elements, such as gamelan, batik, kris, wayang kulit and Javanese dance were formulated, codified and took its present form during this period, and inherited by its successors, the courts of Surakarta and Yogyakarta, and the princedom of Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman.|$|E
