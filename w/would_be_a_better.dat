5|$|Beginning in 1976, Bob Lewis, an {{environmental}} activist in Aspen, organized revegetation efforts on some {{sections of the}} pass near the road that were having serious erosion problems. He realized eventually that a dedicated nonprofit organization <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> way to address the many issues that remained. The Independence Pass Foundation (IPF) was established in 1989. Its first project, coordinated with the Forest Service, CDOT and Pitkin County, was the reconstruction of a curve near the popular Weller Lake trailhead.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Harold Grad {{theorized that}} a high-beta plasma {{pressure}} {{combined with a}} cusped magnetic field would improve plasma confinement. A diamagnetic plasma rejects the external fields and plugs the cusps. This system <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> trap.|$|R

30|$|Limitations in the {{collection}} of quantitative information about water and energy usage have made it difficult to actually measure improvements, which <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> indicator of improvement. As a result of this, mostly observations of the SUWAMA team and teachers and the logbooks were used to determine results.|$|R
5|$|Candidate state {{reptiles}} are not {{assured of}} making it through the legislative process. In Minnesota, 1998 and 1999 bills proposing the Blanding's turtle were unsuccessful. In Pennsylvania in 2009, the House passed an eastern box turtle bill which died in the Senate without a vote. Virginia proponents of the eastern box turtle have seen 1999 and 2009 bids fail. For the most recent attempt, a legislative opponent of the turtle {{said it was too}} cowardly for the state because of its defensive shell, and suggested the rattlesnake <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> representative. The turtle also drew scorn for often perishing on roads, but its most serious problem was a too-close association with bordering state, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, John Bell Hatcher {{is backing}} out of paying his share of a card game by drawing his revolver. He has taken to gambling, as Marsh, who employs him as a bone hunter, is not {{providing}} him with enough funds. Marsh lobbies the Bureau of Indian Affairs on behalf of Red Cloud, but also visits with the Geological Survey, insinuating that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> leader of the USGS than Cope. After learning about Sam Smith's attempted sabotage of Cope and once again receiving no payment from Marsh, Hatcher leaves his employ. Marsh, now representing the survey, heads west with wealthy businessmen, scoffing at the financial misfortunes of Cope, whose investments have failed.|$|E
5|$|The name Great Northern Highway {{was first}} {{proposed}} in October 1940 by the state's Nomenclature Advisory Committee, {{to describe the}} main route from Midland to Geraldton, Western Australia. This was following the naming of the Great Eastern and Great Southern highways. The Midland Junction Municipal Council approved the name, however at the Geraldton Municipal Council meeting, one councillor suggested that Great Midland Highway <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> name. The reasoning was that Geraldton was in {{the centre of the}} state's coastline, not in the north. It was explained that the highway would continue north past Geraldton, and the council voted to approve the name.|$|E

40|$|Binding of {{methadone}} in {{body tissues}} limits {{the rise in}} plasma concentration and prolongs the pharmacological action in patients receiving a daily maintenance dose.

5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> projectile than chromium for {{the synthesis of}} element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but {{it would probably be}} the most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work could in the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
5|$|In August 1728, Linnaeus {{decided to}} attend Uppsala University {{on the advice}} of Rothman, who {{believed}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, {{which was one of the}} richest botanical libraries in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Some reports {{suggested}} that the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program to replace the M113 family of vehicles was being favored over the GCV program. While procurement of the AMPV fleet would cost over $5 billion, the Government Accountability Office estimated the GCV fleet would cost $37 billion. In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said the AMPV <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 Congressional Research Service report {{suggested that}} given budgetary constraints, the GCV program may be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion could focus on {{a decision by the}} Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.|$|E

[...] In addition, Teller's false claims that Stanislaw Ulam made no {{significant contribution to}} the development of the hydrogen bomb (despite Ulam's key insights of using compression and staging elements to generate the thermonuclear reaction) and his personal attacks on Oppenheimer caused great animosity towards Teller within the general physics community.|$|R
40|$|In {{proof of}} the story about Medea's rule over Corinth, the scholiast quotes some verses coming {{apparently}} from Simonides, although previously he named Eumelos too. There {{is no doubt that}} this poet of the Corinthian school of epic <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> much <b>better</b> authority than Simonides <b>is.</b> <b>A</b> new examination of the quotations shows that originally there were two separate verses, one from Eumelos, the other from Simonides.

5|$|The news of Daenerys's {{pregnancy}} {{reaches the}} Small Council, delivered {{by one of}} Varys's spies. Fearing a possible invasion by the Targaryen/Dothraki alliance, Robert orders {{that she and her}} unborn child, along with Viserys, be assassinated. Ned refuses to obey such a dishonorable order since Robert's hatred for Targaryens is clouding his judgment and ordering such an assassination will make him no better than the Mad King. When Robert's mind is clearly made, Ned resigns the office of Hand of the King, much to Robert's anger. As Robert drinks in sorrow over his fight with Ned, Cersei visits Robert and he explains why he takes the Dothraki threat seriously. Meanwhile, Robert's youngest brother Renly is with his lover, Ser Loras. Loras convinces Renly that he should be king because Loras believes that Renly <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> ruler than either his brothers or nephews.|$|E

The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. Deciding that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain, where they see a structure, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and the stars in the night sky time lapse behind him. He wakes the woman to take his turn to sleep. When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning back if they do not find people.|$|E
25|$|In 1870 Dohrn {{decided that}} Naples <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> place for his Station.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOn 16 December 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 2832 (XXVI) declaring the Indian Ocean, within limits to be determined, together with its air space and sea bed, to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> zone of peace. The resolution also {{call upon the}} Great Powers {{to enter into negotiations}} with the littoral states of the region to halt any further association of their military presence and to eliminate all bases and other Great Power competition. This paper examines the history of the zone of peace process {{as it relates to the}} interests of three states: The United States, the Soviet Union, and India. Particular attention is devoted to the Soviet and Indian positions, and how each nation's regional interests have led to divergent views on the topic. The work concludes that previous attempts to make the Indian Ocean into a zone of peace have concentrated on drafting international resolutions and reducing naval arms, while ignoring the central problem of competing national interests. Confidence-building measures related to these interests <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>betters</b> approach, now that naval arms reduction talks are deadlocked. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

His remit of opposing steel nationalisation came to naught as given his tiny majority Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson did not proceed with this measure. Macleod’s speech opposing steel nationalisation had been trailed as his comeback to frontline politics, but in the event was a damp squib. Nigel Fisher wrote {{that it was the}} only really bad speech of his career. Macleod did not contest the first ever Conservative Party leadership election in 1965, but backed Edward Heath, whom he did not particularly like but thought <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> leader than Maudling.
