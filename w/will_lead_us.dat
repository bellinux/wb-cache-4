25|$|My illness {{helped me}} to see that what was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood. The 1980s were about {{acquiring}} – acquiring wealth, power, prestige. I know. I acquired more wealth, power, and prestige than most. But you can acquire all you want and still feel empty. What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't I pay for an evening with friends? It took a deadly illness to put me eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime. I don't know who <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.|$|E

40|$|In the {{encounter}} between Levinas’ ethical metaphysics and feminist liberation theology, {{there is a}} divide between eros and agape. Levinas takes a grave view of agape in terms of one’s human responsibility that must always come before one’s freedom and self-concern. In response to a feminist liberation theological perception of eros, the article will engage Levinas’ uncompromising proclamation of disinterested love. It is a “crooked road” one follows along the journey of disinterestedness.

2500|$|Ben-Gurion said {{he wanted}} to [...] "concentrate the masses of our people in this country [...] and its environs." [...] When he {{proposed}} accepting the Peel proposals in 1937, which included a Jewish state in part of Palestine, Ben-Gurion told the twentieth Zionist Congress, [...] "The Jewish state now being offered to us is not the Zionist objective. [...] But it can serve as a decisive stage along the path to greater Zionist implementation. It will consolidate in Palestine, within the shortest possible time, the real Jewish force, which <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> to our historic goal". In a discussion in the Jewish Agency he said that he wanted a Jewish-Arab agreement [...] "on the assumption that after we become a strong force, {{as a result of the}} creation of the state, we shall abolish partition and expand to the whole of Palestine." ...|$|E

30|$|Within the post-national {{space of}} “Europe” the legal {{innovation}} {{of the principle}} of non-discrimination by nationality also negates one of the cornerstones of Kymlicka’s arguments: that we owe something more to our co-nationals out of egalitarian membership; that is, beyond the humanitarian charity that may <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> to be fleetingly fair to the non-nationals among us. For, as Kymlicka emphatically must conclude, human rights alone <b>will</b> not <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> to share our welfare cake with non-nationals once their basic humanity has been recognised.|$|R
60|$|We {{must first}} {{escape from the}} {{atmosphere}} and the methods of Paris. Those who controlled the Conference may bow before the gusts of popular opinion, but they <b>will</b> never <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> out of our troubles. It is hardly to be supposed that the Council of Four can retrace their steps, even if they wished to do so. The replacement of the existing Governments of Europe is, therefore, an almost indispensable preliminary.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} mathematically {{construct}} the F and R operators, we can consider permutations of these F and R operators. We {{know that if}} we sequentially change the basis that we are operating on, this <b>will</b> eventually <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> {{back to the same}} basis. Similarly, we know that if we braid anyons around each-other a certain number of times, this <b>will</b> <b>lead</b> back to the same state. These axioms are called the pentagonal and hexagonal axioms respectively as performing the operation can be visualized with a pentagon/hexagon of state transformations. Although mathematically difficult, these can be approached much more successfully visually.|$|R
40|$|Speciation of ions in {{groundwater}} is {{very important}} to understand its hydrogeochemical evolutions from its origin to its present status. The speciation will help to understand the geochemical process which controls their evolution and their present day environmental conditions which <b>will</b> ultimately <b>lead</b> <b>us</b> to utilize them directly or after the required treatment process to make them safe and useable. Some of the ions and their speciation were discussed in this line in this chapter...|$|R

40|$|Achieving {{high levels}} of agility and {{resilience}} in upcoming military organizations will require new {{ways of thinking about}} command and control. As traditional military organizations are gradually being equipped for new types of network-centric missions, it becomes obvious that we need rethink coordination strategies.
