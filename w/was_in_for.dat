5|$|After {{recovering}} from his hip surgery, Costello returned to active competition at age 56. The {{fact that he}} was able to recover from such a major injury is credited to his almost-fanatical style of healthy living. As a devout vegan, Costello credited his meat-free diet with his recovery, as well as the remarkable shape he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a man of his age.|$|E
5|$|With {{every major}} player back from 1994, and the {{addition}} of Auriemma's most highly ranked recruit to date (Connecticut Player of the Year Nykesha Sales), UConn <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a season to remember in 1994–95. The season started with an 80-point win over Morgan State; two weeks later, UConn defeated powerhouse North Carolina State by 23 points on the road. This season also saw the birth of one of the greatest rivalries in college sports, the UConn-Tennessee rivalry, that began when the two teams {{met for the first time}} on Martin Luther King Day at Gampel Pavilion. UConn defeated Tennessee 77–66 in front of a sold-out crowd in a game televised on ESPN and soon afterwards was ranked #1 in the polls for the first time in program history.|$|E

Patrick Alan <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> Peter Lamarr briefly, before Lamarr left in 1991, and was permanently replaced by Rohan Delano Turney. Johnny Stewart joined the group in 1963 and left in 1993 in Las Vegas. He later joined The Platters and continued his singing career. This lineup lasted until 1996, when Cofie was out and Jason Leigh was in. Leigh was replaced after two years by the returning Lamarr. Leigh later returned on the next tour and Lamarr was replaced by the returning Patrick Alan.|$|E
25|$|Pleased {{with his}} success so far, and expecting Napoleon {{to retreat to}} {{the west bank of the}} Vistula, Bennigsen <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a surprise. Far from retreating, the French emperor {{launched}} a dangerous counterattack on 1 February. Napoleon saw that Bennigsen had advanced so far west that there was an opportunity to hit the Russian army in the left flank and rear. He ordered Bernadotte to continue retreating to tempt Bennigsen to move westward into the trap. Lannes with the V Corps and General of Division Nicolas Léonard Beker's dragoon division would keep an eye on Ivan Essen's detached force to the northeast of Warsaw. (These forces clashed in the Battle of Ostrołęka on 16 February.) Napoleon ordered the corps of Davout, Soult, Augereau, Murat, and the Imperial Guard northward to Allenstein, while Ney covered the gap between the main body and Bernadotte.|$|E
500|$|Wales {{hosted the}} All Blacks at Cardiff Arms Park in November 1978, losing 13–12 after a late penalty goal by the {{replacement}} All Black fullback, Brian McKechnie. The penalty was controversial because All Black lock Andy Haden had dived {{out of a}} line-out {{in an attempt to}} earn a penalty. Haden later admitted that he and Frank Oliver had pre-agreed this tactic should the All Blacks find themselves in difficulties. Referee Roger Quittenton was roasted by the press for failing to notice the dive, but he later stated he had the penalty <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> Welsh lock Geoff Wheel for jumping off the shoulder of Frank Oliver. Quittenton later said, [...] "Haden's perception is that his dive secured the penalty. That is a load of rubbish". The All Blacks went on to secure their first Home Nations Grand Slam. Wales then {{went on to win the}} 1979 Five Nations with a Triple Crown.|$|E

500|$|On November 6, Mondale and Ferraro {{lost the}} general {{election}} in a landslide. They received only 41percent {{of the popular vote}} compared to Reagan and Bush's 59percent, and in the Electoral College won only Mondale's home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. The ticket even lost Ferraro's to congressional district, which had long been one of the more conservative districts in New York City; it tended to vote Republican in presidential races. Ferraro's presence on the ticket had little measurable effect overall. Reagan captured 55percent of women voters and about the same share of Catholic voters, the latter being the highest level yet for a Republican presidential candidate. Of the tenth of voters who decided based on the vice-presidential candidates, 54percent went to Mondale–Ferraro, establishing that Ferraro provided a net gain to the Democrats of 0.8percent. Reagan's personal appeal and campaign themes of prosperity and [...] "It's morning again in America" [...] were quite strong, while Mondale's liberal campaign alienated Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who usually voted Democratic. Political observers generally agree that no combination of Democrats could have won the election in 1984. Mondale himself would later reflect that [...] "I knew that I <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> it with Reagan" [...] and that he had no regrets about choosing Ferraro.|$|E

2500|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their tough road {{loss to the}} Patriots, the Chiefs hosted their AFC West rival, the Oakland Raiders. [...] In the first quarter, Kansas City trailed early as Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski got a 56-yard and a 25-yard field goal. Chiefs quarterback Damon Huard {{suffered}} a neck injury {{in the first quarter}} and Tyler Thigpen substituted as quarterback {{for the remainder of the}} game. Huard <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> Kansas City's first two series, but didn't return after throwing an interception late in the second quarter. Marques Hagans, who was listed on the Chiefs' roster as a wide receiver, checked in as quarterback for several draw plays. The Chiefs announced at the end of the third quarter that Huard sustained [...] "mild head trauma," [...] a move deemed controversial as Huard never sought medical attention in the following days.|$|E

2500|$|Having won the {{previous}} two encounters {{between himself and the}} Brit, Federer needed to win this match in order to finally gain his head to head advantage over Murray {{for the first time since}} 2005. Murray also needed to win this match in straight sets in order to be able to progress to the semi-final stage of the tournament. [...] However the Brit <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a hard time as Federer was in no mood to give Murray any chance of winning. [...] Murray was two points away from a double bagel but managed to hold serve. Federer won the next game and handed Murray his worst loss since losing to Novak Djokovic in the semifinals at the 2007 Sony Ericsson Open. [...] With this win, Federer became the first man to score a 6–0 set on all of his big four rivals.|$|E
