5|$|Almost {{all species}} in the genus Myrmecia are found in Australia and its coastal islands. M. apicalis is the only species not native to Australia, and is only found in the Isle of Pines, New Caledonia. Only one ant has ever {{established}} nests outside its native range; M. brevinoda was first discovered in New Zealand in 1940, and the ant was recorded in Devonport in 1948, 1965 and 1981, where a single nest was destroyed. Sources suggest the ant was introduced to New Zealand through human activity; they were found inside a <b>wooden</b> <b>crate</b> brought from Australia. While no eradication attempt {{was made by the}} New Zealand government, the ant has not been found in the country since 1981 and is presumed to have been eradicated.|$|E
5|$|As well as passengers, Nairana {{regularly}} carried cargo, including gold bullion, {{and live}} {{animals such as}} horses and cattle between Tasmania and the mainland. A Tasmanian devil being transported to Melbourne Zoo in a <b>wooden</b> <b>crate</b> placed {{in one of the}} ship's four horse stalls escaped by chewing a hole through its box, and was never seen again. In 1934, her code letters were changed to VJGY. Nairana was withdrawn from service in December 1935 {{as a result of a}} ship workers' strike, returning to the Bass Strait run in the new year. As she neared Port Phillip Bay on 12 April 1936, on a clear day with apparently calm seas, she was again struck by a rogue wave and rolled onto her port side before swinging back over to starboard and eventually righting. The impact injured most of her 88 passengers and killed four, including a family of three who disappeared after being swept overboard. Despite this, she proceeded to her berth in the Yarra River, having sustained only minor damage.|$|E

Clips of Carey leaning against a wall and sitting on some steps looking on at what is happening are shown.

After taking her to his hideout, he reveals that the glass heart was his by nature of having been born with it, and that after working with Walter, Peter loved him enough to donate it to him. However, he took it back after learning a terrible secret behind his inventions: they were stolen from children's dreams and replaced with nightmares. Later, the house is under attack by an army of watchers. Olivia fights them off, but not before they manage to take Peter's heart with them. After placing batteries in his heart cavity {{to act as a}} temporary measure, Olivia discovers that Walter set up the attack. In the confrontation, Walter apologises for his misdeeds and promises to change. However, Peter does not forgive Walter and leaves him, ending the story.|$|E

They would travel easiest if slung and made fast in a strong <b>wooden</b> <b>crate</b> or framework, to be fixed {{on the body of}} the carriage. A white covering is necessary for a wooden boat, on account of the sun: both boat and covering should be frequently examined. Mr. Richardson and his party took a boat, divided in four quarters, on camel-back across the Sahara, {{all the way from the}} Mediterranean to Lake Tchad. A portable framework of metal tubes, to be covered with india-rubber sheeting on arrival, was suggested to me by a very competent authority, the late Mr. M'Gregor Laird.|$|E

[...] He pushed violently; the door swung with a creak and a clatter, disclosing to his intense astonishment the low dungeon-like interior illuminated by a lurid, wavering glare. A turmoil of smoke eddied down upon an empty <b>wooden</b> <b>crate</b> in the middle of the floor, a litter of rags and straw tried to soar, but only stirred feebly in the draught. She had thrust the light through the bars of the window. He saw her bare round arm extended and rigid, holding up the torch with the steadiness of an iron bracket. A conical ragged heap of old mats cumbered a distant corner almost to the ceiling, and that was all.|$|E
