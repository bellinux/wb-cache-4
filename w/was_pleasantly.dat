500|$|Harrison <b>was</b> <b>pleasantly</b> {{surprised}} {{when he got a}} call from Beyoncé, who was working {{on one of the most}} anticipated albums of the year.

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} from {{television}} critics were generally positive. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the scenes set at Massive Dynamic, and thought the episode {{did a good job}} tricking the audience into thinking Peter was not responsible for the shapeshifter killings.

Hanson particularly loved the opening's first few minutes, and like Tucker, he <b>was</b> <b>pleasantly</b> surprised about Peter and the murders. The A.V.

500|$|James {{signed with}} the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions in 1947. He was still {{eligible}} to play in college at the time, but wartime rules allowed him to skip to the professional ranks and play for the Lions, who had selected him in the 1947 NFL Draft. James broke his arm {{in the second game}} of the season, and he sat on the sidelines {{for the rest of the}} year. Detroit did not renew his contract, and the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, picked him up. He started at right defensive halfback in 1948 opposite Tommy Colella and intercepted four passes as the Browns went 15–0 and won the All-America Football Conference championship. Brown <b>was</b> <b>pleasantly</b> surprised by his abilities on defense. [...] "Tommy always was a pretty good man on defense at Massillon and Ohio State", he said in 1948.

Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee out to lunch, who he called [...] "one of the nicest and most unassuming guys you could hope to meet." [...] Lee continued, [...] "Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like my table manners, because I haven't been invited back for another guest shot.
