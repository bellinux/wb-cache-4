5|$|Massage therapy {{does not}} appear to provide much benefit for acute low back pain. A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute low back pain massage therapy was better than no {{treatment}} for pain only in the short-term. There was no effect for improving function. For chronic low back pain massage therapy was no better than no treatment for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. The overall quality of the evidence <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain.|$|E
5|$|The 11 Canis-Minorids, {{also called}} the Beta Canis Minorids, are a meteor shower that arise near the fifth-magnitude star 11 Canis Minoris and were {{discovered}} in 1964 by Keith Hindley, who investigated their trajectory and proposed a common origin with the comet D/1917 F1 Mellish. However, this conclusion has been refuted subsequently {{as the number of}} orbits analysed <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> their trajectories too disparate to confirm a link. They last from 4 to 15 December, peaking over 10 and 11 December.|$|E
5|$|Due to the fog, {{visibility}} <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> the {{two main}} forces failed to notice Oxford's victory over Hastings. As such, {{the collapse of the}} Yorkist left wing had little (if any) effect on morale of either side. The fighting between Montagu's and Edward's groups was evenly matched and intense. The Lancastrian left wing, however, was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart; Gloucester exploited the misaligned forces and beat Exeter back. Progress for Edward's brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope. Nonetheless, the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian left wing rotated the entire battle line. Warwick, seeing the shift, ordered most of his reserves to help ease the pressure on Exeter, and took the rest into fighting at the centre. Gradually, the battle line settled to an orientation that slanted north-east to south-west.|$|E

5|$|Godley's II ANZAC Corps {{played an}} {{important}} role in the Passchendaele offensive in October 1917. Following the success of his corps at the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October 1917, Godley believed the morale of the Germans <b>was</b> <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> pushed for further attacks to secure the Passchendaele Ridge. This was in concert with the preference of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force. However, Godley's superior officer, General Herbert Plumer, preferred to halt the offensive as the weather had deteriorated immediately after the battle. An attack on 9 October by the 49th and 66th Divisions, both British formations attached to II ANZAC Corps, was hampered by the poor weather which showed no signs of abating and achieved very limited gains.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March, Pattle flew {{his first}} {{missions}} with No. 33 Squadron, now based at Larissa. They flew as escort for Blenheims from No. 84 Squadron over the Pindus Mountains and Paramythia. Supported by No. 112 Squadron Gladiators, they flew to raid Berat. The cloud base <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> thick and they descended below it at 1,900 feet. The bombers attacked and two Hurricanes were badly damaged by ground fire. One of the squadron {{was shot down}} by a Fiat G.50 and bailed out — the Italians disappeared before they could retaliate. In the afternoon, he was briefed to strafe the heavily defended Fieri airfield. It was an unpopular sort of mission. At 25,000 feet, they were intercepted and a dogfight began with G.50s and Macchi C.200s. Only Pattle and one other Hurricane attacked the airfield. Furious, Pattle berated the pilots for not carrying out their primary assignment. He had claimed one enemy fighter as a probable and proceeded to the airfield to claim another victory — his 25th — and claimed another three on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Monitor withdrew, Virginia had {{run aground}} {{at which time}} Commander Jones {{came down from the}} spar deck only to find the gun crews not {{returning}} fire. Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> precious and given Monitors resistance to shot after two hours of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition. Virginia soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk, believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle. Greene, now in command, did not pursue Virginia and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota, an action for which he was later criticized.|$|E

5|$|The French {{defenders}} of the island were weakened by years of isolation caused by the British blockade. Although the available French troops numbered between 3,000 and 4,000, there was an epidemic {{on the island and}} a significant proportion of the garrison, principally formed by the 66e Régiment, were unfit for duty. Apart from the capital, the rest of the island's defences were manned by a militia formed from local inhabitants, among whom morale <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> desertion rates high. Military and food stores of all kinds were in short supply and the governor, General Jean Augustin Ernouf was unable to maintain garrisons around the island's extensive perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The Montreal team in Canada {{depended}} on the Americans for supplies of heavy water from the US heavy water plant in Trail, British Columbia, (which was under American contract), as well as technical information about plutonium. The Americans {{said that they would}} give heavy water to the Montreal group only if it agreed to direct its research along the limited lines suggested by du Pont. Despite doing much good work, by June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab had come to a complete standstill. Morale <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. In April 1944, a Combined Policy Committee meeting in Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. John Cockcroft became the director. The Americans supported the project with information and visits. They also supplied material, for example, uranium and heavy water. The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and in 1946 the Montreal Laboratory was closed. The project developed the ZEEP reactor, which went critical in September 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of the Clinton Laboratories passed from Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, and then to Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended that all work on reactors be concentrated at the Argonne National Laboratory, the successor to the Metallurgical Laboratory, near Chicago. There was also competition for staff and resources from the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York. Morale <b>was</b> <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> {{no one could be}} found to take on the job of Director of Research at the laboratory, renamed the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in January 1948. At least six people turned down the job before Union Carbide's acting Director, Nelson (Bunny) Rucker, asked Weinberg to become Director of Research in March 1948.|$|E

5|$|To build {{a working}} nuclear reactor, the Montreal Laboratory {{depended}} on the Americans for heavy water from Trail, which was under American contract, {{but this was not}} forthcoming. An American request for Halban to come to New York to discuss heavy water with Fermi and Urey was turned down by the British, and the Americans brought cooperation to a standstill. By June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab had come to a halt. Morale <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. The British government seriously considered going it alone on developing nuclear weapons, despite the cost and the expected length of the project. In August 1943, Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King hosted the Quebec Conference, at which Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt came together, and agreed to resume cooperation. The Quebec Agreement subsumed Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project, and established the Combined Policy Committee, on which Canada was represented by Howe, to control the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the 1948 Arab Israeli War, the {{majority}} of volunteer airmen returned home, and 69 Squadron once again went through a period of reorganization. From an English-speaking outfit it was transformed into a Hebrew speaking unit. Training was stepped up to qualify Israelis to take over vacated positions and the squadron settled into a peacetime routine, with the B-17s conducting bombing and cloud seeding tests and participating in IDF exercises. The IAF itself was undergoing major changes, and in early May 1949 69 Squadron relocated to Tel Nof. In October 1951 the squadron moved once more, this time to Hatzor. In December 1952 the three B-17 was joined by three PBY Catalinas, acquired to guarantee supply to the town of Eilat at Israel's southern extremity. Utilization of these aircraft, however, <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> they were soon withdrawn from service with the squadron. Spares, meanwhile, were also hampering B-17 operations and in March 1954 69 Squadron was deactivated and its assests handed over to 103 Squadron, which soon retired the Catalinas but continued to operate the three B-17s.|$|E
5|$|Zino's petrel {{has a very}} {{restricted}} {{range on}} the mountaintops of a single island, and is the most endangered European seabird. The birds, already confined to a limited area when discovered, {{were thought to be}} extinct by the mid-twentieth century. Two freshly fledged juveniles were found within the walls of the governor's palace in Funchal in the early 1940s, presumably attracted there by lights, but the species was not seen again until 1969. In 1969, Paul Zino played a tape of Fea's petrel from Bugio to a shepherd from Curral das Freiras; he immediately recognised the call, and led the researchers to the remaining nesting area. Predation by introduced rats meant that breeding success in the small population <b>was</b> <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> no young at all fledged in 1985. The Freira Conservation Project was founded in 1986 with the aim of increasing the population of Zino's petrel by controlling rats and human interference; the control was extended to cats after the mass predation of 1990.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B.aemula grew on ridges (dry heath) and B. oblongifolia on slopes (wet heath), {{and the two}} species did not overlap. Manipulation of {{seedlings}} in the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath. Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species {{did not appear to}} impact negatively on each other. A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced seedlings in low numbers but the attrition rate <b>was</b> <b>low,</b> <b>and</b> that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that Banksia aemula seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in {{the presence or absence of}} recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of survival) is unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, B.aemula was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Ayutthaya sat on {{an island}} {{surrounded}} by three rivers—the Lopburi River to the north, the Chao Phraya River {{to the west and}} south, and the Pa Sak River to the east, forming a formidable natural moat. The Chao Phraya basin where Ayutthaya is situated <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> prone to flooding—especially intense during the rainy season when torrential waters flowed in great quantity from the north along the Lopburi River. This flood would begin approximately in July and end somewhere between October and November, giving Tabinshwehti only five months to capture Ayutthaya—otherwise his camp grounds and supply routes would be flooded. There was also the possibility that the flood could trap his forces. The low, swampy area around the city was laced with numerous canals thronging with gun boats armed with cannon to repulse any attempt at an attack on the city. Also, the Burmese had only small cannon that they had brought with them, while the Siamese had large cannon mounted along the city walls. The Burmese had the city surrounded, but without the ability to cross the rivers or breach the city walls with cannon fire, were left to camp around it instead, while the interconnected waterways to the north and south made it fairly easy to resupply the defenders in the city. Fifty Portuguese mercenaries, who had elected Galeote Pereira as their captain, defended the weakest part of the city wall for Maha Chakkraphat. Unable to take the city conventionally, Tabinshwehti offered bribes to these defenders. The Portuguese reacted with derision, and refused. When a Siamese commander heard of this, he swung open the gates of the city and dared the Burmese King to bring the money—a dare that was ignored.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to spread into inland areas. In the east, the superb fairywren spread into Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> the island was connected {{with the rest of the}} continent via a land bridge. What gave rise to subspecies cyaneus became isolated as the sea levels rose. The Bass Strait forms were isolated from Tasmania but more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E

5|$|The Bears won {{the coin}} toss and elected to defer. The 49ers went three-and-out and punted; on the return, the Bears behaved as if Marc Mariani was {{returning}} {{on one side}} of the field, though Bryce Callahan actually returned it, and scored on the 65-yard play. However, a holding penalty on linebacker LaRoy Reynolds nullified the play. The Bears eventually scored a field goal with Robbie Gould's 40-yard kick. After the 49ers punted again, the Bears scored another field goal, this one being 51 yards. San Francisco subsequently punted, but scored on the second play of the Bears' next drive when Jimmie Ward intercepted Jay Cutler's screen pass for Alshon Jeffery and returned it 29 yards for the touchdown; the score remained tied after defensive tackle Eddie Goldman blocked the extra point. Chicago's next drive lasted into the second quarter, where Matt Forte took advantage of two consecutive 14-yard plays to score on a five-yard run. The 49ers scored on their drive with Shaun Draughn's one-yard touchdown run to tie the score. The first half ended with both teams tied 13–13. The Bears received the ball to start the third quarter, but failed to score when new long snapper Patrick Scales' snap <b>was</b> <b>low</b> <b>and</b> Gould missed the 40-yard kick. The next seven drives all ended in punts; the trend was broken when Ka'Deem Carey scored on a four-yard run, followed by San Francisco retaliating with Gabbert scoring on a 44-yard run. On the ensuing kickoff, Deonte Thompson's return went 74 yards to reach the 49ers' 28-yard line. On the drive, the Bears ran on each play, forcing the 49ers to use all three timeouts. With two seconds left, Gould's 36-yard field goal sailed wide left, resulting in overtime. The 49ers won the coin toss but punted, though the Bears were also forced to punt. On the first play of the next series, Gabbert threw a 71-yard touchdown pass to Torrey Smith to seal the win.|$|E
