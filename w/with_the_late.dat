5|$|In {{the northwestern}} and northeastern {{parts of the}} shield volcano, basanite lava flows were erupted and are volumetrically subordinate. These {{represent}} the youngest known lavas of the Itcha Range. However, a cinder cone {{in the middle of}} the shield could be much younger, perhaps as young as the basanites at Nazko Cone to the east, which were erupted 340,000to 7,100years ago. The older basanites in the Itcha Range may have been erupted contemporaneously <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> feldspar hawaiites.|$|E
5|$|Seven offered Johns the 10.30pm Thursday timeslot, which Johns had {{the option}} of declining owing to a clause in his contract. Co-host Webcke was not happy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> time, and Johns' {{producers}} perceived that there may be difficulty in booking guests at that time. Consequently, Johns declined the offer and sat out 2011 on full pay. It has also been suggested that success of The Matty Johns Show depended on the success of related AFL show The Bounce, which failed in 2010. The future of The Matty Johns Show is currently unclear.|$|E

5|$|Stela 13 {{dates to}} the Late Preclassic. It is badly damaged, having been broken in two parts. It is carved in early Maya style and bears a design {{representing}} a stylised serpentine head, very similar to a monument found at Kaminaljuyu. Stela13 was erected {{at the base of}} the south side of Structure7A. At the base of the stela was found a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels, 33 prismatic obsidian blades, as well as other artifacts. The stela and the offering are associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Late</b> Preclassic royal tomb known as Burial1.|$|E
5|$|Unlike early Shinto shrines, early Buddhist temples {{were highly}} {{ornamental}} and strictly symmetrical. Starting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 7th century Hōryū-ji, temples {{began to move}} towards indigenous methods expressed by irregular ground plans that resulted in an asymmetric arrangement of buildings, greater use of natural materials such as cypress bark instead of roof tiling, and an increased awareness of natural environment with the placement of buildings among trees. This adaption was assisted by the syncretism of Shinto and Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|While the MacBook Pro largely {{followed}} the industrial design standard {{set by the}} PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – the glossy display, the sunken keyboard design and the non-mechanical magnetic latch. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 2007 revision, the keyboard received several changes to closely mirror the one which shipped with the iMac, by adding the same keyboard short-cut to control multimedia, and removing the embedded numeric keypad and the Apple logo from the command keys.|$|E

5|$|For Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro, the {{opportunity}} to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro {{had been one of}} more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> president's widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the match itself came the opening {{ceremony}} for the final. The ceremony began with 64 members of the Rustavi Ensemble dance group performing a choreographed routine to {{a variation of the}} UEFA Champions League Anthem. At the culmination of the routine, the players emerged from the tunnel, accompanied by Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli singing Il Gladiatore – a song based on Earth from the soundtrack to the film Gladiator – before Bocelli sang supporting vocals to the UEFA Champions League Anthem. Before they emerged from their dressing room, manager Pep Guardiola played the Barcelona team a specially commissioned seven-minute film showing their best moments from the season interspersed with clips from the film Gladiator. The film culminated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Luciano Pavarotti's version of Nessun Dorma, and it left several of the players in tears. With his players motivated for the game, Guardiola said nothing as they emerged into the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore Zoo, {{established}} in 1892, the Karanji, Kukkarahalli and the Blue Lagoon Lake are popular recreational destinations.

The colour of the water and the sky is Blue and there is a mini island in the middle due to which it was named as Blue Lagoon. Mysuru has the Regional Museum of Natural History, the Folk Lore Museum, the Railway Museum and the Oriental Research Institute. The city is a centre for yoga-related health tourism that attracts domestic and foreign visitors, particularly those who, for years, came to study <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> ashtanga yoga guru K.

5|$|The era {{of record}} labels {{investing}} in their artists, giving them freedom to experiment and limited {{control over their}} content and marketing, ended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1970s. Corporate artists and repertoire staff exerted an increasing amount {{of control over the}} creative process that had previously belonged to the artists, and established acts were pressured to create music with simpler harmony and song structures and fewer changes in meter. A number of symphonic pop bands, such as Supertramp, 10cc, the Alan Parsons Project and the Electric Light Orchestra, brought the orchestral-style arrangements into a context that emphasised pop singles while allowing for occasional instances of exploration. Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant and Pink Floyd opted for a harder sound in the style of arena rock.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his death}} in 1883, the childless Tự Đức had named his nephew, Kiến Phúc, as his successor, rather than Dục Đức, his most senior heir. Tự Đức had written in his will that Dục Đức was depraved and unworthy of ruling the country. However, led by Thuyet, the regents enthroned Dục Đức under the {{pressure}} of the ladies of the court. Phan protested against the violation of Tự Đức's will of succession and refused to sanction anyone other than Kien Phuc. Lucky to escape the death penalty, Phan was stripped of his positions. Later, Dục Đức was deposed and executed by Thuyet on the grounds of ignoring court etiquette, ignoring the mourning rites for Tự Đức and having affairs <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> emperor's consorts. Phan again protested the regents' actions and was briefly imprisoned by Thuyet, before being exiled to his home province.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In other respects, there is little similarity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.|$|E
