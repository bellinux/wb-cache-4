50|$|All {{of these}} linearized objects <b>are</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> {{envelopes}} that enable {{the client and}} server agents to coordinate their processing. In DDM architecture, these envelopes are called Data Stream Structures (DSS).

Further many OBJDSSes can be chained to a RQSDSS or a PRYDSS to accommodate as many objects as necessary A DSS consists of the total length of the DSS, a flag byte identifying the type of DSS, a request identifier, and the linearized objects in the DSS. The request identifier ties an RQSDSS with subsequent OBJDSSes from the client, such as the records to be loaded into a file by the Load File command.
