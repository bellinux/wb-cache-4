25|$|Since 2000, {{scholarly}} {{research has}} focused on aspects of Ruskin's legacy, including his impact on the sciences; John Lubbock and Oliver Lodge admired him. Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and cultural tourism (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with Thomas Cook); the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre. The sociologist and media theorist, David Gauntlett, argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout Web 2.0. Similarly, architectural theorist Lars Spuybroek has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens up a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>way</b> of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.|$|E

Their technique was sound, {{but they were}} beaten to it in 1933 by Lewis, who had {{the resources of the}} University of California at his disposal.

40|$|This paper {{emphasizes}} the reliance Kuril islanders have felt towards Japan and discusses {{the challenge that}} cultural programmes have posed to Russian sovereignty over {{the territory of the}} Southern Kurils. The geographer David Kaplan has argued that on the border a unique set of forces affect the residents of these regions and <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>ways</b> of thinking about the state, about the nation, and about the immediate surroundings are forged. He suggests that in extreme cases these perspectives may manifest themselves in new loyalties and hopes for a better future that contest dominant ideas of national identity. Using the example of this visa free programme and humanitarian aid, a striking example of borderlands being a "crucible" of new connections and relations between local inhabitants and the Russian and Japanese state can be observed. In the case of the Southern Kurils, the local "border culture" on the islands can be seen as sometimes being sharply at odds with the logic of Russian nation-statehood. These islands have emerged as a site of resistance, providing alternative definitions and challenges to the Russian state's attempts to order and control national space...|$|R

40|$|Here, an {{overview}} of Hans Küng’s understanding of paradigm shifts in theology is provided {{with a focus on}} its ecumenical aims. In the analysis of paradigm shifts as an ecumenical tool the strengths and weakness of this approach are presented, largely indicating that though paradigm shifts seem to occur and offer possibilities for ecumenism, there are problems with how Küng elaborates his programme. To strengthen the case for the occurrence of paradigm shifts in Christianity a reflection is offered, in germ, on the role that irruption and eruption play in Eucharistic bread-breaking, where the irruption of brokenness and confusion is made <b>whole</b> in a <b>new</b> <b>way</b> via the eruption of the Spirit. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{idea that}} masculinity {{has a history}} is fairly recent. This {{collection}} opens new paths in literary and theatre studies by addressing not only how literary texts represented masculinity but how different representational strategies in such texts produce masculinity. They thus offer provocative answers {{to the question of}} what it meant to be a “man” on the newly global stage. While the volume as a <b>whole</b> offers a <b>new</b> <b>way</b> of thinking about literary histories, the individual articles offer reflections on the relationship between gendered meanings and the sophisticated, self-conscious, representational form of language that is called literature. What is especially innovative about this collection is its success in moving beyond the obvious cultural focus of the topic to consider how literary genre also affected the way masculinity was viewed. Such an approach brings a fresh perspective on current debates about the nature, extent and contemporary meaning of male/male sexual practices in the pre-modern and early modern period...|$|R

There are wars in the future, great wars, which not machines will finally decide, but the free, indomitable life spirit. No more wars under the banners of the ideal, and in the spirit of sacrifice. But wars in the strength of individual men. And then, pure individualistic training to fight, and preparation for a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>way</b> of life, a new society.

40|$|Social phobia (SP) is {{a common}} and {{disabling}} condition for which cognitive-behavioral treatments (CBT) have demonstrated efficacy. However, there remains room for improvement. Hence, further exploration of {{the means by which}} CBT helps patients with SP is warranted. Studies examining patients' perspectives on which aspects of treatment were most or least helpful may augment other established methodologies for identifying the more or less effective components and thus help to increase the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CBT for SP. The current study used interpretive phenomenological analysis to analyze the transcripts of interviews with eight patients who had completed cognitive therapy (CT) for SP. Four related themes were identified: (i) social phobia as a way of being; (ii) learning to challenge social phobia as a way of being: transformative mechanisms of therapy; (iii) challenges faced in the pursuit of change; (iv) a <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> world: <b>new</b> <b>ways</b> of being. This analysis of patients' experiences of CT for SP confirmed that the factors hypothesized to be important in maintaining SP in cognitive-behavioral models of the disorder are evident in patients' descriptions of the processes of change in CT for SP (e. g., reducing internal focus of attention and reducing safety behaviors and avoidance). Helpful components of CT for SP were identified as areas where the protocol could be enhanced. Recommendations for the way in which CT for SP is implemented are made...|$|R
