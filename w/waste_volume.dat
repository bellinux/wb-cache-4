500|$|The Croatian Environment Agency (CEA), {{a public}} {{institution}} {{established by the}} Government of Croatia to collect and analyse information on the environment, has identified further ecological problems as well as various degrees of progress in terms of curbing their environmental impact. These problems include inadequate legal landfills {{as well as the}} presence of illegal landfills; between 2005 and 2008, 62 authorized and 423 illegal landfills were rehabilitated. In the same period, the number of issued waste management licenses doubled, while the annual municipal solid <b>waste</b> <b>volume</b> increased by 23%, reaching [...] per capita. The processes of soil acidification and organic matter degradation are present throughout Croatia, with increasing soil salinity levels in the Neretva river plain and spreading areas of alkali soil in Slavonia.|$|E

40|$|A better {{model for}} {{full-scale}} landfills is required {{based on the}} more sophisticated component models, with fewer parameters, and able {{to be used by}} operators. To work towards developing such a model, an investigation is required examining the issues in using medium to large-scale landfill data for modelling, model calibration and prediction purposes. This investigation used three datasets of varying <b>waste</b> <b>volumes</b> to undertake a parameter sensitivity study for landfill modelling purposes (Lamborn 2010). The first part of this investigation examined the data available from each dataset and undertook an assessment of the issues in using incomplete data for modelling purposes. The data was incomplete as many parameters either had not been measured at larger <b>waste</b> <b>volumes</b> or they were too expensive to measure over long periods of time...|$|R
50|$|A typical large 1000 MWe {{nuclear reactor}} {{produces}} 25-30 tons of spent fuel per year. If the fuel were reprocessed and vitrified, the <b>waste</b> <b>volume</b> {{would be only}} about three cubic meters per year, but the decay heat would be almost the same.|$|E
50|$|Earthships {{also have}} the {{capacity}} to process the wastes (generated daily by a household) in the interior and exterior of the Earthship. The exterior botanical cells reduce the <b>waste</b> <b>volume</b> leaching into the ground and reduce the risk of contaminating an aquifer. This system eliminates the use of large public sewer systems and treatment facilities that sometimes cannot adequately treat. The reuse of gray water to produce food allows the Earthships to take sustainability to the next level.|$|E
50|$|From 2004, {{pre-treatment}} {{of waste}} (physical, thermal, {{chemical or biological}} processes, including sorting to change waste characteristics) {{will be required to}} substantially reduce <b>waste</b> <b>volume</b> or hazardous nature of the waste, or to facilitate handling or to enhance the recovery potential of the waste. The LFD further requires that landfill gas will be used to generate non-fossil fuel derived energy wherever possible, that each site has a fully developed closure and aftercare plan and during the active phase and following closure, a monitoring regime to ensure groundwater quality is not compromised.|$|E
50|$|Kerbside {{collection}} is today {{often referred to}} as a strategy of local authorities to collect recyclable items from the consumer. Kerbside {{collection is}} considered a low-risk strategy to reduce <b>waste</b> <b>volumes</b> and increase recycling rates. Materials are typically collected in large bins, coloured bags, or small open plastic tubs, specifically designated for content.|$|R
5|$|The double bottoms {{are also}} subject to design constraints. The primary {{concern is that}} they be high enough to allow the passage of pipes and cables. These areas must also be roomy enough to allow people safe access to perform surveys and maintenance.

25|$|Pressure from {{environmentally}} related {{legislation on}} {{solid waste disposal}} methods in developed countries has increased the application of anaerobic digestion as a process for reducing <b>waste</b> <b>volumes</b> and generating useful byproducts. It may either be used to process the source-separated fraction of municipal waste or alternatively combined with mechanical sorting systems, to process residual mixed municipal waste. These facilities are called mechanical biological treatment plants.|$|R
50|$|Hong Kong is {{currently}} actively discussing the options {{of solid waste}} charging, and the quantitative-based charging system adopted by Taipei is deemed as an apt reference for Hong Kong supported by legislators. Following the “polluters-pay” principle, the public must purchase designated garbage bags, ranging from 5-litre to 120-litre at different price levels, from EDP fitting to their own needs. Recyclables can be separated to minimize the load put into the charged garbage bags as a measure to encourage recycling. The waste charge scheme has reduced 60% of domestic <b>waste</b> <b>volume</b> in Taipei (Green Power, 2012).|$|E
50|$|A {{comparison}} of immunoglobulin protein capture on a conventional column and a monolithic column yields some economically interesting results. If processing times are equivalent, process volumes of IgG, an antibody, are 3,120L for conventional columns versus 5,538L for monolithic columns. This represents a 78% increase in process volume efficiency, {{while at the}} same time only a tenth of the media <b>waste</b> <b>volume</b> is generated. Not only is the monolith column more economically prudent when considering the value of product processing times, but, at the same time, less media is used, representing a significant reduction in variable costs.|$|E
5000|$|After being {{introduced}} in the 1970s, 954 municipalities (30%) in Japan have implemented PAYT programs. The city of Taipei currently runs a scheme where households and companies purchase specially printed blue bin bags, and place waste in it. The municipal waste management department collects only rubbish placed within these special bags. Called the [...] "Per Bag Trash Collection Fee", this scheme encourages usage of recyclable packaging, as those do not need a special bag and are disposed free of charge. As a result, Taipei's <b>waste</b> <b>volume</b> is down 35.08%, and recycling has increased 2.6-fold from 1999. PAYT is also implemented in Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Taiwan.|$|E

50|$|In {{many parts}} of the {{developed}} world, biodegradable waste is separated {{from the rest of the}} waste stream, either by separate kerb-side collection or by waste sorting after collection. At the point of collection such waste is often referred to as Green waste. Removing such waste from the rest of the waste stream substantially reduces <b>waste</b> <b>volumes</b> for disposal and also allows biodegradable waste to be composted where composting facilities exist.|$|R

50|$|DSM is {{the basis}} for many other types of modelling; {{examples}} include integrated assessment models, system dynamics models, population balance models, and dynamic material flow accounting (MFA) models. The latter are an important manner in which the material and technological detail of MFA is enhanced. DSM of materials additionally allows for the modelling of the end-of-life product flow which is the sum of all discarded products leaving the use phase according to the lifetime distribution chosen. This enables forecasting of <b>waste</b> <b>volume</b> and recycling potential and provides essential information for resource and energy use reduction strategies. The connection between dynamic DSM and waste input-output (IO) models, a special IO model type designed for handling waste, is currently under development and will allow for simultaneous assessment of environmental impacts of material production and recycling.|$|E
50|$|Cesspits were {{introduced}} to Europe in the 16th century, {{at a time when}} urban populations were growing at a faster rate than in the past. The added burden of <b>waste</b> <b>volume</b> began overloading urban street gutters, where chamber pots were emptied each day. There was no regulation of cesspit construction until the 18th century, when a need to address sanitation and safety concerns became apparent. Cesspits were cleaned out by tradesmen using shovels and horse-drawn wagons. Cesspools were cleaned only at night, to reduce the smell and annoyance to the public. The typical cesspit was cleaned out once every 8 to 10 years. Fermentation of the solid waste collecting in cesspits, however, resulted in dangerous infections and gases that sometimes asphyxiated cesspit cleaners. Cesspits began to be cleaned out more regularly, but strict regulations for cesspit construction and ventilation were not introduced until the 1800s.|$|E

5000|$|Liquid wastes: include bloodwater and brine from drained storage tanks, {{and water}} {{discharges}} from washing and cleaning. This waste may need holding temporarily, {{and should be}} disposed of without damage to the environment. How liquid waste should be disposed from fish processing operations depends on the content levels in the waste of solid and organic matter, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus content, and oil and grease content. It also depends on an assessment of parameters such acidity levels, temperature, odour, and biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The magnitude of waste management issues {{depends on how much}} <b>waste</b> <b>volume</b> there is, the nature of the pollutants it carries, the rate at which it is discharged and the capacity of the receiving environment to assimilate the pollutants. Many countries dispose of such liquid wastes through their municipal sewage systems or directly into a waterway. The receiving waterbody should be able to degrade the organic and inorganic waste components {{in a way that does}} not damage the aquatic ecosystem.|$|E
