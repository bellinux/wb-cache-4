2500|$|Modern {{harvesting}} {{methods are}} shifting towards using <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> ships to transport live salmon to the processing plant. [...] This allows {{the fish to}} be killed, bled, and filleted before rigor has occurred. [...] This results in superior product quality to the customer along with more humane processing. [...] To obtain maximum quality, {{it is necessary to}} minimize the level of stress in the live salmon until actually being electrically and percussively killed and the gills slit for bleeding. These improvements in processing time and freshness to the final customer are commercially significant and forcing the commercial wild fisheries to upgrade their processing to the benefit of all seafood consumers.|$|E

Shortly after commencing this work, the yacht was impounded by creditors.

The stem was reduced, a diesel engine was installed in 1945, and facilities for keeping fish (including refrigerated storage and a <b>wet</b> <b>well)</b> were fitted. The Roches sold Aurore in 1974.|$|E

6000|$|Which {{reminds me}} of another phase of the weather that I can't bear, and that is April weather (so called because it always comes in May). Poets think it very nice. As it does not know its own mind five minutes together, they liken it to a woman; and it is {{supposed}} to be very charming on that account. I don't appreciate it, myself. Such lightning-change business may be all very agreeable in a girl. It is no doubt highly delightful to have to do with a person who grins one moment about nothing at all, and snivels the next for precisely the same cause, and who then giggles, and then sulks, and who is rude, and affectionate, and bad-tempered, and jolly, and boisterous, and silent, and passionate, and cold, and stand-offish, and flopping, all in one minute (mind, I don't say this. It is those poets. And they are supposed to be connoisseurs of this sort of thing); but in the weather the disadvantages of the system are more apparent. A woman's tears do not make one wet, but the rain does; and her coldness does not lay the foundations of asthma and rheumatism, as the east wind is apt to. I can prepare for and put up with a regularly bad day, but these ha'porth-of-all-sorts kind of days do not suit me. It aggravates me to see a bright blue sky above me when I am walking along wet through, and there is something so exasperating about the way the sun comes out smiling after a drenching shower, and seems to say: [...] "Lord love you, you don't mean to say you're <b>wet?</b> <b>Well,</b> I am surprised.

50|$|Due to {{the much}} reduced {{health and safety}} concerns, and smaller {{footprint}} and visibility, submersible pump sewage pumping stations have almost completely superseded traditional sewage pumping stations. Further, a refit of a traditional pumping station usually involves converting it into a modern pumping station by installing submersibles in the <b>wet</b> <b>well,</b> demolishing the pump house and retiring the dry well by either stripping it, or knocking down the internal partition and merging it with the <b>wet</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of a sewage pump station {{is a very dangerous}} place. Poisonous gases, such as methane and hydrogen sulfide, can accumulate in the wet well; an ill-equipped person entering the well would be overcome by fumes very quickly. Any entry into the <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> requires the correct confined space entry method for a hazardous environment. To minimize the need for entry, the facility is normally designed to allow pumps and other equipment to be removed from outside the <b>wet</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
30|$|Contact {{angle is}} one of the {{important}} indicators to measure the wettability of a surface or material. A low value of contact angle indicates that the liquid spreads, or <b>wets</b> <b>well,</b> while a high contact angle indicates poor wetting. The two materials had very different contact angles with water. The contact angle between petroleum coke and water was 91 °, while that between lignite and water was only 59 °, indicating lignite was more hydrophilic than petroleum coke. This result was consistent with FTIR analysis. Due to the high content of oxygen functional groups, the surface of lignite showed strong hydrophilicity, and thus its contact angle with water was smaller. On the contrary, petroleum coke had a hydrophobic surface, which is difficult to wet.|$|R

5000|$|Sewage pumping {{stations}} are typically {{designed so that}} one pump or one set of pumps will handle normal peak flow conditions. Redundancy {{is built into the}} system so that in the event that any one pump is out of service, the remaining pump or pumps will handle the designed flow. The storage volume of the <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> between the [...] "pump on" [...] and [...] "pump off" [...] settings is designed to minimize pump starts and stops, but is not so long a retention time as to allow the sewage in the <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> to go septic.|$|E
5000|$|The 2009 {{breakdown}} {{was caused}} by what Tim Bousquet of The Coast called [...] "a perfect storm" [...] of technical errors. A Nova Scotia Power electrical outage spurred a technician to activate two backup generators to maintain operation of the plant. But the electrical load was unevenly distributed between the two generators and one became overloaded and failed. A floodgate, designed to close in emergencies to isolate the plant's [...] "wet well" [...] from the deep pipe feeding sewage to the plant, was powered by the overloaded generator. A switch designed to allow the second generator to power the floodgate happened to fail. Owing to the failed generator, {{only one of the}} four sewage pumps could convey sewage out of the <b>wet</b> <b>well,</b> and the volume of sewage began to rise, shorting out the electrical junction boxes placed above the pumps. With the floodgate jammed partially open and all four pumps inoperable, the 85-foot-deep <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> filled with sewage. The electrical control room above the <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> then also filled with sewage, destroying all the equipment there.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} intakes for the powerhouse and regulating outlet {{were deep}} and pulled {{water from the}} bottom of the reservoir which is much colder than the surface water. During the spring and summer, the release of unnaturally cold water into the McKenzie River reduces salmon migration and productivity. [...] In the fall, the reservoir level is considerably lower and the warmer water from the surface enters the intakes and makes the river downstream unnaturally warm which causes salmon eggs to hatch several months too early. In order to help control the temperature of water discharged below the dam, the original intake tower was modified by adding a 302 ft tall <b>wet</b> <b>well.</b> The <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> has three adjustable gates at various levels so that different temperature water can be mixed in the <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> to a desired temperature. The mixed water enters the existing regulating and penstock intakes. By controlling the temperature of the water released from the dam, the impacts on the McKenzie River are greatly reduced.|$|E

50|$|An {{adjustable}} speed drive can often provide smoother operation {{compared to an}} alternative fixed speed mode of operation. For example, in a sewage lift station sewage usually flows through sewer pipes under {{the force of gravity}} to a <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> location. From there it is pumped up to a treatment process. When fixed speed pumps are used, the pumps are set to start when the level of the liquid in the <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> reaches some high point and stop when the level has been reduced to a low point. Cycling the pumps on and off results in frequent high surges of electric current to start the motors that results in electromagnetic and thermal stresses in the motors and power control equipment, the pumps and pipes are subjected to mechanical and hydraulic stresses, and the sewage treatment process is forced to accommodate surges in the flow of sewage through the process. When {{adjustable speed}} drives are used, the pumps operate continuously at a speed that increases as the <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> level increases. This matches the outflow to the average inflow and provides a much smoother operation of the process.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional sewage pumping {{stations}} incorporate both a <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> and a [...] "dry well". Often {{these are}} the same structure separated by an internal divide. In this configuration pumps are installed below ground level on the base of the dry well so that their inlets are below water level on pump start, priming the pump and also maximising the available NPSH. Although nominally isolated from the sewage in the <b>wet</b> <b>well,</b> dry wells are underground, confined spaces and require appropriate precautions for entry. Further, any failure or leakage of the pumps or pipework can discharge sewage directly into the dry well with complete flooding not an uncommon occurrence. As a result, the electric motors are normally mounted above the overflow, top water level of the <b>wet</b> <b>well,</b> usually above ground level, and drive the sewage pumps through an extended vertical shaft. To protect the above ground motors from weather, small pump houses are normally built, which also incorporate the electrical switchgear and control electronics. These are the visible parts of a traditional sewage pumping station although they are typically smaller than the underground wet and dry wells.|$|E

5000|$|More modern pumping {{stations}} do {{not require}} a dry well or pump house and usually consist only of a <b>wet</b> <b>well.</b> In this configuration, submersible sewage pumps with closely coupled electric motor are mounted within the <b>wet</b> <b>well</b> itself, submerged within the sewage. Submersible pumps are mounted on two vertical guide rails and seal onto a permanently fixed [...] "duckfoot", which forms both a mount and also a vertical bend for the discharge pipe. For maintenance or replacement, submersible pumps are raised by a chain off of the duckfoot and up the two guide rails to the maintenance (normally ground) level. Reinstalling the pumps simply reverses this process with the pump being remounted on the guide rails and lowered onto the duckfoot where {{the weight of the}} pump reseals it. As the motors are sealed and weather is not a concern, no above ground structures are required, excepting a small kiosk to contain the electrical switchgear and control systems.|$|E
