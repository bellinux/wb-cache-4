25|$|These cars {{at present}} {{have not been}} {{equipped}} <b>with</b> <b>bogies,</b> and are transferred from Hutt to MLST Wellington by road. They will be fitted with either x-28020 bogies ex-FM guard's vans, or x-27750 'Kinki' bogies ex-FS steam-heating vans {{as part of the}} overhaul to bring them up to code-compliance for operation in New Zealand. Unlike most MkII cars in New Zealand, they are receiving only minor modifications to allow them to run in New Zealand, and will receive new numbers. They will also receive new names as well as the new MLST MkII livery of Pearl Grey roof with Midnight Blue body and white window band.|$|E
25|$|Pre-war tram {{networks}} {{remain largely}} intact {{in a number}} of European cities, and many still use PCCs as part or all of their rolling stock. Late-model PCCs remain in use in Belgium. The vehicles used in Antwerp and Ghent are metre-gauge, while those used in Brussels are standard-gauge. One of the peculiarities of the four-axle Brussels PCC vehicles is that some of them have been equipped <b>with</b> <b>bogies</b> and electric motors acquired second-hand in the United States from decommissioned streetcars from Kansas City, Missouri, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The last of the originally 171 four-axle class 7000 PCC cars in Brussels were withdrawn on February 12, 2010, with the articulated PCCs (130 class 7700 six-axle cars and 60 class 7900 eight-axle cars) remaining in service.|$|E
25|$|However, the underframes {{were not}} {{designed}} to be towed {{in the long term}} and they deteriorated rapidly, bringing about their demise. The introduction of the EM class electric multiple units to the Wellington suburban system meant 11 NZR 56-foot carriages became available, and the cancellation of the unnamed daylight successor to the New Plymouth Night Express that ran between New Plymouth and Taumaranui freed more. A wooden 50-foot Z bogie box wagon was refitted <b>with</b> <b>bogies</b> that enabled it to run at passenger-train speed and was painted the same shade of bright red as the cars it accompanied. In the style of the new Fastrak and Northtrak express parcels logos that emphasised the new approach and priority of parcels traffic, the wagon had a logo known as Waitrak, hinting at its being dedicated to Wairarapa services.|$|E

25|$|The Eurostar Class 373 trains, which {{run through}} the Channel Tunnel between the UK and both France and Belgium, are {{substantially}} {{different versions of the}} TGV trains, with support for four voltages, of them two present in the UK, both pantograph and third-rail power collection (although the third-rail shoe-gear has now been removed following the opening of High-Speed 1), the ability to adapt to multiple platform heights, and to cope with no fewer than seven different signalling modes. Like the TGVs, Eurostar trains are articulated <b>with</b> <b>bogies</b> between the carriages, and most units have 18 passenger carriages and two power cars (the end passenger carriages also have their outer bogies powered). New Class 374 trains were introduced in November 2015, and are able to carry passengers to destinations beyond the core routes to Paris and Brussels. A Class 374 train has 900 seats, roughly equivalent to six Airbus A320s or Boeing 737s (the aircraft typically used by low-cost airlines). These trains operate at the highest scheduled speeds of any in the UK, using a high-speed line between the Channel Tunnel and St Pancras station in London (High Speed 1) which was fully opened in November 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1993, using bogies {{from class}} 110 units with numbers 110 287 and lower, all 20 {{of the class}} 114 {{locomotives}} were rebuilt as normal class 110.3 units and were inserted into inventory as 110 485-504. [...] 18 of the class 110, which lost their bogies to these [...] "new" [...] 110s, were rebuilt <b>with</b> <b>bogies</b> from retired class 140 locomotives, and were re-designated as members of class 139, with which class they were nearly identical in the first place, due to their electric brake system. (The 2 remaining former class 114s received bogies from 2 other retired class 110.3 units). The concept of the Einheitslokomotive completely paid for itself in this swap exercise.|$|E
60|$|I {{write of}} the service with a smile; yet I was always there--always with respect for Maka, always with admiration for his deep seriousness, his burning energy, the fire of his roused eye, the sincere and various accents of his voice. To see him weekly {{flogging}} a dead horse and blowing a cold fire was a lesson in fortitude and constancy. It may be a question whether if the mission were fully supported, and he was set free from business avocations, more might not result; I think otherwise myself; I think not neglect but rigour has reduced his flock, that rigour which has once provoked a revolution, and which to-day, in a man so lively and engaging, amazes the beholder. No song, no dance, no tobacco, no liquor, no alleviative of life--only toil and church- going; so says a voice from his face; and the face {{is the face of}} the Polynesian Esau, but the voice is the voice of a Jacob from a different world. And a Polynesian at the best makes a singular missionary in the Gilberts, coming from a country recklessly unchaste to one conspicuously strict; from a race hag-ridden <b>with</b> <b>bogies</b> to one comparatively bold against the terrors of the dark. The thought was stamped one morning in my mind, when I chanced to be abroad by moonlight, and saw all the town lightless, but the lamp faithfully burning by the missionary's bed. It requires no law, no fire, and no scouting police, to withhold Maka and his countrymen from wandering in the night unlighted.|$|E
50|$|Bogies - Approximately 50 of {{the earlier}} {{locomotives}} were built <b>with</b> ex-Claughton <b>bogies</b> which had a 6’3” wheelbase compared to the later locomotives built <b>with</b> new <b>bogies</b> that had a wheelbase of 6’ 6”.|$|R

50|$|Seven {{passenger}} coaches and two combined luggage and post carriages with two axles each {{as well as}} 56 goods waggons were purchased. The rolling stock increased over time: finally HBJ owned 7 passenger cars with two axles each, 3 passenger cars <b>with</b> <b>bogies</b> and 3 combined luggage and post carriages as well as 116 goods waggons with two axles each and 6 goods waggons <b>with</b> <b>bogies.</b>|$|E
50|$|Further orders {{over the}} 19 years saw 11 {{locomotives}} built the last being delivered in April 1911. The initial 50 were built with six wheel tenders, the remainder <b>with</b> eight wheel <b>bogie</b> tenders. Many of the originals were later equipped <b>with</b> <b>bogie</b> tenders, however {{a number of}} the class kept the shorter tenders to enable them to be turned on the 50 foot m turntables at certain locations.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-two {{members of}} the new class were ordered at first. Wagons 1-8 were {{delivered}} as class ALF, but later wagons were fitted <b>with</b> <b>bogie</b> exchange equipment from new. The older wagons were refitted and recoded between 1963-1965. These wagons were all fitted with side sheets.|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{operation}} may see {{one or two}} locomotives running {{together with}} a snowplow at either end.

50|$|When {{the first}} segment was opened, only {{relatively}} short 4-wheel boxcars and passenger cars were used. In 1892 the first passenger cars <b>with</b> <b>bogies</b> were employed, which replaced the 4-wheel cars {{over the following}} years. For freight cars this transition did not happen until the early 20th century, when freight cars <b>with</b> <b>bogies</b> for wood and gravel were put into service. The first transporter wagons started service around 1912, and by 1945 completely replaced any of the narrow gauge freight cars.|$|E

50|$|These were {{constructed}} in two lengths. Most had underframes 63 ft long, <b>with</b> <b>bogies</b> at 46 ft centres; {{the body was}} 64 ft long if the coach was gangwayed, or 63 ft if non-gangwayed. A smaller number had underframes 56 ft long, <b>with</b> <b>bogies</b> at 40 ft centres; the body was 58 ft long if the carriage was gangwayed, or 57 ft if non-gangwayed. The shorter vehicles were intended for use where the track curvature was too tight to accommodate the longer vehicles, due to excessive overhang.|$|E
50|$|Astara is {{currently}} {{served by a}} broad gauge railway only headed north. A standard gauge connection to the Iranian railway network along {{the shore of the}} Caspian sea is planned.

50|$|By the 1920s the District {{was having}} to rebuild its {{original}} wooden cars and having reliability problems <b>with</b> the <b>bogies</b> fitted to the motor and trailer cars.
