The <b>working</b> <b>pump</b> pressure and traverse velocity were the most significant operating parameters affecting cutting, as has been shown previously.

The models allow for the preselection of particular operating parameters for the cutting of specific rocks types.

It has also been found that the PT from Glu- 286 (E) to the propionate of heme a 3 (Prd) provides a gate for an initial back leakage from the high pH side of the membrane. Interestingly, the rotation of E that brings it closer to Prd appears to provide a way for blocking competing pathways in the primary PT. Our study elucidates and quantifies the nature of the control of the directionality in the primary PT in CcO and provides instructive insight into the role of the water molecules in biological PT, showing that “bridges” of several water molecules in hydrophobic regions present a problem (rather than a solution) that is minimized in the primary PT...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. One of {{the main}} {{indicators}} characterizing mechanical circulatory support devices (artificial valve, implantable pumps, etc.) is trauma of blood cells. Therefore, while developing new pumps, {{one of the key}} studies in vitro is to evaluate blood hemolysis. For an objective hemolysis analysis of pump it is required to create a standardized methodology of hemolysis studies. The object of the study in this paper is implantable axial pump DON for two-step heart transplantation in children. The aim of study is to develop a standardized methodology of hemolysis studies of blood pumps and to conduct research of pediatric axial pump DON. Materials and methods. To conduct hemolysis research we created a mock circulatory system consisting of a reservoir placed in water bath maintaining a constant working fluid (blood) temperature, hydrodynamic resistance, connecting tubes, ports for blood sampling and pressure and flow measurement systems, and research pump. Test method is to estimate levels of free hemoglobin pHb obtained by blood samples during pump working in operating mode (for pediatric pump: blood flow 2. 5 l/min, pressure difference 80 mmHg). Using the data obtained the standardized indices of hemolysis NIH and MIH are calculated based on pHb values, hematocrit, total hemoglobin, blood flow and <b>working</b> <b>pump</b> time. Results. We developed and realized a standardized methodology of hemolysis research by which we evaluated hemolysis of pediatric axial pump. The results of hemolysis tests allowed us to optimize the design of DON.

Conclusion. Developed methods and evaluation tools of hemolysis allow us to provide objective information {{on one of the most}} important indicators of developing implantable pediatric axial pump and they could be recommended for hemolysis research of others pumps. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGaining {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the energetics of the proton-pumping process in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) {{is a problem of}} great current interest. Despite promising mechanistic proposals, so far, a physically consistent model that would reproduce all the relevant barriers needed to create a <b>working</b> <b>pump</b> has not been presented. In addition, there are major problems in elucidating the origin of key mutational effects and in understanding the nature of the apparent pKa values associated with the pH dependencies of specific proton transfer (PT) reactions in CcO. This work takes a key step in resolving the above problems, by considering mutations, such as the Asn 139 Asp replacement, that blocks proton pumping without affecting PT to the catalytic site. We first introduce a formulation that makes it possible to relate the apparent pKa of Glu 286 to different conformational states of this residue. We then use the new formulation along with the calculated pKa values of Glu 286 at these different conformations to reproduce the experimentally observed apparent pKa of the residue. Next, we take the X-ray structures of the native and Asn 139 Asp mutant of the Paracoccus denitrificans CcO (N 131 D in this system) and reproduce {{for the first time the}} change in the primary PT pathways (and other key features) based on simulations that start with the observed structural changes. We also consider the competition between proton transport to the catalytic site and the pump site, as a function of the bulk pH, as well as the H/D isotope effect, and use this information to explore the relative height of the two barriers. The paper emphasizes the crucial role of energy-based considerations that include the PT process, and the delicate control of PT in CcO...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGaining a {{detailed}} {{understanding of the}} energetics of the proton pumping process in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) {{is one of the}} challenges of modern biophysics. Although there are several current mechanistic proposals, most of these ideas have not been subjected to consistent structure–function considerations. In particular most works have not related the activation barriers for different mechanistic proposals to the protein structure. The present work describes a general approach for exploring the energetics of different feasible models of the action of CcO, using the observed protein structure, established simulation methods and a modified Marcus' formulation. We start by reviewing our methods for evaluation of the energy diagrams for different proton translocation paths and then present a systematic analysis of various constraints that should be imposed on any energy diagram for the pumping process. After the general analysis we turn to the actual computational study, where we construct energy diagrams for forward and backward paths, using the estimated calculated reduction potentials and pKa values of all the relevant sites (including internal water molecules). We then explore the relationship between the calculated energy diagrams and key experimental constraints. This comparison allows us to identify some barriers that are not fully consistent with the overall requirement for an efficient pumping. In particular we identify back leakage channels, which are hard to block without stopping the forward channels. This helps to identify open problems that will require further experimental and theoretical studies. We also consider reasonable adjustments of the calculated barriers that may lead to a <b>working</b> <b>pump.</b> Although the present analysis does not establish a unique and workable model for the mechanism of CcO, it presents what is probably the most consistent current analysis of the barriers for different feasible pathways. Perhaps more importantly, the framework developed here should provide a general way for examining any proposal for the action of CcO {{as well as for the}} analysis of further experimental findings about the action of this fascinating system...|$|E

The combined effect of multiple sources and the joint probability of extremes should be considered to assess and manage flood risk better. This paper aims to study the combined effect of rainfall and the tidal level of the receiving water body on flood probability and severity in Fuzhou City, which has a complex river network. Flood severity under a range of precipitation intensities, with return periods (RPs) of 5 yr to 100 yr, and tidal levels was assessed through a hydrodynamic model verified by data observed during Typhoon Longwang in 2005. According to the percentages of the river network where flooding occurred, the threshold conditions for flood severity were estimated in two scenarios: with and without <b>working</b> <b>pumps.</b> In Fuzhou City, <b>working</b> <b>pumps</b> efficiently reduce flood risk from precipitation within a 20 -yr RP. However, the pumps may not work efficiently when rainfall exceeds a 100 -yr RP because of the limited conveyance capacity of the river network. Joint risk probability was estimated through the optimal copula. The joint probability of rainfall and tidal level both exceeding their threshold values is very low, and the greatest threat in Fuzhou comes from heavy rainfall. However, the tidal level poses an extra risk of flood. Given that this extra risk is ignored {{in the design of}} flood defense in Fuzhou, flood frequency and severity may be higher than understood during design...|$|R
