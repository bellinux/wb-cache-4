5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, green leaves are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. <b>Woody</b> <b>plants,</b> such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are <b>woody</b> <b>plants.</b> Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is also home}} to several bogs, which exist as breaks in the cloud forests. It is believed that bogs form in low-lying areas where clay in the soil prevents proper water drainage, resulting in an accumulation of water that impedes the root systems of <b>woody</b> <b>plants.</b> Kohala's bogs are characterized by sedges, mosses of the genus Sphagnum, and oha wai, native members of the bellflower family. Other habitats include rain forest and mesophytic (wet) forests.|$|E
40|$|Context: Spatially {{heterogeneous}} habitats often promote <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> {{species and}} functional diversity (FD). Ungulate herbivory {{can have the}} opposite effect. Across the globe, the type and intensity of herbivory is changing, as domestic livestock replace wild ungulates, which are increasingly confined to protected areas. Despite recognition {{of the importance of}} FD for ecosystem functioning, the interactive effect of soil-related fine-scale heterogeneity and larger-scale ungulate herbivory on <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> FD is little-known. Objectives: In miombo woodland of Zimbabwe, we investigated (1) how bottom-up fine-scale heterogeneity created by Macrotermes termitaria interacts with top-down effects of herbivore foraging-guilds on <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> FD; and (2) whether browsing combined with grazing impacts FD more than grazing alone. Methods: The three different herbivore treatments (grazing, combined browsing-and-grazing, and exclusion) had been maintained for 50 years. We surveyed 10 termite mound-matrix plots within three sites per treatment. We assessed <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> traits and FD across treatments (herbivore feeding-guild) and position (mound or woodland-matrix), and interactive effects between these. Results: <b>Woody</b> <b>plant</b> FD was greater on mounds, and lowest overall with browsing-and-grazing. Specific traits were associated with position (e. g. palatability was greater for mounds), and treatment (e. g. spinescence increased with grazing). Conclusions: Long-term enclosure of ungulate herbivores (browsing-and-grazing, and grazing alone) decreased woody FD, but this was mitigated by termitaria. The novel finding is that at regional scales, mounds can enhance <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> FD despite the impacts of herbivory. At broader scales encompassing the miombo system, potential exists for mounds to stabilise <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> FD from livestock-induced impacts...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of riparian protection {{forests in the}} Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is an ideal measure {{to cope with the}} eco-environmental problems of the water-level fluctuation zone (WLFZ). Thus, the information for screening winter-flood-tolerant <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species is useful for the recovery and re-{{establishment of}} the riparian protection forests in the TGR WLFZ. Therefore, we discussed the possibilities of constructing and popularizing riparian protection forests in the TGR WLFZ from several aspects, including the <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species distribution in the WLFZ, the survival rate analyses of suitable candidate woody species under controlled flooding conditions, the survival rate investigation of some <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species planted in the TGR WLFZ, and the physiological responses of some <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species during the recovery stage after winter floods. The results of woody species investigation showed that most <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species that existed as annual seedlings in the TGR WLFZ are not suitable candidates for the riparian protection forests. However, arbor species (e. g., Salix matsudana, Populus 6 canadensis, Morus alba, Pterocarya stenoptera, Taxodium ascendens, and Metasequoia glyptostroboides) and shrub species (e. g., Salix variegata, Distylium chinensis, Lycium chinense, Myricaria laxiflora, and Rosa multiflora) might be considered suitable candidates for the riparian protection forests in the TGR WLFZ by survival rate analyses under controlled winter flooding conditions, and survival rate investigations of <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> species planted in the TGR WLFZ, respectively.

5|$|Armillaria is a genus of fungi {{commonly}} known as honey mushrooms. First treated by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821, and later assigned generic rank by Friedrich Staude in 1857, Armillaria is classified in the Physalacriaceae family of the Agaricales, the gilled mushrooms. The majority of species in Armillaria are saprotrophic and live mainly on dead wood, but some are parasites that can cause root and butt rot in over 600 species of <b>woody</b> <b>plants.</b> Some Armillaria species form mycorrhizae with orchids; others, such as A.gallica, A.mellea, and A.tabescens, are bioluminescent.|$|E

5|$|A 1994 {{study of}} the nilgai's diet in the Sariska Reserve {{revealed}} its preference for herbs and grasses; grasses became {{more important in the}} rainy season, while during winter and summer it fed additionally on flowers (Butea monosperma), foliage (Anogeissus pendula, Capparis sepiaria, Grewia flavescens and Zizyphus mauritiana), pods (Acacia nilotica, A. catechu and A. leucophloea) and fruits (Zizyphus mauritiana). Preferred grass species include Cenchrus species, Cynodon dactylon, Desmostachya bipinnata, Scirpus tuberosus and Vetiveria zizanoides. <b>Woody</b> <b>plants</b> eaten include Acacia nilotica, A. senegal, A. leucophloea, Clerodendrum phlomidis, Crotalaria burhia, Indigofera oblongifolia, Morus alba and Zizyphus nummularia; herbs favoured are Cocculus hirsutus, Euphorbia hirta and Sida rhombifolia. Seeds of Paspalum distichum occurred in the dung of nilgai most of the year; Acacia nilotica and Prosopis juliflora seeds were discovered in the dry season and those of Echinochloa crusgalli during the monsoon.|$|E
5|$|Herbivores, the nilgai prefer {{grasses and}} herbs; <b>woody</b> <b>plants</b> are {{commonly}} eaten {{in the dry}} tropical forests of India. Studies suggest they may be browsers or mixed feeders in India, whereas they are primarily grazers in Texas. The nilgai can tolerate interference by livestock and degradation of vegetation in its habitat better than deer, possibly because they can reach high branches and do not depend on surface vegetation. The sambar deer and nilgai in Nepal have similar dietary preferences. Diets generally suffice in protein and fats. The protein content of the nilgai's {{should be at least}} seven percent. The nilgai can survive for long periods without water and do not drink regularly even in summer. However, a nilgai died in Dwarka (India) allegedly due to the heat wave and acute shortage of water.|$|E
40|$|Land {{abandonment}} {{exacerbated by}} climate change {{has led to}} increased <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> encroachment of mountain grasslands in many regions of the world. The present study assessed <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> encroachment below potential tree line in the Central Pyrenees of Spain and the association of this encroachment with changes in land use. Remote sensing data from Landsat- 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) from the mid- 1980 s and mid- 2000 s were analyzed by supervised classification for identification of land cover types. The transition matrix indicated that shrublands were the most dynamic plant communities. Consequently, 21 % of cultivated areas, 19 % of dense grasslands, and 24 % of sparse grasslands became shrublands during the period analyzed, and 35 % of shrublands became forest. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) were used to identify biophysical and anthropogenic factors that were significantly correlated with <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> encroachment of dense and sparse grasslands. Distance to the nearest <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> habitat (shrub or forest) was the most strongly correlated factor with <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> encroachment of both types of grassland. This factor explained 69 % and 71 % {{of the variance in}} models of dense and sparse grasslands, respectively. Besides this factor, anthropogenic factors had larger effects on <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> encroachment of dense grasslands, regions that were more productive and accessible. However, biophysical and especially topographic factors had slightly greater effects on <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> encroachment of sparse grasslands, regions that were less productive and accessible. The changes in land cover that we observed indicated that land cover has become more homogeneous. There have been reductions in the variety, functions, and services of grasslands, particularly in areas below the potential tree line that are vulnerable to the development of <b>woody</b> <b>plant</b> habitats. © The Author(s) 2014.

5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, {{the definition of}} a tree may be narrower, including only <b>woody</b> <b>plants</b> with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand forest {{relies heavily}} on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the <b>woody</b> <b>plants</b> have fruits that are {{probably}} dispersed by birds, which included the huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), pigeonwood (Hedycarya arborea) and various species of Coprosma are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio, and the diminishing range of many others, including the kiwi, weka, and kōkako, has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest. For plants with fruit greater than 1cm in diameter, kereru are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as forest regeneration and seed dispersal.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{threat to}} the {{ecosystem}} is grazing by feral sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos primigenius), and goats (Capra hircus) introduced to the island in the late 18th century. Feral animal competition with commercial grazing was severe enough that a program to eradicate them existed {{as far back as}} the late 1920s, and continued through to 1949. One of the results of this grazing was the increased prevalence of herbaceous and <b>woody</b> <b>plants,</b> both endemic and introduced, that were resistant to browsing. The feral animals were almost eradicated, and numbered a few hundred in the 1950s. However, an influx of local hunters led to the feral species being valued as game animals, and in 1959 the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the governing body in charge of conservation and land use management, changed its policy to a sustained-control program designed to facilitate the sport.|$|E

5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). The animals band {{together}} in three distinct kinds of groups: {{one or two}} females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and all-male groups with two to 18 members. Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; it flees up to -or even , galloping away from the source of danger. Herbivores, nilgai prefer grasses and herbs, though they commonly eat <b>woody</b> <b>plants</b> in the dry tropical forests of India. Females become sexually mature by two years, while males do not become sexually active until {{four or five years}} old. The time of the year when mating takes place varies geographically, but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at most places. Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf (sometimes twins or even triplets) is born. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves stay hidden for the first few weeks of their lives. The lifespan of the nilgai is around ten years.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about its {{reproduction}} or nuptial flight. Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February, and the larvae collected were not {{large enough to be}} reproductive ants. However, it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer, and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli, alates most likely start to occur by June. After nuptial flight, queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of <b>woody</b> <b>plants.</b> This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction. The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs {{on the side of the}} larvae. This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group. Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages. Unlike the larvae and pupae, the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries, but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest. In large nests, small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{material}} {{makes up}} the majority of most lemur diets. Members of at least 109 of all known plant families in Madagascar (55%) are exploited by lemurs. Since lemurs are primarily arboreal, most of these exploited species are <b>woody</b> <b>plants,</b> including trees, shrubs, or lianas. Only the ring-tailed lemur, the bamboo lemurs (genus Hapalemur), and the black-and-white ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata) are known to consume herbs. While Madagascar is rich in fern diversity, these plants are rarely eaten by lemurs. One possible {{reason for this is that}} ferns lack flowers, fruits, and seeds—common food items in lemur diets. They also occur close to the ground, while lemurs spend most of their time in the trees. Lastly, ferns have an unpleasant taste due to the high content of tannins in their fronds. Likewise, mangroves appear to be rarely exploited by lemurs due to their high tannin content. Some lemurs appear to have evolved responses against common plant defenses, however, such as tannins and alkaloids. The golden bamboo lemur (Hapalemur aureus), for instance, eats giant bamboo (Cathariostachys madagascariensis), which contains high levels of cyanide. This lemur can consume twelve times the typically lethal dose for most mammals on a daily basis; the physiological mechanisms that protect it from cyanide poisoning are unknown. At the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in the United States, lemurs that roam the outdoor enclosures have been observed eating poison ivy (Taxicodendron radicans), yet have shown no ill effects.|$|E
