[...] He was {{as fast as a}} good halfback. [...] I have never seen a center who was his equal at backing up a line and then {{protecting}} both flanks. [...] He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> tackler".|$|E
500|$|Wilson, {{after seeing}} an early {{screening}} of Dustbin Baby, {{said that it}} was the best film adaptation of any of her works. Haig said that the film was his favourite of his summer projects, saying [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> story and very touchingly done. I think Juliet Stevenson was very funny and moving in it". During its initial run on BBC One, Dustbin Baby was watched by 2.3 million viewers, giving it a 15.4% share of the audience.|$|E

500|$|... "Redux II" [...] {{was highly}} praised by Carter, saying that [...] "I think that Redux II {{is one of}} the best episodes we've ever done". Frank Spotnitz said [...] "Redux II is one of my {{favorite}} episodes. I think the story has a crystal purity and clarity, and it just comes to a perfect point for me". Anderson said [...] "I thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> episode, especially the scenes in the hearing room, and the whole progression of Scully praying. How it was written and shot and how it was edited. Fabulous".|$|E
500|$|Damon viewed his {{character}} as {{the embodiment of}} the [...] "everyman"—an individual that is seen as [...] "one of the human faces of the supervirus" [...] following his wife and stepson's deaths. Soderbergh also noted Mitch's [...] "common individual" [...] lack of medical and scientific knowledge, though keeping the situation dynamic and compelling was challenging for the director, as he was concerned that Emhoff would be a one-dimensional character. Soderbergh felt that Damon understood the concept and addressed the producers' concerns. [...] "You never catch him acting", said Soderbergh. [...] "There's no vanity, no self-consciousness in his performance; it's as if the cameras aren't there." [...] Writer Scott Z. Burns sent him a copy of the script with a [...] "read this and then go wash your hands" [...] note attached to it. Damon recalled: [...] "I just really want to be in this movie. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific,</b> riveting, really fast read and really exciting and really horrifying, but managed to be really touching." ...|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} an A-, {{explaining}} {{he thought it}} must have been [...] "satisfying" [...] for those viewers tired of the [...] "monster-of-the-week" [...] storylines. Murray also enjoyed two twists: that Olivia had to shut off the lights for real, and that Walter discovers he wrote the ZFT manual at the end. Jane Boursaw of AOL TV (previously TV Squad) opined that it was a [...] "really great episode that's probably worth another viewing to pick up more clues," [...] while the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson thought it [...] "managed to have a couple good twists to it." [...] Annalee Newitz of io9 praised [...] "Ability", remarking that [...] "overall, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> episode, and a great way to go into a show hiatus. We got a lot of payoff when we discovered why Olivia was being stalked by the ZFT weirdos, and we learned more about the Pattern than we had in a really long time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ron Howard later praised {{producer}} Walter Mirisch saying, [...] "When I...acted {{in one of}} his productions, The Spikes Gang, I {{learned that}} a prolific and brilliant producer could also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> guy and <b>a</b> wonderful teacher." ...|$|R
2500|$|Comparing Meyer to J. K. Rowling, Stephen King stated: [...] "The real {{difference}} is that Jo Rowling <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> writer, and Stephenie Meyer can't write worth a darn. She's not very good". King {{went on to say}} that: ...|$|R

500|$|During the 2008 United States presidential election, Eastwood {{stated that}} he would be voting for John McCain, citing {{the fact that he had}} known McCain since he {{returned}} to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW. Eastwood said of McCain: [...] "I met him years ago when he first came back from Vietnam. This was back when (Ronald) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released. I thought he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> guy, a real American hero." [...] Nevertheless, Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying, [...] "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us." [...] Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama: [...] "I think he's a nice fella and I enjoyed watching him come along and I enjoyed watching him campaign and win the job. But I'm not a fan of what he's doing at the moment.... I just don't think he's governing. I don't think he's surrounded himself with the people he could have surrounded himself with." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{these recent}} developments, Larkin and his circle are {{nonetheless}} still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. For example, the poet Andrew Duncan, writing of The Movement on his pinko.org website, notes that [...] "there {{now seems to}} be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> dearth of magazines during the 50s—an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents." [...] Peter Riley, a key player in the British Poetry Revival, which was a reaction against The Movement's poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: [...] "What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of 'This is what life is really like' as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable 'life'. W.S. Graham and Dylan Thomas knew perfectly well that 'life' was like that, if you nominated it thus, which is why they went elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Box" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Salon.com {{gave the}} episode an A-, explaining [...] "this week's episode was {{chock full of}} good stuff. We get some more fun nuggets about how Earth 2 differs from Earth 1... Your Bose headphones cannot protect you from the awesome sonic power of [...] "The Box". UGO Networks' Alex Zalben wrote [...] "Two weeks in, Fringe {{is still the best}} damn show currently on TV". Zalben loved the serial aspects of the plot, praised Anna Torv's performance, but disliked how no one has realized Fauxlivia's true identity. Josh Wigler from MTV enjoyed the episode particularly because although he found the parallel universe a [...] "compelling world, sometimes it's nice to just kick your feet up on the table and know that you're home... Two episodes down, and it's safe to say that the third season of [...] "Fringe" [...] is off to a very strong start". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> episode, with [...] "a tremendously clever game-changer of an ending...This Fringe was {{a good example of how}} far the series has come since its first season, dominated by pre-credits scare-scenarios for Fringe Division to investigate, some of which spilled over into the show's mythology. Now, Fringe is a seamless whole".|$|E
5000|$|The satirist P.J. O'Rourke said of it: [...] "The Know-It-All <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> book. It's <b>a</b> lot {{shorter than}} the encyclopedia, and funnier, and you'll {{remember}} more of it. Plus, if it falls off the shelf onto your head, you'll live." ...|$|R

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{was very}} pleased with the episode, stating that it was [...] "a very good and well-acted episode. I like it because it {{actually}} seemed too real to me. It played less as a paranormal science fiction show than as whether or not something could really happen. The entire cast was wonderful. Overall that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> episode". In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Lazarus" [...] was rated a C+, being described as [...] "as exciting as Scully's taste in men (not very)". The episode's supporting cast, however, was described as [...] "solid". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated episode a B-, finding that it had [...] "no real thematic resonance". He found that the episode left its premise [...] "largely unexplored", and would have benefited from a stronger focus on the relationship between the characters of Willis and Dupre. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode negatively, feeling that it [...] "wasn't up to much", and that it [...] "plays more like an episode of [...] than anything else". However, the exploration of Scully's character history was cited as a positive aspect of the episode. Anna Johns, writing for TV Squad, was critical of [...] "Lazarus", stating that its opening scene was [...] "the only good part" [...] of the episode.|$|E
500|$|A third {{series was}} {{announced}} on 27 September 2010, commissioned by BBC Learning, {{as part of}} a new BBC strategy to provide learning opportunities for all audiences. Saul Nassé, Controller of Learning, said, [...] "I want to use BBC programmes that are known and loved by audiences that can serve as springboards for learning. [...] We'll be enlisting the help of the BBC's best talent to maximise the reach of our output," [...] and Sathe commented, [...] "We are thrilled with the success of the first two series and have already started to storyline the third. Be prepared for a few familiar faces, a couple of new ones and a lot of fireworks." [...] It was confirmed that Learning would fund the third series and work with young people to develop storylines [...] "that bring to life subjects in the Personal, Social, Health Education (PSHE) curriculum such as bullying or peer pressure." [...] A regional schools tour was organised to tie in with the launch of the series, with pupils writing short scenes based on scenarios tying in with the PSHE curriculum, which were performed, filmed and edited. Sarah Miller, BBC Learning commissioner and executive producer of series 3, explained: [...] "The schools tour <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> opportunity to deliver powerful face-to-face workshops, giving students and teachers the opportunity to develop key media production skills and to get behind the scenes of a top BBC drama." ...|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on March 19, 2009, [...] "New Boss" [...] was watched by 7.95 million overall viewers {{and received a}} Nielsen rating of 3.9 among adults aged between 18 and 49, and 4.4 among ages 18 to 34. The episode received generally positive reviews. Marc Hirsh of National Public Radio said {{the addition of the}} no-nonsense Charles Miner character infused a sense of reality into The Office, which he said was growing increasingly wacky and out of control: [...] " [...] may, in fact, {{have been one of the}} most important episodes of the entire series, acting as a corrective to the show's increasing flirtations with ridiculousness. The characters of The Office have lived in a bubble for long enough." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said [...] "New Boss" [...] brought a badly needed change to the series, which he said had been in a [...] "stagnant state" [...] over the last several episodes. Fickett said Steve Carell gave [...] "a tour de force" [...] as Michael saw his power slip away, and he called the final scene when Michael quit as one of the show's biggest moments. He said, [...] "Watching Miner work like a monkey wrench thrown into the works is the most fun I've had watching this show in a long time." [...] Shahzad Abbas of TV Guide said, [...] "Overall, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> episode, tightly structured, some nice laugh-out loud moments, and a genuine shocker at the end that was completely consistent with Michael's personality." ...|$|E
5000|$|Pop Matters {{gave the}} album a six star rating out of 10, [...] "Who Knew? comes {{after nine years}} of label changes, promotional singles, leaked songs, false starts, and {{personal}} problems that left fans of the songstress thinking that she'd never release a proper album again. Wyatt is clearly aware of this fact, as she has crafted <b>an</b> album that <b>is</b> designed to let everyone know that she is here to stay. Who Knew? is built around Wyatt's gospel-reared, wonderfully versatile voice, which, mostly, works out in fine, if uninspiring, fashion. Who Knew? proves that Wyatt <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> singer. But that doesn't necessarily mean this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> album. It <b>is</b> not. But it {{is good enough to}} make Keke Wyatt a singer to watch." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2014 pre-concert {{interview}} Brooks, {{when asked}} what [...] "big numbers" [...] she looked forward to singing, replied: [...] "I still really like Dont Cry Out Loud, Sunshine After the Rain and of course Fool If You Think It’s Over: that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> song." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Ken Dryden awarded the album 3½ stars and states [...] "While this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> live performance, there are sound problems, {{including}} {{what sounds like}} bleeding of the stage monitors into the mix, and there are muddy spots in the recording as well".|$|R
2500|$|Stuart Kaminsky, Publishers Weekly (December 19, 2005) — I {{ended up}} writing the last episode, [...] "Immune to Murder," [...] {{based on one}} of Rex Stout's short stories.

2500|$|Security {{researcher}} Ross Anderson {{reported in}} 1994 that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> row between the NATO signal intelligence {{agencies in the}} mid-1980s over whether GSM encryption should be strong or not. The Germans said it should be, as they shared a long border with the Warsaw Pact; but the other countries didn't feel this way, and the algorithm as now fielded is a French design." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, the Packard One-Twenty {{had been}} {{introduced}} in 1935, and had taken off like a rocket. Additional competition from the Lincoln-Zephyr, introduced in 1936, did not help, either. For 1937, Cadillac made the LaSalle its own again, giving it the [...] monobloc V8 of the Series 60, new styling, a lower price range, and a heavy promotion, emphasizing the car was completely Cadillac built. It was too late. Model year sales of 32,000 LaSalles <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> leap forward, but remained leagues behind the junior Packard.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 Dudderidge {{described}} Blyth {{as being}} focused on customer needs through the 1970s and '80s, interested in designing mixing consoles to fit: [...] "I vividly remember lunch meetings with Albert Leccese of Audio Analysts where Graham would start designing stuff with Albert on cocktail napkins; there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrific</b> synergy between them... {{and the things}} we worked on with Tom Schlum and Mick Whelan of Electrotec prior to that were just as exciting.
