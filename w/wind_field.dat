40|$|Abstract: Conical {{scans of}} Doppler LIDAR {{were made at}} a {{specific}} elevation angle to monitor the <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> in cases of plume dispersion in western Australia. To better visualize the airflow patterns {{in relation to the}} plume direction, variational analysis is performed on the radial velocity data of the LIDAR to retrieve the 2 D <b>wind</b> <b>fields.</b> Compared to the 4 DVAR method, the 2 D variational analysis as adopted in the present paper is computationally more efficient yet provides sufficient details of the flow patterns. Examples of the plume dispersion are shown with the 2 D analyzed <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> as presented in the paper. In general, the analyzed <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> are consistent with the plume directions as observed from the backscattered power data of the LIDAR...|$|R

5|$|Size {{plays an}} {{important}} role in modulating damage caused by a storm. All else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. Additionally, a larger near-surface <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.|$|E
40|$|An h-adaptive mass {{consistent}} {{finite element}} model (FEM) is developed for constructing 3 -D <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> over irregular terrain. The h-adaptive FEM allows the element size to be changed dynamically according to local flow and topographic features. The mesh is refined and unrefined to satisfy preset error criteria.

The simulated <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> over the bay {{have a positive}} curl {{in the north and}} a negative curl in the south. These <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> were used to simulate the current in Funka Bay using a barotropic ocean model. The simulated current pattern was composed of two vortices—one with anti-clockwise vorticity in the north and the other with clockwise vorticity in the south—and was in the opposite direction to that simulated by the uniform <b>wind</b> <b>fields.</b> This is because the wind stress curl effect on the vorticity production in Funka Bay opposes and overwhelms the bathymetry torque effect during cold air outbreaks.

30|$|In the {{intuitive}} illustration of snapshots and footprints in Fig.  8, the key {{characteristics of the}} <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> are well captured. The spatial heterogeneity of the <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> is quantified by the PBL models by consideration of the variations in terrain type, slope direction, slope degree, and surface roughness length. Moreover, there is a distinct difference between the winds over the sea and land, which is usually caused by the rapid decay of TCs after landfall. Asymmetry in the simulated instantaneous <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> are captured because the gradient models are able to integrate the effect of TC forwarding.|$|R
5|$|Doria passed near {{or through}} the {{northern}} Caribbean Islands and the Bahamas as a tropical depression, though effects, if any, are unknown. Tropical Storm Doria passed about 160miles (260km) east of Charleston, South Carolina, though its large <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> produced 22mph (35km/h) winds in the town. The storm also dropped light rainfall of up to 1.75inches (44mm), and resulted in a storm tide of 5.7feet (1.7m) above the mean low water level.|$|E
5|$|The Hurricane Severity Index (HSI) {{is another}} scale used and rates the {{severity}} {{of all types of}} tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields. The HSI is a 0 to 50 point scale, allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclone's intensity and up to 25 points for <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> size. Points are awarded on a sliding scale, with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fields.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved westward off {{the coast}} of Africa on July 27. Initially, virgorous convection persisted throughout the wave axis, though dry air greatly diminished the convection on July 28. The <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> remained well-defined as it continued westward, and deep convection increased two days later along the northern end of the wave axis. Dvorak classifications began on July 30 in response to an increase in vertical depth and organization of the convection. On July 31 a buoy recorded a change of wind direction from northeast to west, indicating a small low pressure area formed. Convective organization rapidly increased as it turned to the northwest, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Three on August 1 while located about 235miles (375km) east-southeast of Barbuda.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} {{tropical storm}} status, the maximum sustained winds fluctuated {{for three days}} between 40mph (65km/h) and 50mph (85km/h). This {{was due to the}} large size of Florence; the overall <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> reached a diameter of 460miles (745km), and the radius of maximum winds reached about 110miles (170km). By September 6, a well-defined cloud swirl became evident, with thin rainbands developing in the southeast and northwest quadrants. As a result, hurricane forecasters anticipated Florence would develop significantly and attain major hurricane status. Though convection gradually migrated closer {{to the center of the}} storm, forecasters could not detect a well-defined center of circulation by late on September 6. On September 7, convection developed over and to the west of the center for the first time in its duration. However, Florence failed to intensify further, as its <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> had increased to more than 1,035miles (1,670km) in diameter. This led to difficulties in forecasting, as its environment favored further strengthening; the storm tracked through an area of 84°F (29°C) water temperatures and light shear, and the system maintained a large low-level cyclonic envelop with abundant convection. By early on September 8, the storm consisted of an elongated, shapeless cloud pattern atypical of a tropical cyclone. Later that day, as an anticyclone developed over Florence, the storm began to consolidate around a vorticity center on the western side of the large cyclonic envelope. It began to strengthen more steadily as it turned to the northwest. Early on September 10, an eye began developing within a round central dense overcast over the center, and shortly thereafter Florence attained hurricane status while located about 390miles (630km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} {{tropical storm}} status, Doria quickly intensified as its <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> expanded while moving northward. The minimum central pressure quickly dropped, as well, and late on August 27, Doria {{reached its peak}} intensity of 65mph (105km/h) while making landfall on North Carolina near Morehead City. The storm maintained its peak winds as it moved north-northeastward through North Carolina, and weakened slightly to a 60mph (95km/h) tropical storm after entering Virginia on August 28. Doria turned to the northeast, passing through the Chesapeake Bay and Delmarva Peninsula before entering southern New Jersey. It paralleled the state a short distance inland, and after moving through New York City Doria became extratropical over northwestern Maine on August 29. The extratropical remnant continued northeastward until losing its identity near the border of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada.|$|E

5|$|As Helene {{recurved}} {{and accelerated}} towards more northerly latitudes, it steadily weakened. By 1200 UTC on September 28, Helene {{was no longer}} a major hurricane. The hurricane's <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> also expanded from the storm's center as it weakened. By midday on September 29, Helene had weakened to minimal hurricane strength, and later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 1800 UTC that day, though it still maintained hurricane-force winds. At roughly the same time, Helene passed over Newfoundland, with gale force winds having expanded 500 mi (800 km) from the system's center, coinciding with the US Weather Bureau's final advisory on the system. Helene's extratropical remnants continued eastward across the Atlantic, becoming a dominant synoptic feature, before entirely dissipating by 0600 UTC on October 4 just west of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Fanele {{weakened}} quickly over land; {{within four}} hours of moving ashore, its winds decreased to 150km/h (95mph), and its <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> expanded. The eye feature dissipated as the system weakened to tropical storm status, and increased wind shear contributed to further weakening. By January22, the poorly defined circulation moved over open waters, by which time its winds weakened to about 45km/h (30mph). Upon reaching the ocean, convection began to reform near the circulation, and Fanele re-attained tropical storm status. Cooler waters caused convection diminish near the center, which began the process of extratropical transition. Late on January22, the JTWC issued its last advisory on the storm. By January23, Fanele completed the transition into an extratropical storm as it accelerated toward the south-southeast. It persisted as a distinct tropical cyclone until later that day.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{decrease}} in convection shortly after forming, the large depression remained well organized, with a <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> 575mi (930km) in diameter. On August 22, as it passed 140mi (225km) to south of the Cape Verde islands, deep convection developed over the center of circulation, and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300mi (485km) southwest of Cape Verde. Banding features continued to organize as the system slowly strengthened, and on August 23 Debby attained a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to intensify to attain hurricane status, while its projected path placed the storm {{in an area of}} warm water temperatures and moderate upper level shear.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the reconstruction of}} high-resolution (HR) sea surface <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> (typically, at a spatial reso- lution of 1 km). The availability of such HR fields is critical for numerous issues, e. g. coastal management, offshore structures, oil spill disaster tracking, etc. Satellites, especially from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems, can monitor the ocean surface at a spatial resolution of a few meters. SAR <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> are operationally produced with spatial resolutions of less than 1 km [1, 2]. However, satellite SAR systems involve a highly irregular sampling of the ocean surface and, for a given region, SAR <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> may be delivered with a low temporal resolution, typically every 7 -to- 10 days for temperate zones. By contrast, model predictions, such as European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) <b>wind</b> <b>fields,</b> are typically delivered with a high temporal resolution (e. g. every 3 h), but with a low spatial resolution (∼ 50 km × 50 km). The question of the combination of numerical model predictions and SAR <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> naturally arises to deliver HR <b>wind</b> <b>fields</b> at sea surface anywhere and anytime. Here, we state this issue as the statistical learning of transfer functions between low-resolution (LR) model predictions and the associated HR SAR fields. We investigate {{the extent to which}} such regression functions can be learnt from a set of co-located HR and LR fields. Both local and non-local schemes as well as linear and non- linear regression methods are considered.

Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms.

5|$|Roughly {{two weeks}} after Kanoa dissipated, the season's second {{hurricane}} was identified over the open waters of the eastern Pacific on August6. This storm traveled {{in a similar fashion}} to Kanoa in response to a high pressure system over the northern Pacific. By August9, the system turned northwest and weakened. Cold, dry air began to enter the storm as it accelerated over cooler waters. Several reconnaissance missions were flown into the storm due to rapid changes in the storm's <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> and structure. Late on August10, the system intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and its forward motion slowed as it turned more westward.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} slid slowly northwestward {{between the}} contiguous upper vortex {{and a large}} high-pressure region over the central Atlantic. A region of lighter wind shear ahead, {{as well as an}} anticipated weakening of the upper cyclone, prompted the NHC to introduce the possibility of a tropical transition. Later, satellite observations showed a rapid improvement in the depression's structure; convective banding wrapped completely around the broad inner <b>wind</b> <b>field,</b> which produced gusts to 65mph (105km/h). Accordingly, the NHC upgraded the depression to Subtropical Storm Otto at 21:00UTC on October6, about 215mi (345km) northeast of Grand Turk. Although satellite images continued to display a classical subtropical cyclone, with Otto's center and the vortex aloft nearly collocated, data from a Hurricane Hunters aircraft indicated a weak warm convective core was developing within the mid levels of the circulation—a feature normally present at the upper levels of tropical cyclones. Moreover, a contraction of the large <b>wind</b> <b>field</b> reaffirmed that Otto was entering the final stages of its tropical transition. Although convective activity briefly weakened overnight, weakening shear and considerably warmer sea surface temperatures permitted small patches of thunderstorms to refire on the morning of October7. As Otto meandered northward, temperature contrasts from forecast models indicated that the warm core within the circulation had ascended to the upper levels of the cyclone. In consequence, a burst of deep, tropical convection with extreme cloud top temperatures of approximately 112°F (80°C) occurred over the center. Having shed the last of its subtropical characteristics, Otto became a warm-core system and was operationally declared tropical at 1200UTC that day.|$|E
