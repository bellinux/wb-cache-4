5|$|Realizing {{the need}} for new leadership, in {{what became known as the}} Polish October, the Politburo chose Gomułka, who had been {{released}} from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR. Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland. Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was soon reinforced by the pressure from communist China, which expressed its great power aspirations and demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone. On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland. Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous social democratic-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing revisionists and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable. The revisionists replaced and claimed to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. The main goals in pursuit of which they engaged were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises. However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> sight. On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of NATO.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Vincejo came to intercept, {{after a long}} chase and a warning shot, a large (6-700 ton (bm)) vessel. She {{turned out to be}} the Hercules, of Boston, and hence neutral, with no {{apparent}} cargo. The American captain explained to Long that Hercules had taken cargo to Leghorn, sold it there, and then had agreed to take a small number of invalid French officers to a French port where he might find a return cargo for the United States. Long was suspicious and ordered Hercules to accompany him overnight in Long's hope that they might encounter Cockburn and that he would decide what to do with the American vessel. Next day, when it turned out that Minerve <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> sight, Long released the American vessel, which sailed off to Nice. Later, the British learned that Hercules had been ballasted with brass guns (violating her neutrality), and had hidden aboard her French plunder in the form of statues, pictures, plate, and the like.|$|E

60|$|A {{search was}} made, {{and it was}} soon ascertained that their enemies <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> that vicinity. Then breakfast was had, and a little later {{the search for the}} lost Landslide Mine was continued.|$|R
60|$|Mac <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> that sleeper, {{judging from}} the vehement denials. But the Rube kept on digging and prodding in the upper berths.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't {{want to keep}} Uncle Foster waiting," [...] said Earl; {{but when}} they reached the wharf their uncle <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> sight.|$|E
60|$|They {{reached the}} terrace. Lady O'Moy <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> sight. But Lord Wellington {{was too much}} engrossed in his {{discovery}} to be troubled.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly an {{unexpected}} series of sounds {{began to be}} heard in this place up against the sky. They had a clearness which was to <b>be</b> found <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> the wind, and a sequence which was to <b>be</b> found <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> nature. They <b>were</b> the notes of Farmer Oak's flute.|$|R
60|$|Paul {{led the way}} in the {{direction}} of the barn. There, in the gloom, they saw two men struggling violently. They were Dottery and the negro, Jeff Jones. The other horse thieves and Jack Blowfen <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> sight.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{we can do}} is to get {{something}} to eat and take the other train for Oakdale," [...] said Roger, after they had satisfied themselves that the runaways <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> that vicinity. The walking around had made him hungry.|$|R

40|$|The Denjoy-Carleman {{classes are}} spaces of smooth {{functions}} which satisfy growth conditions on their derivatives defined through weight sequences. In this talk, given a Denjoy-Carleman class E of Beurling type that strictly contains another non-quasianalytic class F of Roumieu type, we handle {{the question of}} knowing how large the set of functions <b>in</b> E that <b>are</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> the class $F$ is. In particular, we prove the dense-lineability of the set of functions of $E$ which <b>are</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> F. Consequences for the Gevrey classes are also given. We extend then these results {{to the case of}} classes of ultradifferentiable functions defined imposing conditions on their Fourier Laplace transform using weight functions...|$|R
60|$|The thieving crew <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> sight, {{as would}} have been the case had they sailed in almost any other than a southerly direction, and it seemed {{probable}} that the yawl had been headed toward Nassau despite the danger the men would incur of being arrested.|$|R
50|$|Like many {{animated}} series, {{it regularly}} surpasses the Bond movies {{in terms of}} fantastic gadgets, while {{the violence of the}} adult Bond series <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> evidence.

60|$|But Ward Porton {{was evidently}} scared. He looked back, and, seeing Dave running, {{increased}} his speed, and then shot {{around a corner}} and into an alleyway. When Dave reached the corner he <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> sight.|$|E
60|$|Bud snored in {{the shade}} of a big boulder. Herky whistled as he broke dead {{branches}} into fagots for a campfire. Bill <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> sight. I saw several of the horses browsing along the edge of the water.|$|E
60|$|Reddy had {{to confess}} he didn't know. He <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> sight, and he {{certainly}} hadn't had time to reach the dear Old Briar-patch. Jimmy looked {{this way and that}} way, {{but there was no sign}} of Peter Rabbit.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Becky gives {{premature}} birth. Cal and Tobin then {{appear and}} wrap {{the baby in}} a shirt. Becky then passes out to [...] "slurping sounds."

60|$|Such was {{the terrifying}} {{question}} which Sam asked {{himself as he}} stared out of the pilothouse window into the darkness before him. Another flash of lightning lit up the scene and he made certain that his big brother <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> sight.|$|E
50|$|After a 70-hour ride {{without food}} or water, Eva and Miriam, {{along with their}} mother, arrived at the {{selection}} platform.

5000|$|The famous {{syllogism}} [...] "Socrates {{is a man}} ...", {{is frequently}} quoted as though from Aristotle, but fact, it <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> the Organon.
