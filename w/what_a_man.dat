It is not important to convert or to join any religion, {{but it is important}} to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.|$|E

The Scoutmaster living the Scout law will have more influence than one who simply talks about it.

25|$|Socrates gets Hippias {{to agree}} that the more a man knows about a subject, the better {{position}} he will be in to lie about it.

Socrates never indicates <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> might stand to gain from lying about such matters, but brings the conversation back around to Achilles, and what kind of man Homer intended to portray.|$|E

This moved Héloïse to write her first Letter; the first being {{followed}} by the two other Letters, in which she finally accepted the part of resignation, which, now as a brother to a sister, Abelard commended to her. Sometime before 1140, Abelard published his masterpiece, Ethica or Scito te ipsum (Know Thyself), where he analyzes the idea of sin and that actions are not <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> will be judged for but intentions. During this period, he also wrote Dialogus inter Philosophum, Judaeum et Christianum (Dialogue between a Philosopher, a Jew, and a Christian), and also Expositio in Epistolam ad Romanos, a commentary on St. Paul's epistle to the Romans, where he expands {{on the meaning of}} Christ's life.|$|E
25|$|While {{in command}} of the Jane, Rodgers' strong and {{determined}} character was made evident during one of his voyages navigating the North Sea. Adverse winter winds had carried the vessel off course, the ship's provisions were almost exhausted, and three of his crewmen had frozen to death in one night, while most of the others had lapsed into hopeless despair. When Rodgers ordered some of the crew to go aloft to secure the ice encrusted rigging, they refused. Outraged at their desolation, Rodgers stripped off his jacket and shirt and, before going aloft, told the insubordinate crew to watch <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> could do. While he climbed the frozen rigging bare-chested, the crew, awe struck, immediately rose to his aid and in little time they secured the faltering rigging. Under the grim circumstances of their situation Rodgers put the matter behind him and days later they safely reached port.|$|E

Women were initially paid two-thirds of <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> {{at the same level}} made. As the war progressed the military leaders began to see the substantial impact the women could make. In many cases the women had outperformed their male counterparts. This was taken into account and the women received a raise to four-fifths of the wages of a man. A female doctor however, received equal financial compensation to her male counterpart. One commander argued that it would be impossible for female recruits to reach the location of his station, even though it was located only three and a half miles from the city and was serviced by a paved road and a bus route The negative reaction of men towards the female recruits was addressed in propaganda films.

500|$|Statements {{regarding}} Jesuit-encouraged plots against Queen Elizabeth {{were read}} to the court, {{as well as some}} of the plotters' confessions. Garnet defended his use of equivocation with his own treatise on the doctrine. He had denied his conversation with Oldcorne as it was a secret, but said that in matters of faith, equivocation could never be lawful. When asked by Salisbury what he would do if the pope excommunicated King James, he [...] "denied to answer". His defence of equivocation was scorned by Coke, who called it [...] "open and broad lying and forswearing". [...] As for Tesimond's confession, the planned assassination had not at that point happened and so Salisbury said that Garnet could easily have alerted the government. [...] Salisbury attacked the idea that it had ever been made under the seal of the confessional, and claimed anyway that Garnet could have warned the authorities after his more ordinary conversation with Catesby about the death of innocents; the priest replied by saying that at the time, he did not understand the relevance of Catesby's questions. The Earl of Northampton said, in Latin, [...] "quod non-prohibet cum potest, jubet" [...] (<b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> does not forbid when he can, he orders). Garnet's defence, that he had forbidden Catesby from proceeding, was futile.|$|E

2500|$|The persona, he argues, is a mask for the [...] "{{collective}} psyche", a {{mask that}} 'pretends' individuality, so that both {{self and others}} believe in that identity, {{even if it is}} really no more than a well-played role through which the collective psyche is expressed. Jung regarded the [...] "persona-mask" [...] as a complicated system which mediates between individual consciousness and the social community: it is [...] "a compromise between the individual and society as to <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> should appear to be". But he also makes it quite explicit that it is, in substance, a character mask in the classical sense known to theatre, with its double function: both intended to make a certain impression to others, and to hide (part of) {{the true nature of the}} individual. The therapist then aims to assist the individuation process through which the client (re)gains his [...] "own self" [...] – by liberating the self, both from the deceptive cover of the persona, and from the power of unconscious impulses.|$|E

2500|$|Most significantly, {{the desire}} to {{dominate}} others is what motivates the Crawfords. Henry Crawford is attracted to Fanny Price because he cannot fathom her mind, and is obsessed with [...] "knowing" [...] her, to destroy her identity and remake her into his own image of what he wants her to be, making him in many respects in Edwards's viewpoint the most monstrous of Austen's villains as he wants to erase Fanny's identity just to please his own vanity. Mary Crawford is likewise in her relations with Edmund is not prepared to accept him as he is, but only to remade into her own image of <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> should be. Edwards argued Austen could have easily titled Mansfield Park Conscience and Consciousness as the novel's main conflict is the struggle between conscience, what people really feel in their souls, and consciousness, which understood {{at the time to}} mean [...] "having one's thoughts and attention unduly centered in one's own personality". The climactic struggle of the novel is Henry's efforts to win Fanny so he could impose his will on her, to remake her as he would like her to be, and Fanny's efforts to maintain her identity. Even when Henry tries to please Fanny as when renounces acting and discusses Shakespeare, he is still acting as he keeps a careful watch on Fanny's reaction, measuring his every word and the reaction on her face. Edwards wrote that the theatrical aspect of Henry, the man who is always acting {{can be seen in the}} way in which he considers careers in the Church of England and the Royal Navy after encounters with Edmund and William respectively, a man who has no identity of his own and who constantly reinvents himself.|$|E
