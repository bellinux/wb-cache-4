25|$|I {{would say}} from my gut {{that we are}} {{probably}} as low as we're {{going to go in}} that valley, and heading for the next peak. That's fine <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> everybody needs a turn. We've been {{at the top of the}} mountain twice already, and, if nothing else, we need to get out of the way and let other bands have some fun. I mean, now there's variety that Christian kids can have. And they don't just grab Petra. Now they can grab Jars of Clay, dc Talk or Newsboys.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Fuse in August 2012, Q-Tip confirmed that {{he was working with}} Carey on material for her fourteenth studio album. In April 2014, Carey confirmed that she and Q-Tip had worked together on a song which was yet to be mixed in {{an interview}} with Radio.com. Of the collaboration, Carey said [...] "He's angry <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> he thinks that I didn't allow him to do his mix, but really it's okay. He loves me, we're going to make this work. And that's good because it's one of my favorite songs. I'm going to call him soon... I think we need to get that ready." [...] She also stated that {{it was the first time}} they had worked together since composing [...] "Honey" [...] for Carey's sixth studio album, Butterfly (1997).|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{nothing the}} matter <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Jimmy Skunk," [...] said Johnny. [...] "There's nothing the matter <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> It's just <b>because</b> I've got a secret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Angry <b>with</b> <b>me!</b> Angry <b>because</b> I love her, so that I risk my {{life just}} to see her, to hear her speak! Ah! but that is cruel! Let me go in and speak to her! Let <b>me</b> plead <b>with</b> her in my own fashion!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has been}} {{staying at the}} farm," [...] Kate answered, [...] "for days. I brought her <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to-night <b>because</b> I thought that she might know {{something}} about Lord Ronald's disappearance. She is there waiting. If I do not return by daylight, she {{will go to the}} police." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] {{was written}} by Alejandro Sanz for his album El Tren de los Momentos (2006). He also handled the song's {{production}} together with Lulo Pérez. Shakira, {{a close friend of}} Sanz, was the one who approached him in order to sing on his album, asking of him to make sure that she sounds [...] "nothing like she does on her own". [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] marks the second time Sanz and Shakira collaborated after [...] "La Tortura", included on the latter's Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005). Sanz stated, [...] "I hadn't dared ask her if she wanted to do something <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> it was a little like, 'I sing with you, now sing with me'. Plus, we didn't want it to be 'La Tortura 2' because we're very considerate of each other. She's the one who came and said, 'Hey, I want to sing'." [...] He concluded the interview by saying that with the collaborations, he managed to expand his artistry by experimenting with new styles.|$|E
2500|$|.....so {{nearsighted}} {{he carried}} about four different pairs of glasses with him...but by God, {{if you wanted}} a target bombed, he would hit it. He would hit it when everybody else missed. ...He got furious <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I wouldn't let him get up there among the MiGs. I told him, 'Pappy, every fighter pilot in the Air Force knows and loves you, and I {{am not going to}} be the guy that sends you up there to get your butt scragged.' He just could not see anymore.|$|E
2500|$|The filmmakers {{considered}} {{dozens of}} child actors for Jack before choosing seven-year-old Jacob Tremblay from Vancouver. Tremblay said his part was not hard [...] "because I {{was playing a}} happy child" [...] unaware of the sinister nature of Room. However, {{because he was too}} young to read the whole screenplay, each scene was explained to him one by one. Tremblay wore a wig made from human hair. According to Joan Allen, Larson and Tremblay met for over three weeks to build a [...] "very tight, obviously critical, close relationship," [...] before the Room scenes were shot over five weeks. Allen arrived in Toronto later and met Tremblay, [...] "But we didn’t want him to become too familiar <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> that’s not what the story is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh--yes!" [...] and Miss Dunstable {{stopped in}} the grand path. [...] "I won't let you return <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Mr Moffat, <b>because</b> I know you were not coming in so soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [25] <b>with</b> <b>me?</b> Is it <b>because</b> {{we are not}} so happy, as they? Is {{it because}} I groan {{sometimes}} even as thou groanest? Then Cain stopped, &c. MS. Bijou, 1828.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said the}} Egyptian, sadly, [...] "I see you are angry <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> Is it <b>because</b> I said I {{lived in a}} tree? Do forgive me for that dreadful lie." ...|$|R
2500|$|Their honeymoon {{was at her}} parents' house, and Martin's {{dream of}} life with a family and a white-picket fence faded. [...] "I was 17, a married woman without real responsibilities, miserable about my mixed-up emotions, afraid there was {{something}} awfully wrong <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I didn't enjoy being a wife. Worst of all, I didn't have enough to do." [...] (p.39) It was [...] "Sister" [...] who came to her rescue, suggesting that she should teach dance. [...] "Sister" [...] taught Martin her first real dance—the waltz clog. Martin perfectly imitated her first dance move, and she opened a dance studio. Here, she created her own moves, imitated the famous dancers she watched in the movies and taught [...] "Sister's" [...] waltz clog. As she later recalled, [...] "I was doing something I wanted to do—creating." [...] (p.44) ...|$|E
2500|$|DeLillo {{returned}} with what {{would turn out}} to be his final novel of the decade with Falling Man in May 2007. The novel concerned the impact on one family of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, [...] "an intimate story which is encompassed by a global event." [...] According to a 2007 interview in Die Zeit, DeLillo claims that originally he [...] "didn't ever want to write a novel about 9/11" [...] and [...] "had an idea for a different book" [...] which he had [...] "been working on for half a year" [...] in 2004 when he came up with an idea for the novel, beginning work on the novel following the re-election of George W. Bush that November. Although highly anticipated and eagerly awaited by critics, who felt that DeLillo was one of the contemporary writers best equipped to tackle the events of 9/11 in novelistic form, the novel met with a mixed critical reception and garnered no major literary awards or nominations. DeLillo, however, remained unconcerned by this relative lack of critical acclaim, remarking in 2010, [...] "In the 1970s, when I started writing novels, I was a figure in the margins, and that’s where I belonged. If I’m headed back that way, that’s fine <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> that’s always where I felt I belonged. Things changed for me in the 1980s and 1990s, but I’ve always preferred to be somewhere in the corner of a room, observing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw! Bushy {{is not a}} man of feeling. Besides, he is a coward. He {{refused to}} come <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I {{purchased}} a revolver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"He wants us! What do {{you think}} of that, Padda?" [...] He pulled the seal's {{whiskers}} till it threw back its head and roared, and he pretended to interpret. [...] "No! Padda says he won't be baptized yet awhile. He says you'll stay to dinner and come fishing <b>with</b> <b>me</b> tomorrow, <b>because</b> you're over-worked and need a rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So," [...] she said, [...] "now {{you look}} pretty again--and your nice, fat cheeks have the sweetest of dimples. Nay, I vow, all these young gallants only sigh <b>with</b> love for <b>me</b> <b>because</b> you frown on them so!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right," [...] he acknowledged. [...] "Take {{care of it}} for me. I took it <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to Ireland, <b>because</b> one never knows what may happen in that amazing country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--no--it {{shall not}} be. It may be--it shall be better <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I have known you." [...] She turned immediately, and quitted the room.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{then this}} is not my natural manner?' she rejoined. 'Now you must really bear <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I ask for information. We never know ourselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{asked her}} not to come down <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> Frank wished {{to speak to me}} about his own affairs. You have no {{objection}} to his coming, papa?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's quite too ridiculous!" [...] she declared, tossing her head. [...] "I {{really wanted}} you to come <b>with</b> <b>me</b> this morning, <b>because</b> you know the country," [...] she added, with a sidelong glance from her dark eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Hodder {{will tell}} you. I {{want you to}} know that I wouldn't marry--your brother," [...] she hesitated over the name. [...] "He wanted me to--he was mad <b>with</b> <b>me</b> to night, <b>because</b> I wouldn't--when this happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|Your Excellency is {{not pleased}} <b>with</b> <b>me</b> [...] <b>Because</b> of certain jests I made of late, [...] And, for my putting rogues in pillory, [...] Accuse {{me of being}} anti-German. Wait, [...] And hear a thing that {{happened}} recently: [...] When wandering here and there one day as fate [...] Led me, by some odd accident I ran [...] On the old church St. Ambrose, at Milan.|$|R
6000|$|... [Taking his hand.] Good-bye, John. You're {{not angry}} <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I was horrid.... I'm glad {{you told me}} about his wife. Now I shall know what to do.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{forehead}} puckered {{a little}} in thought. [...] "I don't quite know," [...] she said simply. [...] "Sometimes more--sometimes less. They come and stay <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I love them, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How misunderstood? Why Sir Francis? Am I to {{understand}} {{that you want to}} quarrel <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I am going away? If so speak it out. I shall go just the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He is {{a regular}} screw!' responded Herbert. 'What do you think now! He was in no end of a rage <b>with</b> <b>me</b> just <b>because</b> I went {{with some of the}} other fellows to the Colbeam races; and one can't help a bet or two, you know. So I lost twelve pound or so, and what must he do but stop it out of my {{allowance}} two pound at a time!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! ah!" [...] grunted the woman, {{who seemed}} {{literally}} to curl and shrivel up beneath her anger. [...] "Don't be angry <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> Miss Stella, <b>because</b> I can't bear it. I only said {{it because it}} was true. I will fetch the brandy." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was unwilling}} to damp my good friend's confidence, and {{therefore}} assented. After a little further conversation, we went round to the chandler's shop, to enlist Peggotty; Traddles declining to pass the evening <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> both <b>because</b> he endured the liveliest apprehensions that his property would be bought by somebody else before he could re-purchase it, {{and because it was}} the evening he always devoted to writing to the dearest girl in the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I do. Some of {{the girls}} quarrel <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I get sore, and swear they're not square, as I try to be. I hate a liar and a quitter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Harry {{you need}} not be cross <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I love the girl {{who is going to}} be your wife. You would not like it if I did not care about her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{unreasonable}} you are! You told me {{just now}} that I was a hypocrite for {{not telling you}} of my letter, and now you are angry <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I have shown it you." ...|$|E
5000|$|As he {{prepared}} to retire from Face The Nation, Schieffer reflected on the acclaim that came his way during the latter stages of his career. [...] "The interesting thing about my life — {{a lot of the}} recognition I got was after most people retired," [...] he told The New York Times, going on to add, [...] "I think that people just became familiar <b>with</b> <b>me</b> just <b>because</b> I had been there and others had come and gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you like}} do now, eh? P'r'aps wish {{fly back to}} Town of Child, for suppose this how you come. If so, please take <b>me</b> <b>with</b> you, <b>because</b> that save long ride." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I'm a wicked, thoughtless, {{reckless}} man, I suppose. I didn't mean to vex you, Selina; but {{my father}} is so pompous, so absurd, and so tedious. In the whole of this affair I have endeavoured to do exactly {{as he would have}} me; and he is more angry <b>with</b> <b>me</b> now, <b>because</b> his plan has failed, than he ever was before, for any of my past misdoings.--But let me get up now, there's a good girl; for I've no time to lose." ...|$|R
