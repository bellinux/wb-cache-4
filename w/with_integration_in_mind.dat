The designed and simulated architecture is based on one SRAM access in series with two multiplexers and is claimed to be optimally fast.

40|$|The {{integration}} of software tools {{used in an}} engineering process {{is a problem that}} arises frequently in large-scale engineering projects. Traditional approaches are insufficient for complex engineering tools and processes. The solution must also account for the evolution of the system, as tools and processes change over time. This paper shows a new approach to the problem, describes the supporting infrastructure, and discusses the background model-integrated generation technology. 1. Introduction Every large-scale project on computer-based systems that uses software-based engineering tools has to face the problem of their integration. Each of these tools is usually a highly specialized package that contributes to a crucial step in the engineering process. While tool vendors may offer tool suites, the tools used in practice are very rarely integrated across the engineering process. In many cases, the tools were simply not designed <b>with</b> easy <b>integration</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Solving the integratio [...] ...|$|R

Our research funding comes from industry, {{as well as from}} governmental organizations.

CMOS IC technology is dictated by optimal cost and performance of digital circuits and is certainly not optimized for nice analog behavior. As analog designers, {{we do not have the}} illusion to be able to change the CMOS technology, so we have to "live with it" and solve the problems by design. In this article several examples will be shown, where problematic analog behavior, such as noise and distortion, can be tackled with new circuit design techniques. These circuit techniques are developed in such a way that they do benefit from the modern technology and thus enable further integration. This way we can improve various analog building blocks for wireless, wire-line and optical communication. Below some examples are given. ...|$|R

Empirically, we find that integration diminishes employment growth fluctuations within states, and decreases the deviations in employment growth across states. Business cycles within states become smaller <b>with</b> <b>integration,</b> <b>in</b> other words, but more alike.
