But I think {{if you want to}} exceed limits, you have to suck that all in and be happy with <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> At first it was painful to watch all those things but now I take it as {{constructive}} criticism or I don't bother to look at it.|$|E
5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
5|$|What is a boy? He is {{a person}} who is going to carry on <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> started, to sit where you are sitting and, when you are gone, attend to those things you think are so important. You can adopt all the {{policies}} you please, but how they will be carried on depends on him. Even if you make leagues and treaties, he will have to manage them. He will assume control of your cities and nations. He is going to move on and take over your prisons, churches, schools, universities and corporations.|$|E

After a fortnight one discovers that the variations are only apparent, not real; in the third week <b>you</b> get <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the first, and in the fourth the week <b>you</b> get <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the second. Three or four months of this weary sameness will kill the robustest appetite.|$|R

25|$|In 2008, {{plans were}} {{announced}} for a Roy Harper tribute album. The album, What You Need Is <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Have,</b> The Songs of Roy Harper was being compiled by Laurel Canyon folk singer, musician and producer Jonathan Wilson, and was to feature Chris Robinson (the Black Crowes), Gary Louris (the Jayhawks), Johnathan Rice, Eric Johnson (Fruit Bats, the Shins), Benji Hughes, Will Oldham, Andy Cabic, Dawes, Jenny O., Josh Tillman and others. At present, the collection remains unfinished, {{having been delayed}} beyond its planned 2009 release date. Six of the tracks can be heard on the project's Myspace page.|$|E

As in every other community in the City, there will be zero tolerance for behavior which doesn’t respect the celebrated diversity of our communities. And again like last year, there will be zero tolerance for individuals and businesses that do not obey alcohol consumption and distribution regulations. The Home For Halloween website will help promote your events so please let us know about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> planned in your community.|$|E
25|$|You stand {{convicted of}} the truly evil {{abduction}} and murder of a vulnerable young girl in 1991 and thereafter of attempting to defeat the ends of justice in various ways over an extended period... Yet again you have shown yourself to be unfit {{to live in a}} decent society. It is hard for me to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done... I fix the minimum period which you must spend in custody at 30 years. Had it been open to me I would have made that period run consecutive to the 21 year custodial period that you are already serving.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E

500|$|Bamber {{was tried}} in October 1986 before Maurice Drake and a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court, during a trial that lasted 19 days. The {{prosecution}} {{was led by}} Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC. The Times wrote that Bamber cut an arrogant figure in the witness box. At one point when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: [...] "That is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got to establish." ...|$|E
500|$|Samuel Hubbard Scudder {{recorded}} a similar experience, {{first published in}} 1874 as [...] "Look at Your Fish" [...] in Every Saturday magazine. Agassiz again starts his new student off with a fish preserved in alcohol and instructs the student to [...] "look at it", and promises [...] "by and by I will ask <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen". As opposed to Pound's decomposing sunfish, Scudder's account emphasizes the care taken to keep the specimen in good condition: ...|$|E

500|$|For dream {{sequences}} in Inception, Nolan used little computer-generated imagery, preferring {{practical effects}} whenever possible. Nolan said, [...] "It's always {{very important to}} me to do as much as possible in-camera, and then, if necessary, computer graphics are very useful to build on or enhance <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> achieved physically." [...] To this end, visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin built a miniature of the mountain fortress set and then blew it up for the film. For the fight scene that takes place in zero gravity, he used CG-based effects to [...] "subtly bend elements like physics, space and time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by Semi Chellas and Matthew Weiner, and {{directed}} by Phil Abraham. [...] Weiner said in August 2012 that he intended for Peggy's departure from SCDP to be in [...] "The Other Woman", which is centered on Joan: [...] " [...] literally about the quantification and value {{of women in the}} workplace and the relationship of their sexuality to it. I knew that on a subconscious level at the writing stage, {{because of the way the}} stories went together. As these stories fold in together, it starts to become about that, but it was always about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do to get ahead, in a very simple way, and the opportunities to get ahead." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{decided to}} use the digital Thomson Viper Filmstream camera to shoot the film. Fincher had {{previously}} used the Thomson Viper {{over the past three years}} on commercials for Nike, Hewlett Packard, Heineken and Lexus which allowed him to get used to and experiment with the equipment. He was able to use inexpensive desktop software like Final Cut Pro to edit Zodiac. Fincher remarked in an interview, [...] "Dailies almost always end up being disappointing, like the veil is pierced and you look at it for the first time and think, 'Oh my god, this is what I really have to work with.' But when you can see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> as it's gathered, it can be a much less neurotic process." ...|$|E

500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done and, believe me, I appreciate it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Lee, several core {{concepts}} {{were already}} in place from Buck and Del Vecho's early work, such as the film's [...] "frozen heart" [...] hook: [...] "That was a concept and the phrase... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart." [...] They already knew the ending involved true love {{in the sense of}} the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that [...] "Anna was going to save Elsa. We didn’t know how or why." [...] Lee said Edwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, told her early on about the film's ending: [...] "First and foremost, no matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do to the story, do it. But you have to earn that ending. If you do it will be great. If you don't, it will suck." ...|$|E
500|$|Lawson met {{journalist}} John Diamond in 1986, {{when they}} were both writing for The Sunday Times. They married in Venice in 1992, and have a daughter, Cosima, and a son, Bruno. Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47. One of his last messages to Lawson was, [...] "How proud I am of you and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> become. The great thing about us is that we have made us who we are." [...] His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; [...] "I took a fortnight off. But I'm not a great believer in breaks", Lawson explained; she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral. After Diamond's death, Lawson kept all of the press clippings in what she called her [...] "Morbidobox".|$|E
