60|$|MRS GEORGE [coming to {{the hearth}} and {{addressing}} Reginald] Mr Bridgenorth: will you oblige me by leaving {{me with this}} young man. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> like a mother, on YOUR business.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{he was a}} woman," [...] she said, [...] "then I {{could make}} him my friend. I want him as my friend. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and go about with him. Just go about with him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{like the}} Bible!" [...] she murmured. [...] "Fancy the sunrises he must have seen, and the sunsets!

I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> May I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned over}} again a few leaves {{of his book}} and, closing it with {{something}} of a clap, transferred it to the bench beside him--a movement in which, as if through a drop into thought, he rendered her no assistance.

60|$|Then I {{would find}} myself {{thinking}} {{with the utmost}} particularity of her face. Had it changed at all? Was it altogether changed?

Of course she would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me, as now I perceived I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|R

5000|$|... "We cannot simply {{expect them}} to say, 'Our older people have had {{experience}} and they have proved to themselves certain things, therefore they are right.' That isn't the way {{the best kind of}} young people think. They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> experience for themselves. I find they are perfectly willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people, but they don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people who are shocked by their ideas, nor do they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people who are not realistic." ...|$|R
