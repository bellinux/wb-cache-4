500|$|After obtaining {{commercial}} success with first two singles, [...] "Smile" [...] and [...] "LDN", Allen decided {{to promote the}} album by releasing [...] "Littlest Things". The song was composed in New York, where Allen travelled after she had met producer Mark Ronson when at lunch with her then boyfriend, Seb. There, {{she told him she}} was a singer and gave him a copy of her demo CD. He was impressed by her song [...] "Smile" [...] and asked her to work together. Regarding the process of composing the song, Ronson stated: <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> day together and worked on a couple of things, and went to record shops where I played samples to her. Then I wrote the piano and guitar bit to [...] "Littlest Things", and she sat down and scribbled for about an hour and finished the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Three {{weeks after}} Marky joined the band, the Ramones began {{recording}} Road to Ruin in Midtown Manhattan at Media Sound Studios, {{the premises of}} a former Episcopalian Church. [...] Album engineer Ed Stasium explained the recording process: [...] "After Tommy left the band, we went straight into working on the Road to Ruin album with Marky. We rehearsed a long time with Marky, just getting it down. Then {{we went into the}} studio, recorded, and mixed the record at Media Sound. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of money, and the entire summer, on Road to Ruin." [...] Music critic John Young of Rolling Stone called the album's production [...] "clean and simple", but pointed out that the track [...] "Bad Brain" [...] contained [...] "funny noises" [...] in between drum beats, which prevents the song from having the humorous asperity that was intended.|$|E
500|$|Technical {{director}} Lisa Forsell {{explained that}} {{to enhance the}} richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: [...] "Digital matte paintings are {{a way to get}} a lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen that does not have an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed to}} me almost as if <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> entire {{lifetime}} {{within sight of the}} country we were minded to leave behind us, and indeed six weeks, with no change of scene, and while one is held to the narrow limits of a ship, is an exceeding long time.|$|R
500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} creation and execution of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling like we had limited time to capture something, I felt like we could take our time with the songs, and come back the next day to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, for lack of a better word, sloppy. But in a good way. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records. On this one, we went more with the vibe of the particular take in question." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{moved into}} the teen-pop genre, as she felt that {{restyling}} herself to match the image of Spears and Aguilera would help remake her career. She separated from her then-boyfriend Nick Lachey, in March 2001, feeling the need to concentrate on her career. Her new image was promoted through appearances on many events, where Simpson wore revealing outfits. The development of this image coincided with the production and release of her second studio effort, Irresistible. Simpson said {{that she wanted to}} portray a [...] "sexier, more mature style" [...] in her new album. [...] "I recorded Sweet Kisses when I was 17 years old and I'm 21 [...] so there is four years of growth involved," [...] Simpson {{said in an interview with}} Coventry Newspapers in July 2001. In an interview with Cosmopolitan in June 2001, she explained, [...] "This record is about who I am now. The music is edgier, and I'm all grown up." [...] According to Terri Doughtery, author of People in the News: Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey, Simpson hoped her new image would bring more attention to the power of her voice. [...] "It's not just me singing about being in love. I also have heartbreak songs and girls telling off guys songs. It's going to take me a while to recoup [...] this album, because <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of money on it," [...] Simpson said to Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Butch Vig {{stated that}} the album is a [...] "much simpler record than Version 2.0": [...] "All of the songs sort of came from us playing live downstairs [...] with guitar, bass and drums ... That was the only {{conscious}} decision we made – to make the songs simpler. Some of the songs are still layered in spots; compared to the last record, there're about half as many tracks. As far as sounds go, it's basically drums, bass, some heavy guitars and Shirley singing." [...] Erikson agreed that a more organic sound and simplistic approach with respect to production is embodied by the final mix of the album. [...] "A lot of songs took shape {{in just a few}} hours as opposed to a few months with the last record.Some of the songs obviously took a long time, or we wouldn't have been in the studio for a full year. But a lot of them happened very quickly. 'Silence Is Golden' we recorded basically in three days and it was done. 'So Like a Rose,' for the most part, was recorded in three hours. I think <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time just trying to resist adding stuff to [...] Because that was our tendency on the other two records.” On the lyrical content of the songs, Vig remarked that [...] " [...] aren't specifically responses to the industry, but they could be read that way. Shirley has said that, for example, 'Shut Your Mouth' is about all the bullshit that's out there, but it's also a sort of note to self to keep your mouth shut, because she says she's the biggest, most opinionated loudmouth of anyone around. So they work on multiple levels." ...|$|E

It was the longest we’d spent on anything ever we’ve done. We knew how we wanted it to sound {{and we wanted to}} get it perfect, so yeah, <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> long time on it.

2500|$|Guitarist Keith Wallen and bassist Aaron Bruch {{performed}} all of {{the background}} vocals on Dark Before Dawn, unlike previous albums on which Burnley performed his own. Burnley stated that background vocals were worked on the most in regard to producing, elaborating on That Metal Show, [...] "Because, guitars are guitars, you know, I mean, what are you gonna do, you can tune them and all these things, but singing is a totally different animal so that's where <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time. Because when you're playing guitar you can kinda let your style come through, but if you're singing [...] somebody you {{kind of have to}} sound like them for it to really gel, so they really altered, I guess their personality." [...] Bruch added, [...] "It's things like inflection, and vibrato, and making sure you bring it the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pilots and airline {{personnel}} throughout the industry petitioned the NTSB to revise its report. First Officer Claude Ouimet sent the NTSB a detailed defence of the crew's actions, including {{the decision to}} land in Cincinnati instead of Standiford Field Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, the airport closest to where the crew first notified Air Traffic Control in Indianapolis, Indiana, {{that they needed to}} make an emergency landing. Ouimet stated that Louisville was too close to be able to descend from cruising altitude to an emergency landing safely, and even landing in Cincinnati was a questionable proposition given Cameron's difficulties in controlling the plane. After reviewing Ouimet's missive and re-evaluating the available data, the NTSB issued a revised version of the report which included Ouimet's explanation of the landing decision, though the report was still critical of Cameron's decision not to inquire about the fire itself. [...] "All I know was that I did the best I could," [...] Cameron later said. [...] "I'm very sorry the people that didn't get off, didn't get off, because <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time and effort getting them there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Great Chase Through Time {{was cited}} by Mary E. Hocks in her journal article Feminist {{interventions}} in electronic environments {{as an example}} of a Carmen Sandiego game which [...] "included educational information in a gender-neutral way and portrayed strong, intelligent women characters" [...] such as the African-American Chief and the Hispanic Carmen Sandigo. David Colker of Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "Another plus for [...] "Where in Time" [...] is the on-screen presence of actress Lynne Thigpen, who brings a winning presence to her role as the chief of the detectives seeking Carmen". Debbie Maria Leon of the New Straits Times wrote that [...] "the urgency of the [...] voice [...] enough oomph to make [...] go scurrying to restore history". Alternatively, Providence Journal - Bulletin wrote [...] "There's a lot to learn along the way, but <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time sitting through overblown speeches from the chief especially when we would rather have gotten on with it."

2500|$|In the 1970s, Velásquez began {{focusing}} on {{national and international}} companies in addition to local growers. [...] "It {{was a big mistake}} to go after individual farmers," [...] he said, [...] "instead of {{focusing on}} the large corporations. [...] <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of years doing that, and it was a mistake." [...] From 1970 to 1983, Velasquez implemented a long-term strategy to build public support for the farmworkers, publicizing the discrimination, low wages, and often appalling working conditions they faced. In 1976, workers at a tomato cannery in Warren, Indiana, struck over the employer's tactic of overrecruiting workers in order to force down wages. The workers spontaneously barricaded themselves inside the cannery, refusing to allow the perishable crop inside until their grievances had been addressed. The workers asked FLOC to intervene. A federal district court issued an injunction requiring that the workers vacate the premises, but they refused. Although nearly all the workers were arrested, there was extensive publicity about the strike, the employer's overrcruitment tactic, the low wages and unsanitary conditions the workers suffered, {{and the use of the}} Immigration and Naturalization Service to intimidate workers and avoid paying them (through deportation proceedings). Velásquez later said the tomato cannery strike helped improve FLOC's negotiating and worker mobilization skills and provided a trial run for the union's dealings with large corporations.|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{spoke to}} Inside Soap about Alfie's reaction, {{saying that when}} he discovers {{it is one of}} the three Branning brothers, it [...] "really tips him over the edge, and Alfie becomes a monster. He finally gets some balls and decides enough is enough. He tells Kat that he doesn't care about her anymore—he says she's filthy and disgusting. Alfie has kept going with Kat for the sake of their love and their history. But if he can't forgive her for this latest indiscretion, there's no way they can keep their family together." [...] He said that he and Wallace had [...] "a vested interest" [...] to get the scenes right, [...] "because our bosses gave us such a great opportunity. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time working on it—and I hope we've ticked every box." [...] Richie called the bedsit scene [...] "fantastic" [...] and told the BBC, [...] "It's very rare you get a 15-minute scene with two people in one room". He {{explained}} that he and Wallace spent a lot of time with the episode's director, Karl Neilson, [...] "just going over stuff, finding out where the emotions were, who was the victim, who was on the offensive, who was on the defensive", where usually there are no rehearsals. Richie also revealed that the bedsit set was a [...] "tiny space" [...] that was purposely built for the episodes, which Richie said was [...] "quite claustrophobic". He called it a [...] "square room [...] nowhere to hide", with [...] "every blink of the eye, every look, every frown, every sigh" [...] being seen, adding [...] "if you're looking angry, it's there to be seen, you're naked to it". He said he [...] "loved" [...] that about filming the episode, and said, [...] "you work hard to try and be as good an actor as you can and then you're given an opportunity by the BBC and by EastEnders to step up to the mark. Lorraine [...] believing that two actors could do that—it's a bit of a pressure on your shoulders, but me and Jessie loved it." [...] Richie and Wallace filmed the episode about two months before it was broadcast.|$|E
