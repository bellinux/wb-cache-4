500|$|Music critic Robert Christgau {{wrote that}} {{although}} he had stayed away from McLachlan's music in the past, [...] "between her Lilith Fair counterpalooza and 'Building a Mystery' bonanza, [...] had to dive in, and got less than [...] bargained for." [...] He criticized McLachlan's [...] "monumental banality" [...] and summed the album up as [...] "renormalized pop at its most unnecessary." [...] A reviewer for Rolling Stone criticized the album's slow tempo, commenting that [...] "if you <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of her nirvana, {{you have to go}} along at her protracted, glacial pace."

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Piece of Me" [...] are written as a {{reaction}} to the scrutiny of Spears' private life in the media. They deal with fame and living under the spotlight. During the first verse, Spears sings the hookline [...] "You <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of me?", that is repeated throughout the song. According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times, the line [...] "could be an accusation or an invitation or a threat". [...] "Piece of Me" [...] is constructed in the common verse-chorus pattern. [...] "Piece of Me" [...] is written like a biography retelling Spears' mishaps, sung in a nearly spoken manner. Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy compared the lyrics to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] (2006). Bill Lamb of About.com said that [...] "Piece of Me" [...] makes Michael Jackson's [...] "Scream" [...] (1995) [...] "sound like a whimper." ...|$|E

500|$|Led Zeppelin {{also made}} a {{significant}} cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll, argues that [...] "on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic ethic, which casts rock as passive sensory involvement". Led Zeppelin have also been described as [...] "the quintessential purveyors" [...] of masculine and aggressive [...] "cock rock", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has commented that [...] "Led Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people <b>want</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> of that". Led Zeppelin {{laid the foundation for}} the big hair of 1980s glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe and Skid Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair, such as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman hair of Jack White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced tight jeans.|$|E
