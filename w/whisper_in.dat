25|$|In most congregations, the oleh {{does not}} himself read the Torah aloud. Rather, he stands near it while a practiced expert, called a ba'al k'ri'ah ("one {{in charge of}} reading"; {{sometimes}} ba'al ko're), reads the Torah, with cantillation, for the congregation. In some congregations the oleh follows along with the expert, reading in a <b>whisper.</b> <b>In</b> Yemenite communities, the oleh reads the portion himself, while another person, usually a young boy, recites the Targum after each verse.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{match was}} between the Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy and Randy Orton for Orton's WWE Championship. Early in the match, Hardy {{performed}} a Baseball Slide on Orton who hit head-first into the barricade outside due to the impact.

Later, Orton took advantage in the match, as he applied a Body Scissors on Hardy, followed by a choke-hold. Some of the other main highlights of the match were Hardy performing a <b>Whisper</b> <b>in</b> the Wind on Orton; and, laterexecuting a Moonsault from the top-rope to Orton outside the ring. When Hardy brought Orton back in the ring and tried to deliver a Twist of Fate, Orton suddenly reversed it into an RKO and pinned Hardy to retain his WWE title.|$|E

500|$|Following the VMAs, {{media outlets}} {{attempted}} to analyse {{the meaning of}} the dress with suggestions by BBC News ranging from anti-fashion, to feminism, aging and decay, and society's attitude towards meat. Chef Fergus Henderson explained this meat attitude as [...] "People often don't want meat to look like meat. They want it to be neatly wrapped in plastic from a supermarket." [...] People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said [...] "wearing a dress made from cuts of dead cows is offensive enough to bring comment, but someone should <b>whisper</b> <b>in</b> her ear that more people are upset by butchery than are impressed by it." [...] The Vegetarian Society also condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said [...] "No matter how beautifully it is presented, flesh from a tortured animal is flesh from a tortured animal. Enough animals die for food and they should not be killed for stunts like this." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Bother" [...] {{was directed by}} Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously collaborated with Shakira on the video for [...] "No", and was released on 15 November 2005. The video begins with a man parking his sports {{car in front of}} a house and proceeding to enter it. Shakira is seen lying on a bed {{in the house and the}} man comes up and lies beside her, indicating that they are a couple. As soon as the man falls asleep, Shakira wakes up and lies atop the man and begins to caress him and bite and <b>whisper</b> <b>in</b> his ear a few times, although he does not wake up. Shakira takes the keys of the man's car and drives it to a wrecking yard. The video then interludes to scenes of Shakira sexually romancing the man in a shower. The scene then changes back to the wrecking yard, where Shakira begins playing a pink guitar. After the spoken bridge of the song, Shakira places her partner's car in a car crusher, which soon commences demolishing it. The man reacts in a similar manner to the car being crushed and begins experiencing continuous body jerks and spasms, indicating a connection between his car and his body. After the car is fully destroyed, Shakira leaves the man unconscious on the bed, exits the house, and begins walking on the street triumphantly. Shakira explained the usage of the car symbolism in the video, saying that [...] "A man's car is like an extension of their ego and their manhood. I thought this would be a video that would make women say, 'Yeah, yeah!' and it would make men feel".|$|E

During the hiatus, Willard was recruited by Tom DeLonge for his band Angels & Airwaves and released an album, We Don't Need to <b>Whisper,</b> <b>in</b> 2006.|$|E

However, Charlotte's letter to William Smith Williams where she mentions Emily's dog, Keeper, lying at the side of her dying-bed, makes this statement seem unlikely.|$|E
