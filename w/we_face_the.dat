Shaughnessy explained his Chicago defensive scheme in November 1961:"We can adjust to fit three things. We have defenses to fit the [...] <b>we</b> <b>face,</b> <b>the</b> personnel we face and {{the situation in the}} game. Bill George calls the basic overall defense.

"But," [...] David Clowney writes, [...] "freedom is frightening, and it {{is easier}} to run from it into the safety of roles and realities that are defined by society, or even by your own past. To be free is to be thrown into {{existence}} with no [...] "human nature" [...] as an essence to define you, and no definition of the reality into which you are thrown, either. To accept this freedom is to live [...] "authentically"; but most of us run from authenticity.

All of Roquentin's experiences are related to these themes from Sartre's philosophy." ...|$|E

[...] Martin Gottfried wrote: [...] "The concept behind 'Follies' is theater nostalgia, representing the rose-colored glasses through which <b>we</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> fact of age ... the show is conceived in ghostliness. At its very start, ghosts of Follies showgirls stalk the stage, mythic giants in winged, feathered, black and white opulence.

And painful, dreadful, indeed, as they must be, I am driven to feel that you can only reach true peace by facing them in a spirit of brave humility.

60|$|There is no {{necessity}} to-night {{to plunge}} {{into a discussion}} of the philosophical divergencies between Socialism and Liberalism. It is not possible to draw a hard-and-fast line between individualism and collectivism. You cannot draw it either in theory or in practice. That is where the Socialist makes a mistake. Let us not imitate that mistake. No man can be a collectivist alone or an individualist alone. He must be both an individualist and a collectivist. The nature of man is a dual nature. The character of the organisation of human society is dual. Man is at once a unique being and a gregarious animal. For some purposes he must be collectivist, for others he is, and he will for all time remain, an individualist. Collectively we have an Army and a Navy and a Civil Service; collectively we have a Post Office, and a police, and a Government; collectively we light our streets and supply ourselves with water; collectively we indulge increasingly in all the necessities of communication. But we do not make love collectively, and the ladies do not marry us collectively, and we do not eat collectively, and we do not die collectively, and it is not collectively that <b>we</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> sorrows and the hopes, the winnings and the losings of this world of accident and storm.|$|E

6000|$|But the {{difference}} lies precisely in this&mdash;that the Christ of Mr. Kennedy's play insists on really knowing all the souls that he loves; he declines to conquer {{by a kind}} of supernatural stupidity. He pardons evil, but he will not ignore it. In other words, he is a Christian, and not a Christian Scientist. The distinction doubtless is partly explained by the problems severally selected. Mr. Jerome practically supposes Christ to be trying to save disreputable people; and that, of course, is naturally a simple business. Mr. Kennedy supposes Him to be trying to save the reputable people, which is a much larger affair. The chief characters in The Servant in the House are a popular and strenuous vicar, universally respected, and his fashionable and forcible wife. It would have been no good to tell these people they had some good in them&mdash;for that was what they were telling themselves all day long. They had to be reminded that they had some bad in them&mdash;instinctive idolatries and silent treasons which they always tried to forget. It is in connection with these crimes of wealth and culture that <b>we</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> real problem of positive evil. The whole of Mr. Blatchford's controversy about sin was vitiated throughout by one's consciousness that whenever he wrote the word [...] "sinner" [...] he thought of a man in rags. But here, again, we can find truth merely by referring to vulgar literature&mdash;its unfailing fountain. Whoever read a detective story about poor people? The poor have crimes; but the poor have no secrets. And it is because the proud have secrets {{that they need to be}} detected before they are forgiven.|$|E
