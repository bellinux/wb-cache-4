5|$|Ms. Hartman and Jackie {{are taken}} by the Cybermen for conversion, but the Cyber Leader orders the Doctor held aside because he has {{valuable}} information about the Daleks. The Cyber Leader is destroyed by a strike team led by Jake Simmonds, who have travelled from their universe {{in pursuit of the}} Cybermen. Ms. Hartman is converted, but Jackie escapes into a stairwell. Jake uses a device around his neck to take the Doctor to the parallel universe and their version of Torchwood. The Doctor meets with the alternate universe Pete Tyler, who tells him that after he left the Cybermen were sealed in their factories while humanity decided <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> In the meantime, the Cybermen vanished and the breach began causing unprecedented global warming on the parallel Earth, which the Doctor theorises is the start of the process that will lead to both planets falling into the Void. Pete demands the Doctor seal the breach before his Earth is destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Peter {{gathered}} his army at Cologne on 12 April 1096, planning to stop there and preach to the Germans and gather more crusaders. The French, however, were {{not willing to}} wait for Peter and the Germans and {{under the leadership of}} Walter Sans Avoir, a few thousand French crusaders left before Peter and reached Hungary on 8 May, passing through Hungary without incident and arriving at the river Sava at the border of Byzantine territory at Belgrade. The Belgrade commander was taken by surprise, having no orders on <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> and refused entry, forcing the crusaders to pillage the countryside for food. This resulted in skirmishes with the Belgrade garrison and, to make matters worse, sixteen of Walter's men had tried to rob a market in Zemun across the river in Hungary and were stripped of their armor and clothing, which was hung from the castle walls. Eventually the crusaders were allowed to carry on to Niš, where they were provided with food and waited to hear from Constantinople.|$|E

500|$|... "Training Day" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. IGN writer Cindy White wrote that Deangelo {{was not given}} a proper introduction {{and that he was}} not distinguished from Michael's character. She also went on to criticize Jim, Pam and Dwight's reaction to Deangelo as the new manager, particular that of Jim and Pam, writing that [...] "it's becoming painfully obvious that the longtime writers don't know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> anymore". However, she concluded that the episode continued the seventh season's improvement over the sixth, and that it showed potential for future episodes of the season. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating, denoting a [...] "good" [...] episode. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt praised Michael's reactions to the office easily ignoring him for Deangelo, calling the final shot of him walking into his office alone [...] "quite effective", and that Dwight's reaction to not being suggested to be Michael's replacement made it more [...] "meaningful". Despite this, he continued by saying that the series was not [...] "sophisticated" [...] enough to use this plotline effectively and criticized the writing for the cast, which made them look [...] "stupid" [...] for [...] "cheap humor" [...] and a [...] "enormously shallow laughter". He ultimately gave the episode a [...] "C+". Alan Sepinwall, a columnist for HitFix, complimented the chemistry between Ferrell and Carell, but criticized the storyline which eventually came down to Michael [...] "being petulant about not being the center of attention every minute of every day", negatively comparing it to [...] "Viewing Party". Despite this, he noted that Ferrell's presence did involve several funny moments.|$|E

Executive secretary of the National Parks Association and wilderness advocate Robert Sterling Yard was among several skeptics who doubted that business endeavors in Florida and a protected area could coexist. Establishment of the park initiated the first U.S. government contact with the Seminoles outside military action in the Seminole wars when the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Secretary of the Interior were charged with deciding <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Coe pushed for including considerations for Seminole lands within the structure of the park, although beyond roles as tour guides and park vendors, he thought the Seminoles should be restricted from using the park.

2500|$|Throughout her career, Vélez's onscreen {{persona of}} a hot tempered, lusty [...] "wild" [...] woman was closely tied to her off screen personality.

2500|$|The initial discovery, by Bedouin {{shepherd}} Muhammed edh-Dhib, {{his cousin}} Jum'a Muhammed, and Khalil Musa, {{took place between}} November 1946 and February 1947. The shepherds discovered seven scrolls (See Scrolls and fragments) housed in jars in a cave near what {{is now known as}} the Qumran site. John C. Trever reconstructed the story of the scrolls from several interviews with the Bedouin. Edh-Dhib's cousin noticed the caves, but edh-Dhib himself was the first to actually fall into one. He retrieved a handful of scrolls, which Trever identifies as the Isaiah Scroll, Habakkuk Commentary, and the Community Rule, and took them back to the camp to show to his family. None of the scrolls were destroyed in this process, despite popular rumor. The Bedouin kept the scrolls hanging on a tent pole while they figured out <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> periodically taking them out to show it to their people. At some point during this time, the Community Rule was split in two. The Bedouin first took the scrolls to a dealer named Ibrahim 'Ijha in Bethlehem. 'Ijha returned them, saying they were worthless, after being warned that they might have been stolen from a synagogue. Undaunted, the Bedouin went to a nearby market, where a Syrian Christian offered to buy them. A sheikh joined their conversation and suggested they take the scrolls to Khalil Eskander Shahin, [...] "Kando", a cobbler and part-time antiques dealer. The Bedouin and the dealers returned to the site, leaving one scroll with Kando and selling three others to a dealer for 7 GBP (equivalent to US$37, in 2014). The original scrolls continued to change hands after the Bedouin left them in the possession of a third party until a sale could be arranged. (See Ownership.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{difficulty}} is {{in where the}} manuscripts are coming from. Often, especially in monasteries, a manuscript cache {{is little more than}} a former manuscript recycling center where imperfect and incomplete copies of manuscripts were stored while the monastery or scriptorium decided <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> There were several options. The first was to simply [...] "wash" [...] the manuscript and reuse it. This was very common in the ancient world and even up into the Middle Ages; such reused manuscripts are called palimpsests. The most famous palimpsest is probably the Archimedes Palimpsest. If this was not done within a short period of time after the papyri was made, then washing it was less likely since the papyri might deteriorate and thus be unusable. When washing was no longer an option, the second choice was burning: since they contained the words of Christ, they were thought to have had a level of sanctity, and burning them was considered more reverent than simply throwing them into a garbage pit (although that was not unheard of as in the case of Oxyrhynchus 840). The third option was simply to leave them in what has become known as a manuscript gravesite. When scholars come across manuscript caches, for example that at Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai (source of the Codex Sinaiticus), or Saint Sabbas Monastery outside Bethlehem, they are not finding libraries, but storehouses of rejected texts (sometimes kept in boxes or back shelves in libraries due to space constraints). These texts were unacceptable because of their scribal errors and contain corrections inside the lines possibly evidence that monastery scribes were comparing them to what must have been a master text. In addition, texts thought to be complete and correct but which had deteriorated due to heavy usage or had missing [...] would also be placed in these caches. Once in a cache, insects and humidity would often contribute to the continued deterioration of the documents.|$|E
