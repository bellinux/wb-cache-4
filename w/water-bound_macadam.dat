25|$|The civic {{infrastructure}} grew {{to accommodate}} the increasing population. A Water District was established in 1912 and a town-wide Fire Department was established in 1913. Acton was the first town {{in the area to}} have <b>water-bound</b> <b>macadam</b> highways.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} motor bus tyres (which {{at that time}} were solid rubber) on the road surface was an early issue. Reimbursement for {{repairing}} {{the damage to the}} roads in Holyrood Park by the tour charabancs was laid down as a condition of operating there in the 1921 season. In 1921 the city deputy surveyor found that no undue damage was being done by buses on tarmacked roads, with some not damaged at all, but <b>water-bound</b> <b>macadam</b> surfaces and sett paving without concrete underlay were vulnerable to rutting and other issues. On one hilly route, after residents complained of vibration caused by the buses, various remedies were deployed - limiting the speed to 8mph, descent in gear, and the fitting of super-cushion tyres (Dunlop and North British). The 8mph limit was also necessary in granite paved sections of running, which were extensive in Edinburgh.|$|E

5000|$|McAdam's road {{building}} technology {{was applied to}} roads by other engineers. One of these engineers was Richard Edgeworth, who filled the gaps between the surface stones {{with a mixture of}} stone dust and water, providing a smoother surface for the increased traffic using the roads. This basic method of construction is sometimes known as <b>water-bound</b> <b>macadam.</b> Although this method required a great deal of manual labour, it resulted in a strong and free-draining pavement. Roads constructed in this manner were described as [...] "macadamized." ...|$|E

The road runs towards south up to Solapur and then south-eastwards up to Dudhani. The road passes through Barshi, Solapur North, Solapur South and Akkalkot talukas. The road-surface up to Solapur is black-topped and is motorable throughout the year except for some interruptions during heavy rains. The {{entire length of the}} road up to Akkalkot is black-topped beyond which it is <b>water-bound</b> <b>macadam.</b> The road is motorable throughout the year except some obstructions at Bori river near Umarge village during the monsoon.|$|E

5000|$|Acton had {{excellent}} roads due to {{a contribution}} from a former Acton resident - Alvin Nothrop. He {{had grown up in}} Acton before moving to Washington D.C., where he became a successful merchant. He donated money to the town of Acton to purchase a stone crusher for improving local roads. Because of this contribution, Acton had <b>water-bound</b> <b>macadam</b> highways long before its neighbors. [...] With the advent of the Automobile, the railroads serving East and North Acton fell into decline. The Nashua and Acton line was completely abandoned in the mid-1920s while passenger service ceased on the Framingham and Lowell line in the 1930s with the last vestiges of service on the line occurring to North Acton lumberyards in the early 1990s. This line too, has been formally abandoned. The Framingham and Lowell line {{is in the process of}} being converted into a rail trail, with the Acton portion scheduled for 2015.|$|E
