25|$|Vasari {{says that}} Raphael {{eventually}} had a workshop of fifty pupils and assistants, {{many of whom}} later became significant artists in their own right. This was arguably the largest workshop team assembled under any single old master painter, and {{much higher than the}} norm. They included established masters from other parts of Italy, probably working with their own teams as sub-contractors, as well as pupils and journeymen. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> little evidence of the internal working arrangements of the workshop, apart from the works of art themselves, which are often very difficult to assign to a particular hand.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{producer}} Daniel Melnick, whose Altered States was moved up a month into the 1980 Christmas season by the studio over his objections, complained {{about this in}} an interview.

2500|$|Interfax, quoting Ingush Deputy Prime Minister Bashir Aushev, {{reported}} that the explosion {{was a result of}} a truck bomb detonated next to the convoy by Russian agents. According to a Russian edition of Newsweek, Basayev's death was a result of an FSB operation, whose primary aim was to prevent a planned terrorist attack {{in the days before the}} G8 summit in St Petersburg. [...] The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, said: [...] "He is a notorious terrorist, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> clearly and publicly announced what is going to happen to notorious terrorists who commit heinous crimes of the type Mr. Basayev has been involved in." [...] In February 2014, a Turkish court convicted a Chechen national Ruslan Papaskiri aka Temur Makhauri with the killings of several Chechen separatists on Turkish soil. The pro-Chechen separatist Imkander organization held a press conference claiming that Turkish investigators believed that Makhauri had prepared the explosives laden truck that killed Basayev.|$|E

[...] As Clinton saw it, [...] "turning over a lot of that material—intentionally or unintentionally—drained, gave all kinds of information, not only to big countries, but to networks and terrorist groups and the like. So I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia, under Putin's authority." [...] Clinton later said that if Snowden wished to return to the U.S., [...] "knowing he would be held accountable," [...] he would have the right [...] "to launch both a legal defense and a public defense, which can of course affect the legal defense." ...|$|E

2500|$|The series uses green {{screen to}} augment the live action, {{inserting}} views of outdoor scenes in windows and broadcast images on TV monitors, often in post-production. The Production Designer, Steve Arnold, also describes in detail {{the use of a}} three-sided green screen to insert street scenes outside car windows, with synchronized LED screens above the car (and out of camera shot), that emit the appropriate light onto the actors and parts of the car, such as window frames: [...] "All the driving in the show, anything inside the vehicle is done on stage, in a room that is a big three-sided green screen space. The car does not move, the actors are in the car, and the cameras are set up around them. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>very</b> long strips of LED monitors hung above the car. We had a camera crew go to Washington, D.C. to drive around and shoot plates for what you see outside when you’re driving. And that is fed into the LED screens above the car. So as the scene is progressing, the LED screens are synched up to emit interactive light to match the light conditions you see in the scenery you’re driving past (that will be added in post). All the reflections on the car windows, the window frames and door jambs is being shot while we’re shooting the actors in the car. Then in post the green screens are replaced with the synced up driving plates, and it works really well. It gives you the sense of light passing over the actors’ faces, matching the lighting that is {{in the image of the}} plate".|$|E

On 20 September 2017, it was officially confirmed that Kat & Alfie: Redwater would not return for a second series, with a BBC spokesperson saying, [...] "In order to increase the range of new original drama on BBC One, Kat & Alfie: Redwater won't be returning." ...|$|E
