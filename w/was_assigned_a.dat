5|$|At {{some point}} in 1777, Kościuszko {{composed}} a polonaise and scored it for the harpsichord. Named for him, and with lyrics by Rajnold Suchodolski, it later became popular with Polish patriots during the November 1830 Uprising. Around that time, Kościuszko <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> black orderly, Agrippa Hull, whom he would treat as an equal and a friend.|$|E
5|$|The Racz {{procedure}} {{employs a}} wire-bound or spring loaded catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibroids, that have formed around the nerve roots, {{and allows for}} local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area. This procedure <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code in 2000.|$|E
5|$|After the {{experience}} of World War II, Belgium abandoned its neutral stance in international politics, in favour of military, political and economic integration. In 1949, Belgium joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deployed troops to fight alongside other United Nations forces in the Korean War in 1950. Belgium was also {{a key player in}} the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s. Belgium <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> sector of the British zone in West Germany, around the city of Cologne, which it occupied from 1945. Belgian soldiers remained in Germany until their final withdrawal in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|As with {{at least}} 4% of Méliès's output (including major films such as The Kingdom of the Fairies, The Impossible Voyage, and The Barber of Seville), some prints of A Trip to the Moon were {{individually}} hand-colored by Elisabeth Thuillier's coloring lab in Paris. Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and celluloid products, directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified. Each worker <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> different color in assembly line style, with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film. On average, Thuillier's lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies of a film.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} centuries, rolls of arms {{included}} invented arms for kings of foreign lands (Neubecker, 30). Around 1310, Jacques de Longuyon wrote the Voeux de Paon ("Vows of the Peacock"), {{which included a}} list of nine famous leaders. This list, divided into three groups of three, became known in art and literature as the Nine Worthies (Loomis 1938, 37). Each of the Nine Worthies were given a coat of arms. King David, for instance, <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> gold harp as a device (Neubecker, 172).|$|E

5|$|In July 2004, Hamdan {{was charged}} with {{conspiracy}} to commit terrorism, and the Bush administration made arrangements to try him before a military commission, established by the Department of Defense under Military Commission Order No. 1 of March 21, 2002. He <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> defense counsel, LCDR Charles D. Swift from the Navy JAG, who with a legal team filed a petition for Hamdan in US District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging {{the constitutionality of the}} military commission, and saying that it lacked the protections required under the Geneva Conventions and United States Uniform Code of Military Justice.|$|E
5|$|In June, major combat {{operations}} {{on the island}} ceased and the Australians began the mopping up phase of the campaign as the Australians sought to clear isolated pockets of Japanese troops that had evaded capture. These operations continued into July. During this time, the 2/48th <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> sector near the Pamusian River on the eastern coast, as well as Tarakan town and {{the centre of the}} island. The battalion's involvement in the Borneo campaign resulted in 174 casualties, including 37 killed and nine died of wounds or from accident.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{call to arms}} issued in 1861, Indiana <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> quota of 7,500 men—a tenth of the amount called—to join the Union Army in putting down the rebellion. So many volunteered in the first call that {{thousands}} had to be turned away. Before the war ended, Indiana contributed 208,367men to fight and serve in the war. Casualties were over 35% among these men: 24,416 {{lost their lives in}} the conflict and over 50,000 more were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Inexperienced as a manager, Barrow had player Harry Hooper {{advise him}} on {{baseball}} game strategy. Hooper urged his manager to allow Ruth to play another position {{when he was}} not pitching, arguing to Barrow, who had invested in the club, that the crowds were larger on days when Ruth played, as they were attracted by his hitting. Barrow gave in early in May; Ruth promptly hit home runs in four consecutive games (one an exhibition), the last off of Walter Johnson. For {{the first time in his}} career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), Ruth <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> place in the batting order higher than ninth.|$|E
5|$|Mennonite Central Committee, American Friends Service Committee and Brethren Service Committee {{administered}} {{almost all}} of the camps. The Association of Catholic Conscientious Objectors managed four camps and the Methodist World Peace Commission two. Each camp <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> director responsible for supervising camp operation. The director managed the needs of the men, oversaw maintenance of the camp facilities, handled community relations and reported to Selective Service officials. Initially a pastor had the camp director role. Later, capable men from among the CPS workers directed the camps.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 2012, Warren {{defeated}} incumbent Scott Brown with a {{total of}} 53.7% of the votes. She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts, as part of a sitting U.S. Senate that had 20 female senators in office, the largest female U.S. Senate delegation in history, following the November 2012 elections. In December 2012, Warren <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> seat on the Senate Banking Committee, the committee that oversees the implementation of Dodd–Frank and other regulation of the banking industry. Warren was sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden on January 3, 2013.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on the shelves {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E
5|$|St. Gatien {{returned}} to Newmarket on October 12 {{to attempt to}} win a second Cesarewitch. On this occasion, he <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> weight of 131 pounds, twenty-three pounds {{more than any of}} the seventeen other runners. He made little show in the race and finished unplaced behind Stone Clink. Two days later, St. Gatien was given a chance to redeem his reputation when he met Stone Clink again in Her Majesty's Plate over two miles. This race was at level weights and St. Gatien had no difficulty justifying his position as 4/9 favourite, taking the lead a furlong from the finish and winning very easily by three lengths.|$|E
5|$|The IX Corps {{headquarters}} {{was first}} constituted on 29 July 1921 in the organized reserves, a new corps formation intended to compliment the existing corps commands {{in the active}} duty component of the force by providing command to reserve units. It <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> shoulder sleeve insignia shortly thereafter. Though the corps was not activated, it remained on the organizational rolls of the Army, to be called on when needed. On 1 October 1933, the corps {{was moved to the}} active duty roster, though it remained deactivated.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this data {{collection}} is to gather student information to populate the Student Test Number (STN) Lookup System. The STN Lookup is a tool provided for schools {{to determine whether or}} not <b>a</b> student has <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> STN. <b>A</b> STN should <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> to <b>a</b> student once and should remain with the student throughout their educational experience. The majority of students educated in Indiana should have already <b>been</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> STN and should appear in the STN Lookup in the Application Center...|$|R
5|$|The {{off-season}} the Phillies promoted {{assistant general}} manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. to general manager, succeeding Pat Gillick who retired {{at the end of}} a three-year contract. Their most notable offseason player change was in left field, as Pat Burrell departed due to free agency and was replaced by free agent Raúl Ibañez. Another notable acquisition was free agent pitcher Chan Ho Park. Park was originally signed as a backup option for the bullpen, as reliever J. C. Romero <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> 50-game suspension after violating the Major League Baseball drug policy, but Park won the fifth starter's job in Spring Training.|$|E
5|$|After Andrianampoinimerina reunited {{the divided}} and warring Kingdom of Imerina, he {{successfully}} pursued an expansionist policy that saw his authority extended {{over a large}} portion of Madagascar by {{the time of his death}} in 1810. Having captured Antananarivo by 1793 and transferred his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo the following year, Andrianampoinimerina established new structures on the Rova grounds that would become imbued with the political and historic significance of his reign. In keeping with the tradition of Merina sovereigns before him, each building <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> name by which it could be distinguished. Several of the buildings were used interchangeably by the king as personal residences, including Manjakamiadana ("Where It is Pleasant to Rule"), Besakana, Manatsaralehibe ("Vast Improvement", also called Manatsara)—which he alone was authorised to enter—and Marivolanitra ("Beneath the Heavens"), a building reportedly designed with a staircase leading to a rooftop observation deck from which the king could observe the town and plains below.|$|E
5|$|By June 15, 1942 the {{highways}} in the Grand Rapids area were reconfigured. A Bypass US16 (BYP US16) designation {{was assigned to}} the portion of M-114 that traveled around the southwest side of Grand Rapids (now M-11), leaving just the east and unfinished north segments left. The section along {{the east side of the}} city was completed as M-114. A northern leg was added along 3 Mile Road at the same time. By 1945, the northern leg of M-114 was turned back to local control and removed from the highway system. The eastern leg <b>was</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>a</b> BYP US131 designation, thereby eliminating the last remaining portion of M-114. A BYP M-21 designation was also used along part of the southern and eastern legs. East Beltline now carries M-37 and M-44.|$|E
