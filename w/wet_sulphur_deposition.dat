40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} determining reductions of SO 2 emissions from coal- and oil-fired power stations, oil refineries and large industrial units in the UK taking into account their pollution potential. The method {{is based on the}} use of two gridded data sets: critical loads, which represent the sensitivity of the environment to acid deposition and modelled estimates of total (<b>wet</b> + dry) <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> for 646 point sources within the UK. An iterative method is used to identify and subsequently reduce emissions from point sources that contribute most to areas of critical loads exceedance. This paper demonstrates how the method may be used to determine an optimal allocation of emissions across the UK which yields the maximum amount of environmental protection per unit of emission. The paper then goes on to consider the changes that will have to take place within the UK power generation industry {{in order to meet the}} revised EC Large Combustion Plant Directive which comes into force on 1 January 2008. Particular emphasis is placed upon proposed emissions trading schemes and the environmental implications of allowing trading between stations with high and low pollution potentials. The paper concludes by suggesting that the emissions trading process should take into account the pollution potential of each source, irrespective of whether the proposed emission is within the plantâ��s agreed emission limit. An approach based entirely on minimizing environmental damage rather than one which takes cost into account, as in current integrated assessment modelling, could provide an interesting approach across the rest of Europe...|$|R
40|$|Elemental sulphur {{which is}} {{originally}} soluble in gas {{phase in the}} reservoir should precipitate from the gas phase after exceeding saturation state and deposit at pore spaces and throat sequentially resulting in porosity and permeability loss. Over several decades, modelling elemental <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> around the wellbore are mainly focused on the gas reservoir and were based on Darcy flow. Few {{recent studies have shown}} models that capable for predicting elemental <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> considered non-Darcy flow, variations in gas properties with pressure change as well as permeability reduction caused by compaction. It therefore follows that if compaction causes a reduction in the permeability of the reservoir as well as reduction in its porosity, then porosity damage function induced by compaction becomes a crucial factor needed to be incorporated into the existing models to adequately predict sulphur saturation. This study is concerned with developing an accurate model for predicting elemental sulphur saturation in the fractured reservoir by exploring the functional relationship between compaction and elemental <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> over time. The result obtained from newly improved model is at variance with that obtained from Guo et al. model. This variance may not be unconnected {{with the fact that the}} rate of <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> seemed to have been underestimated by Guo et al. model. The refined model is more accurate and practical in predicting <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> in fractured sour gas reservoir as it leads to a faster rate of sulphur depositio...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic eruptions affect peatlands {{around the}} world, {{depositing}} volcanic ash (tephra) {{and a variety}} of chemicals including compounds of sulphur. These volcanic impacts may be important for many reasons, in particular <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> has been shown to suppress peatland methane flux, potentially reinforcing climatic cooling. Experiments have shown that <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> also forces changes in testate amoeba communities, potentially relating to the reduced methane flux. Large volcanic eruptions in regions with extensive peatlands are relatively rare so it is difficult to assess the extent to which volcanic eruptions affect peatland microbial communities; palaeoecological analyses across tephra layers provide a means to resolve this uncertainty. In this study, testate amoebae were analysed across multiple monoliths from a peatland in southern Alaska containing two tephras, probably representing the 1883 eruption of Augustine Volcano and a 20 th Century eruption of Redoubt Volcano. Results showed relatively distinct and often statistically significant changes in testate amoeba community coincident with tephra layers which largely matched the response found in experimental studies of <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition.</b> The results suggest volcanic impacts on peatland microbial communities which might relate to changes in methane flux...|$|R

The model was run using emissions for the year 2002. The model was compared with measurements of gas concentrations (SO 2, NOx, HNO 3 and NH 3) and of wet deposition and aerosol concentrations of SO 42 −, NO 3 − and NH 4 + from national monitoring networks. Good correlation was obtained, demonstrating that the model is capable of accurately estimating the mass balance and spatial distribution of sulphur and nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere. A future emissions scenario for the year 2020 {{was used to test}} the influence of shipping emissions on <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> in the UK. The results show that, if shipping emissions are assumed to increase at a rate of 2. 5 % per year, their relative contribution to <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> is expected to increase from 9 % to 28 % between 2002 and 2020. The model was compared to both a European scale and a global scale chemical transport model and found to give broad agreement with the magnitude and location of <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> associated with shipping emissions.

Our aim was to quantify the balance between microbial consumption and chemical precipitation of DOC due to episodic acidification driven by sulphur redox reactions by comparing changes in soil water chemistry to microbial activity (i. e. soil respiration and trace gas fluxes).

Nitrogen inputs increased below ground colonisation compared to acidified nitrogen and sulphur, largely due {{to an increase in}} Tylospora fibrillosa colonisation. Sporocarp production and ectomycorrhizal root colonisation by Lactarius rufus were reduced in the nitrogen treated plots. These observations suggest that nitrogen deposition to a young plantation may suppress ectomycorrhizal fungi producing large sporocarps. It is proposed that enhanced nitrogen deposition increases ectomycorrhizal nitrogen assimilation, consuming more carbon and leaving less for extrametrical mycelium and sporocarp development. ...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{deposition}} of air pollutants {{has been a}} severe threat to terrestrial and forest ecosystems for several decades. In Sweden <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> has caused acidification of soils and runoff, while nitrogen deposition only had a minor or local impact on runoff quality so far.

Long term changes in runoff acidity and nitrogen chemistry after these changes in deposition are of great concern. Monitoring of small, well-defined catchments including hydrochemistry of precipitation, soil and runoff, is a valuable tool for addressing this concern. When interpreting runoff data from such sites, the near-stream zone has been identified to be of crucial importance.

40|$|Soil water {{chemistry}} in forest soils over 20 years was studied at nine sites in southern Sweden. The {{aim was to}} investigate the recovery from acidification and the influence of strong sea salt episodes that occur in the region. All sites but one showed signs of recovery from acidification along with the reduced <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition,</b> but the recovery progress was slow and the soil water was in most cases still highly acidic {{at the end of the}} period. In several cases the recovery was delayed by episodes of sea salt deposition, leading to transient acidification. The less marked decrease of sulphur concentrations in soil water than of <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition,</b> highlighted the importance of sulphur adsorption/desorption in the acidification and recovery process. Nitrogen retention capacity was exceeded on one site, leading to nitrate leaching and extremely low pH. Storm fellings on two sites in the end of the period led to effects similar to those of regeneration fellings. It was concluded that the soils in the region are in an early stage of recovery.

Using time series of flux observations from 23 forests distributed throughout Europe and the USA, and generalised mixed models, we found that forest-level net ecosystem production and gross primary production have increased by 1 % annually from 1995 to 2011. Statistical models indicated that increasing atmospheric CO 2 {{was the most important}} factor driving the increasing strength of carbon sinks in these forests. We also found that the reduction of <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> in Europe and the USA lead to higher recovery in ecosystem respiration than in gross primary production, thus limiting the increase of carbon sequestration.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} chemistry and deposition {{model has been}} applied for calculation of nitrogen and <b>sulphur</b> <b>depositions</b> to the entire North Sea area for the year 1999. The total atmospheric nitrogen and <b>sulphur</b> <b>depositions</b> to the North Sea area were determined to 709 kton (kt) N and 551 kt S, respectively. Since the North Sea area was calculated to be 747, 988 km 2, this is equivalent to an average deposition of 0. 9 ton N km- 2 and 0. 7 ton S km- 2, respectively. The depositions decrease strongly from the south end (about 2 - 3 kt N km- 2) to the north end (about 0. 2 kt N km- 2) of the North Sea, due to increasing distance to the large source areas {{in the northern part}} of the European continent. The territorial waters of Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany receive about 50 % higher deposition densities than the average value for the entire North Sea area. For the remaining territorial waters of the North Sea the depositions follow more or less the fraction of the area.

40|$|High-elevation lakes are {{sensitive}} to acidification from atmospheric deposition owing to their generally small catchment areas, thin soils and low bedrock weathering rates. The Georgia Basin, southwest British Columbia, Canada, receives atmospheric inputs from emissions originating in Vancouver, Victoria, and from marine traffic in the Strait of Georgia. There is growing concern {{on the influence of}} this air pollution on high-elevation systems in the region. Water chemistry and catchment characteristics were used to assess the sensitivity of 72 lakes in the Georgia Basin to acidic deposition. Twenty percent of the study lakes had pH levels less than 6, and acid neutralising capacity (ANC) concentrations below 20 μeq L– 1, which are key thresholds for biological sustainability. Base cation and trace metal concentrations were low, typical of the dilute nature of high-elevation lakes (median conductivity = 7. 0 μS cm– 1). Nonetheless, concentrations of trace metals (such as lead) decreased with distance from major cities. The primary factors influencing the pH and ANC of surface waters were investigated using multiple linear regression; both ANC and pH were related to longitude and the proportion of the catchment dominated by ice and glaciers. Increasing <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> resulted in decreasing pH. The median critical load of acidity (sulphur) for the study lakes was approximately 70 meq m– 2 y– 1; 18 % of the lakes received <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> (range: 6 - 81 meq m– 2 y– 1 for the period 2005 - 2006) in excess of their critical load...|$|R

Critical chemical limits as well as soil stability criteria were derived {{for each of these}} vegetation types, which include both natural and managed ecosystems. Results show that low critical loads in Asia occur in BanglaDesh, Indo-China, Indonesia and the southern part of China Uncertainties of the results are mainly due to uncertainties in base cation deposition. The critical loads are part of the impact module of the Asian version of the Regional Air pollution INformation and Simulation model (RAINS-Asia), a model used to assess abatement strategies for sulfur emissions which are rapidly increasing {{in this part of the}} world. The difference in the level of detail between European and Asian critical load maps enables different applications.

40|$|International audienceSulphate {{deposition}} {{has decreased}} by about 60 % in the Nordic countries {{since the early}} 1980 s. Nitrogen deposition has been roughly constant during the past 20 years, with only a minor decrease in the late 1990 s. The resulting changes in the chemistry of small lakes have been followed by national monitoring programmes initiated in the 1980 s in Finland (163 lakes), Norway (100 lakes) and Sweden (81 lakes). These lakes are partly a subset from the survey of 5690 lakes in the Northern European lake survey of 1995. Trend analyses on data for the period 1990 - 1999 show that the non-marine sulphate concentrations in lakes have decreased significantly in 69 % of the monitored lakes. Changes were largest in lakes with the highest mean concentrations. Nitrate concentrations, on the other hand, were generally low and showed no systematic changes. Concentrations of non-marine base cations decreased in 26 % of the lakes, most probably an ionic-strength effect due to the lower concentrations of mobile strong-acid anions. Acid neutralising capacity increased in 32 % of the lakes. Trends in recovery were in part masked by large year-to-year variations in sea-salt inputs and by increases in total organic carbon concentrations. These changes were most probably the result of climatic variations. Nordic lakes, therefore, show clear signs of recovery from acidification. Recovery began in the 1980 s and accelerated in the 1990 s. Reductions in <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> are the major "driving force" {{in the process of}} recovery from acidification.

Similar DOC increases have been observed in surface waters across much of Europe and North America. Much of {{the debate about the}} causes of rising DOC has, as in other studies relating to the carbon cycle, focused on factors related to climate change. Data from our peat-core experiments support an influence of climate on DOC, notably an increase in production with temperature under aerobic, {{and to a lesser extent}} anaerobic, conditions. However, we argue that climatic factors may not be the dominant drivers of DOC change. DOC solubility is suppressed by high soil water acidity and ionic strength, both of which have decreased as a result of declining <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> since the 1980 s, augmented during the 1990 s in the United Kingdom by a cyclical decline in sea-salt deposition. Our observational and experimental data demonstrate a clear, inverse and quantitatively important link between DOC and sulphate concentrations in soil solution. Statistical analysis of 11 AWMN lakes suggests that rising temperature, declining <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> and changing sea-salt loading can account for the majority of the observed DOC trend. This combination of evidence points to the changing chemical composition of atmospheric deposition, particularly the substantial reduction in anthropogenic sulphur emissions during the last 20 years, as a key cause of rising DOC. The implications of rising DOC export for the carbon cycle will be very different if linked primarily to decreasing acid deposition, rather than to changes in climate, suggesting that these systems may be recovering rather than destabilising...|$|R

However, biological recovery appears to be much slower than chemical recovery. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze temporal changes of invertebrate communities in acidified rivers and lakes, and disentangle the environmental causes of the observed changes. The analysis was performed using long-term data from rivers (25 - 30 years) and lakes (~ 15 years) in three catchments along the west coast of Southern Norway, which represent a gradient of non-marine <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition.</b> We performed statistical analysis using both biological indices and ordination methods. First, our results show that invertebrate communities in rivers shifted from a state with low or absence of acid-sensitive taxa to an alternate state with higher richness and abundance of acid-sensitive taxa. These biological shifts coincided with previously defined chemical thresholds. Second, there was no invertebrate community change recorded in the lakes, even though chemical recovery was comparable to the rivers. This finding may relate to limited variation in habitat and refuges, which may make them less susceptible to re-colonisation of acid-sensitive taxa, or it may relate to the taxonomic resolution. Third, our result indicate that the recovery of invertebrate communities in rivers is primarily related to reduced <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition,</b> and associated water chemistry. Superimposed on the long-term trends, temperature fluctuations and sea-salt episodes have caused short-term variability in the invertebrate community. We did not identify impacts of temperature rise on the long-term invertebrate community trends.

A formal response outlining this monitoring programme was submitted to, and accepted by, the Environment Agency in March 2008. The NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology were awarded a four year contract to implement the monitoring in 2011. The monitoring programme is based on protocols for ecological and deposition monitoring at Natura 2000 sites approved by the Environment Agency in September 2010. Following discussions between the installation operators, the Environment Agency, Natural England and Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), seven Natura 2000 sites were selected for inclusion in the monitoring programme, including at least one site relevant to each of the 13 participating installations. As <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> remains the dominant issue associated with power station and refinery emissions, sites were {{selected on the basis of}} the installation’s modelled percentage contribution to the minimum site-relevant critical load for sulphur (CLmaxS), plus the percentage contribution to total <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> and total acid deposition, while the absolute level of <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> arising from the installation was also taken into account. Monitoring focuses on three components relating to the conservation objectives of the selected sites: 1. Prevailing levels of acidifying deposition and any changes in acidification deposition over the period of monitoring. 2. Prevailing levels of eutrophying deposition and any changes in eutrophication deposition over the period of monitoring. 3. Prevailing ecological condition and any changes in the ecological condition over the period of monitoring. The monitoring programme provides supplementary monitoring information to complement a previous modelling assessment review conducted by the Environment Agency in relation to the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control permitting for UK refineries and coal-fired power stations.

40|$|The water fern Azolla pinnata R. Br. was {{fumigated}} for 1 {{week with}} either 25, 50 or 100 nl 1 − 1 SO 2. The symbiosis of Azolla with Anabaena azollae (spp.) was severely damaged by atmospheric SO 2 even at concentrations {{as low as}} 25 nl 1 − 1, with significant reductions in growth, reduction of C 2 H 2, NH 3 assimilation, protein synthesis, and heterocyst development. These disturbances appear to be mainly responsible for the extreme sensitivity of this fern to atmospheric SO 2. Changes in violaxanthin/antheraxanthin and epoxy-lutein/lutein ratios also indicate that free radical products are induced by atmospheric SO 2. These {{results suggest that the}} Azolla-Anabaena symbiotic system is a very responsive and reliable lower plant model to study the detailed effects of total <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> upon the balances between various important plant metabolic processes...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{monitoring}} of surface water quality has shown increasing concentrations of {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) across {{a large part of}} the Northern Hemisphere. Several drivers have been implicated including climate change, land management change, nitrogen and <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> and CO 2 enrichment. Analysis of stream water data, supported by evidence from laboratory studies, indicates that an effect of declining <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> on catchment soil chemistry is likely to be the primary mechanism, but there are relatively few long term soil water chemistry records in the UK with which to investigate this, and other, hypotheses directly. In this paper, we assess temporal relationships between soil solution chemistry and parameters that have been argued to regulate DOC production and, using a unique set of co-located measurements of weather and bulk deposition and soil solution chemistry provided by the UK Environmental Change Network and the Intensive Forest Monitoring Level II Network. We used statistical non-linear trend analysis to investigate these relationships at 5 forested and 4 non-forested sites from 1993 to 2011. Most trends in soil solution DOC concentration were found to be non-linear. Significant increases in DOC occurred mostly prior to 2005. The magnitude and sign of the trends was associated qualitatively with changes in acid deposition, the presence/absence of a forest canopy, soil depth and soil properties. The strongest increases in DOC were seen in acidic forest soils and were most clearly linked to declining anthropogenic acid deposition, while DOC trends at some sites with westerly locations appeared to have been influenced by shorter-term hydrological variation. The results indicate that widespread DOC increases in surface waters observed elsewhere, are most likely dominated by enhanced mobilization of DOC in surficial organic horizons, rather than changes in the soil water chemistry of deeper horizons. While trends in DOC concentrations in surface horizons have flattened out in recent years, further increases may be expected as soil chemistry continues to adjust to declining inputs of acidity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{recent efforts}} {{to limit the}} growth of SO 2 {{emissions}} in Asia, the negative environmental effects of sulphur emissions are likely to further increase in the future. This paper presents {{an extension of the}} RAINS-Asia integrated assessment model for acidification in Asia with an optimisation routine {{that can be used to}} identify cost-effective emission control strategies that achieve environmental targets for ambient SO 2 concentrations and <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> at least costs. Example scenarios developed with this optimisation module demonstrate a potential for significant cost savings in Asia, if emission controls are allocated to those sources that have the largest environmental impact and are cheapest to control. It is shown that strategies that simultaneously address harmful population exposure and the risk of vegetation damage from acid deposition result in the most cost-effective use of resources spent for emission controls.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{a number of}} the complex interrelationships between energy, {{environment}} and economic welfare can be investigated {{with the aid of a}} 10 -sector input-output (I-O) model of the UK, with pollution emission coefficients and a European <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> vector. The paper reviews relevant past applications of I-O analysis in the energy-environment area and describes the ENDAM program and its operation. It is used to simulate the effects of a variety of policies and possibilities, not only through changes in exogenous variables (final demand and income taxes and transfers) but also through changes in the structural matrices and their coefficients. In each case the full effects, direct, indirect and income induced, can be traced and the changes in comparative static equilibrium values discovered. In this way, policy issues connected with energy use and environmental impacts, employment and economic welfare have been investigated...|$|R
40|$|Triggered by {{the steep}} decline in <b>sulphur</b> <b>deposition</b> in Europe and North America {{over the last}} decades, {{research}} and emission reduction policies have shifted from acidification {{to the effects of}} nitrogen (N) deposition and climate change on plant species diversity and carbon (C) sequestration in soils and biomass. Consequently, soil-ecosystem models need to include detailed descriptions of C and N processes, and ideally provide output that link to plant species diversity models. We describe an extension of the Very Simple Dynamic (VSD) model, called VSD+, which includes an explicit description of C and N turnover. Model simulations for three forest stands, which differ in N deposition and soil C/N ratios, show that VSD+ can well predict both trends and absolute values of NO 3 and NH 4 concentrations in soil and stream waters, soil C/N ratios and pH, which makes VSD+ suitable for providing input for plant species diversity models. </p...|$|R
