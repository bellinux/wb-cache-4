2500|$|Franklin {{had only}} gone a short {{distance}} towards Fort Enterprise when four voyageurs — Michel Terohaute, Jean Baptiste Belanger, Perrault, and Fontano — said {{they were unable to}} continue and asked to return to Hood and Richardson's camp. Franklin agreed. He staggered on towards Fort Enterprise with his five remaining companions, growing weaker and weaker. No game was to be found, even if any of them had been strong enough to hold a rifle, and recounting the story, Franklin made a comment which would become famous: [...] "There was no tripe de roche, so <b>we</b> <b>drank</b> tea and ate some of our shoes for supper." ...|$|E
60|$|Even nowadays, though, the thirstiness {{of mankind}} is {{something}} supernatural. We are forever drinking on one excuse or another. A man never feels comfortable unless {{he has a}} glass before him. <b>We</b> <b>drink</b> before meals, and with meals, and after meals. <b>We</b> <b>drink</b> when <b>we</b> meet a friend, also when we part from a friend. <b>We</b> <b>drink</b> when <b>we</b> are talking, when we are reading, and when we are thinking. <b>We</b> <b>drink</b> one another's healths and spoil our own. <b>We</b> <b>drink</b> the queen, and the army, and the ladies, and everybody else that is drinkable; and I believe if the supply ran short <b>we</b> should <b>drink</b> our mothers-in-law.|$|R

2500|$|Our {{meal that}} night was on a more luxurious scale than {{anything}} that we had tasted for some time. In addition to the usual spoonful of bully beef, we used {{up some of the}} remaining water in making some hot porridge and brewed up some tea. We also scraped up enough rum for a small tot all round. This <b>we</b> <b>drank</b> after supper, lying on a little sandbank and watching the sun sinking behind the dunes. [...] I cannot remember a meal that I enjoyed more or that seemed more wildly and agreeably extravagant. Extravagant it certainly was, for, when we had finished eating, there was no food left at all, and only enough water to half fill one water-bottle for each man.|$|E

Chisholm {{also participated in}} a three-mile [...] "Sport Relief Mile" [...] run. In 2013, Chisholm joined Jack Dee, Dara Ó Briain, Greg James, Chelsee Healey and Philips Idowu in Through Hell and High Water, a Comic Relief challenge which involved British celebrities canoeing the most difficult rapids of the Zambezi River. They raised over £1 million for the charity. [...] In 2014, Chisholm travelled to Ghana to support a charity campaign by Procter & Gamble that provides African children with clean drinking water. The project involved the use of purification sachets that changes the water from stagnant to drinkable. She said, [...] "I've been on charity trips to Africa before. They can be harrowing, but this one was really positive and inspiring. Already it's changing people's lives. When we first arrived, three of the girls took us down to the local water supply, which is basically a big lake shared with animals, so that water can be very dangerous. Using the sachets, {{in half an hour}} the water goes from black to clear. <b>We</b> <b>drank</b> it as well. It's completely and utterly safe." [...] Chisholm also supported a homeless charity by donating funds raised from her annual calendar.|$|E
2500|$|Gatorade {{was created}} in 1965 {{by a team of}} {{scientists}} at the University of Florida College of Medicine, including Robert Cade, Dana Shires, Harry James Free and Alejandro de Quesada. Following a request from Florida Gators football head coach Ray Graves, Gatorade was created to help athletes by acting as a replacement for body fluids lost during physical exertion. The earliest versions of the beverage consisted of a mixture of water, sodium, sugar, potassium, phosphate, and lemon juice. Ten players on the University of Florida football team tested the first version of Gatorade during practices and games in 1965, and the tests were deemed successful. On the other hand, star quarterback Steve Spurrier said, [...] "I don’t have any answer for whether the Gatorade helped us be a better second-half team or not[...] [...] [...] <b>We</b> <b>drank</b> it, but whether it helped us in the second half, who knows?" [...] Nonetheless, the football team credited Gatorade as having contributed to their first Orange Bowl win over the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in 1967, at which point the drink gained traction within the athletic community. Yellow Jackets coach Bobby Dodd, when asked why his team lost, replied: [...] "We didn't have Gatorade. That made the difference." ...|$|E
