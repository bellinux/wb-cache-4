40|$|Ostranenie, {{the term}} for defamiliarization {{introduced}} by Russian writer and critic Victor Shklovsky, means, among other things, to see in strangeness. To see in strangeness is {{to participate in an}} illusion that is more real than real. It may be achieved by (re) presenting the surface as the substance, the play as the thing, or by examining (from exigere: to drive out) <b>what</b> <b>is</b> present before one’s eyes. Ultimately, ostranenie means confessing one’s complicity in making known <b>what</b> <b>is</b> known. <b>M.</b> H. Bowker’s Ostranenie: On Shame and Knowing is a meditation upon the moment of a mother’s death: a moment of defamiliarization in several senses. The body of the work consists of footnotes which elaborate, by exegesis, by parataxis, and sometimes by surprise, the intimate and often hidden relationships between parent and child, illusion and knowledge, shame and loss. These elaborations raise questions about the power of the familiar, the limitations of discursive thought, and the paradoxical nature of the interpersonal, political, and spiritual bargains we make for the sake of security and freedom. Ostranenie treats the personal relationship between the author and his mother in both direct and oblique ways. In a candidly unsettled examination of this relationship and its influence upon the reflections and concerns of the author, the reader is invited to experience a family, a disintegration, a psyche, and its defamiliarization, from the perspectives of both an adult and a child...|$|R

Although there is no contradiction with the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, one can prove that expectation values of Heisenberg operators at fixed times cannot exist in an ordinary asymptotic Lorentz frame. Only operators whose matrix elements between the vacuum and energy eigenstates with energy greater than the Planck scale are artificially cut off, can have conventional Green's functions. This implies a Planck scale cutoff on the possible localization of measurements in time. A similar behavior arises also in ``little string theories''. We argue that conventional quantum mechanics in light cone time is compatible with the properties of black holes if there are more than four non-compact flat dimensions, and also with the properties of ``little string theories''.
