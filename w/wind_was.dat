5|$|Friday {{morning the}} wind shifted again, {{this time to}} the north. The {{firefighting}} finally started to show some semblance of organization, and efforts were waged to stop {{the fire in the}} neighborhood around Magstræde. This failed, though, when the fire took the soap factory on Magstræde around noon. The <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> now blowing northwest and the firefighting moved via Snaregade to Nybrogade, Naboløs and Gammel Strand, but failed to save Nybrogade.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains, peaking at 345mm (13.5in) on Tarama, {{triggered}} {{flooding and}} landslides throughout the islands. The highest sustained winds {{on the islands}} were also recorded on Tarama at 137km/h (85mph) and the highest gust was recorded on Miyako-jima at 185km/h (115mph). Despite transitioning into an extratropical cyclone while impacting Japan, Conson brought heavy rains and high winds to Kyūshū. The highest rainfall and gusts were recorded in Tanegashima at 277.5mm (10.9in) and 146km/h (91mph) respectively; the highest sustained <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> recorded in Muroto, Kōchi at 109km/h (68mph).|$|E

5|$|On September 15, a {{tropical}} depression formed {{off the coast}} of Central America. It moved west-northwest, passing southwest of the Revillagigedo Islands. It then turned north and then north-eastward. For some time, it was a hurricane, and it lost that intensity on or just before September 25. The tropical storm made landfall near San Pedro, California early on September 25 with winds of severe gale strength. It dissipated later that day. The strongest reported <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> of Force 11, reported by a ship, making this system a minimal hurricane. The lowest pressure was reported by the same ship and was 28.67inHg (971mb).|$|E
5|$|The eye of Hurricane Katrina was {{forecast}} to {{pass through}} the city of New Orleans. In that event, the <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> predicted to come from the north as the storm passed, forcing large volumes of water from Lake Pontchartrain against the levees and possibly into the city. It was also forecast that the storm surge in Lake Pontchartrain would reach , with waves reaching 7feet (2m) above the storm surge.|$|E
5|$|The only warship {{reported}} wrecked on the Doom Bar was , a 12-gun schooner. The Whiting {{was originally}} a cargo ship named Arrow, which travelled from the United States to France; she {{was captured by}} the Royal Navy on 8 May 1812 and renamed. On 15 September 1816, she ran aground on the Doom Bar as the tide was ebbing and the <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> from an unfavourable direction offering little assistance. According to court-martial transcripts, an attempt to move her was made at the next high tide, but she was taking on water and {{it was impossible to}} save her.|$|E

5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me like this, and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E
5|$|Upon making landfall, Babe {{produced}} a storm surge of , leading to minor coastal flooding. Due to the storm's quick deterioration after moving inland, the NHC presumed that hurricane-force winds did not impact land. The highest wind gust {{was recorded in}} Grand Isle, Louisiana at 50mph (85km/h) and the highest sustained <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> recorded in Boothville, Louisiana at 45mph (75km/h). In Jean Lafitte, Louisiana, overflow from the Fleming Canal produced flooding throughout the area. The most significant damage was to croplands inundated by flood waters. Flash flooding occurred throughout {{the path of the}} former hurricane in the eastern United States, particularly in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in his life Beebe was {{developing}} a close friendship with the American romance novelist Elswyth Thane, who had met Beebe in 1925. Very little of their early correspondence survives, but Elswyth had idolized Beebe for years, and her first novel Riders of the <b>Wind</b> <b>was</b> devoted to him. The novel was an account of a young woman who falls in love with, and eventually marries, a much older adventurer who strongly resembled Beebe. Beebe and Elswyth were married on September 22, 1927, when Beebe was 50. Due to Elswyth's tendency to misrepresent her age, conflicting accounts exist of how old she was when she and Beebe were married, ranging from 23 to 28. Elswyth and Beebe had an open marriage, in which neither expected sexual exclusivity from the other so long as their life together was not damaged.|$|E

5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on her side, which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
5|$|In agriculture, the {{increased}} usage of sheep with long-fibred wool allowed a stronger thread to be spun. In addition, the spinning wheel replaced the traditional distaff for spinning wool, tripling production. A less technological refinement that still greatly affected daily {{life was the}} use of buttons as closures for garments, which allowed for better fitting without having to lace clothing on the wearer. Windmills were refined with the creation of the tower mill, allowing {{the upper part of the}} windmill to be spun around to face the direction from which the <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> blowing. The blast furnace appeared around 1350 in Sweden, increasing the quantity of iron produced and improving its quality. The first patent law in 1447 in Venice protected the rights of inventors to their inventions.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E

5|$|The 22.5-foot (6.85m) James Caird was {{launched}} on 24 April 1916. The {{success of the}} voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations {{that would have to}} be made in the most unfavourable of conditions. The prevailing <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> helpfully north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in twenty-six years at sea. On 8 May South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay.|$|E
5|$|The falling trees downed {{power lines}} and poles, causing power outages and some {{property}} damage due to the trees and poles hitting houses. One indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree. Two other vehicles in Franklin County and a fire truck in York were hit and greatly damaged by trees. Downed wires set a Family Dollar on fire in Paradise Township and was believed to have started a fire in a church in Ringtown. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with one tree severely damaging a mobile home in Bellwood. Damage directly from the <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> generally minor, and included a house losing a chimney in Camp Hill, a carport being blown over in New Oxford, and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near Lancaster. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56roads in the region, including U.S. Routes 6 and 322, as well as Interstate 83 in York County.|$|E
5|$|While the Carthaginians were in {{the process}} of {{defeating}} the cavalry, the masses of infantry on both sides advanced towards each other in the center of the field. The wind from the east blew dust in the Romans' faces and obscured their vision. While the <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> not a major factor, the dust that both armies created would have been potentially debilitating to sight. Although it made seeing difficult, troops would still have been able to see others in the vicinity. The dust, however, was not the only psychological factor involved in battle. Because of the somewhat distant battle location, both sides were forced to fight on little sleep. Another Roman disadvantage was thirst caused by Hannibal's attack on the Roman encampment during the previous day. Furthermore, the massive number of troops would have led to an overwhelming amount of background noise. All of these psychological factors made battle especially difficult for the infantrymen.|$|E
