40|$|Abstract. Raman {{scattering}} from surface optic (SO) phonons {{has been}} observed and identified in cylindrical and rectangular cross-section nanowires with lateral dimensions in the range 20 - 50 nm and lengths of ~ 10 microns. The position of the SO band is found to depend on both {{the shape of the}} <b>wire</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> (i. e., circular or rectangular) and on the dielectric constant of the external medium. The position of the SO band in GaP and ZnS nanowires is in good agreement with a dielectric continuum model that takes the shape of the <b>wire</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> into account. We propose that the symmetry breaking mechanism which activates the Raman sacttering of the SO phonon in our nanowires is a quasi-periodic modulation of the cross-sectional area along the nanowire axis.

40|$|Friction {{extrusion}} is a {{novel and}} efficient manufacturing process for producing high-value material (e. g., metal wires) from low-cost precursors (e. g., powders) or from recycled metal wastes (e. g., chips). In the friction extrusion process, the precursor material experiences high pressure and frictional heating and undergoes large deformation and material flow before it is extruded to create the final product {{in the form of}} a wire. A three-dimensional thermo-fluid computational fluid dynamicsmodel has been developed to study the heat transfer and material flow patterns in the friction extrusion process. The precursor material in this study is aluminum alloy 6061 and it is modeled as a viscous non-Newtonian fluid with a viscosity that is temperature and strain rate dependent. The heat source because of viscous dissipation and frictional heating is modeled with a user defined volume heat source in a thin layer volume near the tool–precursor interface. The total heat source is taken to equal to the mechanical power input in the friction extrusion experiment. It is found that temperature predictions match reasonably well with experimental measurements. In order to study material flow patterns in the friction extrusion process, a small wire of different material was inserted into the precursor material in the experiment as a marker material and the marker material can be observed on extruded <b>wire</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections.</b> Correspondingly, in the modeling, massless solid particles were released in the fluid as marker particles and they can be tracked and observed on extruded <b>wire</b> <b>cross</b> <b>sections.</b> The massless marker particles do not affect the fluid field and they flow with nearby fluid so they can represent the motion of the fluid where they were initially released. Both predictions and experimental measurements about the markers observed on extruded wire cross-sections show some features in common, such as (a) markers form continuous spirals on the cross-sections, and (b) the number of spirals decreases as friction extrusion continues. Results of this study suggest that the proposed thermo-fluid model can capture the main features of the heat transfer and material flow phenomena in the friction extrusion process and can be used to provide reasonable predictions of the temperature and material flow fields in the friction extrusion process.

The mode conversion is achieved through varying the path length, <b>wire</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> and the surrounding index of refraction. Instead of pure optical interference, strong near-field coupling of surface plasmons results in great momentum splitting and modal profile variation.
