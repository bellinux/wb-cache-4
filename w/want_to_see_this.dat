However, as their plan moves through, things start to fall apart {{when they find out}} that Bill has no checkered past and nothing for them to use against him. Elise, feeling sorry for herself, gets drunk which only results in her and Brenda hurling vicious insults at each other, and the women drift apart. When Annie starts thinking about closing down the First Wives Club, her friends come back, saying that they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> to the end and Bill hasn't done anything blatantly wrong, but only as far as he knows. As a result, the wives manage to uncover information revealing that Bill's mistress (Elizabeth Berkley) is actually a minor.|$|E
500|$|Baja California Sur governor, Ceaser Mendoza Arambrue, {{ordered a}} {{permanent}} evacuation of all low-lying residents to prevent more destruction during future floods, saying [...] "I never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> city menaced {{in this way}} again". He also believed {{that it would take}} two years to completely re-build La Paz. Mexican officials arranged a meeting on October3 to make a plan to reconstruct the devastated area. The nation's president ordered a plan to prevent a recurrence of Hurricane Liza, saying that La Paz would be built a different way. In February 1977, houses were donated to the needy in La Paz. Many residents were upset at their government for failing to protect the dam. In the mainland, $50,000 of relief materials as well as $20,000 of cash was supplied to the Los Mochis area.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} 1952 championship, Cochran {{announced}} he {{was coming out of}} a seven-year retirement to play an exhibition tour with Katsura. [...] "Millions of fans <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> charming first lady of billiards" [...] he said, [...] "now some of them can." [...] The duo previewed their tour with a three-day engagement at the Garden City Parlor in San Jose starting on April 18, 1952. Thereafter, they planned stops in Kansas City (May 2–3); Chicago (May 5–11); Detroit in mid-May; and on to tentative stops in Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Diego, Los Angeles and Long Beach. The format was to be a 100-point straight-rail match, followed by a 50-point three-cushion game played under tournament conditions with trick or [...] "fancy" [...] shots to follow. Katsura stated prior to departing: [...] "I hope my tour will convince women that billiards is not only a man's game. Women can play just as well as men." ...|$|E

60|$|Only Hans, {{although}} he was so tired, acquiesced with some eagerness, the fact being that his brain was more alert {{and that he had}} all the curiosity of the monkey tribe which he so much resembled in appearance, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> queen whom Zikali revered.|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked if}} soap opera fans {{were ready for}} the kiss, Riegel stated, [...] "I know that on the (Internet) message boards, {{there is a small}} but vocal {{minority}} that didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this.</b> But the vast majority (of fans) were ready, excited and with the storyline." [...] For All My Children fans, who had witnessed Bianca's unlucky romantic life, the kiss [...] "was long overdue".|$|E
2500|$|An {{episode of}} CBS's 60 Minutes in 2010 {{focused on the}} lack of {{progress}} at Ground Zero, particularly {{on the lack of}} completion dates for a majority of the buildings, the main tower, One World Trade Center's having undergone three different designs, and the delays and monetary expense involved. [...] Investor Larry Silverstein said the Port Authority's estimated completion date for the entire site was 2037, and billions of dollars had already been spent on the project, even though Ground Zero [...] "is still a hole in the ground". During an interview for the episode, Larry Silverstein said: [...] "I am the most frustrated person in the world....I'm seventy-eight years of age; I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> thing done in my lifetime".|$|E
2500|$|The {{reviewer}} {{stated that}} the jokes might be funnier if the dialogue between them were [...] "compressed". [...] The Manchester Guardian concurred: [...] "Mr. Gilbert's tendency to over-elaboration has nowhere shown itself so obtrusively.... Mr. Gilbert has introduced too many whimsical ideas which practically bear {{no relation to the}} story proper". [...] Although the audience greeted the new piece enthusiastically, neither partner was satisfied. [...] Sullivan wrote in his diary, [...] "Parts of it dragged a little – dialogue too redundant but success great and genuine I think.... Thank God opera is finished & out." [...] Gilbert wrote to his friend, Mrs. Bram Stoker: [...] "I'm not at all a proud Mother, and I never <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> ugly misshapen little brat again." ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{evening of}} that week Sarah Bernhardt {{was at the}} Theatre Royal in Nottingham, giving [...] "La Dame aux Camelias".

60|$|As I was speaking, I thought I heard {{a little}} gasp behind me. I turned. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> woman who stirred my memory with her voice.

2500|$|James Berardinelli {{wrote of}} the film, [...] "The Mist is what a horror film should be—dark, tense, and punctuated by just enough gore to keep the viewer's flinch reflex intact. ... Finally, after {{a long list of}} failures, someone has done justice in {{bringing}} one of King's horror stories to the screen. Though definitely not the feel-good movie of the season, this is a must-see for anyone who loves the genre and doesn't demand 'torture porn' from horror." [...] Roger Ebert was negative, however, writing: [...] "If you have seen ads or trailers suggesting that horrible things pounce on people, and they make you think you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> movie, you will be correct. It is a competently made Horrible Things Pouncing on People Movie. If you think Frank Darabont has equaled the Shawshank and Green Mile track record, you will be sadly mistaken." ...|$|E
2500|$|Church {{was stunned}} by what the Church Committee learned about the immense {{operations}} and electronic monitoring capabilities of the National Security Agency (NSA), an agency whose existence was unknown to most Americans at the time. Church stated in 1975: [...] "That capability at any time could be turned around on the American people, and no American would have any privacy left, such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn't matter. There would be no place to hide." [...] He is widely quoted as also stating regarding the NSA: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> country ever go across the bridge... I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must {{see to it that}} this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision, so that we never cross over that abyss. That is the abyss from which there is no return." ...|$|E
50|$|The story {{reaches its}} climax when Tsukasa confronts Morganna.

The last scenes feature an emotional encounter between Tsukasa's real-life self, finally shown to be a girl, and the real-life player behind Subaru.|$|R
50|$|The black-breasted {{buttonquail}} {{was once}} populous on Inskip Point near Fraser Island, {{with the area}} a destination for birdwatchers <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> species.

50|$|Together {{they went}} on botanical expeditions to the Caucasus, Crimea, Kyrgyzstan, {{southern}} Urals, West Tien Shan and the Pamir ranges. The Fenchenkos made three separate explorations between 1868 and 1872. These investigations were central to the Governor-General's policy as he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> information shared. The local newspaper was used to publish the scientific findings and Kaufman was targeting the 1872 Moscow All-Russian Technical Exhibition {{as an opportunity to}} display Turkestan research and artefacts.|$|R
2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot {{and you can see that}} in the fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him. You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> type of game, where you set the tone, you control the game, you make it fast, you make it attractive and attacking. He's always been famous for his version of the 4–3–3 with the wide wingers, all technically highly gifted and fast. This is his mark." ...|$|E

5000|$|Michael Riedel in The New York Post {{reported}} that in early April 2011, the show only grossed $239,000, though its gross potential was $867,000: [...] "For whatever reason, nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> show". The production is expected to cost $3 million. He noted that {{the title of the}} show has been [...] "debilitating" [...] for advertising. Wrote Riedel, [...] "They simply can't get the name of the play out there, because Chris can talk about it, but he can't say the title, so nobody knows what it is." ...|$|R
