40|$|For {{computer}} graphics rendering, we generally {{assume that the}} appearance of surfaces remains static over time. Yet, {{there are a number}} of natural processes that cause surface appearance to vary dramatically, such as burning of <b>wood,</b> <b>wetting</b> and drying of rock and fabric, decay of fruit skins, and corrosion and rusting of steel and copper. In this paper, we take a significant step towards measuring, modeling, and rendering time-varying surface appearance. We describe the acquisition of the first time-varying database of 26 samples, encompassing a variety of natural processes including burning, drying, decay, and corrosion. Our main technical contribution is a Space-Time Appearance Factorization (STAF). This model factors space and time-varying effects. We derive an overall temporal appearance variation characteristic curve of the specific process, as well as space-dependent textures, rates, and offsets. This overall temporal curve controls different spatial locations evolve at the different rates, causing spatial patterns on the surface over time. We show that the model accurately represents a variety of phenomena. Moreover, it enables a number of novel rendering applications, such as transfer of the time-varying effect to a new static surface, control to accelerate time evolution in certain areas, extrapolation beyond the acquired sequence, and texture synthesis of time-varying appearance. ...|$|E
40|$|Most drying {{simulation}} models describe the moisture migration in wood as a diffusion process, including free water flow at contents {{greater than the}} fibre saturation point. This means that wood {{is seen as a}} homogeneous material lacking internal structure. However, especially in softwood narrow sections, bordered pits, divide the free water phase into rather distinct units. It is thus quite clear that the flow of free water is governed by capillary forces and not by diffusion. A model has been developed that investigates how water filled units are emptied one by one in a drying process. Simulations with the model explain some experimentally seen features that cannot be obtained using solely diffusion type models. Water absorption by dried wood is generally assumed to be governed by capillary (surface tension) forces. An additional feature is that a considerable part of the bordered pits have been aspirated, i. e. closed, in the drying process and the number of possible flow paths is thus reduced. Thus the driving force for water flow is the capillary suction into the lumen. Modelling <b>wood</b> <b>wetting</b> by these principles also introduces some interesting specific features, such as a limit regarding the maximal achievable water saturation. In summary it is found that specific behaviour seen on a real macroscopic level originates from properties at the microscopic, fibre level. This clearly indicates that experience from fibre level models should be included in future drying and wetting {{simulation models}}. The work in this direction so far, has been promising...|$|E

25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: <b>wet</b> <b>wood,</b> <b>wet</b> weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen. Rain will douse a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect.

Samples treated in pressurized steam had lower percentages of polysaccharides and higher percentages of lignin compared to those treated in atmospheric steam, indicating greater chemical changes during the treatment. It was also found that thermal degradation of both samples was modest at the treatment temperature of 205 °C. These results help to explain the better dimensional stability and limited strength deterioration of wood treated in pressurized steam...|$|R

50|$|Once {{the fire}} is built, {{the next step is}} to light the tinder, using either an {{ignition}} device such as a match or a lighter.
