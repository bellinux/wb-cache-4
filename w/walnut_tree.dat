5|$|Until the mid 19th century Radyr was a {{collection}} of small farms, crofts and cottages, but after Radyr railway station opened in 1863, the population rose from 400 to more than 600 in 20 years. The Taff Vale Railway and its successor, the Great Western Railway, brought significant employment to Radyr. Junction Terrace (the first street in Radyr) was built to house the railway workers. It {{was the start of}} strong demand for housing in Radyr that transformed the hamlet. The Barry Railway's <b>Walnut</b> <b>Tree</b> Viaduct, built in 1901, dominated the village for some 70 years.|$|E

25|$|Today's Walnut Creek {{is located}} within the earlier site of four Mexican land grants. One of these land grantsmeasuring belonged to Juana Sanchez de Pacheco, who {{eventually}} passed the land down to her two grandsons. Ygnacio Sibrian, one of the grandsons, created the first roofed home in the valley in about 1850. The grant was called Rancho Arroyo de Las Nueces y Bolbones, named after the principal waterway, Arroyo de las Nueces (Walnut Creek), {{as well as for}} the local group of indigenous Americans (Bolbones). The Arroyo de las Nueces was named for the evidence of the native species of <b>walnut</b> <b>tree,</b> the California Walnut.|$|E
25|$|Hammonds Place, to {{the west}} of London Road as it leaves the town to the south, is a {{handsome}} Elizabethan residence which was substantially re-built by the Michelbourne family in 1565, the date engraved on its porch. Part of a structure dating from about 1500 was retained with the house. Grove Farm House, just south of Station Road, can be dated to about 1600 and was built {{about the same time as}} Farthings in Keymer Road. Chapel Farm House and <b>Walnut</b> <b>Tree</b> Cottages on Fairplace Hill are on medieval sites and the present buildings date from the late Tudor period, as do Pollards Farm and Freckborough Manor House on the eastern boundary of the town.|$|E
50|$|The name Quzlu (Oghuzlu/Ghozlu/Qozlu) {{comes from}} Oghuz Turks.

25|$|After his death, Paine's {{body was}} brought to New Rochelle, but the Quakers would not {{allow it to be}} buried in their {{graveyard}} as per his last will, so his remains were buried under a <b>walnut</b> <b>tree</b> on his farm. In 1819, the English agrarian radical journalist William Cobbett, who in 1793 had published a hostile continuation of Francis Oldys (George Chalmer)'s The Life of Thomas Paine, dug up his bones and transported them back to England with the intention to give Paine a heroic reburial on his native soil, but this never came to pass. The bones were still among Cobbett's effects when he died over twenty years later, but were later lost. There is no confirmed story about what happened to them after that, although various people have claimed throughout the years to own parts of Paine's remains, such as his skull and right hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{name was}} {{originally}} Peñamellera, given by José de Escandón, as the mountain formation east of town {{reminded him of}} a similar formation in Asturias, Spain in the Peñamellera Baja. It was officially named Santa María de Peñamillera when the area became a sub prefecture of Tolimán. Eventually, the name morphed to what it is today. The municipality’s coat of arms represents the history and traditions of the area, especially those related to the founding of the Spanish town in 1748 and after. Since it was the 18th century, the sun figure has eighteen rays. Another motif is that of a colonizer subjugating an indigenous person to represent the conquest of the Chichimecas. As thirty seven families moved in to found the town, there are thirty seven marked tombs, and a tree represents the distribution of lands. Eight palms in a <b>walnut</b> <b>tree</b> branch represent the most important annual celebration, that of the Virgin of the Assumption on August 15. The parish church is represented, and the mass of foundation is represented by a cross {{at the top of the}} coat of arms.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Scania belongs to the European hardwood vegetation zone, a considerable part of which is now agricultural rather than the original forest. This zone covers Europe west of Poland and north of the Alps, and includes the British Isles, northern and central France and the countries and regions {{to the south and}} southeast of the North Sea up to Denmark. A smaller north-eastern part of Scania is part of the pinewood vegetation zone, in which spruce grows naturally. Within the larger part, pine may grow together with birch on sandy soil. The most common tree is beech. Other common trees are willow, oak, ash, alder and elm (which until the 1970s formed a few forests but now is heavily infected by the elm disease). Also rather southern trees like <b>walnut</b> <b>tree,</b> chestnut and hornbeam can be found. In parks horse chestnut, lime and maple are commonly planted as well. Common fruit trees planted in commercial orchards and private gardens include several varieties of apple, pear, cherry and plum; strawberries are commercially cultivated in many locations across the province. Examples of wild berries grown in domesticated form are blackberry, raspberry, cloudberry (in the north-east), blueberry, wild strawberry and loganberry.|$|E

Around the same time, Sally Williams reviewed the restaurant for the Western Mail, who also praised the soufflé.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Falls from <b>walnut</b> <b>trees</b> are a {{frequent}} cause of {{morbidity and mortality}} in Kashmir. This study has been undertaken to evaluate the resultant disabilities and identify methods to prevent such injuries. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted by the Accident and Emergency Department in which case histories (available in Medical Records Department) of all patients with falls from <b>walnut</b> <b>trees</b> were studied and analysed. Results: The patients are young and robust males. The cervical spine injuries are most common (27. 50 %) followed by brain contusion (26. 43 %). Mortality is 24. 13 %. About 18 % of patients get permanent disability (paralysed for life). Conclusion: The significant mortality and morbidity associated with falls from <b>walnut</b> <b>trees</b> is due to crude traditional methods applied in collection of walnuts. If the farmers are educated and more scientific methods based on common sense used many lives can be saved. Falls from <b>walnut</b> <b>trees</b> need to be included as an occupational hazard in medical literature...|$|R
500|$|The most {{important}} {{tree in the}} park is the yellowwood (Cladrastis lutea). [...] This tree typically does not grow further north than central Kentucky, and has been designated as a state threatened species in Indiana. [...] Other trees found in the park include at least four types of oak (black, chestnut, red, and white) and three types of hickory (bitternut, pignut, and shagbark). [...] The park also contains at least two types of maple trees: [...] black and sugar. Patches of paw paw trees can be found throughout the park, and these trees produce an edible fruit. In areas with good moist soil, the black <b>walnut</b> <b>tree</b> grows, and this tree is {{an excellent source of}} wood for lumber or furniture. [...] Among other trees growing in the park are the American beech, basswood, black cherry, black gum, and red elm. [...] Also the sassafras, sycamore, white ash. [...] The park also contains at least eight kinds of ferns and 20 types of wildflowers, including bloodroot and wild geranium.|$|E
