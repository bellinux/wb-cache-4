6000|$|It {{has been}} said that the order of our {{knowledge}} is this: that we know best, first, what we have divined by native instinct; second, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> by experience of men and things; third, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> not in books, but by books--that is, by the reflections that they suggest; fourth, last and lowest, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> in books or with masters. The virtue of an aphorism comes under the third of these heads: it conveys a portion of a truth with such point as to set us thinking on what remains. Montaigne, who delighted in Plutarch, and kept him ever on his table, praises him in that besides his long discourses, [...] "there are a thousand others, which he has only touched and glanced upon, where he only points with his finger to direct us which way we may go if we will, and contents himself sometimes with only giving one brisk hit in the nicest article of the question, from whence we are to grope out the rest." [...] And this is what Plutarch himself is driving at, when he warns young men that it is well to go for a light to another man's fire, but by no means to tarry by it, instead of kindling a torch of their own.|$|E

"By my father's beard, I think thou hast the right," [...] {{said the}} Saracen, rather amused than {{offended}} by the freedom with which the Christian had uttered his reflections; [...] "for, though the Prophet (blessed be his name!) hath sown amongst us the seed of a better faith than our ancestors learned in the ghostly halls of Tugrut, yet we are not willing, like other Moslemah, to pass hasty doom on the lofty and powerful elementary spirits from whom we claim our origin. These Genii, according to our belief and hope, are not altogether reprobate, but {{are still in the}} way of probation, and may hereafter be punished or rewarded. Leave we this to the mollahs and the imauns.

He has learned from him that your niece here is acquiring the system of learning {{to understand what is}} said by watching the lips of speakers. The doctor is of opinion that our daughter may in time outgrow the deafness that came on a year ago, after scarlet fever, but he wishes her to remain under his eye, and he suggested that it would be well that she should learn the new system, so that in case she does not recover her hearing she would still be able to mingle with other people. Hilda is delicate, and it is necessary that she should have a cheerful home; besides which she could not begin to learn the system until she had become familiar with German. The doctor suggested that if we could persuade you to do us the great kindness of taking her under your charge it would be the best possible arrangement." ...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{continuous}} {{progress in}} the development of anti-viral and anti-bacterial/parasite drugs, the high cost of medicines and the potential for re-infection, especially in high risk groups, suggest that protective vaccines {{to some of the most}} dangerous persistent infections are still highly desirable. There are no vaccines available for HIV, HCV and Malaria, and all attempts to make a broadly effective vaccine have failed so far. In this Research Topic we look into why vaccines have failed over the years, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>learn</b> from these attempts. Rather than only showing positive results, this issue aims to reflect on failed efforts in vaccine development. Coming to understand our limitations will have theoretical and practical implications for the future development of vaccines to these major global disease burdens...|$|R

40|$|The old certainties of {{administrative}} law – its location, nature, and purpose – are dissolving; administrative law is now much more varied, diverse, and diffused.
