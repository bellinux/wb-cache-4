2500|$|When Philip IV of Spain died in 1665, {{the great}} powers <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> his heir, the sickly Charles II, would last. [...] Wilhelm was put to work by France to begin {{negotiations}} related to the succession in Spain and in the Spanish Netherlands. [...] In the run up to the War of Devolution, Wilhelm carried funds to Maximilian to fund the build-up of an army for Cologne. [...] He also visited the Count Palatine of Neuburg, Philip Wilhelm, and the Elector of Bavaria to persuade them not to allow Austrian forces to move through their lands to oppose French maneuvers in the Netherlands. [...] On 8 January 1667, Wilhelm went to Vienna representing Cologne (but {{acting on behalf of}} France), to sound out the Emperor's feelings about the succession, perhaps splitting the Netherlands from Spain after the death of Charles. [...] There he spent much time establishing relationships with various ministers at the court. [...] He was offered titles and money to join the Habsburg side and work {{for the end of the}} League of the Rhine, but he demurred. [...] He was also sought by Petar Zrinski, who wished his help (and thus French help) in a Hungarian revolution. [...] Wilhelm avoided being seen too often with him. [...] However, he did let Louis XIV know of the Hungarian revolutionaries, and their potential to provide an opportune diversion for Austrian forces. [...] This laid the ground for a 1668 treaty between France and Austria agreeing that if Charles died without an heir, France would receive the Spanish Netherlands, the County of Burgundy, Navarre, the Philippines, the Two Sicilies, and Morocco, while the remaining Spanish territories would go to Austria.|$|E
60|$|It {{was well}} he said that, for I was {{thinking}} how elaborately everything was planned. I <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{he had the}} scheme in his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{like you}} when you're ironical," [...] Mrs. Halliday rejoined, {{and looking up}} saw that Evelyn had come in. She <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the girl had been there.|$|E
5000|$|Buck: Ho. I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> this {{association}} and Klegs will last? ...|$|R
5000|$|... '...I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> this sickly, this childish, {{taste is}} to remain?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Gaano kayáng kahahabà ang mga ahas na iyón?"I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> those snakes are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Gwendolen, indifferently, finding {{all places}} alike undescribable {{as soon as}} she {{imagined}} herself and her husband in them. [...] "I only <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> you would like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{talk about}} the job first," [...] said Dave, {{trying to keep his}} wits about him, {{although}} he was terribly disturbed. He <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it would be before Phil would return.|$|E
60|$|Soon he bade Marguerite good-night. She {{was tired}} out, body and soul, and he--her {{faithful}} friend--vaguely <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{she would be}} able to withstand the strain of so much sorrow, such unspeakable misery.|$|E
60|$|MANGAN. This girl doesn't want {{to spend}} her life <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> her gloves will last.|$|R
60|$|Ten minutes passed, and {{the youth}} began to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{he would have}} to remain a self-made prisoner.|$|R
60|$|As {{he ended}} she sighed, <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{it would be}} before he told her what she knew was in his heart.|$|R
60|$|The air in {{the hold}} was {{stifling}} and soon I breathed with difficulty. I longed for a drink of water, and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> I could stand being in the place should those on deck forget I was there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{you meant}} {{to stay in}} that damned place"--one of the freedoms he had assumed as a husband being {{the use of his}} strongest epithets. Gwendolen, turning to see the rest of the party approach, said-- ...|$|E
60|$|Yeobright {{returned}} to the room without his cousin. When within two or three feet of Eustacia he stopped, as if again arrested by a thought. He was gazing at her. She looked another way, disconcerted, and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> this purgatory was to last. After lingering a few seconds he passed on again.|$|E
6000|$|Carrie {{rose with}} a little languid gesture. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> this {{exceptionally}} pleasant state of affairs {{could be expected to}} continue?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Twemlow murmured condolences. Mr. Beach's set {{expression}} was {{of one who}} is <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the strain of existence can be supported.|$|R
60|$|And the veiled lady {{is still}} waiting for you up-stairs. You <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> she will stop, also what will happen after she is gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{the rusty}} voice went on; [...] "I'd as soon die as {{go on living}} as I do. And now I've lost my self-respect. Often <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> a {{starving}} man could go without losing his self-respect. Not so very long. You {{take my word for}} that." [...] And without the slightest change in the monotony of that creaking voice he added: ...|$|E
60|$|The girl's courage shamed him, and he obeyed her {{instructions}} {{as best he}} could. By dint of continually shifting {{what remained}} of the paddle {{from one side of the}} canoe to the other, he did manage to keep her head on to the waves that were now rolling in apace. But in their hearts they both <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> this would last.|$|E
60|$|Presently he {{distinguished}} {{the outlines}} of other lions in the surrounding brush and among the trees. Each of them halted as it came {{within sight of the}} ape-man and there they stood regarding him in silence. Tarzan <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it would be before they charged and while he waited he resumed his feeding, though with every sense constantly alert.|$|E
6000|$|... "That boat {{must have}} at least two hundred dollars' worth aboard," [...] I calculated. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it took to get the load?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Bullen," [...] Hallett said, {{the next}} morning, [...] "here we are again. I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> we shall get to rest our wearied bodies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{they have}} taken all the extra harness as well," [...] added Chet, his black eyes {{snapping}} angrily. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> ago this happened." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{over half}} an hour the two Rover boys {{remained}} in the engine room of the Mermaid doing little but walk around. With the hatch closed it was very hot down there, and Dick, who had his coat on, was glad to discard that garment. They could get little or no fresh air, and both <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> they could stand the confinement.|$|E
60|$|Repeatedly he {{was called}} to the balcony over the grand {{entrance}} that the people might feast their eyes on him. The princess <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it was before she herself {{would be forced to}} offer her congratulations and, perchance, suffer his caresses. She shivered and cringed at the thought, and then there came a knock upon the door, and in answer to her permission it opened, and the king stood upon the threshold alone.|$|E
60|$|He <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> Miss Melbury {{was going}} to stay in Hintock. The season was unpropitious for {{accidental}} encounters with her out-of-doors, and except by accident he saw not how they were to become acquainted. One thing was clear--any acquaintance with her could only, with a due regard to his future, be casual, at most of the nature of a flirtation; for he had high aims, and they would some day lead him into other spheres than this.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will step}} inside?" [...] I asked awkwardly, and while I spoke I was <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> {{it would be}} before the earl's {{excitement}} broke out.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> I {{can stand}} this without my legs coming off," [...] said poor Oliver, giving way {{at last to}} a feeling of despair.|$|R
60|$|Mannering turned {{abruptly}} {{round and}} looked {{her in the}} face. He had been gazing out of the window, <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it would be before Hester returned.|$|R
60|$|A {{feeling of}} {{loneliness}} came over Mr. Chalk {{as he watched}} the receding boat. The schooner, riding at anchor half a mile outside the reef, had taken in her sails and presented a singularly naked and desolate appearance. He <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it would take the devoted Brisket to send assistance in case of need, and blamed himself severely for not having brought some rockets for signalling purposes. Long before night came the prospect of sleeping ashore had lost all its charm.|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, {{the others}} fretted at the cold, and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> the outlaws meant {{to keep them}} waiting. Two of them, upon whom all the rest {{depended}} for the warning, were just then crouching, almost frozen, where the thinnest of the birches broke off abruptly, watching a group of vague, shadowy shapes moving in their direction across the white wilderness. Gallwey stood behind them. A bank of sombre cloud sailed across the moon, and left the watchers in almost utter darkness.|$|E
60|$|The {{minutes passed}} and became hours. Ojo <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> one {{could live in}} such a {{condition}} and if the leaf would gradually sap his strength and even his life, in order to feed itself. The little Munchkin boy {{had never heard of}} any person dying in the Land of Oz, but he knew one could suffer a great deal of pain. His greatest fear at this time was that he would always remain imprisoned in the beautiful leaf and never {{see the light of day}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{that proves}} {{we are on}} the right trail!" [...] cried Roger, joyfully. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> ago it was when he threw the paper away?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the fine}} weather continues, and we <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> a time must elapse ere our mutineers eat up their mysterious food and are starved back to work.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} was {{something}} like that," [...] she remarked. [...] "Supposing I had not happened to discover you, I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> you would have gone on?" ...|$|R
