25|$|Any object {{can be used}} as a Portkey; it {{is common}} {{practise}} to select old, worthless items, to discourage unsuspecting Muggles from picking them up and activating them. Portkey objects used in the Potter series include a football and an old <b>Wellington</b> <b>boot.</b> Once the Portus charm is cast upon an object, it glows blue and vibrates gently; once settled it has become a Portkey. When Portkeys are activated, users feel the sensation of a hook being jerked from behind their navel. The floor disappears from beneath their feet, leaving their last position behind them, and they fly forward through a whirlwind of colour and sound, appearing suddenly at their destination. With enough practice it is possible to achieve a graceful landing: After the Portkey trip to the Quidditch World Cup in the fourth film, Mr. Weasley, Cedric and Amos Diggory land on their feet, while the less experienced teenagers, including Harry, fall on the ground.|$|E
25|$|The second Faerie {{gathering}} {{took place}} in August 1980 in Estes Park near Boulder, Colorado. Twice as long and almost {{twice as large as}} the first, it became known as Faery Woodstock. It also exhibited an increasing influence from the U.S. Pagan movement, as Faeries incorporated elements from Evans' Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture and Starhawk's The Spiral Dance into their practices. At that gathering, Dennis Melba'son presented a shawl that he had created with a crocheted depiction of the Northwest European Iron Age deity Cernunnos on it; the shawl became an important symbol of the Faeries, and would be sent from gathering to gathering over subsequent decades. There, Hay publicly revealed the founding trio's desire {{for the creation of a}} permanent residential Faerie community, where they could grow their own crops and thus live self-sustainably. This project would involve setting up a non-profit corporation to purchase property under a community land tryst with tax-exempt status. They were partly inspired by a pre-existing gay collective in rural Tennessee, Short Mountain. The gathering was also attended by an increasing number of men from outside of America, particularly Canada, but also from Australia, Norway, France and Germany, many of whom returned to their countries of origin to establish Faerie communes, such as the <b>Wellington</b> <b>Boot,</b> Common Ground etc. in Australia.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wellington</b> <b>boots</b> are {{a popular}} choice of footwear, being hard wearing, cheap, having good grip and great water resistance.

There is also the risk of lace hooks ensnaring on ladders. In large dry tropical caves they are superior to <b>wellington</b> <b>boots,</b> being cooler and restrict movement less.
