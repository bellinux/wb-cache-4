5|$|During childhood, Goebbels {{suffered}} from ill health, {{which included a}} long bout of inflammation of the lungs. He had a deformed right foot that turned inwards, due to a congenital deformity. It was thicker and shorter than his left foot. He underwent a failed operation to correct it just prior to starting grammar school. Goebbels wore a metal brace and special shoe because of his shortened leg, and <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> a limp. He was rejected for military service in World War I due to his deformity.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{footprints}} {{show that}} pterosaurs stood {{with the entire}} foot {{in contact with the}} ground (plantigrade), {{in a manner similar to}} many mammals like humans and bears. Footprints from azhdarchids and several unidentified species show that pterosaurs <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> an erect posture with their four limbs held almost vertically beneath the body, an energy-efficient stance used by most modern birds and mammals, rather than the sprawled limbs of modern reptiles. Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, Abraham Thornton {{was charged}} {{with the murder of}} Mary Ashford. Thornton had met Ashford at a dance, and had <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> her from the event. The next morning, Ashford was found drowned in a pit, with little outward signs of violence. Although public opinion was heavily against Thornton, the jury quickly acquitted him, and also found him not guilty of rape.|$|E
5|$|Like rauisuchians, Batrachotomus <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> an erect posture, {{although}} the limbs were not located {{directly under the}} trunk. The limbs were not equal in length as the forelimbs were about 70% of the hindlimbs. The toe bones (phalanges) are poorly preserved and the only well known bone is a fifth metatarsal (bone in hindlimbs attached to the toe bones) which was hooked in shape. However, hypotheses suggest that probably each forelimb had four toes and each hindlimb five.|$|E
50|$|<b>Walking</b> <b>with</b> Beasts (<b>Walking</b> <b>with</b> Prehistoric Beasts in North American releases) is a 2001 six-part {{television}} documentary miniseries, {{produced by the}} BBC Natural History Unit.

5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{hands and}} forearms of Triceratops {{retained}} a fairly primitive structure {{compared to other}} quadrupedal dinosaurs such as thyreophorans and many sauropods. In those two groups, the forelimbs of quadrupedal species were usually rotated so that the hands faced forward with palms backward ("pronated") as the animals walked. Triceratops, like other ceratopsians and the related quadrupedal ornithopods, <b>walked</b> <b>with</b> most of their fingers pointing out {{and away from the}} body, the primitive condition for dinosaurs also retained by bipedal forms like the theropods. In Triceratops, the weight of the body was carried by only the first three fingers of the hand, while digits 4 and 5 were vestigial and lacked claws or hooves. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-3-1, meaning that the innermost finger of the forelimb has two bones, the next has three, etc.|$|E
5|$|White Zombie is {{considered}} to be the first feature length zombie film and has been described as the archetype and model of all zombie movies. Not many early horror films followed White Zombies Haitian origins style. Other horror films from the 1930s borrowed themes from White Zombie, such as people returning from the dead and other elements of zombie mythology. These films include: The Ghost Breakers (1940), King of the Zombies (1941), I <b>Walked</b> <b>with</b> a Zombie (1943), and The Plague of the Zombies (1966). These films all contain elements from White Zombie including the blank-eyed stares, the voodoo drums, and zombies performing manual labor.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} formalism for {{the description of}} unrestricted quantum <b>walks</b> <b>with</b> entangled coins and one walker. The numerical behaviour of such walks is examined when using a Bell state as the initial coin state, two different coin operators, two different shift operators, and one walker. We compare and contrast the performance of these quantum <b>walks</b> <b>with</b> that of a classical random walk consisting of one walker and two maximally correlated coins as well as quantum <b>walks</b> <b>with</b> coins sharing different degrees of entanglement. We illustrate that the behaviour of our <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> entangled coins can be very different {{in comparison to the}} usual quantum <b>walk</b> <b>with</b> a single coin. We also demonstrate that simply by changing the shift operator, we can generate widely different distributions. We also compare the behaviour of quantum <b>walks</b> <b>with</b> maximally entangled coins with that of quantum <b>walks</b> <b>with</b> non-entangled coins. Finally, we show that the use of different shift operators on 2 and 3 qubit coins leads to different position probability distributions in 1 and 2 dimensional graphs.

5|$|In the 1940s, RKO {{stood out}} among the industry's Big Five for its focus on B pictures. From a latter-day perspective, {{the most famous of}} the major studios' Golden Age B units is Val Lewton's horror unit at RKO. Lewton {{produced}} such moody, mysterious films as Cat People (1942), I <b>Walked</b> <b>with</b> a Zombie (1943), and The Body Snatcher (1945), directed by Jacques Tourneur, Robert Wise, and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect. The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir—Stranger on the Third Floor (1940), a 64-minute B—was produced at RKO, which would release many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein. The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the best-known film noirs were A-level productions, most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E
5|$|Much {{more than}} the other Big Five studios, RKO relied on B {{pictures}} to fill up its schedule. Of the thirty-one features released by RKO in 1944, for instance, ten were budgeted below $200,000, twelve were in the $200,000 to $500,000 range, and only nine cost more. In contrast, a clear majority of the features put out by the other top four studios were budgeted at over a half a million dollars. A focus on B pictures limited the studio's financial risk; while it also limited the potential for reward (Dmytryk's extraordinary coups aside), RKO had a history of making better profits with its run-of-the-mill and low-cost product than with its A movies. The studio's low-budget films offered training opportunities for new directors, as well, among them Jacques Tourneur, Mark Robson, Robert Wise, and Anthony Mann. Robson and Wise received their first directing assignments with producer Val Lewton, whose specialized B horror unit also included the more experienced director Jacques Tourneur. The Lewton unit's moody, atmospheric work—represented by films such as Cat People (1942), I <b>Walked</b> <b>with</b> a Zombie (1943), and The Body Snatcher (1945)—is now highly regarded. Richard Dix concluded his lengthy RKO career with the 1943 Lewton production The Ghost Ship. Tim Holt was RKO's cowboy star of the era, appearing in forty-six B Westerns and more than fifty movies altogether for the studio. In 1940, Chester Lauck and Norris Goff brought their famous comic characters Lum and Abner from radio to RKO for a six-film run. The Falcon detective series began in 1941; the Saint and the Falcon were so similar that Saint creator Leslie Charteris sued RKO. The Falcon was first played by George Sanders, who had appeared five times as the Saint. He bowed out after four Falcon films and was replaced by his brother, Tom Conway. Conway had a nine-film run in the part before the series ended in 1946. Johnny Weissmuller starred in six Tarzan pictures for RKO between 1943 and 1948 before being replaced by Lex Barker.|$|E
