5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{when the story}} first emerged, but similar stories, {{possibly}} inspired by medieval Arthurian legends, exist at the nearby locations of Hexham and the Eildon Hills. Matthew Lewis wrote a poem, Sir Guy the Seeker, popularising the story in 1808, <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> versions produced by W. G. Thompson in 1821 and James Service in 1822.

5|$|Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren {{arose in}} Eurasia, while within Liliaceae sensu Dahlgren the Lilieae s.s. subclade {{arose in the}} Himalayas (Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau), with later {{radiation}} there in montane and alpine habitats. Species of Lilium and Fritillaria then dispersed {{into the rest of}} Eurasia and North America. The second subclade, the Tulipeae arose in East Asia <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> colonisation of North America by Erythronium and Lloydia. On the other hand, Clintonia-Medeola (Medeoleae) may have appeared in North America but subsequently underwent intercontintental dispersal (although some evidence points to a Eurasian origin). The Calochortaceae sensu Tamura (Streptopoideae and Calochortoideae) appears to have evolved in western North America, <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> colonisation of East Asia by Streptopus and the ancestral Tricyrtis.|$|E

5|$|The Liliaceae {{probably}} arose as shade plants, <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> evolution to open areas including {{deciduous forest}} in the more open autumnal period.

5|$|Although not {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} an apotropaic, mirrors {{have been used to}} ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a soul). This attribute is not universal (the Greek vrykolakas/tympanios was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula and has remained popular <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> authors and filmmakers.|$|E
5|$|By late November 1810, the {{invasion}} force was assembled and Vice-Admiral Albemarle Bertie assumed command at Rodriguez. Upon consultation with his commanders, Bertie decided {{to land at}} Grand Baie {{to the north of}} the island's capital. The landing itself would be commanded by Captain Philip Beaver in HMS Nisus and the first troops ashore would be a specially selected vanguard under Keating and a naval brigade under Captain William Augustus Montagu. These forces would advance on Port Napoleon <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> reinforcement by the main force under General John Abercromby over the following days. This force, nearly 7,000 in number, was significantly larger than the reliable troops available to Decaen, which numbered approximately 1,300, and were intended to achieve a quick resolution to the campaign before the hurricane season began in December.|$|E

Kelly {{provided}} guitars and vocals for their debut album, Professor Ratbaggy, on EMI Records. Songs were written jointly by all group {{members and their}} work was a more groove-oriented style compared to Kelly's usual folk or rock formula, using samples, synthesiser and percussion. Kelly's second anthology of lyrics entitled Don't Start Me Talking {{was first published in}} 1999, <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> songs appended in the 2004 edition.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Army leaders {{including}} General Eric Shinseki began shifting the Army force toward brigade centered operations. All separate brigades had been inactivated in the 1990s {{as part of}} the U.S. Army's drawdown following the end of the Cold War. These inactivations, along <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> reorganization of U.S. Army divisions, saw several divisional brigades stationed in bases that were far from the division's headquarters and support units. These brigades had difficulty operating without support from higher headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Other minor {{roles were}} cut <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> drafts of the script. At the US premiere of Goblet of Fire, series {{producer}} David Heyman said that former Hogwarts professor Gilderoy Lockhart, played by Kenneth Branagh in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, {{was in the}} first draft of the script for Phoenix. However, neither Branagh nor the character of Lockhart appears in the final version. Tiana Benjamin was scheduled to return for the film in the role of Angelina Johnson, the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but she had to withdraw due to a commitment to playing Chelsea Fox in EastEnders. The character, as well as the entire Quidditch subplot, was ultimately cut from the film. She did, however, record sound clips for the Order of the Phoenix video game.|$|E

5|$|Starting on January 3 {{and lasting}} until January 9, 2011, in the United States, players of Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold, and SoulSilver {{were able to}} visit GameStop stores to {{download}} the special shiny Raikou that was previously given out for Phantom Ruler: Zoroark pre-order ticket holders in Japan. Similar downloads would be available for the shiny Entei (January 17 to 23) and shiny Suicune (January 31 to February 6). All three of these Pokémon still enabled the event for Zoroark in the North American Black and White versions. These three Pokémon were later distributed via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for European, Australian, and North American markets (for a second time) starting February 7 to 13 with Raikou, again, <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> staggered releases for Entei and Suicune throughout February.|$|E
5|$|The crested newts are {{believed}} to have originated in the Balkans and radiated in a brief time interval between 11.5 and 8 mya: First, the Balkan–Asian group (the Anatolian, Balkan and southern crested newt) branched off from the other crested newts, probably in a vicariance event caused by the separation of the Balkan and Anatolian land masses. The origin of current-day species is not fully understood so far, but one hypothesis suggests that ecological differences, notably in the adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle, may have evolved between populations and led to parapatric speciation. Alternatively, the complex geological history of the Balkan peninsula may have further separated populations there, <b>with</b> <b>subsequent</b> allopatric speciation and the spread of species into their current ranges.|$|E

Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds should be subject to cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each individual case.|$|E
