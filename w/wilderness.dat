5|$|In 1974, a <b>wilderness</b> {{study was}} {{submitted}} to Congress which identified 95% {{of the area}} of the park as qualifying for <b>wilderness</b> designation. Unlike a few other parks, Glacier National Park has yet to be protected as <b>wilderness,</b> but National Park Service policy requires that identified areas listed in the report be managed as <b>wilderness</b> until Congress renders a full decision. Ninety-three percent of Glacier National Park is managed as <b>wilderness,</b> even though it has not been officially designated.|$|E
5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The <b>Wilderness</b> Society helped gain passage of the <b>Wilderness</b> Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined <b>wilderness</b> areas of the United States and {{protected}} some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the <b>wilderness</b> preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall <b>Wilderness</b> in Montana and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, The <b>Wilderness</b> Society {{has helped}} pass many bills for {{preservation}} and conservation of public lands. It has also purchased lands for preservation, contributing {{a total of}} 109millionacres (421,000km2) to the National <b>Wilderness</b> Preservation System. Marshall's dream of permanent <b>wilderness</b> protection became a reality 25years after his death when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the <b>Wilderness</b> Act into law on September 3, 1964 in the Rose Garden of the White House. The ceremony was attended by Alice Zahniser and Mardy Murie, the widows of two prominent members of The <b>Wilderness</b> Society.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{set aside}} about 89 {{percent of the}} park in a highly {{protected}} <b>wilderness</b> area through passage of the <b>Wilderness</b> Act of 1964. No roads, motorized vehicles (except rescue helicopters and other emergency vehicles), or any development beyond trail maintenance are allowed in this area. The adjacent Ansel Adams <b>Wilderness</b> and John Muir <b>Wilderness</b> were also protected under the act and include regions removed from the park immediately before it was unified with the state grant in 1906.|$|E

According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Sawtooth <b>Wilderness</b> has some of the clearest air in the lower 48 states.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Wilderness</b> Act of 1964 {{enhanced}} the protection status of remote and/or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage {{of the act}} ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in <b>wilderness</b> designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or extraction, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment, including even bicycles. The only manner in which people can enter <b>wilderness</b> areas is either on foot or horseback. Hunting and fishing are permitted in the <b>wilderness,</b> {{just as they are}} throughout the forest, provided those engaging in such activities have the proper licenses and permits.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{contains}} {{four areas}} of pristine <b>wilderness</b> that have remained largely untouched by human {{activities such as}} mining, logging, and road and building construction. The four regions include the North Absaroka, Washakie, Fitzpatrick and Popo Agie Wildernesses. Additionally, {{a small portion of}} the Absaroka-Beartooth <b>Wilderness</b> extends into the extreme northwestern part of the forest, along the Montana border. In Shoshone National Forest, , constituting 56percent of the forest is designated <b>wilderness.</b> The <b>wilderness</b> designation provides a much higher level of land protection and prohibits any alterations by man to the resource.|$|E

5|$|The volcano and the {{surrounding}} Goat Rocks <b>Wilderness,</b> established in 1964, are named after the numerous mountain goats which live in the area. The variable climate of the <b>wilderness</b> area supports a host of wildlife, including marmots, pikas, deer, and elk. Various peaks within the <b>wilderness</b> can be climbed or scrambled, and other activities such as hiking are permitted. The area is rife with minerals and resources, including coal, cobalt, copper, and base metals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wilderness</b> is {{generally}} defined as {{areas that have}} not been significantly modified by human activity. <b>Wilderness</b> areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, , national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. <b>Wilderness</b> areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Some nature writers believe <b>wilderness</b> areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider <b>wilderness</b> areas to {{be an integral part of}} the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere). They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying over the area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The <b>Wilderness</b> Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National <b>Wilderness</b> Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area <b>Wilderness</b> Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E
