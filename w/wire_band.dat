6000|$|LANCASTER bore him--such {{a little}} town, [...] Such a great man. It doesn't see him often [...] Of late years, though {{he keeps the}} old {{homestead}} [...] And sends the children down there with their mother [...] To run wild in the summer--a little wild. [...] Sometimes he joins them {{for a day or}} two [...] And sees old friends he somehow can't get near. [...] They meet him in the general store at night, [...] Pre-occupied with formidable mail, [...] Rifling a printed letter as he talks. [...] They seem afraid. He wouldn't have it so: [...] Though a great scholar, he's a democrat, [...] If not at heart, at least on principle. [...] Lately when coming up to Lancaster [...] His train being late he missed another train [...] And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction [...] After eleven o'clock at night. Too tired [...] To think of sitting such an ordeal out, [...] He turned to the hotel to find a bed. [...] "No room," [...] the night clerk said. [...] "Unless----" [...] Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps [...] And cars that shook and rattle--and one hotel. [...] "You say 'unless.'" [...] "Unless you wouldn't mind [...] Sharing a room with someone else." [...] "Who is it?" [...] "A man." [...] "So I should hope. What kind of man?" [...] "I know him: he's all right. A man's a man. [...] Separate beds of course you understand." [...] The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on. [...] "Who's that man sleeping in the office chair? [...] Has he had the refusal of my chance?" [...] "He was afraid of being robbed or murdered. [...] What do you say?" [...] "I'll have to have a bed." [...] The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs [...] And down a narrow passage full of doors, [...] At the last one of which he knocked and entered. [...] "Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your room." [...] "Show him this way. I'm not afraid of him. [...] I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself." [...] The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot. [...] "This will be yours. Good-night," [...] he said, and went. [...] "Lafe was the name, I think?" [...] "Yes, Layfayette. [...] You got it the first time. And yours?" [...] "Magoon. [...] Doctor Magoon." [...] "A Doctor?" [...] "Well, a teacher." [...] "Professor Square-the-circle-till-you're-tired? [...] Hold on, there's something I don't think of now [...] That I had on my mind to ask the first [...] Man that knew anything I happened in with. [...] I'll ask you later--don't let me forget it." [...] The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away. [...] A man? A brute. Naked above the waist, [...] He sat there creased and shining in the light, [...] Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt. [...] "I'm moving into a size-larger shirt. [...] I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it. [...] I just found what the matter was to-night: [...] I've been a-choking like a nursery tree [...] When it outgrows the <b>wire</b> <b>band</b> of its name tag. [...] I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having. [...] 'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back, [...] Not liking to own up I'd grown a size. [...] Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?" [...] The Doctor caught his throat convulsively. [...] "Oh--ah--fourteen--fourteen." [...] "Fourteen! You say so! [...] I can remember when I wore fourteen. [...] And come to think I must have back at home [...] More than a hundred collars, size fourteen. [...] Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them. [...] They're yours and welcome; let me send them to you. [...] What makes you stand there on one leg like that? [...] You're not much furtherer than where Kike left you. [...] You act as if you wished you hadn't come. [...] Sit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous." [...] The Doctor made a subdued dash for it, [...] And propped himself at bay against a pillow. [...] "Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed. [...] You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off." [...] "Don't touch me, please--I say, don't touch me, please. [...] I'll not be put to bed by you, my man." [...] "Just as you say. Have it your own way then. [...] 'My man' is it? You talk like a professor. [...] Speaking of who's afraid of who, however, [...] I'm thinking I have more to lose than you [...] If anything should happen to be wrong. [...] Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat! [...] Let's have a show down as an evidence [...] Of good faith. There is ninety dollars. [...] Come, if you're not afraid." [...] "I'm not afraid. [...] There's five: that's all I carry." [...] "I can search you? [...] Where are you moving over to? Stay still. [...] You'd better tuck your money under you [...] And sleep on it the way I always do [...] When I'm with people I don't trust at night." [...] "Will you believe me if I put it there [...] Right on the counterpane--that I do trust you?" [...] "You'd say so, Mister Man.--I'm a collector. [...] My ninety isn't mine--you won't think that. [...] I pick it up a dollar at a time [...] All round the country for the Weekly News, [...] Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News?" [...] "Known it since I was young." [...] "Then you know me. [...] Now we are getting on together--talking. [...] I'm sort of Something for it at the front. [...] My business is to find what people want: [...] They pay for it, and so they ought to have it. [...] Fairbanks, he says to me--he's editor-- [...] Feel out the public sentiment--he says. [...] A good deal comes on me when all is said. [...] The only trouble is we disagree [...] In politics: I'm Vermont Democrat-- [...] You know what that is, sort of double-dyed; [...] The News has always been Republican. [...] Fairbanks, he says to me, 'Help us this year,' [...] Meaning by us their ticket. 'No,' I says, [...] 'I can't and won't. You've been in long enough: [...] It's time you turned around and boosted us. [...] You'll have to pay me more than ten a week [...] If I'm expected to elect Bill Taft. [...] I doubt if I could do it anyway.'" [...] "You seem to shape the paper's policy." [...] "You see I'm in with everybody, know 'em all. [...] I almost know their farms as well as they do." [...] "You drive around? It must be pleasant work." [...] "It's business, but I can't say it's not fun. [...] What I like best's the lay of different farms, [...] Coming out on them from a stretch of woods, [...] Or over a hill or round a sudden corner. [...] I like to find folks getting out in spring, [...] Raking the dooryard, working near the house. [...] Later they get out further in the fields. [...] Everything's shut sometimes except the barn; [...] The family's all away in some back meadow. [...] There's a hay load a-coming--when it comes. [...] And later still they all get driven in: [...] The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches [...] Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees [...] To whips and poles. There's nobody about. [...] The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking. [...] And I lie back and ride. I take the reins [...] Only when someone's coming, and the mare [...] Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go. [...] I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one. [...] She's got so she turns in at every house [...] As if she had some sort of curvature, [...] No matter if I have no errand there. [...] She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am. [...] It's seldom I get down except for meals, though. [...] Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep, [...] All in a family row down to the youngest." [...] "One would suppose they might not be as glad [...] To see you as you are to see them." [...] "Oh, [...] Because I want their dollar. I don't want [...] Anything they've not got. I never dun. [...] I'm there, and they can pay me if they like. [...] I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by. [...] Sorry there is no cup to give you a drink. [...] I drink out of the bottle--not your style. [...] Mayn't I offer you----?" [...] "No, no, no, thank you." [...] "Just as you say. Here's looking at you then.-- [...] And now I'm leaving you a little while. [...] You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps-- [...] Lie down--let yourself go and get some sleep. [...] But first--let's see--what was I going to ask you? [...] Those collars--who shall I address them to, [...] Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?" [...] "Really, friend, I can't let you. You--may need them." [...] "Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style." [...] "But really I--I have so many collars." [...] "I don't know who I rather would have have them. [...] They're only turning yellow where they are. [...] But you're the doctor as the saying is. [...] I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me: [...] I've just begun the night. You get some sleep. [...] I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door [...] When I come back so you'll know who it is. [...] There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people. [...] I don't want you should shoot me in the head. [...] What am I doing carrying off this bottle? [...] There now, you get some sleep." [...] He shut the door.

40|$|In a {{semiconductor}} laser above threshold, carriers are extracted at the lasing energy {{at a high}} rate due to stimulated emission and are injected at higher energies. This creates a ‘‘hole burning’’ phenomenon resulting in gain compression. This effect is studied in a quantum wire laser by solving the Boltzmann equation with sink and source terms by a novel Monte Carlo technique. The results for various values of the characteristic injection times are given. A formalism is also proposed for the fully self‐consistent determination of the laser operating parameters from the rate equations with the inclusion of nonlinear gain effects by substituting the correct form of the distribution function in presence of hole burning into the standard expressions for the laser material gain. The nonlinear gain effect is then described completely starting from the <b>wire</b> <b>band</b> structure and scattering rates.

40|$|High-quality {{colloidal}} CdTe quantum wires having purposefully controlled diameters in {{the range}} of 5 - 11 nm are grown by the solution-liquid-solid (SLS) method, using Bi-nanoparticle catalysts, cadmium octadecylphosphonate and trioctylphosphine telluride as precursors, and a TOPO solvent. The wires adopt the wurtzite structure, and grow along the [002] direction (parallel to the c axis). The size dependence of the band gaps in the wires are determined from the absorption spectra, and compared to the experimental results for high-quality CdTe quantum dots. In contrast to the predictions of an effective-mass approximation, particle-in-a-box model, and previous experimental results from CdSe and InP dot-wire comparisons, the band gaps of CdTe dots and wires of like diameter are found to be experimentally indistinguishable. The present results are analyzed using density functional theory under the local-density approximation by implementing a charge-patching method. The higher-level theoretical analysis finds the general existence of a threshold diameter, above which dot and <b>wire</b> <b>band</b> gaps converge. The origin and magnitude of this threshold diameter is discussed...|$|E

The influence of disorder on carrier relaxation in quantum wires is found to be negligible. The unusually slow carrier equilibration process is attributed to the combined effect of the sharply peaked one‐dimensional density of states and the absence of randomizing intrasubband carrier‐carrier scattering processes in quasi‐one‐dimensional systems.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a quantum <b>wire</b> {{intermediate}} <b>band,</b> grown by molecular beam epitaxy, on the optical and electrical properties of solar cells are reported. To investigate {{the behavior of the}} intermediate <b>band,</b> the quantum <b>wires</b> were remotely doped at three different doping concentrations, the number of quantum wire layers was varied from three to twenty, and the solar cell structure was optimized. For all the structures, current-voltage and external quantum efficiency measurements were performed to examine the effect of absorption and power conversion of the intermediate band solar cell (IBSC). Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements showed that δ-doping can increase the lifetime of the excited electrons in the quantum wires. The quantum efficiency measurements revealed that the quantum wires extend the absorption spectrum in the infrared and produce a photocurrent by absorption of photons with energies below the GaAs band gap energy. In addition, the quantum <b>wire</b> intermediate <b>band</b> solar cell increased the solar conversion efficiency by 13. 3 % over the reference cell. An increase in the quantum efficiency was observed by increasing the number of quantum wire layers in the intermediate band. Furthermore, by optimizing the solar cell structure, the quantum efficiency and solar power conversion efficiency were substantially improved. Finally, temperature dependent current-voltage measurements reveal that the quantum <b>wire</b> intermediate <b>band</b> does not degrade the temperature sensitivity of the device. This research shows the potential for a quantum <b>wire</b> intermediate <b>band</b> as a viable option for creating higher efficiency solar cell devices...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether additional tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> in the plate for traumatic disruption of symphysis pubis has clinical benefits. Therefore, outcomes and complications were compared between a plate fixation group and a plate with tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> group. Methods We retrospectively evaluated 64 consecutive patients who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the symphysis pubis by using a plate alone (n 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 00939) or a plate with tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> (n 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 00925). All the patients were followed up for a minimum of 240 months (mean, 34. 40 months; range, 262 ̆ 01339 months). Demographic characteristics, outcomes, movement of the metal works, complications, revision surgery, and Majeed functional score were compared. Results Significant screw pullout was relatively significantly more frequently found in the plate fixation group than in the plate with tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> group (P 2 ̆ 009 = 2 ̆ 0090. 009). In terms of the overall rate of all-cause revision surgery, including significant loosening, symptomatic hardware, and patient-requested hardware removal during follow-up period, the plate with tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> group showed a significantly lower rate. Conclusion Tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> in combination with a symphyseal plate showed better radiological outcomes, a lower incidence of hardware loosening, and a lower rate of revision surgery than plate fixation alone. This technique would have some potential advantages in terms of avoiding significant movement of plate, symptomatic hardware failure, and revision surgery...|$|R

Majority of these fractures can be treated with Kirschner <b>wire</b> and tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> [10].

40|$|BACKGROUND Various {{treatment}} modalities {{are described}} {{for the treatment}} of displaced transverse fractures of patella. As patella is very important biomechanically, open reduction and internal fixation with maximal preservation of patella is the standard treatment. Most commonly used method is modified tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> with Kirschner wires. In a modification, cannulated screws are used instead of K wires and wire is passed through the cannulation of the screw and anterior surface of the patella. The aim of our study was to compare the complications and functional outcomes after surgical treatment of patellar fractures using modified tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> with Kirschner wires and with cannulated screws. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was conducted in Department of Orthopaedics, Government Medical College, Kozhikode, during the period 2014 - 2015. Total sample size was 36. They were randomised into two groups. Among them, 17 had undergone tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> with cannulated screws and 19 with Kirschner wires. They were evaluated in postoperative period at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months by looking for complications like postoperative infection, postoperative loss of reduction, skin irritation by prominent hardware. Functional outcome was assessed by knee pain score and Good Fellows grading of range of motion. RESULTS According to this study while comparing these two surgical techniques, there are no statistically significant differences in terms of complications and functional outcome. We observed that cannulated screw with tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> has better patient tolerance, less complications like skin irritation by prominent hardware, loss of fixation and knee pain. We found that tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> through cannulated screws is technically more difficult than using Kirschner wires. CONCLUSION Although, the statistical analysis showed no significant differences regarding the union and final outcome, cannulated screw with tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> has better patient tolerance, less complications like prominent hardware, loss of fixation and knee pain. So, tension <b>band</b> <b>wiring</b> through cannulated screws for displaced transverse fractures is safe and effective alternative treatment with fewer complications and better functional outcome...|$|R
