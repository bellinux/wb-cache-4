50|$|Modern {{bicycles}} {{have adopted}} standard axle spacing: the hubs of front wheels are generally 100 mm wide fork spacing, road wheels with freehubs generally have a 130 mm wide rear wheel hub. Mountain bikes {{have adopted a}} 135 mm rear hub width, which allows clearance to mount a brake disc on the hub or to decrease the <b>wheel</b> <b>dish</b> for a more durable wheel. Freeride and downhill are available with 150 mm spacing.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2005, {{the museum}} has four {{permanent}} exhibits: an antique toy room featuring items from the 19th and early 20th century; an exhibit of local rocks and minerals, including fluorescent minerals; a pre-electric kitchen, designed to resemble a kitchen of the early 20th century; and the [...] "homespun" [...] room, featuring early- to mid-19th-century items such as spinning <b>wheels,</b> <b>dishes,</b> and clothes.|$|R
5000|$|Disc brakes {{require a}} hub built {{to accept the}} disc, and a fork (for front brakes) or frame (for rear brakes) built to accept the caliper. Front hubs {{designed}} for discs often move the left hub's flange inward {{to make room for}} the disc, which causes the <b>wheel</b> to be <b>dished.</b> A <b>dished</b> <b>wheel</b> is laterally weaker when forced to the non-disc side. Other hubs use conventional flange spacing and provide a <b>wheel</b> without <b>dish,</b> but require a less common wide-spaced fork.|$|R

50|$|The sick animal {{should be}} kept in a cage by itself so that others do not catch the disease—wet tail can be very {{contagious}} so sanitize all objects the animal has come in contact with (<b>wheel,</b> food <b>dish,</b> huts, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Over millennia {{the overall}} {{appearance}} of the wheel barely changed but subtle changes {{to the design of}} a wooden <b>wheel</b> such as <b>dishing</b> and staggered spokes helped keep up with the demands of a changing world.|$|R
50|$|The {{artillery}} wheel {{was developed}} for use on gun carriages when {{it was found that}} the lateral forces involved in horse artillery manoeuvres caused normally constructed cart wheels to collapse. Rather than having its spokes mortised into a wooden nave (hub), it has them fitted together (mitred) then bolted into a metal nave. Its tyre is shrunk onto the rim in the usual way but it is also bolted on for security. A normal wagon <b>wheel</b> is <b>dished</b> so that in its lowest part, the spokes are perpendicular to the ground thus supporting the weight (with the axle not truly horizontal but angled downward toward the outside about 5 degrees). This is not done with artillery wheels.|$|R

The Sanam Washing Machine use Korean SAMSUNG technology, by which it becomes a powerful, economic and durable washing machine. Sanam Industrial Group in Parchin is licensed by the Italian company Lombardini to fabricate internal combustion engines, {{that are used in}} automotive, agricultural, industrial and marine applications.|$|R
50|$|Despite the 100 and 105 bodies {{being very}} similar, {{there are some}} {{exterior}} visual indications between both models. The most obvious is {{the front end of}} the vehicle often appearing lower than the rear on the 100 models, due to the IFS. The other indicator is the design of the wheels. The 100 models have almost flat wheel designs, while the 105 models have <b>dished</b> <b>wheels.</b> This difference allows both versions to retain similar wheel tracks, despite the 100 having a relatively wider axle track to allow for the IFS system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{specification}} {{of the car}} was basic. The steel <b>dish</b> <b>wheels</b> were of a thinness commonly associated with basic motorcycles and needed therefore to be pumped to a relatively high pressure. [...] The hardness of the tires and the minimalist approach taken to shock absorption made the cars strikingly uncomfortable. Except for users of cabriolet versions with the roof open, above average agility was vital for anyone wishing to get {{in or out of}} a Champion. [...] Driver fitness was also encouraged by the need to start the engine with a starting handle, there being no electric starter-motor.|$|R
50|$|Touring {{bicycles}} {{usually have}} linear-pull brakes or cantilever brakes, {{instead of the}} caliper brakes used on racing bicycles. Caliper brakes are less suitable because, to fit around mudguards (fenders) and wide tires, they become large and may flex when trying to stop a heavy bike. Some newer touring bikes use disc brakes, because of their greater stopping power in wet and muddy conditions and also to avoid outer rim wear. However, they are more complicated, so repairing them in remote locations can be difficult; they also weigh more than a cantilever brakes, increase the stresses on spokes, and require the front <b>wheel</b> to be <b>dished,</b> which reduces the durability of the wheels.|$|R
5000|$|The initial range {{comprised}} eleven different models. There {{were three}} body styles: 2-door saloon, 4-door saloon and Familiare station wagon (Estate on the British market). Station wagons were built by SEAT in Spain, but were labelled Fiats for all non-Spanish markets.Trim levels were two; the entry-level 131 Mirafiori (also known as [...] "Normale" [...] or [...] "Standard") had single square headlamps, <b>wheels</b> and <b>dished</b> hubcap from the 124, and simplified interior furnishings. Next {{was the better}} appointed 131 Mirafiori Special (or simply [...] "S"), which could be distinguished from the base model by its quadruple circular headlamps, specific grille, side rubbing strips, chrome window surrounds, and rubber bumper inserts. Inside it added different instrumentation with triple square dials, a padded adjustable steering wheel, cloth upholstery, and reclining seats. Additionally the more sophisticated options—such as air conditioning, tachometer, limited slip differential and vinyl roof—were exclusive to the Special. Each body style could be combined with either of the engines and trim levels—save for the Special estate which only came with the larger engine.US market versions had a SOHC 1.8 litre inline-four and were available with a GM three-speed automatic transmission.|$|R
2500|$|Bicycle wheels {{were not}} strong enough for cars [...] until the {{development}} of tangentially spoked wheels. They rapidly became well established in the bicycle and motor tricycle world but were not common on cars until around 1907. This was encouraged by the Rudge-Whitworth patented detachable and interchangeable wheels designed by John Pugh. These wheels owed their resistance to braking and accelerative stresses to their two inner rows of tangential spokes. An outer row of radial spokes gave lateral strength against cornering strains. These <b>wheels</b> were deeply <b>dished</b> so that steering pivot pins might lie as near {{as possible to the}} center-line of the tires. Their second feature was that they were easily detachable [...] being mounted on splined false hubs.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper reports {{aerodynamic}} testing {{results of}} various styles of bicycle wheels across yaw angles of 0 to 30 degrees. Wheels considered include disc wheels, a bladed spoke wheel and various depth <b>dished</b> <b>wheels.</b> Testing {{has been completed}} in a three quarter open jet test section wind tunnel with a anthropomorphic mannequin and rotating front and rear wheels. Data is provided as {{to the influence of}} the wheel type on the overall drag and side force, and yaw and roll moment of the rider and bicycle combination. The results demonstrate that the wheel type has a significant effect on both the aerodynamic drag and stability of the bicycle system, and that evaluation of wheel aerodynamic performance should not be based on drag alone...|$|R
40|$|The Caribbean steelpan is a pitched {{percussion}} {{instrument that}} originated in Trinidad and Tobago during the Second World War. Despite several research initiatives {{to improve the}} making of this relatively new instrument, several areas remain unaddressed. This thesis presents new approaches to help improve {{the making of the}} instrument. These approaches are situated in the production, vibration and material aspect of the steelpan. A novel sheet forming technology termed Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) is applied to the production of miniature steelpan dishes. The thickness distribution in the wall of the ISF dishes is compared to the wall thickness distribution in a traditionally formed steelpan <b>dish</b> and a <b>wheeled</b> <b>dish.</b> Unlike traditional forming and wheeling, ISF produces stretching in only a portion of the walls of the formed dishes. Multi-pass ISF is used to extend the stretched zone but this extension is minimal. A break even analysis is also applied to investigate the fiscal viability of ISF application to the production of miniature and full size steelpan dishes. The application of ISF to steelpan making is found to be commercially profitable but could be jeopardised by the tuning stage of the steelpan making process. A preliminary study on the effect of impact on tone stability is conducted on a pair of notes on a full size steelpan and detuning is found more likely to occur by repeated impact of the note at its centre. Mode confinement in test-pans is also investigated. ISF is used to produce miniature test-pans with test-notes that are geometrically identical to notes on full size pans. It is possible to confine modes by varying the curvature of the bowl surrounding the test-note. The number of localised modes in the test-note increases as the radius of curvature of the surrounding bowl increases. The natural frequency of the first confined mode in the test-notes is sensitive to material springback in ISF and the mechanism of confinement appears to be due to the change in geometry that occurs between the flat test-note region and the bowl wall. This control of mode confinement may find use in future efforts to completely or partially automate the steelpan making process. Material damping and mechanical properties in low-carbon steel used to produce steelpans are researched. Damping and mechanical properties are extracted from low-carbon steel that is subjected to identical stages to the steelpan production process. Material damping trends suggest that an annealing temperature between 300 °C and 400 °C would be appropriate for the heat treatment of steelpans. Air-cooled and water-quenched low-carbon specimens exhibit comparable damping trends. Hardness increases in cold formed low-carbon specimens is attributed to strain hardening and not strain ageing. Investigation of damping trends and mechanical properties in ultralow bake-hardenable and interstitial-free steels reveals that a wider range of low-carbon steels maybe suitable for steelpan making.

5000|$|While no current-era {{automobile}} front suspension {{incorporates a}} physical king pin, {{the angle of}} the pivot points of the steering knuckle constitute a [...] "virtual king pin" [...] about which the wheels turn. This virtual king pin angle remains a fundamental design parameter. King pin angle, virtual or physical, is sometimes referred to as it's acronym KPA, or alternatively king pin inclination (KPI), or steering axis inclination, SAI. On most modern designs, the kingpin angle is set relative to the true vertical line, as viewed from the front or back of the vehicle. Kingpin inclination is non-adjustable, since it would change only if the wheel spindle or steering knuckles are bent. This has an important effect on the steering, making it tend to return to the straight ahead or centre position. This is because the straight ahead position is where the wheel is at its highest point relative to the suspended body of the vehicle - the weight of the vehicle tends to return the kingpin to this position. A second effect of the kingpin inclination is to set the scrub radius of the steered wheel. This is the offset between the tyre's contact point with the road surface and the projected axis of the steering down through the kingpin. If these points coincide, the scrub radius is zero. Zero scrub radius is possible without an inclined kingpin, but requires a deeply <b>dished</b> <b>wheel</b> so that the kingpin is at the centerline of the wheel. It is much more practical to incline the kingpin and use a less <b>dished</b> <b>wheel,</b> which also gives the self-centering effect. Zero scrub radius is not necessarily desirable - larger scrub radii lead to less steering effort (especially on vehicles without power steering), but more force applied to the steering components by road surface imperfections, braking, etc. Zero scrub radius isolates the steering from these effects but can lead to a [...] "dead" [...] feel for the driver which is undesirable, especially on performance vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dishes on}} each side of a wheel are not always equal. The cogset (freewheel or cassette) of a rear wheel and disc brake rotors, if installed, takes up width on the hub, and so the flanges may not be located symmetrically about the center plane of the hub or the bike. Since the rim must be centered, but the hub flanges are not, there is a {{difference}} in dish between the two sides. Such an asymmetrical wheel is called a [...] "dished" [...] wheel. The side of the <b>wheel</b> with less <b>dish</b> has slightly shorter but significantly higher-tensioned spokes than the side with more dish. Several different techniques have been tried to minimize this spoke asymmetry. In addition to modified hub geometry, some rims have off-center spoke holes, and the mounting of common J-bend spokes at the hub flange can be altered [...] "inboard" [...] or [...] "outboard".|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{the number}} of {{sprockets}} in a cogset has increased, from three or four before World War II, to five used from the 1950s to the 1970s, up to the eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve now found on modern bikes. As more rear sprockets were added, the combination became wider, and the sprocket spacing narrower. One {{of the ways to}} make space for this was the axle length (measured as the Over Locknut Distance — O.L.D.) was increased, necessitating more dish on the rear wheel drive side with a threaded hub to centre the wheel in the frame. The hub flanges spacing was not shortened on threaded hubs, rather the axle length increased from 120 mm O.L.D. (five-speed/compact six) to 126 mm O.L.D. (six-speed/compact seven) through to 130 mm O.L.D. (threaded seven-speed) for a road bike. MTB rear spacing is normally 135 mm O.L.D. Another advantage of the Shimano cassette hubs introduced from 1978 was that the rear hub flanges were wider apart than those of a threaded hub, so built a stronger <b>wheel</b> with less <b>dish</b> and without the problem of increased bearing stress or axle failure.|$|R
5000|$|Traxxas's first RTR Nitro truck. The Traxxas' Nitro Hawk, though {{already a}} legacy model, is highly {{collectible}} {{and are still}} being sold at toy auctions till this time. The highest recorded bid, in 2011, sold for $360.00, {{much more than the}} price of a new one.The Traxxas Nitro Hawk was a two-wheel drive stadium truck with an all-aluminum chassis that came with four different engines, the Image [...]12, the TRX12, TRX15 and Pro15 in a special long crankshaft configuration. The engine assembly was different from other traxxas models, having the clutch bell with the pinion facing against the engine, and the flywheel secured with a nut {{at the end of the}} crank with the clutch shoes facing inward. Another particularity was its shoe brake system that applied braking force on the clutch bell itself instead of having a brake disc mounted on the transmission. This truck also featured all-aluminum shocks with collars to adjust spring load and 2.2-inch lite <b>dish</b> <b>wheels</b> with pro trax ribbed tires at the front and spiked ones at the back. Common upgrades were the 360 Stinger exhaust and sturdier shock towers, since the stock fiber ones were soft.First editions had white plastic parts, body and a clear/transparent hard plastic top, purposely to be painted with the hobbyist-preferred color and are the most collectable ones.|$|R
