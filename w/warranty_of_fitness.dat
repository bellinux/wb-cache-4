50|$|The modern {{trend in}} the U.S. is that the implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitness</b> for a {{particular}} purpose applies in the real-estate context to only the sale of new residential housing by a builder-seller and that the caveat emptor rule applies to all other real-estate sale situations (e.g. homeowner to buyer).

Genetic algorithms appear {{to hold a}} lot of promise as general purpose adaptive search procedures.

GAucsd was developed by Nicol Schraudolph at the University of California, San Diego; it is based on Genesis 4. 5, a genetic algorithm package written by John J. Grefenstette.

Instead—whether the transaction established on the evidence between the plaintiff and the defendant be treated as a sale of food or as a contract for entertainment—there are relevant facts to be submitted to the jury, including: whether rational investigation of the character of the food was made by plaintiff, and whether its noxious nature should have been discovered.|$|E
5000|$|Warranties are {{statements}} by a manufacturer or seller concerning a product during a commercial transaction. Warranty claims commonly require privity between the injured {{party and the}} manufacturer or seller; in plain English, this means they must be dealing with each other directly. Breach of warranty-based product liability claims usually focus on one of three types: (1) breach of an express warranty, (2) breach of an implied warranty of merchantability, and (3) breach of an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>fitness</b> for a particular purpose. Additionally, claims involving real estate may also {{take the form of}} an implied warranty of habitability. Express warranty claims focus on express {{statements by}} the manufacturer or the seller concerning the product (e.g., [...] "This chainsaw is useful to cut turkeys"). The various implied warranties cover those expectations common to all products (e.g., that a tool is not unreasonably dangerous when used for its proper purpose), unless specifically disclaimed by the manufacturer or the seller.|$|E
