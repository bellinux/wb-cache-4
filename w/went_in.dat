5|$|The Klondike Gold Rush was a {{migration}} by {{an estimated}} 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike {{region of the}} Yukon in north-western Canada between 1896 and 1899.

Some became wealthy, but the majority <b>went</b> <b>in</b> vain. It has been immortalized in photographs, books, films, and artifacts.|$|E
5|$|A report {{had been}} {{prepared}} for the parish council in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood – 2,700 by that time, with 530 houses – compared with the largely rural character {{of the rest of}} Ruislip parish. At a meeting of the Ruislip parish council on 28 October 1903, the forthcoming extension of the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow on the Hill to Uxbridge was also discussed as it was known that a station would be opened in Ruislip on the new line. Councillors were also aware that King's College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish and lords of the manor, were planning to sell some for development. With this in mind, a vote was cast which <b>went</b> <b>in</b> favour of becoming an urban district. The new district was designed to better reflect to increase in development, as councillors felt a parish council would work slower than an urban district.|$|E

The attack <b>went</b> <b>in</b> on 4 October, and after overcoming an encounter with a German infantry regiment, the 212th, in no man's land, the Australians successfully managed to capture their objectives. During the battle, the 2nd Battalion lost 10 officers and 144 other ranks killed or wounded, some of which were suffered after an intense German mortar barrage had fallen upon the troops in their form-up point prior to the attack, killing or wounding up to one seventh of the assault force.|$|E

Brett {{did not want to}} know her, but she managed to form a relationship with Ruth and went to live with her in New York.

5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people <b>went</b> <b>in</b> never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E

5|$|After {{the decline}} in Linnaeus' health in the early 1770s, {{publication}} of editions of Systema Naturae <b>went</b> <b>in</b> two different directions. Another Swedish scientist, Johan Andreas Murray issued the Regnum Vegetabile section separately in 1774 as the Systema Vegetabilium, rather confusingly labelled the 13th edition. Meanwhile a 13th edition of the entire Systema appeared in parts between 1788 and 1793. It was through the Systema Vegetabilium that Linnaeus' work became widely known in England, following its translation from the Latin by the Lichfield Botanical Society as A System of Vegetables (1783–1785).|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{international}} affairs intervened. Louis XI {{declared war on}} Burgundy, and Duke Charles responded by granting an expeditionary force to Edward IV, in order to reclaim his throne. On 14March Edward landed at Ravenspurn in Yorkshire, with the acquiescence of the Earl of Northumberland. Warwick was still waiting for Queen Margaret and her son Edward, {{who were supposed to}} bring reinforcements from France, but were kept on the continent by bad weather. At this point Edward received the support of his brother Clarence, who realised that he had been disadvantaged by the new agreement with the Lancastrians. Clarence's defection weakened Warwick, who nevertheless <b>went</b> <b>in</b> pursuit of Edward. On 14April 1471 the two armies met at Barnet. Fog and poor visibility on the field led to confusion, and the Lancastrian army ended up attacking its own men. In the face of defeat Warwick attempted to escape the field, but was struck off his horse and killed.|$|E

Both tail-enders threw the bat at the ball, which often <b>went</b> <b>in</b> vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Tallon put on 45 with Johnstonwho scored 29 before holing out for 53. Ending at 350, the Australians had regained the momentum, taking 92 runs from 66 minutes of hitting in the morning.|$|E
