5|$|By the 4th century BCE Aristotle {{records that}} there were no {{restrictions}} on whom an heiress might marry. If she was not married during her father's lifetime or by directions in her father's will, her nearest next-of-kin was allowed to marry her <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> chose.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller became {{well known}} in his later life for the {{practice}} of giving dimes to adults and nickels to children <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> went. He even gave dimes as a playful gesture to wealthy men, such as tire mogul Harvey Firestone.|$|E

The suit will also automatically materialize whenever he is in danger, and will normally teleport him to <b>wherever</b> <b>he's</b> needed.|$|R
5|$|Sullivan is a {{business}} partner of Drake's. He was meant to act, {{not only as a}} partner, but as a mentor to the main character, and to provide insight into his criminal activities. In all games, Sullivan wears a bowling-style shirt, dockers pants, and chews on a cigar <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> goes. He is constantly in enormous debt, but is likable enough to pull people into investing in his ventures.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{after some}} negotiation, Nevinson {{agreed to work}} for the British War Memorials Committee to produce a single large artwork for a proposed, but never built, Hall of Remembrance. He was offered an honorary {{commission}} as a Second Lieutenant but refused, fearing it would prejudice his medical exemption from combat duties. A short visit over a long weekend to the Western Front was arranged but without a commission Nevinson had to be accompanied <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> went and his movements were restricted. Nevinson quickly fell out with the Army minder assigned to him in France, and claimed he was refused permission to visit the casualty stations he wanted to sketch in.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's {{economic}} thinking only {{began to}} achieve close to universal acceptance {{in the last}} few years of his life. On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> went – even those who found themselves on the wrong side of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E

50|$|At first, Tommy's ability {{appears to}} be simple {{teleportation}} that he can't control. By touching an object, Tommy can make it disappear but has no idea where it goes. He eventually learns that it goes <b>wherever</b> <b>he's</b> thinking of in his mind and learns to control his ability. By touching {{his hand to his}} chest when using his ability, Tommy becomes able to teleport himself and others he's touching. At one point, he indicates his ability is strong enough to teleport the Eiffel Tower if he so wishes.|$|R
5|$|Microbes {{feature in}} many highly dramatized films. Hollywood {{was quick to}} exploit the {{possibilities}} of deadly disease, mass infection and drastic government reaction, starting as early as 1922 with Nosferatu, in which a Dracula-like figure, Count Orlok, sleeps in unhallowed ground contaminated with the Black Death, which he brings with him <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> goes. Another classic film, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 The Seventh Seal, deals with the plague theme very differently, with the grim reaper directly represented by an actor in a hood. More recently, the 1971 The Andromeda Strain, based on a novel by Michael Crichton, portrayed an extraterrestrial microbe contaminating the Earth.|$|E
5|$|The medieval aristocratic {{household}} was not {{fixed to}} one location, {{but could be}} more or less permanently on the move. Greater nobles would have estates scattered over large geographical areas, and to maintain proper control of all their possessions it was important to physically inspect the localities on a regular basis. As the master of the horses, travel was the responsibility of the marshal. Everything in the noble household was designed for travel, so that the lord could enjoy the same luxury <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> went.|$|E

At the newspaper's 150th anniversary celebration in 2004, Chief Judge Joel M. Flaum of the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals said [...] "The paper has bound many generations of lawyers together. It is extremely well led by Bernard Judge, who has been a beacon of excellence <b>wherever</b> <b>he's</b> been. And never has that beacon shone more brightly than at the Law Bulletin." [...] Upon Judge's retirement in 2007, former Illinois Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas R. Fitzgerald stated [...] "He has endeared himself to hundreds, if not thousands, of lawyers because of his integrity. He understood it wasn't only getting the story, it was getting it right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 60. This {{enemy is}} always recognizable, briefly in two functions.

5|$|Torn's primary {{narrative}} {{revolved around}} a wandering protagonist character, cursed to bring pain and misfortune <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> or she traveled, and to whomever {{he or she}} traveled with. A misguided king, later revealed to be the game's ultimate antagonist, would have acted as the player's benefactor, assigning them various quests in order to discover the truth about a series of apparently conflicting prophecies. It would eventually have been revealed that all the prophecies, and even the protangonist character's mysterious curse, could be rationalized, and were in fact related to the protagonist character, effectively granting the player control over which interpretation of the future was realized.|$|E
5|$|Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite In 1784, in Bordeaux, the man {{calling himself}} Count Alessandro di Cagliostro opened the first lodge of his Egyptian Rite masonry. This had the three degrees of normal French masonry (Apprentice, Companion and Master), {{but with a}} greatly different, more mystical ritual. Cagliostro claimed that he was re-introducing true Freemasonry, and he {{attempted}} to attract candidates <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> went. Male candidates were already Freemasons, but women were also admitted. The ceremony for the two sexes differed only in minor points - males were admitted by Cagliostro (the Grand Copht) and females by his wife (the Queen of Sheba). On admission, the women {{were told that they}} were now Freemasons.|$|E
5|$|The Chancery came to {{prominence}} after {{the decline of}} the Exchequer, dealing with the law of equity, something more fluid and adaptable than the common law. The early Court of Chancery dealt with verbal contracts, matters of land law and matters of trusts, and had a very liberal view when setting aside complaints; poverty, for example, was an acceptable reason to cancel a contract or obligation. Complaints were normally brought via a bill or petition, which had to show that the common law did not provide a remedy for the problem. The Chancery writs were in French, and later English, rather than the Latin used for common law bills. In the reign of Edward III, the Court found a fixed home at Westminster Hall, where it sat almost continually until its dissolution. Before this, justice was difficult to dispose because the Lord Chancellor had to travel with the King <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> went.|$|E
50|$|Paleari {{focused on}} {{work with the}} {{children}} and was known to take all opportunities to preach to them and he also heard confessions <b>wherever</b> possible. <b>He</b> was a noted preacher and people flocked to him to ask him for advice.

5|$|Theodore himself {{remained}} in captivity at Tarnovo for seven years. Initially {{he was treated}} with honour, {{but at some point}} during his captivity he was accused of plotting against John Asen and blinded as a result. This was the customary Byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals. According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews to carry out the deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns. Theodore begged to be spared, and they refused to carry out the blinding, whereupon the enraged Tsar had them thrown from a cliff. Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, Irene. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo to <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> wished.|$|E
5|$|They {{arrived at}} Cologne on July 29, visiting the Cologne Cathedral before {{continuing}} on to Berlin. Kalākaua stayed in his Berlin accommodations {{and took care}} of his correspondence the first full day of his stay, with German soldiers standing vigil outside his door. He received boisterous expressions of public approval <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> appeared. During their stay, they attended several military displays and toured museums, castles, and other sites of interest. The King was entertained by the future Kaiser Wilhelm II and his wife, who were receiving him on behalf of Wilhelm's grandfather, the German Emperor. On a visit to Potsdam with Prince Charles of Prussia, Kalākaua was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Red Eagle. Armstrong rejoined the group in Germany, but was too ill to accompany them on their outings. They departed for Vienna on August 4.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{discharge}} from the Army {{and return to the}} States in 1946, Benedetto studied at the American Theatre Wing on the GI Bill. He was taught the bel canto singing discipline, which would keep his voice in good shape for his entire career. He continued to perform <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> could, including while waiting tables. Based upon a suggestion from a teacher at American Theatre Wing, he developed an unusual approach that involved imitating, as he sang, the style and phrasing of other musicians — such as that of Stan Getz's saxophone and Art Tatum's piano — helping him to improvise as he interpreted a song. He made a few recordings as Bari in 1949 for small Leslie Records, but they failed to sell.|$|E

5000|$|In the HISTORY OF THE FIRST MAINE HEAVY ARTILLERY appears this {{tribute to}} him: [...] "He {{was born a}} soldier, {{attractive}} and magnetic in person, a fine horseman with commanding presence.

5|$|It was {{now that}} Philip applied {{the coup de}} grace. He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks {{that he and his}} army was heading for Halos, but it seems certain that he also sent other units {{straight}} to Thermopylae. All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy, and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace. Philip could be certain of dictating the terms {{of the end of the}} Sacred War, since he could now use force against any state that did not accept his arbitration. He began by making a truce with Phalaikos on 19 July; Phalaikos surrendered Phocis to him, in return for being allowed him to leave, with his mercenaries, and go <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> wished. Philip then declared that the fate of Phocis would not be decided by him, but by the Amphictyonic Council. However, it is clear that Philip was dictating the terms behind the scenes; allowing the Amphictyons the formal responsibility allowed him to dissociate himself from the terms in the future.|$|E
5|$|Nelson gave chase, {{but after}} {{arriving}} in the Caribbean, spent June in a fruitless search for the fleet. Villeneuve had briefly cruised around the islands before heading back to Europe, in contravention of Napoleon's orders. The returning French fleet was intercepted by a British fleet under Sir Robert Calder and engaged in the Battle of Cape Finisterre, but managed to reach Ferrol with only minor losses. Nelson returned to Gibraltar {{at the end of}} July, and travelled from there to England, dismayed at his failure to bring the French to battle and expecting to be censured. To his surprise he was given a rapturous reception from crowds who had gathered to view his arrival, while senior British officials congratulated him for sustaining the close pursuit and credited him with saving the West Indies from a French invasion. Nelson stayed briefly in London, where he was cheered <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> went, before visiting Merton to see Emma, arriving in late August. He entertained a number of his friends and relations there over the coming month, and began plans for a grand engagement with the enemy fleet, one that would surprise his foes by forcing a pell-mell battle on them.|$|E
5|$|Pennant's next publication, in 1774, was {{his account}} of the second journey to Scotland. This was in two volumes with the second {{appearing}} in 1776. These works include so much detail of the countryside, its economy, natural history and the customs of the inhabitants that they are still of interest today by way of comparison with the very different state of things now. While these volumes were in preparation, he started some new projects. In 1773 he returned to Cumberland, Westmorland and Yorkshire to visit the parts of them that he had missed previously. As with all his tours, he travelled on horseback, keeping his daily journal and accompanied by Moses Griffith who made copious sketches on the way. Pennant seems to have been an unpretentious man of simple tastes, who was welcomed into the homes of strangers <b>wherever</b> <b>he</b> went. He also made tours in Northamptonshire and the Isle of Man. Whenever he travelled to London he took a slightly different route, again recording what he saw and did and {{on the basis of these}} details, some years later he wrote his Journey from Chester to London. On one of these journeys, the church he visited at Buckingham in the morning collapsed into ruins that evening.|$|E

Again <b>wherever</b> possible <b>he</b> attempted to {{design for the}} climate, and his best work shows spacious planning and good ventilation. Soaring real estate values have made much of his planning now seem wasteful, but in any evaluation of his work {{it must be remembered}} that he worked in a comparatively small city whose commercial expansion has exceeded even the dreams of the then most visionary businessmen.|$|R
