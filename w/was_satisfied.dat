As of December 2011, the game had sold over 500,000 copies across platforms since its initial release. Ubisoft <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> with the game's sales. Despite the game's success, no sequel was planned.|$|E
5|$|Groom's {{dispute with}} Paramount was later {{effectively}} resolved after Groom declared he <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> with Paramount's explanation of their accounting, this coinciding with Groom receiving a seven-figure contract with Paramount for film rights to {{another of his}} books, Gump & Co.|$|E
5|$|Hitler <b>was</b> <b>satisfied.</b> The {{reasoning}} of the Luftwaffe seemed sound. Should {{the bombing}} achieve its aim, it offered considerable strategic value. The strike against London meant {{that most of}} the fighting on 15 September would take place between Luftflotte 2 under Albert Kesselring and Keith Park’s No. 11 Group RAF.|$|E

5|$|A duel {{was fought}} on the moor in July 1804 between Mr. Jones and Mr. Shakspere Philips. Mr. Jones fired at Mr. Philips without effect and Mr. Philips then fired his pistol in the air, {{upon which the}} seconds interfered, the two man shook hands and honour <b>was</b> <b>satisfied.</b> Two weeks later, two other {{men who had been}} quarrelling in the {{newspapers}} met on the moor to gain satisfaction. However, the magistrates had been informed and the men were arrested before the duel could take place.|$|E
5|$|Although the Navy <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> {{with the}} {{investigation}} and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|During {{post-production}} Welles {{and special}} effects artist Linwood G. Dunn experimented with an optical printer to improve certain scenes that Welles found unsatisfactory from the footage. Whereas Welles was often immediately pleased with Wise's work, he would require Dunn and post-production audio engineer James G.

5|$|His {{performance}} at the Olympic trials was in vain as Mr. Justice Mackay upheld the BOA ban in the High Court of Justice and stated that a right to work was not sufficient reason to remove it. The BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> with the outcome, stating that those abusing drugs did not deserve to represent Great Britain at the Olympics. However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E
5|$|However, not {{everyone}} <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> {{with the new}} liturgical and political directions of the AFM. Wessel's political ties led to the radicalization of younger black pastors, {{the loss of the}} majority of the English membership, and a major division of Afrikaner members who did not share his political views. These Afrikaners not only disagreed with Wessel politically but also with du Plessis liturgically. In 1958, they broke from the AFM and formed the Pentecostal Protestant Church.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{accepted}} {{the position of}} curator of the Royal Frederick University's zoology collection, a post which carried a salary but involved no duties; the university <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> by the association with the explorer's name.

5|$|Rihanna's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} at Sun Studios in Dublin, Ireland. Marcos Tovar mixed her vocals, which were engineered by Spike Lindsey and mastered from Detroit over the Internet. The American songwriter Makeba Riddick provided additional vocal production. Strange used equalization, compression and reverberation but left the vocal balance. He assumed that Rihanna <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> with her recorded vocals and did not make major changes on her seven stereo vocal tracks.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} were similarly well received. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com and Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called them believable and {{easy for the}} player to care about. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> by development of each character, while Mike Manson of Nintendo Life considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling and poorly written, and believed {{that there was little}} reason to care for them until their backstories were revealed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} change under Tkach's tenure was the WCG's {{doctrine}} on healing. Previously the church taught that true believers were healed by faith in God {{and not by}} doctors. Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question. Once Tkach <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> {{with the results of}} the study, he officially softened the church's teaching on the matter, encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining faith in God as a healer.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} a {{commercial}} success. By November 2010 Konami had shipped one {{million copies in}} North America and Europe. Despite not achieving a high rank on the sales chart, Konami <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> with the game's sales considering the budget it had and the staff's intentions. The game also became the best-selling Castlevania game, which resulted in Konami's request to produce more titles. Because of the game's success, Lords of Shadow {{is seen as the}} start of a possible second golden age of Spanish software.|$|E
5|$|According to the Court of Appeal, {{the burden}} of proof of {{justifying}} the lawfulness of the appellants' detention was, in the first instance, on the detaining authority. This burden of proof could be discharged by evidence that the President, acting in accordance with advice of the Cabinet or an authorized minister, <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> that the detention was necessary for national security purposes, and by the production of the detention order. Once the detaining authority had discharged the initial burden of proof, a burden of proof fell on the appellants to challenge their detention on GCHQ grounds.|$|E
5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700million.|$|E

5|$|By {{the next}} day, Mackay {{realised}} {{that the position}} could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> with {{the security of the}} new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed. Mackay's injuries were severe enough for him to be evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deployment}} to Syria of several new Russian military systems, various countries had reportedly {{expressed interest in}} the Su-35. These countries included Algeria, Egypt, and Vietnam. According to Kommersant, the Algerian military had requested an Su-35 for testing in February 2016; the country <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> with the fighter's flight characteristics and so Moscow is waiting for a formal application. It is expected that the first phase {{will focus on the}} acquisition of at least twelve aircraft. Other countries that had also expressed interest in the aircraft include Kazakhstan, North Korea, and Pakistan, although a Russian official denied that the country was in talks with the latter about the Su-35.|$|E
5|$|For the JATO project, {{they were}} joined by Caltech {{mathematician}} Martin Summerfield and 18 workers supplied by the Works Progress Administration.

The FBI <b>was</b> <b>satisfied</b> that Parsons was not a Marxist but were concerned when Thelemite friend Paul Seckler used Parsons' gun in a drunken car hijacking, for which Seckler was imprisoned in San Quentin State Prison for two years.
