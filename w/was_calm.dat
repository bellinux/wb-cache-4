5|$|At 05:00 on 9 May 1857 {{a parade}} of the entire Meerut Division took place, to {{announce}} the sentences of the convicted men. The troops present included the 60th Rifles, 6th Dragoon Guards, and batteries of Bengal Artillery, {{as well as the}} 11th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, the 20th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry and, dismounted, the remainder of the men of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry. The sentences were read, and the men stripped of their uniforms, then placed in shackles, while the Meerut Division watched. Despite pleas from the condemned men, none of their fellow soldiers came to their assistance. The entire process took around two hours to complete, following which the convicted soldiers were handed over to the civilian authorities and taken to the local jail under armed escort. After the parade, Hewitt communicated to his headquarters that all <b>was</b> <b>calm,</b> but during the night various junior officials received warnings of impending trouble from concerned sepoys or members of their household staff.|$|E
25|$|The rebels {{remained}} at {{the fringe of the}} city on February 5, claiming they could easily take the city if the French soldiers were not present. There was still sporadic shooting outside the city, but N'Djamena <b>was</b> <b>calm.</b>|$|E

25|$|Black Hawk's {{frequent}} rival was Keokuk, a Sauk war chief held in high esteem by the U.S. government. Officials {{believed that}} he <b>was</b> <b>calm</b> and reasonable, willing to negotiate, unlike Black Hawk. Black Hawk despised Keokuk, and viewed him as cowardly and self-serving, at one point threatening to kill him for not defending Saukenuk. After the Black Hawk War, US officials designated Keokuk as the main Sauk leader and would only deal with him.|$|E
25|$|Mozart was interred in {{a common}} grave, in {{accordance}} with contemporary Viennese custom, at the St. Marx Cemetery outside the city on 7 December. If, as later reports say, no mourners attended, that too is consistent with Viennese burial customs at the time; later Jahn (1856) wrote that Salieri, Süssmayr, van Swieten and two other musicians were present. The tale of a storm and snow is false; the day <b>was</b> <b>calm</b> and mild.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 2006, in {{a closed}} hearing, the People's Supreme Court of Appeals heard Glitter's appeal for a reduced sentence. The three-judge panel {{rejected}} the appeal four weeks later. Although he <b>was</b> <b>calm</b> throughout the 40-minute reading of the verdict, upon leaving the courthouse, he shouted angrily to reporters and denounced Vietnamese justice for not hearing the defence arguments. On 7 February 2007, {{it was announced that}} his sentence had been reduced by three months. In anticipation of his release, the Philippines barred Glitter from entering that country as of 16 May 2008.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the wind}} <b>was</b> <b>calm,</b> Cali's {{controllers}} asked the pilots whether {{they wanted to}} fly a straight-in approach to runway 19 rather than coming around to runway 01. The pilots agreed, hoping to make up some time. The pilots then erroneously cleared the approach waypoints from their navigation computer. When the controller asked the pilots to check back in over Tuluá, north of Cali, {{it was no longer}} programmed into the computer, and so they had to pull out their maps to find it. In the meantime, they extended the aircraft's speed brakes to slow it down and expedite its descent.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, October 4 Achille Lauro {{called in}} Naples then sailed through the Straits of Messina the Mediterranean <b>was</b> <b>calm</b> {{and the fall}} day was warm. Cruise manager Max Fico would later recall that he noticed that several young men were acting suspicious, in that they kept to {{themselves}} refusing any of the congenial friendliness common to the other cruise guests. They claimed to be Argentinean when other guests tried to engage them in English, but didn't understand fluent Spanish when it was spoken to them. They had passports from Portugal, Norway, and Argentina – later it was theorized {{that they were trying}} to maintain a cover story.|$|E
25|$|Following {{independence}} from the United Kingdom, the two largest opposition groups in Burma (Myanmar) were the communists, led by the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) and the Karen nationalists, led by the Karen National Union (KNU). Both groups had fought the British colonial government prior to independence; however, during {{the final days of}} the Japanese occupation of Burma in World War II, the two groups helped the British fight against the Imperial Japanese Army. Initially, there <b>was</b> <b>calm</b> during the transitional period after independence, but on 2 April 1948, the CPB fired the first shots of the conflict in Paukkongyi, Pegu Region (present-day Bago Region).|$|E

25|$|According to the Odyssey, Menelaus's fleet {{was blown}} by storms to Crete and Egypt {{where they were}} unable to sail away because the wind <b>was</b> <b>calm.</b> Only 5 of his ships survived. Menelaus had to catch Proteus, a shape-shifting sea god to find out what sacrifices to which gods he would have to make to {{guarantee}} safe passage. According to some stories the Helen who was taken by Paris was a fake, and the real Helen was in Egypt where she was reunited with Menelaus at this point. Proteus also told Menelaus that he was destined for Elysium (the Fields of the Blessèd) after his death. Menelaus returned to Sparta with Helen 8 years after he had left Troy.|$|E
25|$|Eggen had in 1982 {{proposed}} Bjørn Hansen as his successor, {{and after}} the Cavanagh incident, management hired Hansen. He <b>was</b> <b>calm,</b> pedagogical, tactical and continued with the same football philosophy as Eggen had been using. Forward Arne Dokken transferred from Panathinaikos and local talent defender Rune Bratseth was signed. The 1984 season resulted in a sixth place. Ahead of the 1985 season, Roger Albertsen, Trond Sollied and Gøran Sørloth were signed. In September, Hansen withdrew as manager at his own request, {{and was replaced by}} Dokken. The final game of the season would be a decisive match against Lillestrøm. The game set a Lerkendal attendance record of 28,569, and saw Rosenborg capture the league title after winning 1–0.|$|E
25|$|When Rias' English voice actress Jamie Marchi {{was writing}} the dub script, she noted {{it was a}} breast-centric show, even noting that they have sound effects for when they move. She saw the main heroine Rias <b>was</b> <b>calm</b> and stern and a {{character}} that she isn't used to playing. She also liked giving the side characters more personality. Marchi says that Rias is a straightforward character who is not as sassy as the redheaded anime girls she sees in other shows. Ishibumi also agrees with {{the appeal of the}} characters', including Rias' oppai (breasts) especially in later volumes of the light novels, and had planned to make the heroines more erotic, especially in the side story volumes that focus on comedy.|$|E

25|$|Although Welsh {{is often}} criticised {{throughout}} his career as being unable to knock out his opponents, his style centred on his footwork and ability to avoid punishment. He <b>was</b> <b>calm,</b> elusive and able to frustrate those who faced him, especially heavy hitters. Welsh would often finish long fights without injury, while his opponents suffered heavy damage. Whenever Welsh attempted {{to go on the}} attack to prove critics wrong, he often forgot his defence and allowed his opponents in at close quarters, though some sources state that Welsh disliked knocking out other fighters, especially those {{at the beginning of their}} careers. In his early days he relied on bodywork, especially his kidney punches, but when the punch was outlawed he did not suffer from losing this part of his repertoire.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, Hostos {{went to the}} Dominican Republic {{where he}} founded in Santo Domingo the first Normal School (Teachers College) and {{introduced}} advanced teaching methods, although these had been openly opposed by the local Catholic Church as Hostos opposed any sort of religious instruction in the educational process. Nonetheless, his response to this criticism <b>was</b> <b>calm</b> and constructive, as many of his writings reveal. In 1876, Hostos traveled to Venezuela and married Belinda Otilia de Ayala. Their maid of honor was the Puerto Rican poet, abolitionist, women's rights activist, and Puerto Rican independence advocate Lola Rodríguez de Tió. He returned to the Dominican Republic in 1879 when the first Normal School was finally inaugurated. He was named director and he helped establish a second Normal School {{in the city of}} Santiago de los Caballeros.|$|E
25|$|On 23 October Pitt was {{anchored}} in Môle-Saint-Nicolas at the north-west {{end of the}} island of Haiti. Towards evening a lookout sighted two sails, with it looking like one was pursuing the other. Because the weather <b>was</b> <b>calm,</b> they were moving slowly. Fitton weighed anchor and with his crew at the sweeps set out in pursuit. In the morning he spotted three schooners, the largest of which appeared to be a privateer. As Pitt approached the privateer fired her 6-pounders but without effect because of the distance. The three schooners continued to make their way towards the port of Baracoa, Cuba, some 70 miles west. Pitts crew manned their sweeps throughout the night though at dawn a breeze gave them a respite. They caught up with the privateer outside Baracoa. She had sent her two prizes into the port and was awaiting the British.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{reaction}} of many Congress supporters was rioting, damage to government and European property and strikes {{but within a}} few days, following action {{by the police and}} troops, the Southern Region <b>was</b> <b>calm</b> but tense and the strikers returned to work. In the more remote areas, particularly of the Northern Region, the destruction of bridges and government buildings and rural resistance, including attacks on conservation schemes, continued for several months, particularly in the Misuku Hills, a remote area of rural Congress radicalism close to the border with Tanganyika Territory. This continued resistance was countered by what the governor described as a campaign of harassment by troops and police, and allegations of brutality made against them were later considered by the Devlin Commission. It rejected some claims, including those of rape and torture made against Federation troops during a military action in the Misuku Hills, but it upheld other complaints, including the burning of houses, the imposition of arbitrary fines and beatings, which it considered illegal.

25|$|At 11:30 PM on {{the evening}} of Saturday June 8, 1990, an {{explosion}} in the cargo room of the Norwegian oil tanker the Mega Borg “ruptured the bulkhead between the pump room and the engine room”, causing the ship to catch fire and begin to leak oil. The 853-foot-long, 15-year-old vessel was about 50 {{miles off the coast of}} Galveston, Texas when the explosion occurred. The weather at the time <b>was</b> <b>calm</b> and the tanker had easily passed Coast Guard safety inspections in April earlier that year. While the direct cause of the engine room explosion remains unknown, the initial blast occurred during a lightening process in which the Mega Borg was transferring oil onto a smaller Italian tanker, the Fraqmura, in order to then transport the oil to Houston. This transfer was necessary, as the Mega Borg was too large to dock at the Texas port. Three million gallons of the total 38 million gallons of light Angolan Palanca crude oil on board the tanker were able to be transferred to the Fraqmura before the blast.|$|E
25|$|Cen Wenben {{was born}} in 595 {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wen in the Sui dynasty. His grandfather, Cen Shanfang (岑善方), served under Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, a vassal of the Northern Zhou state who claimed to be the {{legitimate}} emperor of the Liang dynasty. His father, Cen Zhixiang (岑之象), served as a magistrate of Handan County late in the Sui dynasty. In 608, Cen Zhixiang was falsely accused of crimes. Cen Wenben, who was already talented in writing and <b>was</b> <b>calm</b> and dexterious in his actions, went to the ministry of justice to proclaim his father's innocence and, when questioned, was able to answer and explain clearly. The officials were surprised by his ability to do so despite his young age, and, to test his writing ability, asked him to write an ode to lotus. Cen was able to write it well quickly. Subsequently, he was able to convince the officials that his father was falsely accused, allowing his father to be exculpated. He became famous from the incident. He was subsequently recommended for the imperial examination by the local government of his home commandery, but as by that time, most of Sui territory was engulfed in agrarian rebellions against Emperor Yang, Cen Wenben did not report for the examination.|$|E
