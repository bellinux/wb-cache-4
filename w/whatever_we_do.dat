500|$|Inclement weather {{continued}} {{to disrupt the}} Saturday's proceedings as qualifying was delayed multiple times before being ultimately rescheduled for Sunday morning. Many drivers backed the decision, with Jenson Button saying: [...] "It {{was the right thing}} to do [...] In one respect, maybe if we decided three hours earlier it would have been better for the fans. But we wanted to get out there and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour was the way it had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil." [...] Kimi Räikkönen backed him, stating: [...] "I think this is F1 and not the circus. The people are obviously not happy when we're not running but we cannot make them happy with <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> apart from running." ...|$|E
500|$|While Ozzy Osbourne {{was working}} on new solo album {{material}} in 2006, Rhino Records released , a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single [...] "The Devil Cried" [...] reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Mob Rules era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about {{the name of the}} group, Iommi stated [...] "it really is Black Sabbath, <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>do...</b> so everyone knows what they're getting [...] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all the stuff we did with Ronnie again." ...|$|E
5000|$|Singer Andrew Eldritch saw {{the time}} {{ripe for a}} change of direction: [...] "I always wanted to do {{something}} different, because <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it all eventually sounded the same."

2500|$|Australia: In November 2014 Saab {{formally}} made a bid in SEA 1000, the Royal Australian Navy's replacement {{program for}} the six Collins-class submarines still in service. Defence Minister David Johnston stated that [...] "We need to decide quickly and <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> decide {{will be in the}} best interests of the entire nation".' The Australian Government had been ready to buy the more expensive Sōryū-class submarine offered by the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force, however, internal opposition had forced the government to have an open tender for the multi-billion-dollar program. Australia subsequently selected Naval Group (formerly DCNS) france and their Shortfin Barracuda submarines to replace the Australian Collins class ...|$|E
2500|$|Concerning {{the debate}} on how the song should be released, Martin later said: [...] " [...] wasn't really a Beatles record and I {{discussed}} this with Brian Epstein: 'You know this is Paul's song... shall we call it Paul McCartney?' He said 'No, <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> we are not splitting up the Beatles.'" [...] Since [...] "Yesterday" [...] was unlike the Beatles' previous work and did not fit in with their image, the Beatles refused to permit {{the release of a}} single in the United Kingdom. This did not prevent Matt Monro from recording the first of many cover versions of [...] "Yesterday". His version made it into the top ten in the UK charts soon after its release in the autumn of 1965.|$|E
2500|$|The Sun {{described}} the album as [...] "a mixture of ballads and the relentlessly upbeat, catchy hits {{we have come}} to expect." [...] Kimberley Walsh has said that the album is [...] "a lot older sounding, which wasn't intentional, it was just kind of how it went." [...] The girl group were very involved in the album's direction. [...] "The '60s thing is quite prominent," [...] Walsh told the BBC. [...] "But it's out of the ordinary. Not really what you'd expect." [...] Nicola Roberts said that the album also features a lot of 1980s-inspired electropop. Sarah Harding said that Girls Aloud [...] "wanted to stay upbeat but try something a bit different and advanced. I don't think anything we've ever done has ever sounded the same. But we have that same vibe <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> because of our vocals." [...] Nadine Coyle said the [...] "aim from the beginning was to come up with songs that didn't sound like anything else out there." [...] Walsh continued, [...] "We want to impress the fans with what we do, so we've tried to up our game with this album and step outside the comfort zone." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1987, Slayer {{returned}} to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided {{to slow down the}} tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, [...] "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down. <b>We</b> knew <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> was gonna be compared to that album, and I remember we actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've never done that on an album, before or since." ...|$|R

Although highly {{respected}} in the techno and progressive house genres, they felt they had lost sight of why they started a career in music. “We decided that <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> next it should be about taking it back to basics” explains Alessandro. They then educated themselves in the origins of house music, they immersed themselves in the records and history of Chicago house, Larry Levan, Studio 54.|$|R
5000|$|We had the {{impression}} that, <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> <b>we</b> were bound to be wrong. Fighter protection for bombers created many problems {{which had to be}} solved in action. Bomber pilots preferred close screening in which their formation was surrounded by pairs of fighters pursuing a zigzag course. Obviously, the visible presence of the protective fighters gave the bomber pilots a greater sense of security. However, this was a faulty conclusion, because a fighter can only carry out this purely defensive task by taking the initiative in the offensive. He must never wait until attacked because he then loses the chance of acting.We fighter pilots certainly preferred the free chase during the approach and over the target area. This gives the greatest relief and the best protection for the bomber force.|$|R
2500|$|Manchester United {{were unable}} to defend their FA Cup title the {{following}} season, having instead been invited {{to compete in the}} inaugural FIFA Club World Championship in Brazil. The Football Association (FA) encouraged the club {{to take part in the}} new tournament as they believed it would help their bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Alex Ferguson initially suggested that The FA could allow his team a bye to a later round of the competition to help alleviate the fixture congestion that would arise from entering both competitions, but the FA suggested that Manchester United simply pull out of the FA Cup altogether, putting the club in what chairman Martin Edwards called a [...] "no-win" [...] situation. Edwards said: [...] "We're going to get criticised <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>do.</b> If we don't go people will say that we are selfish and only looking after ourselves and not prepared to help the 2006 World Cup bid. But we will also be criticised if we say we're not going to compete in the FA Cup." [...] The offer was also criticised by Manchester United fans, with Andy Walsh of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association saying: [...] "They've shown very little offer of help in the past when United have looked to ease their fixture congestion. This blinding conversion is all to do with the 2006 campaign." ...|$|E

5000|$|The look Scott {{envisioned for}} Legend was {{influenced}} somewhat by {{the style of}} Disney animation. He had even offered the project to Disney, but they were intimidated by the film's dark tone {{at a time when}} Disney still focused on family-friendly material. Visually, he referenced films like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Pinocchio. Early on, Scott worked with Alan Lee as a visual consultant who drew some characters and sketched environments. However, Scott eventually replaced Lee with Assheton Gorton, a production designer whom he had wanted for both Alien and Blade Runner. Scott hired Gorton because he knew [...] "all the pitfalls of shooting exteriors on a soundstage. We both knew that <b>whatever</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> would never look absolutely real, but would very quickly gain its own reality and dispense with any feeling of theatricality".|$|R
