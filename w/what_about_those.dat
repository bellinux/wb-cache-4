25|$|<b>What</b> <b>About</b> <b>Those</b> Who Have Never Heard? Three Views. (IVP, 1995).|$|E
25|$|In his <b>What</b> <b>About</b> <b>Those</b> Who Have Never Heard? Sanders tells a {{story about}} a college student who {{rejected}} Christianity because, he claimed, it “damns to hell all those who never hear about Jesus.” Sanders replied that though some Christians held that position there are several other views which have been affirmed by Christians throughout history. In his book, No Other Name, he discusses a range of views affirmed by Christians. Sanders coined the term “restrictivism” for the view that Christian salvation is possible only for those who have heard about the gospel of Jesus and put their faith in Jesus prior to their death. Those who die without knowing about Jesus cannot inherit eternal life. The second view he discusses is universalism (or apokatastasis) according to which every human who has ever lived will be redeemed. Between these polar views are what Sanders calls the “wider hope” and he spends the most time on two views in this category. One is what he calls eschatological evangelization or postmortem salvation. In this view if a person dies without having heard of Jesus then he or she will encounter Jesus after death and be provided an opportunity to put their faith in Jesus. The final position Sanders covers is the one he affirms: inclusivism. The unevangelized are saved by the work of Jesus if they respond in faith to God based on the revelation they have available.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opening}} {{statement}} of the Jury of Conscience of the World Tribunal on Iraq, keynote speaker Arundhati Roy retorted, [...] "Saddam Hussein is being tried as a war criminal even as we speak. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> who helped to install him in power, who armed him, who supported him—and who are now setting up a tribunal to try him and absolve themselves completely?" ...|$|E

"Why," [...] she {{retorted}} lightly, mechanically re-counting {{the bits}} of paper, [...] "friend indeed! <b>What</b> <b>about</b> all <b>those</b> Pollackes and Monneries mother's so full of? You will soon be flitting to quite another sphere. It's the old friends that then will be left mourning. You won't sit moon-gazing then, my dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How it {{is about}} your being sorry. Your father told me that, if you were truly {{penitent}} for <b>what</b> happened <b>about</b> <b>those</b> boys, I should find you, when I came {{to talk with you}} about it, grieved for your own fault, and if you were not penitent, you would only be angry at theirs. I see which it is." ...|$|R
2500|$|While purgatory was disputed by the reformers, the Early Patristic Theologians of the Eastern Church {{taught and}} {{believed}} in [...] "apokatastasis", {{the belief that}} all creation would be restored to the original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation. St. Clement of Alexandria {{was one of the}} early church theologians who taught this view through key scriptures. Many today are discovering that the reformers did an injustice to Early Christian understandings concerning purgatorial restoration. [...] Protestants have always contended that there are no second chances. However, Lutherans have a similar doctrine of what may happen to the unevangelized in a book titled <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> who never heard. Also several Apologists of both Protestant,Universalist and Catholic backgrounds dig deeper into the subject in the book, [...] "Four Views of Hell". Thomas Talbott and [...] both wrote books defending the Early Church view of the unlimited atonement, and the ultimate salvation of all mankind.|$|E

6000|$|And, {{with that}} {{question}} gnawing at him, {{he went out}} into the orchard. The grass was drenching wet, so he descended to the road. Two wood-pigeons were crooning to each other, truest of all sounds of summer; there was no wind, and the flies had begun humming. In the air, cleared of dust, the scent of hay was everywhere. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> poor devils of laborers, now? They would get the sack for this! and he was suddenly beset with a feeling of disgust. This world where men, and women too, held what they had, took what they could; this world of seeing only one thing at a time; this world of force, and cunning, of struggle, and primitive appetites; of such good things, too, such patience, endurance, heroism--and yet at heart so unutterably savage! ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Did {{you ever}} see such an idiot? For him the {{criminal}} is the prisoner. Simple, is it not? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> who shut him up there—forced him in there? Exactly. Forced him in there. And what is crime? Does he know that, this imbecile who has made his way {{in this world of}} gorged fools by looking at the ears and teeth of a lot of poor, luckless devils? Teeth and ears mark the criminal? Do they? And what about the law that marks him still better—the pretty branding instrument invented by the overfed to protect themselves against the hungry? Red-hot applications on their vile skins—hey? Can’t you smell and hear from here the thick hide of the people burn and sizzle? That’s how criminals are made for your Lombrosos to write their silly stuff about.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't tell you; or, rather, I will not. I have my {{own opinion}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>those</b> trees and stones are; but it will require a few years' more {{verification}} before I tell." ...|$|R

5000|$|Holloway has likened {{aspects of}} his work to postdramatic theatre. On Love Me Tender, he said: [...] "There's been a big push away from story {{the last ten years}} in this {{movement}} called ‘post-dramatic theatre'. They're very fragmented and experimental, these plays... I'm taking <b>what</b> I love <b>about</b> <b>those</b> plays and feeding narrative back into it.".|$|R
6000|$|... '"I am {{sometimes}} asked, <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> {{who have}} left me? Well, I am thankful {{to say that we}} remain in sympathetic and friendly relations with the great bulk of them. It was to be expected that in work such as ours, demanding, as it does, not only arduous toil and constant self-denial and often real hardships of one kind or another, some should prove unworthy, some should grow weary, and others should faint by the way, whilst others again, though very excellent souls, should prove unsuitable. It could not be otherwise, for we are engaged in real warfare, and whoever heard of war without wounds and losses? But even of those who do thus step aside from the position of Officers, a large proportion--in this country nine out of ten--remain with us, engaged in some voluntary effort in our ranks."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{generally}} their own fault if they don't get the main things," [...] he insisted. [...] "But, see here, I'll attack {{you with your}} own weapons. Here am I, forty-one years old, {{in love with you}} since I was thirty-two. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> nine years? I am dropping into the ways of untidy, unsatisfactory bachelordom. I only order new clothes when some friend chaffs me into it, and if I do I forget the ties and shirts and those sorts of things. I've lost all interest in myself. I loaf at the club, play auction bridge when I might be doing something a great deal better, and drink a whisky and soda when any one asks me. I hang on to the business, but when I've finished my work I drift. In another five years' time I shall begin to stoop, I shall live with cigar ash all over my clothes, and I shall have to be taken home from the club every other night. Your doing, Marcia--your responsibility." ...|$|E
60|$|While he was {{speaking}} Renouard saw again the sway of her figure in a movement of grace and strength—felt the pressure of her hand—heard the last accents of the deep murmur that came from her throat so white {{in the light of}} the window, and remembered the black rays of her steady eyes passing off his face when she turned away. He remembered all this visually, and it was not exactly pleasurable. It was rather startling like the discovery of a new faculty in himself. There are faculties one would rather do without—such, for instance, as seeing through a stone wall or remembering a person with this uncanny vividness. And <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> two people belonging to her with their air of expectant solicitude! Really, those figures from home got in front of one. In fact, their persistence in getting between him and the solid forms of the everyday material world had driven Renouard to call on his friend at the office. He hoped that a little common, gossipy information would lay the ghost of that unexpected dinner-party. Of course the proper person to go to would have been young Dunster, but, he couldn’t stand Willie Dunster—not at any price.|$|E

60|$|One {{may well}} ask, however, {{granting}} {{that there is}} evidence for such a life and such a world as has been described, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> who have not merited such a destination? What do the messages from beyond say about these? And here one cannot be too definite, for there is no use exchanging one dogma for another. One can but give the general purport of such information as has been vouchsafed to us. It is natural that those with whom we come in contact are those whom we may truly call the blessed, for if the thing be approached in a reverent and religious spirit it is those whom we should naturally attract. That there are many less fortunate than themselves is evident from their own constant allusions to that regenerating and elevating missionary work which is among their own functions. They descend apparently and help others to gain that degree of spirituality which fits them for this upper sphere, as a higher student might descend to a lower class {{in order to bring}} forward a backward pupil. Such a conception gives point to Christ's remark that there was more joy in heaven over saving one sinner than over ninety-nine just, for if He had spoken of an earthly sinner he would surely have had to become just in this life and so ceased to be a sinner before he had reached Paradise. It would apply very exactly, however, to a sinner rescued from a lower sphere and brought to a higher one.|$|E
6000|$|In Massachusetts {{they are}} again hardly honest. [...] "It is the right," [...] says the constitution, [...] "as {{well as the}} duty of all men in society {{publicly}} and at stated seasons to worship the supreme Being, the Great Creator and Preserver of the universe." [...] And then {{it goes on to}} say that every man may do so in what form he pleases; but further down it declares that [...] "every denomination of Christians, demeaning themselves peaceably and as good subjects of the commonwealth, shall be equally under the protection of the law." [...] But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>those</b> who are not Christians? In New Hampshire it is exactly the same. It is enacted that [...] "every individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience and reason." [...] And that [...] "every denomination of Christians, demeaning themselves quietly and as good citizens of the State, shall be equally under the protection of the law." [...] From all which it is, I think, manifest that the men who framed these documents, desirous above all things of cutting themselves and their people loose from every kind of trammel, still felt the necessity of enforcing religion--of making it, to a certain extent, a matter of State duty. In the first constitution of North Carolina it is enjoined [...] "that no person who shall deny the being of God, or the truth of the Protestant religion, shall be capable of holding any office or place of trust or profit." [...] But this was altered in the year 1836, and the words [...] "Christian religion" [...] were substituted for [...] "Protestant religion." ...|$|E
