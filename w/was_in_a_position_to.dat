5|$|After Actium and {{the defeat}} of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> rule the entire Republic under an {{unofficial}} principate—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing {{that he was not}} aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and Marcus Agrippa were elected as dual consuls by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1944, the 6th Airborne Division {{landed in}} Normandy {{to secure the}} left flank of the British landing zone. The division's {{objectives}} were to capture intact the Caen canal bridge, the Orne river bridge, destroy the Merville gun battery– which <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> engage troops landing at the nearby Sword– and the bridges crossing the River Dives, the latter to prevent German reinforcements approaching the landings from the east.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Brundage {{began work}} as a {{construction}} superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird & Roche. In the three years {{he worked for the}} firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5million in buildings—3percent of the total built in Chicago in that time-frame. He disliked the corruption of the Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, {{as a member of the}} Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new phenomenon and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E
5|$|Although {{suffering}} numerous tactical reverses, operationally the Germans diverted the Allied First Army Group {{from the}} lower Ardennes area. In the process his forces, along with the Luftwaffe depleted Prioux' Cavalry Corps. When news of the German breakthrough at Sedan reached Prioux, he withdrew from Gembloux. With the Gembloux gap breached, the German Panzer Corps, the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions, were no longer required by Army Group B and were handed over to Army Group A. Army Group B would continue its own offensive to force {{the collapse of the}} Meuse front. The Army Group <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> advance westward to Mons, outflank the BEF and Belgian Army protecting the Dyle–Brussels sector, or turn south to outflank the French 9th Army.|$|E

5|$|An hour later, having {{endured the}} fire of the guns on both shores, Aigle <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> attack the rear-most frigate of the pair as they emerged from {{the western side of}} the island. This frigate sought the shelter of Groix' batteries, so Aigle set off in pursuit of the other which was now making for Lorient. As it was now dark, Aigle {{displayed}} a blue light to indicate her position to the closing Impétueux, and at 21:00, coming within 50 yards, exchanged fire with the Frenchman. To prevent a boarding, which Wolfe was determined upon, the frigate came about and, shortly after the British had broken off their attack for lack of sea room, ran aground on the Pointe de Chats on the eastern edge of Groix.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} season of The X-Files, Deep Throat {{provided}} Mulder and Scully with information {{they would have been}} otherwise unable to obtain.

Deep Throat felt that the truth the Syndicate kept secret from the public needed to be known, and believed Mulder to be the one person capable of exposing this knowledge. However, during the disappearance of Max Fenig, Deep Throat provided Mulder with false information in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed the public was just not ready to know some truths.|$|E
5|$|In 796 or 797 the Welsh engaged Mercian {{forces at}} Rhuddlan.

A {{civil war in}} Gwynedd in the 810s ended with the {{succession}} of Hywel ap Caradog in 816 or 817, and Coenwulf invaded again, this time ravaging Snowdonia and taking control of Rhufuniog, a small Welsh territory near Rhos. It is not clear if the Mercians {{were involved in a}} battle recorded in Anglesey in 817 or 818, but the following year Coenwulf and his army devastated Dyfed.|$|E

5|$|On 16 May, Morgan <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> {{advance in}} force into Merthyr, pushing forward and taking {{advantage}} of the poor communications between the various elements of the insurgency. The uprising collapsed, and {{over the next few days}} the authorities regained control, making arrests and forcing the workers back to business. Government inquiries into the incident began and Bute, among others, provided analysis and reports to Whitehall. In the aftermath, Richard Lewis, one of the radical crowd, was hanged in Cardiff. The execution proved controversial and it is unknown whether Bute, who had by then left to attend Parliament in London, approved of the decision.|$|E
5|$|The Ponte Grande Bridge was {{immediately}} outside the area defended by the Italian 206 Coastal Division, which would oppose the British seaborne landing. The fortress commander was Rear Admiral Priamo Leonardi, with Colonel Mario Damiani {{in command of}} the army contingent. The Augusta-Syracuse Naval Fortress Area, which included the Coastal Division, was protected by six medium and six heavy coastal artillery batteries, with eleven additional dual-purpose coastal and anti-aircraft batteries, with six batteries only of anti-aircraft guns. Finally the Fortress contained an armoured train with four 120mm guns. The army contingent was the 121st Coastal Defence Regiment, which included four battalions. There were also naval and air force battalions available, while the 54 Infantry Division Napoli <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> send reinforcements if required.|$|E
5|$|When Karajan <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> do so {{he added}} Falstaff to the {{repertoire}} of his opera company at Aachen in 1941, and he remained {{a proponent of}} the work {{for the rest of}} his career, presenting it frequently in Vienna, Salzburg and elsewhere, and making audio and video recordings of it. Solti also became closely associated with Falstaff, as did Carlo Maria Giulini; they both conducted many performances of the work in mainland Europe, Britain and the US and made several recordings. Leonard Bernstein conducted the work at the Met and the Vienna State Opera, and on record. The advocacy of these and later conductors has given the work an assured place in the modern repertoire.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August 1942 a major landing {{took place}} at the French coastal town of Dieppe. The main force was {{provided}} by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, supported by No. 3 and No. 4 Commandos. The mission of No. 3 Commando was to neutralize a German coastal battery near Berneval-le-Grand that <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> fire upon the landing at Dieppe. The landing craft carrying No. 3 Commando ran into a German coastal convoy. Only a handful of commandos, under the second in command Major Peter Young, landed and scaled the barbed wire laced cliffs. Eventually 18 Commandos reached the perimeter of the battery via Berneval and engaged the target with small arms fire. Although unable to destroy the guns, they prevented the Germans from firing effectively on the main assault by harassing their gun crews with sniper fire. In a subsidiary operation No. 4 Commando landed in force along with the French Troop No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando and 50 United States Army Rangers and destroyed the artillery battery at Varengeville. Most of No. 4 Commando safely returned to England. Captain Patrick Porteous of No. 4 Commando was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the raid.|$|E
5|$|The widowed Amélie never remarried, {{and spent}} her time {{overseeing}} her daughter's upbringing in Portugal, where they remained despite not being {{members of the}} Portuguese Royal Family, though closely related. Neither Amélie nor her daughter ever visited Brazil, but Amélie unsuccessfully petitioned the Brazilian government to recognize her daughter {{as a member of}} Brazil's Imperial Family, which would have entitled her to an income. Maria Amélia's half-brother PedroII was a minor, and the government of Brazil was {{in the hands of a}} precarious regency. The government refused to acknowledge Maria Amélia as a Brazilian princess owing to her foreign birth, and forbade both her and her mother from setting foot in Brazil. The situation would only change after PedroII was declared of age in 1840 and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> insist that she be recognized as a member of his household. Aureliano Coutinho (later Viscount of Sepetiba), the Minister of Foreign Affairs, requested the Brazilian parliament to grant Maria Amélia recognition, which occurred on 5 July 1841.|$|E
5|$|With the Australian and Viet Cong {{positions}} now {{too close}} to each other, O'Halloran could neither move forward nor withdraw. Artillery began to fire {{in support of the}} Australians, however it initially fell too far to the rear to be effective, and it had to be adjusted by the B Company forward observer, Captain Jim Ryan, himself under heavy fire. 5 Platoon was still in danger of becoming isolated and O'Brien now suggested he move A Company forward to assist B Company, however this was rejected by Mackay who feared the two companies clashing in the confusion. Meanwhile, O'Halloran called for the APCs to come forward to provide assistance, while the platoon sergeant—Sergeant Mervyn McCullough—guided a section from 6 Platoon forward to reinforce 5 Platoon, and begin evacuating the casualties. Bolstered by reinforcements and with accurate artillery covering fire O'Halloran now felt that he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> extract his platoon. Yet at that moment two rounds from one of the howitzers fell short, and while one of the shells harmlessly exploded against a tree, the other landed just {{to the right of the}} 5 Platoon headquarters, killing two men and wounding eight others, including six of the seven reinforcements from 6 Platoon. Following an urgent radio call from O'Halloran, the artillery ceased fire. Shortly afterwards an RPG round hit the same area, wounding McCullough.|$|E
