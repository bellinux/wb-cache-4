The importance of lexical stress as a determining factor word internally has either been acknowledged [1], or suggested [2]. There is much <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>word</b> internal contexts, but limited work across word boundaries. I examined word final intervocalic [] in non-rhotic English speech, with Electro-magnetic Articulography (EMA) using car out and peer out for stimuli, varying the emphatic stress environment. For two speakers, the lingual articulators moved more rapidly in the transition from word final [] to the following vowel when the word following was stressed. A Scottish rhotic speaker showed the same effect. The higher velocity suggests the consonant {{is more likely to}} be parsed as a syllable onset. I argue emphatic stress increases tension which accounts for the low velocity observed in tokens where the first word was stressed and that the stiffness parameter (k) of Articulatory Phonology is related to bio-mechanical stiffness...|$|E

Each activity, itself small and relatively unimportant, could escalate through word of mouth to create strong, positive brand images and beliefs. A major characteristic of chaos theory, sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) is at <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>word</b> of mouth. This paper reviews word of mouth literature from a chaos/complexity theory perspective. Using a multiple case study approach, the significance of word of mouth in turbulent markets is assessed. It was found that more successful companies tended to use word of mouth proactively, and that it is an effective marketing tool for turbulent environments. Furthermore, chaos theory is shown as a good lens through which to view word of mouth. This paper is important because word of mouth has had little attention from the academic community, with the exception of electronic or Internet based word of mouth. Furthermore, it suggests an academic theory to underpin word of mouth that has not been considered before. In addition, it is important because, in South Africa and possibly in other under-developed and developing countries, word of mouth is critical to marketing to less sophisticated or literate markets...|$|E

40|$|It is commonplace within most University {{computing}} {{schools to}} find different computer platforms coexisting peacefully with each other. UNIX {{as well as}} Linux workstations, PC’s and Apple Macs all have their place within an educational curriculum. Students generally find themselves using at least two major platforms at different times during a typical undergraduate programme. In distance learning, however, such practice would be considered extravagant with most students only having access to one platform, {{more often than not}} a PC running a version of the Windows Operating System. Lack of access to required hardware can lead to compatibility issues between courses run on-campus and their equivalent courses run offcampus. There are also issues relating to illegal use of software. While every effort is made to ensure the legality of software used on-campus, even a simple request that students submit their <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>Word</b> format can be interpreted as condoning software piracy in countries where legal software is expensive and where ‘bootleg’ copies are easily available.

40|$|Parents {{of small}} deaf {{children}} need guidance on constructing {{home and school}} environments that affect normal language acquisition. They often turn to physicians and spiritual leaders and, increasingly, the internet. These sources can be underinformed about crucial issues, such as matters of brain plasticity connected {{to the risk of}} linguistic deprivation, and delay or disruption in the development of cognitive skills interwoven with linguistic ability. We have formed a team of specialists in education, linguistics, pediatric medicine, and psychology, and at times specialists in theology and in law have joined our group. We argue that deaf children should be taught a sign language in the early years. This does not preclude oral-aural training and assistive technology. With a strong first language (a sign language), the child can become bilingual (with the written form of the ambient spoken language and, perhaps, the spoken form), accruing the benefits of bilingualism. We have published in medical journals, addressing primary care physicians, in a journal with a spiritual-leader readership, and in a health-law journal. Articles in progress address medical educators and practitioners. Team members present findings at conferences, work on lobbying and legislative efforts with the National Association of the Deaf, and spread the word at conferences of target audiences.

40|$|Word {{order is}} a textual means {{available}} to text producers to arrange their messages {{in order to}} convey different communicative functions, the choice of sentence initial position {{being one of the}} strategies commonly used to relay pragmatic or textual functions such as emphasis or topic continuity. In Arabic, the use of an initial pre-verbal constituent determines the difference between two types of sentences: the verbal sentence and the nominal sentence. Adopting the Prague School functional approach to grammar as a framework, this study argues that the position of the initial pre-verbal constituent is decided by textual and extra- textual factors. It examines the mechanism of this interaction and its consequences on word order. Arabic word order however, has generally been studied within the transformational-generative framework using sentence-based grammar; even the few cases of functional studies favour this same type of decontextualized data. Very little work of any real significance has been undertaken that attempts to relate sentence type to context and/or text type. In response to this, the data used in this study is text-based and taken from a variety of sources, and the sentences are analyzed in context. Chapter one outlines the aim of the study and reviews current trends in word order research with special regard to Arabic word order, and attempts to highlight the theoretical and empirical limitations of these approaches. Chapter two gives a detailed presentation of the theoretical framework chosen for the analysis. it introduces the corpus used for the analysis, and explains the general method and principles which govern this analysis. Chapter three is the text analysis proper. After a brief presentation of the source text, its general background and organization, each nominal sentence is analyzed textually, contextually, syntactically and functionally. Chapter four discusses the results of the data analysis. The principles at <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>word</b> order organization in Arabic are determined, particularly of initial position, and therefore the difference between nominal and verbal sentences. The textual and contextual behaviour of the sentence initial pre-verbal constituent is examined allowing conclusions about the information structure of the Arabic sentence to be drawn...|$|E

40|$|Many of Dylan Thomas’s poems {{seem to be}} {{straightforward}} and their meaning quite easy to grasp. Yet other poems {{are not at all}} easily accessible, at least not at a first reading, and puzzle many readers and critics alike. The sonnets of the cycle “Altarwise by owl-light” (Collected Poems, 58 ff.) have an enigmatic quality to them which originates from Thomas’s frequent references to other texts. One of the major and most obvious sources of these intertextual references is the Bible. However, we also find quotations and images from varied works of English and American literature, from legends, from Greek myths, and from American films. A vast majority of the images Thomas takes from foreign texts are not implemented in ‘pure’ form in his sonnets, but in ‘processed’ form: their contexts are changed to give them a new meaning or add a further level of possible interpretation, or they are parodied or used paradoxically. The justification of the existence or non-existence of God or a Divine Being and the position of institutionalised religion or a different creed are two subjects which Thomas had to encounter from early childhood onward. These problems pervade his <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>word</b> and image. They are nourished by the experiences of his early childhood which manifest themselves in the contrast between the devout belief of his mother Florence {{on the one hand and}} the atheism of his father David John on the other. Thomas’s poetry often seems to portray the struggle between these two attitudes. With the help of literature he had read, Thomas attempted to find the solution to an intellectual problem which bothered him almost all his life and which he had never been able to solve. He changed and adopted what he found in foreign literature and art and used it to suit his own purpose and opinion. However, Thomas did not seem quite sure what this opinion actually was, and this accounts for the enigmatic quality of many of his poems. The starting point for my thesis is the state of the art in research on Dylan Thomas. The main part of this thesis is divided into three major sections. The first section is concerned with Thomas’s biography; its subdivisions are designed to illuminate three aspects of Thomas’s life which might prove helpful when approaching the problem of intertextuality in Thomas’s sonnets: his Welsh upbringing, the religious views of those who influenced him while he grew up, and the literature Thomas read during his childhood and early adulthood. The biographical section is followed by a chapter on intertextuality. It deals with the definition of intertextuality, the forms it can take and the consequences it bears for writers and readers. Finally, the third part is concerned with the analysis of Thomas’s sonnet cycle “Altarwise by owl-light”. After each sonnet’s close reading and interpretation, I investigate its relation to its pre-texts, how these pre-texts are used, and what consequences these intertextual references have for the overall religious and anti-religious views presented in the sonnets. There are two categories of intertextual references in the sonnets: the first one are references to authors who struggled with religion as much as Thomas did; the second one comprises a lot of references to texts which contain intertextual references themselves. While the latter is probably done to ‘fit’ into a literary tradition, the former clearly indicates Thomas’s ambivalent attitude towards religion. The sonnet cycle can be interpreted as a disquisition on religion. Thomas creates room for discussing his personal doubts concerning the justification of God’s existence and the position of institutionalised religion. When growing up, we are undeniably influenced by the people who raise and educate us, and thus by their opinions and attitudes. In adolesence or young adulthood, we reflect on these attitudes and opinions we simply accepted when we were younger, and we then either adopt them as well or rebel against them. But even if we chose not to adopt the same spiritual path as the people who raised us, this path was still a part of our upbringing. This is clearly seen in Thomas’s poetry. When he makes fun of characters or stories from the Bible, he still shows how well he knows the Biblical tradition. He may have rebelled against it, but he knew very well what he was rebelling against. Overall, we can say that the “Altarwise by owl-light” cycle is the work of a torn poet. The mood of the sonnets is dark and gloomy. At times, the images and metaphors are so cryptic or even absurd that they are almost impossible to decipher. Sometimes the tone is accusatory, sometimes it is mocking, verging on mean. This is not the work of an artist who has figured it all out; this is the work of a man who is longing for a soothing decision in a conflict. The fact that Thomas refers not only to the Bible but also to several other authors who were in a similar struggle with religion as he was shows his ambivalent attitude towards this conflict which was probably never solved until his death...|$|E
