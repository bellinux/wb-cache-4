40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} {{the efficiency of}} microbial protein synthesis (EMPS) in diets based on highly <b>wilted</b> <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> (GS, 539 g dry matter (DM) per kg) with the supplementation of starch or water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) rich feeds, i. e. maize silage (MS, 391 g kg- 1 DM intake [DMI]), fodder beet (FB, 173 g kg- 1 DMI) or molasses (M, 137 g kg- 1 DMI). All the diets were made isonitrogenous by urea supplementation (14. 0, 4. 0 and 2. 0 g per kg DMI in GS-MS, GS-FB and GS-M diets). In sacco determined crude protein (CP) and organic matter (OM) degradabilities were 756, 800, 778 and 814 (P 0. 05) among the diets (36. 6, 35. 1, 34. 7 and 34. 0 g microbial nitrogen per kg OM apparently digested in the rumen in GS, GS-MS, GS-FB and GS-M diets, respectively). The estimated metabolizable protein supply from GS, GS-MS, GS-FB and GS-M diets amounted to 97, 91, 93 and 86 g kg- 1 DMI, respectively. Apparently, highly wilted GS containing {{a high concentration of}} WSC (91 g kg- 1 DM) supports high EMPS in the rumen and this cannot be improved by the supplementation with starch or WSC rich feeds...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{replacing}} <b>wilted</b> <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> (GS) with pea-barley intercrop silage (PBS) on feed intake, diet digestibility and milk production was studied with 8 multiparous Ayrshire-cows in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square experiment. Proportion of PBS was 0 (PBS 0), 33 (PBS 33), 67 (PBS 67) or 100 (PBS 100) % of silage dry matter (DM). The DM content was 559 and 255 g kg- 1 for GS and PBS. Crude protein content was 131 and 170 g kg- 1 DM, respectively. Pea-barley silage was more extensively fermented than GS with total fermentation acid content of 120 vs. 12 g kg- 1 DM. Silage was fed for ad libitum intake and supplemented {{with on the}} average 13 kg concentrate per day. Silage DM intake was 9. 2 (PBS 0), 9. 7 (PBS 33), 9. 0 (PBS 67) and 7. 1 (PBS 100) kg per day (Pquadr. < 0. 05). The energy corrected milk yield [30. 3 (PBS 0), 29. 8 (PBS 33), 30. 3 (PBS 67), 31. 3 (PBS 100) kg per day] was not significantly affected by the treatment. Milk protein concentration decreased linearly (P < 0. 05) in response to feeding PBS. It is concluded that PBS can replace up to two thirds of wilted, moderate quality GS in the feeding of dairy cows because in this experiment pure pea-barley silage reduced silage intake...|$|E

No significant relation between the degradation rate (%h- 1) and the cell wall content of the silages was found. The soluble and undegradable fractions of the crude protein both increased with an increase in silage cell wall content. The soluble fraction was more closely related to dry matter content and date of harvesting than to cell wall content of the silages.

40|$|Six Friesian heifers (Experiment 1) {{and four}} {{lactating}} dairy cows (83 % Holstein; Experiment 2) were fed ad libitum with direct-cut or <b>wilted</b> <b>grass</b> <b>silage.</b> All animals were fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulae. Extent {{and rate of}} ruminal forage digestibility were measured and chewing behaviour of the animals was recorded. Mean faecal particle size was also determined. Neither the concentration of fermentation products in the silages, i. e. their palatability, nor the rate and extent of ruminal digestion or the extent of particle-size reduction in the digestive tract could explain the increased dry-matter intake of wilted versus direct-cut silage (17. 7 % in heifers and 28. 4 % in lactating cows). The time spent eating per kilogram dry-matter intake was substantially reduced after wilting of the grass prior to ensiling (28 % in heifers and 37 % in lactating cows), but the time spent ruminating was not significantly different between {{the two types of}} silages. It was inferred that ruminating is firmly involved in augmenting functional density of feed particles in the reticulorumen by expelling pockets of air or fermentation gases. This permits sedimentation of the particles and their passage through the reticulo-omasal orifice. As daily chewing capacity of the animals is limited to around 950 min, the farmer can help more efficient eaters by facilitating dry-matter ingestion (wilting, chopping, etc.) and in this way, liberating more time and more jaw movements for ruminating. More direct evidence is needed to ascertain the exact mechanism and the importance of favouring ruminating at the expense of eating activity in relation to rumen fill...|$|E

Our objective {{was to examine the}} effects of fatty acids on energy and N balances, total tract digestibility, and milk fatty acids in wk 7 and 16 and to assess total lactation responses. During balance measurements, fatty acids constituted 4. 1, 6. 8, and 8. 6 % of DM in control, oilseed, and oilseed plus protected fatty acid diets. Fat additions reduced fiber digestion (attributed to oilseed) and, to some degree, DMI and milk yield, but enhanced fat test without affecting protein percentage. Supplementary fat increased the proportion of C 18 : 0 in milk at the expense of short-chain fatty acids. Supplemental oilseed with or without protected fatty acids reduced total heat production by 6 % and reduced heat in excess of maintenance by 8 %. Best estimates of NEL in linted whole cottonseed and of fat in Megalac® were 1. 81 and 5. 69 Mcal/kg of DM. In total lactation, primiparous cows yielded more milk and FCM when fed oilseed plus Megalac® and less of each when fed oilseed alone than controls. In pluriparous cows, milk yield was reduced by 2. 7 kg/d relative to other treatments when oilseed plus Megalac® was fed; FCM yield increased about 2 kg/d only when oilseed was supplemented alone. Overall, data suggest that basal ration fat and oilseed supplementation were too high or that supplementation should have been delayed until feed intake was higher...|$|R

40|$|Maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> are {{commonly}} used as major feed materials for dairy cows in Europe and are becoming common parts of dairy cow rations {{in other parts of}} the world. Thenutritive value of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> varies greatly due to variation in chemical composition. A combination of different factors such as the use of various cultivars, fertilization practices, growing conditions, harvesting technology, maturity at harvest and ensiling conditions cause this variation in chemical composition. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate relationships between the chemical composition and the in situ rumen degradation characteristics and in situ mobile nylon bag digestibility of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> Maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> with a broad range in chemical composition and quality parameters were selected from different Dutch commercial farms. The broad range in the chemical composition of the maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> resulted in a large variation in rumen degradable fractions of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and starch. The intestinal digestibility of CP, NDF and/or starch was affected by the concentration of these components in the maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages,</b> by the rumen incubation time and the rumen escape content. Regression equations were developed describing relationships between the chemical composition and the in situ ruminal and postruminal degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> A number of the developed regression equations presented in this thesis can be used for accurate and rapid estimation of the ruminal and postruminal degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages,</b> without conducting time consuming and expensive in situ experiments. The second aim of this thesis was to determine whether three cows are sufficient to cover the variation between individual cows in in situ rumen degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> Significant differences (P 0. 05) between individual cows were found for all the parameters of DM, OM, CP and NDF. The results suggest that using three cows are sufficient for nylon bag incubations of <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and pooling of rumen incubated residues is allowed to obtain a representative sample. The third aim of this thesis was to compare two fractionation methods; the washing machine method and a modified method, for nitrogen (N) and starch fractions of maize silages and N fractions of <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> The N and/or starch fractions of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> determined, using the washing machine method (washing with water for 40 min) and the modified method (shaking with buffer solution for 60 min) were compared. The different methodological approaches of both methods resulted in different values for the washout (W), the soluble (S) and the non-washout (D+U) fractions of N of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and for the W, the insoluble washout (W-S) and the D+U fractions of starch of maize silages. The loss of insoluble small particles of starch was less during shaking of nylon bags in buffer solution, compared to washing nylon bags in the washing machine. Therefore, large differences were found between the D+U fractions of starch determined by both methods compared to the D+U fractions of N of maize silages. The developed regression equations for W, S and D+U fractions of N in <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> and for D+U fractions of starch in maize silages determined by both methods can be used for rapid estimation of these fractions from chemical characteristics of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> The information on nutrient bioavailability of maize and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> presented in this thesis can be used to more accurately formulate dairy ration in terms of maintenance, health and production of dairy cows...|$|R

Each experimental period lasted for 3 wk. The 4 dietary treatments were PC, 20 h {{of access to}} grazing pasture, supplemented with 6 kg/d of corn-based concentrate mixture (96 % corn; C); PCSB, 20 h of access to grazing pasture, supplemented with 6 kg/d of corn- and SBM-based concentrate mixture (78 % corn and 18 % SBM; CSB); SC, 7 h of access to grazing pasture {{during the day and}} 13 h of ad libitum access to <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> at night, supplemented with 6 kg/d of C concentrate; and SCSB, 7 h of access to grazing pasture during the day and 13 h of ad libitum access to <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> at night, supplemented with 6 kg/d of CSB concentrate. The concentrate mixtures were offered twice each day in the milking parlor and were consumed completely. <b>Grass</b> <b>silage</b> supplementation reduced dietary crude protein and concentration of total sugars, and dietary SBM inclusion increased dietary crude protein concentration and decreased dietary starch concentration. Milk yield and energy-corrected milk were increased by SBM supplementation of cows with access to <b>grass</b> <b>silage.</b> Milk protein concentration was lower in cows offered <b>grass</b> <b>silage,</b> regardless of whether SBM was fed. Dietary SBM inclusion tended to increase milk fat concentration. Plasma urea N was reduced by silage feeding and increased by SBM supplementation.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to elucidate the effects of regrowth <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> and red clover silage on nutrient supply and milk production of dairy cows as compared with primary growth <b>grass</b> <b>silages.</b> In the first experiment (publication I), two primary growth and four regrowth <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> were harvested at two stages of growth. These six silages were fed to 24 lactating dairy cows with two levels of concentrate allowance. Silage intake and energy corrected milk yield (ECM) responses, and the range in these response variables between the diets, were smaller when regrowth silages rather than primary growth silages were fed. Milk production of dairy cows reflected the intake of metabolizable energy (ME), and no differences in the ME utilization {{were found between the}} diets based on silages harvested from primary growth and regrowth. The ECM response to increased concentrate allowance was, on average, greater when regrowth rather than primary growth silages were fed. In the second experiment (publication II), two silages from primary growth and two from regrowth used in I were fed to rumen cannulated lactating dairy cows. Cows consumed less feed dry matter (DM), energy and protein, and produced less milk, when fed diets based on regrowth silages rather than primary growth silages. Lower milk production responses of regrowth <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> diets were mainly due to the lower silage DM intake, and could not be accounted for by differences in energy or protein utilization. Regrowth <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> intake was not limited due to neutral detergent fibre (NDF) digestion or rumen fill or passage kinetics. However, lower intake may be at least partly attributable to plant diseases such as leaf spot infections, dead deteriorating material or abundance of weeds, which are all higher in regrowth compared with primary growth, and increase with advancing regrowth. In the third experiment (publications III and IV), red clover <b>silages</b> and <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> harvested at two stages of growth, and a mixed diet of red clover and <b>grass</b> <b>silages,</b> were fed to five rumen cannulated lactating dairy cows. In spite of the lower average ME intake for red clover diets, the ECM production remained unchanged suggesting more efficient utilisation of ME for red clover diets compared with grass diets. Intake of N, and omasal canal flows of total non-ammonia N (NAN), microbial and non-microbial NAN were higher for red clover than for <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> diets, but were not affected by forage maturity. Delaying the harvest tended to decrease DM intake of <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> and increase that of red clover silage. The digestion rate of potentially digestible NDF was faster for red clover diets than for <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> diets. Delaying the harvest decreased the digestion rate for grass but increased it for red clover silage diets. The low intake of early-cut red clover silage could not be explained by silage digestibility, fermentation quality, or rumen fill but was most likely related to the nutritionally suboptimal diet composition because inclusion of moderate quality <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> in mixed diet increased silage DM intake. Despite the higher total amino acid supply of cows fed red clover versus <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> diets, further milk production responses on red clover diets were possibly compromised by an inadequate supply of methionine as evidenced by lower methionine concentration in the amino acid profile of omasal digesta and plasma. Increasing the maturity of ensiled red clover does not seem to affect silage DM intake as consistently as that of grasses. The efficiency of N utilization for milk protein synthesis was lower for red clover diets than for grass diets. It was negatively related to diet crude protein concentration similarly to <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> diets. ...|$|R

High-sugar grass, control grass, and red clover were ensiled in laboratory silos for use in an in vitro experiment (Exp. 1). For an in vivo experiment (Exp. 2), the same forage types were baled and ensiled. All silages were well preserved; within experiments the <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> had similar composition, except for greater (P < 0. 05) water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations in the high-sugar than the control <b>grass</b> <b>silage.</b> In Exp. 1, high-sugar grass, control grass, and red clover silages were fed alone or as mixtures (30 : 70, 50 : 50, or 70 : 30 on a DM basis, respectively) of each grass with the red clover silage to a simulated rumen culture system. There were no significant differences in microbial N flow or efficiency of microbial protein synthesis between individual forages. However, the corresponding values for the 70 : 30 ratio of high-sugar grass:red clover silage were greater (P < 0. 05) than for the red clover silage. The value for the efficiency of N use (g of microbial N/g of feed N) was greater (0. 86; P < 0. 05) for high-sugar <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> than the control <b>grass</b> <b>silage.</b> In addition, the high-sugar grass:red clover silage mixtures all gave greater (P < 0. 05) values for the efficiency of N use than red clover silage alone; this difference was not achieved with the control grass mixture. Experiment 2 was an incomplete Latin square design conducted with 6 Here-ford x Friesian steers (163 ? 5. 9 kg of BW) with rumen and duodenal cannulas fed the following 5 <b>silage</b> diets: high-sugar <b>grass</b> silage; control grass silage; high-sugar grass and red clover silage (50 : 50 DM basis); control grass and red clover silage (50 : 50 DM basis); and red clover silage. Rumen NH 3 -N concentration was lowest (P < 0. 05) with the high-sugar <b>grass</b> <b>silage.</b> Microbial N flows to the duodenum and efficiency of microbial protein synthesis were greater (P < 0. 05) for steers fed the high-sugar <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> than for control grass and red clover silages, and mixing red clover with <b>grass</b> <b>silages</b> increased (P < 0. 05) these values compared with red clover silage alone.

The studied variables were the performance, plasma concentrations of urea-N, glucose, and creatinine, urine-N and milk urea-N, and the nychthemeral variation in NH 3 -N in the rumen fluid of dairy cows. Nutrient intake, milk production, and milk composition were affected by the treatments. The total mixed ration containing elephant <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> combined with rumen undegradable protein (RUP) provided balanced amounts of carbon and nitrogen in the rumen. This effect may explain the 18 % increase in milk yield compared with the other treatments. The diurnal pattern of ruminal NH 3 -N was interpreted with a sinusoid model.

Ration digestibility and N balance was determined using 7 Holstein Friesian steers (mean body weight 411. 0 +/- 120. 9 kg) in a cross-over design. Inclusion of maize silage in the diet had a positive linear effect on forage and total DM intake (P = 0. 001), and on apparent DM and organic matter digestibility (both P = 0. 048).

40|$|On-farm biogas {{production}} is {{typically associated with}} forage maize as the biomass source. Digesters are designed and operated with the focus of optimising the conditions for this feedstock. Thus, such systems may not be ideally suited to the digestion of grass. Ireland has ca. 3. 85 million ha of grassland. Annual excess grass, surplus to livestock requirements, could potentially fuel an anaerobic digestion industry. Biomethane associated with biomass from 1. 1 % of grassland in Ireland, could potentially generate over 10 % renewable energy supply in transport.

However, comprehensive trace element profiles indicated that cobalt, iron and nickel are deficient in mono-digestion of <b>grass</b> <b>silage</b> at a high organic loading rate (OLR) of 4. 0 kg VS m- 3 d- 1. The addition of a slurry co-substrate was beneficial due to its wealth of essential trace elements.

The concept of demand driven biogas was also examined in a two-phase digestion system (leaching with UASB). When demand for electricity is low it is recommended to disconnect the UASB from the system and recirculate rumen fluid to increase volatile fatty acid (VFA) and soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) production whilst minimising volatile solids (VS) destruction. At times of high demand for electricity, connection of the UASB increases the destruction of volatiles and associated biogas production.
