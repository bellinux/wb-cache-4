40|$|This paper {{uses the}} natural {{experiment}} of displacement {{to test whether}} private sector training acts {{as a source of}} firm-specific human capital. If training reflects only firm-specific skills, workers with employer-paid training should have lower displacement rates than <b>workers</b> <b>without.</b> <b>Training,</b> however, should not alter the likelihood of post-displacement reemployment. The paper uses datasets constructed by linking together Current Population Survey Training and Displaced Worker Supplements from January 1983 & 1984, and 1991 & 1992. In the 1980 s, employer-paid training acted as firm-specific human capital would. Training did not appear to provide firm-specific human capital for women in 1991 - 1992...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} gain {{insights}} into the relationship between growth and unemployment in a setting with heterogeneous skills, human capital accumulation, on-the-job training and capital-skill complementarity. We use an endogenous job destruction framework {{in the style of}} Mortensen and Pissarides (1998) with directed search. We show that when growth accelerates, a larger share of unskilled workers seeks training, increasing firms’ incentives to update job-specific technology (rather than destroying it). By magnifying the impact of growth on employment, the introduction of human capital issues allows the model to more closely match the estimated sensitivity of unemployment with respect to growth. When calibrated, the model manages to reproduce the aggregate capitalization effect estimated using OECD data. We find that growth reduces unemployment for individuals receiving training, while it increases the unemployment rate of unskilled <b>workers</b> <b>without</b> <b>training</b> (creative destruction effect) ...|$|R

40|$|The employment/unemployment {{dichotomy}} is {{not applicable}} to developing countries. Workers who are categorized as “unemployed ” are actually {{employed in the}} informal sector and have a “bad job. ” One key issue facing developing countries is how to generate “good jobs ” in sufficient quantity so as to absorb {{the increasing number of}} people appearing on the labor market. This paper discusses three labor market issues. First, in discussing the link between growth, openness and (good) job creation, the paper makes the point that globalization is beneficial provided that it does not contribute to reducing the labor content of growth. Second, the paper also focuses on the need for supply side policies to complement policies that increase the demand for labor. Unskilled <b>workers</b> <b>without</b> <b>training</b> are less likely to get “good ” jobs. In fact, too few skilled workers may even be an obstacle for growth and the creation of good unskilled jobs. Third, the paper discusses labor market policies and social protection. Policies regulating the (formal) labor market, though they are second-best, should not necessarily be rejected on efficiency grounds if they reduce poverty. The questions to ask are: how much regulation should there be and how can social protection be achieved in economies with large informal sectors? Decoupling as much as possible labor market status and social protection is part of the answer since it reduces the distance between good and bad jobs. It provides better social protection to all workers, independently of where they are employed and increases the number of good jobs by reducing the cost of formal employment. ...|$|R

Findings partly confirm a ‘dualization’ scenario as <b>workers</b> <b>without</b> industry-specific vocational <b>training</b> {{are more likely to}} be on a temporary contract than skilled workers, and the gap has widened over time. However, also skilled workers have become increasingly vulnerable to casualization due to job routine and the erosion of industrial relations. Evidence confirms the crucial role of institutions in supporting the linkage between specific skills and employment stability, and suggests that the liberalization of the employment relationship has the potential to advance also in the core of the German economy...|$|R
40|$|Up {{until now}} {{emotional}} and behavioral disorders in Vocational Schools were only rarely subject of research. Yet {{it is probable that}} these disorders might represent a serious field of problems in such schools. Within the scope of a Pilot Study we explored the pupils of a large Special Educational Vocational school in Bavaria, Germany using Teacher’s Report Form (TRF) and Youth Self Report (YSR) of the Achenbach Scales (CBCL). We were interested in the occurrence of {{emotional and behavioral}} disorders in general, in those specific disorders in the foreground, in differences between some groups of the population and in supplementary qualitative information. Whereas disorder quotas coming from the TRF data were unexpectedly low, YSR data showed just the contrary. The latter findings were supported by the partially impressive qualitative information. Furthermore, differences in the occurrence of disorders between women and men as well as between special subgroups such as young <b>workers</b> <b>without</b> vocational <b>training,</b> persons in courses of vocational preparation and in some various courses of vocational training are being discussed.

The main reasons are the significant shift in favor of secondary service jobs and the rising qualification requirements of all jobs. The expectation is that the demand for <b>workers</b> <b>without</b> a formal <b>training</b> certificate (unskilled workers) will continue to decline, from 23 percent (1987) to about 13 percent in 2010. Job gains are forecast for workers who complete on-the-job or school training. For this level, employment gains in service activities and losses in production jobs will balance each other. Despite an absolute increase in jobs, their share in total employment will stagnate just under 60 percent. Persons in this group who hav...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{simulated}} client (SC) {{method for}} evaluating health worker performance utilizes surveyors who pose as patients to make surreptitious observations during consultations. Compared to conspicuous observation (CO) by surveyors, which is commonly done in developing countries, SC data better reflect usual health worker practices. This information {{is important because}} CO can cause performance {{to be better than}} usual. Despite this advantage of SCs, the method’s full potential has not been realized for evaluating performance for pediatric illnesses because real children have not been utilized as SCs. Previous SC studies used scenarios of ill children that were not actually brought to health workers. During a trial that evaluated a quality improvement intervention in Benin (the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness [IMCI] strategy), we conducted an SC survey with adult caretakers as surveyors and real children to evaluate the feasibility of this approach and used the results to assess the validity of CO. Methods We conducted an SC survey and a CO survey (one right after the other) of health workers in the same 55 health facilities. A detailed description of the SC survey process was produced. Results of the two surveys were compared for 27 performance indicators using logistic regression modeling. Results SC and CO surveyors observed 54 and 185 consultations, respectively. No serious problems occurred during the SC survey. Performance levels measured by CO were moderately higher than those measured by SCs (median CO – SC difference = 16. 4 percentage-points). Survey differences were sometimes much greater for IMCI-trained health workers (median difference = 29. 7 percentage-points) than for <b>workers</b> <b>without</b> IMCI <b>training</b> (median difference = 3. 1 percentage-points). Conclusion SC surveys can be done safely with real children if appropriate precautions are taken. CO can introduce moderately large positive biases, and these biases might be greater for health workers exposed to quality improvement interventions.

In this same vein, many thanks to the eight conference hosts who allowed this research to be conducted {{as part of their}} event. This courtesy gave contact to many individuals directly affected by the regulation. Also thanks to the study Training Research Evaluation Advisory Committee members for the time they took to review the documents and offer suggestions. Last, thanks to those involved in the Environmental Protection Agency convened Worker Protection Standard Focus Group for working together to help implement the Worker Protection Standard and for expressing a desire to review its progress, a thought which helped lead to this study. Requiring Worker Protection Standard worker training is a good start in helping to assure workers are aware of and practice safety around pesticides. It is hoped this document will help make the reality even more effective. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Frailty {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} in elderly people. While significant {{progress has been}} made to understand its pathogenesis process, few validated questionnaire exist to assess the multidimensional concept of frailty and to detect people frail or at risk to become frail. The objectives of this study were to construct and validate a new frailty-screening instrument named Frailty Groupe Iso-Ressource Evaluation (FRAGIRE) that accurately predicts the risk for frailty in older adults. Methods A prospective multicenter recruitment of the elderly patients was undertaken in France. The subjects were classified into financially-helped group (FH, with financial assistance) and non-financially helped group (NFH, without any financial assistance), considering FH subjects are more frail than the NFH group and thus representing an acceptable surrogate population for frailty. Psychometric properties of the FRAGIRE grid were assessed including discrimination between the FH and NFH groups. Items reduction was made according to statistical analyses and experts’ point of view. The association between items response and tests with “help requested status” was assessed in univariate and multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses and a prognostic score to become frail was finally proposed for each subject. Results Between May 2013 and July 2013, 385 subjects were included: 338 (88 %) in the FH group and 47 (12 %) in the NFH group. The initial FRAGIRE grid included 65 items. After conducting the item selection, the final grid of the FRAGIRE was reduced to 19 items. The final grid showed fair discrimination ability to predict frailty (area under the curve (AUC) [*]=[*] 0. 85) and good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P-value[*]=[*] 0. 580), reflecting a good agreement between the prediction by the final model and actual observation. The Cronbach's alpha for the developed tool scored as high as 0. 69 (95 % Confidence Interval: 0. 64 to 0. 74). The final prognostic score was excellent, with an AUC of 0. 756. Moreover, it facilitated significant separation of patients into individuals requesting for help from others (P-value[*]<[*] 0. 0001), with sensitivity of 81 %, specificity of 61 %, positive predictive value of 93 %, negative predictive value of 34 %, and a global predictive value of 78 %. Conclusions The FRAGIRE seems to have considerable potential as a reliable and effective tool for identifying frail elderly individuals by a public health social <b>worker</b> <b>without</b> medical <b>training...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSW (Forensic Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. Child {{sexual abuse}} cases are {{particularly}} important in ensuring that victims and falsely accused individuals are protected and perpetrators are successfully convicted. Recent and continuing increases {{in the number of}} children who allege that they have been victims of sexual abuse have emphasized the need for evaluating the competence and credibility of young witnesses. This research focussed on evaluating the use of a structured, evidence-based interview protocol which can determine whether legal action is required and whether the investigation process is legally sound and scientifically validated. The empirical investigation focused on obtaining data by conducting focus groups. This is called group interviewing, and is considered a qualitative method. An exploratory research design was used to gain insight into the use of the forensic interview that is relatively new and unstudied in South Africa. Two different focus groups were held, one of which consisted of participants with post graduate training in conducting a forensic interview using evidence-based protocols. In contrast, the other focus group participants had no post graduate training, but nevertheless conducted interviews with abused children. It was evident that the social workers who had post graduate training in forensic interviewing and employing a structured evidence-based protocol perceived it to be an indispensable tool. The social <b>workers</b> <b>without</b> post graduate <b>training</b> showed limited knowledge of the structured forensic interview. The outcome of the findings proved the necessity of having a structured evidence-based protocol to conduct forensic interviews. If a forensic interview is used, it is possible to obtain a single, objective, clear picture of the details of the alleged abuse – who abused the child, when and how often, how it occurred and where. The forensic interview can lead to the successful investigation and prosecution of criminal offences that depend on obtaining reliable information from child victims and witnesses. Master...|$|R
