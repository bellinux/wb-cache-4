5|$|This story occurs {{before the}} events of the war that brought the world to ruin; at this point, Yumemi has been working at the Flowercrest Department Store's rooftop planetarium for about ten years. One day, Yumemi begins to act strangely, {{culminating}} in her simply <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> and wandering around the town. The staff of the planetarium are bewildered, and one of the workers—a woman named Satomi Kurahashi—is ordered to go follow Yumemi and bring her back. Before long, Yumemi begins to run out of battery power.|$|E
5|$|Chapman also {{advocated}} {{the use of}} white footballs and numbered shirts, as well as adding hoops to Arsenal's socks {{to make it easier}} for players to pick each other out. He later made a further change to Arsenal's kit, adding white sleeves to the previously all-red shirt and brightening the colour, before a match against Liverpool on 4 March 1933; the same kit theme of red with white sleeves or trim survives to this day. The tradition of both teams <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> together at the FA Cup Final was started in 1930 due to Herbert Chapman's involvement with both clubs, and has continued since.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{were held}} {{during the second}} wave of strikes, when Brendan Barber {{announced}} {{on the afternoon of}} Friday 30 October that proposals had been put to both Royal Mail and the CWU for them to consider over the weekend. Talks resumed on the Monday, however this news was overshadowed by the announcement that a further two days of strikes would be held on Friday 6 November and Monday 9 November. It was also announced that these would be all out strikes with everybody <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> at the same time rather than the rolling strike action that had been adopted previously, thus leading to a complete stoppage throughout the course of the action. These were later called off in order for further talks to take place.|$|E

5|$|Miller's love of horseracing then {{interfered}} with his quest. Wanting {{to attend an}} afternoon race meeting, he opened the batting in the morning against Cambridge University. Not intending to play a long innings, he attacked the bowling and was out for 20, before heading for the track. He stayed at the track until late afternoon, and returned to find the Australians <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> to field. This {{was followed by a}} match against the MCC at Lord's where he took four wickets of English Test players. Miller then took match figures of 5/27 against Oxford University. In the match against Essex, Miller pulled rib muscles, meaning he could not bowl in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He scored 55 and five in a rain-affected draw.|$|E
5|$|Specifically, {{the video}} {{opens with a}} boy with a {{basketball}} in his bag <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> of a car park. The basketball then begins to bounce out of the bag, jumps out of the city streets and gets into a Lada taxi. After that, it continues to bounce and causes troubles in an office. Its owner struggles to chase the ball but then manages to catch it for a second. Unfortunately, the ball escapes and is run over by a truck driven by The Chemical Brothers. The basketball re-inflates after the accident, jumps into and eventually gets trapped inside an old phone booth near Baross Street, swells to an enormous size, and explodes.|$|E
5|$|The band {{embarked}} {{on what would}} become a 103 show world tour {{in support of the}} album {{over a period of several}} months in 1995 and 1996. The tour started on 22 June 1995 with a pre-Glastonbury festival warm up gig at the 1,400 capacity Bath Pavilion, which featured the debut of new drummer Alan White and several new songs off the album, and ended on 4 December 1996 at the 11,800 capacity Mayo Civic Centre in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, and included concerts at Earls Court in November 1995 and Cardiff International Arena in March 1996. The tour had many disruptions and cancellations due to Noel twice <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> of the group, and Liam pulling out of a US leg.|$|E

5|$|Tina later {{credited}} the Nichiren Buddhist {{faith and}} chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo with {{giving her the}} courage to strike out on her own. However, by <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> on Ike {{in the middle of}} a tour, she learned she was legally responsible to tour promoters for the canceled shows. After a year in court, their divorce was made final on March 29, 1978. In the divorce, she completely parted ways with him, retaining only her stage name and assuming responsibility for the debts incurred by the canceled tour as well as a significant Internal Revenue Service lien.|$|E
5|$|As Harry learns {{more about}} his great enemy, the love lives of the main {{characters}} start to become more active. Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after learning from his sister Ginny that Hermione had previously kissed Viktor Krum, Ron shuns her. Harry's attempts to repair things between the two fail, resulting in Ron going out with Lavender Brown and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees {{the two of them}} <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> of the boys dormitories together. However, this was only because she hadn't noticed Harry walking ahead of them. Harry develops feelings for Ginny, but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Quidditch victory Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship, with Ron's reluctant consent.|$|E
5|$|Assigned male at birth, she {{was given}} the name Joshua Alcorn and raised in Ohio by a family {{affiliated}} with the Churches of Christ movement. At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy {{with the intention of}} convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her gender as assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She committed suicide by <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> in front of oncoming traffic on the Interstate 71 highway.|$|E

Hysteria erupts, and Michael becomes {{self-conscious}} over the commotion he has caused. He goes outside to fix the cable. There he is discovered by Erin, who throughout the evening {{has been trying to}} encourage Michael to bond with Gabe. Michael, still indignant over the idea that his office views Gabe as his boss, is initially irritated by her efforts, but eventually realizes that Erin views him as a father figure. He jokes around and tells her to go to her room, leading to a bonding moment between the two. As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke by threatening to kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the inquiry}} opened, a poll was {{conducted}} in Tunstall where ratepayers of the town showed themselves to be in favour of federation. As the council itself had voted against federation, it decided not to oppose or support federation but instead to achieve the best deal it could for the town. The three-day inquiry opened on 8 January 1908 and was chaired by Major Norton, {{an officer of the}} Local Government Board. Norton's appointment itself caused controversy with the delegation from Burslem <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> on the first day protesting that Norton had already declared himself in favour of federation. The walkout did not disrupt the hearing but left only Fenton and Staffordshire County Council opposed to the plan, with Tunstall neutral and Hanley, Stoke and Longton in favour. The bulk of the inquiry examined rating schemes based largely on the Owen or Geen proposals from the previous federation attempt.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm tells Adrienne about {{a ritual}} that can {{eradicate}} the demon. Harriet, fearing for her safety, decides {{to leave with}} Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic. The next day, Adrienne is attacked by Don, who is now completely insane and dressed like Carno. Adrienne scars Don's face with acid from his darkroom and then flees, discovering the corpses of Mike, Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion. Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the throne, but she distracts him long enough to free herself and trigger the swinging axe, which impales and kills Don. His death unleashes the demon, a huge and murderous monster that pursues Adrienne through the mansion. She escapes long enough to perform a ritual that traps the demon once again. The game ends with Adrienne <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> of the mansion with a vacant stare, almost catatonic.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{and since}} we left Turin, {{everywhere}} in Italy we have found summer, summer--not a fire have we needed even in Florence. Such mornings, such evenings, such <b>walkings</b> <b>out</b> in the dusk, such sunsets over the Arno! ah, Mr. Kenyon, you in England forget what life is in this out-of-door fresh world, with your cloistral habits and necessities! I assure you I can't help fancying that the winter is over and gone, the past looks so cold and black in the warm light of the present. We have had some rain, but at night, and only thundery frank rains which made the next day warmer, and I have all but lost my cough, and am feeling very well and very happy.|$|R

5|$|On {{an episode}} of Colt Cabana's Art of Wrestling podcast {{released}} in November 2014, Punk broke his silence regarding his exit from WWE. In a detailed interview, Punk {{said that he was}} suspended for two months after <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> on the company in January and that after the suspension ended, nobody from WWE contacted him. He also told that when he reached out to them for unpaid royalties, he was given a run-around by company executives until he was handed his termination papers and was fired by WWE on his wedding day in June 2014. The manner of firing was the last straw for Punk, stating that he would never return to WWE and that following a legal settlement with WWE, there would be no further working relationship between them. The settlement included Punk giving WWE permission to sell his remaining merchandise.|$|E

5|$|Born in England, Brooks {{emigrated to}} Australia {{as a toddler}} and started {{swimming}} lessons after nearly drowning in a childhood accident. After initially being known for his lack of technique, Brooks quickly rose through the youth ranks. Brooks made his debut at the Australian Championships in 1976, {{but it was not}} until 1979 that he medalled at national level and made his debut for Australia at a FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) Swimming World Cup meet. In 1980, he gained prominence by breaking the Australian record in the 100m freestyle and being invited to a national team camp. There he had his first clash with officialdom, <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> after accusing the officials of neglecting him. He then qualified for the Australian team for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, defying political pressure to boycott the Games in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Arriving in Moscow, Brooks' experience in the 100m freestyle was an unpleasant one, suffering an asthma attack and missing the final. The peak of his swimming career came in the 4100m medley relay, when he caught and passed the Soviet Union's Sergey Kopliakov during the anchor leg to seal a narrow victory for Australia. This victory remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at Olympic level.|$|E

5|$|In early 2015, the two again began {{showing signs}} of tension between them - with Stardust {{becoming}} further entrenched in his gimmick, leaving Goldust to {{have to try to}} communicate with his brother, Cody; through his new entity. Stardust would respond to this by <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> on Goldust before their match had concluded on the February 5 episode of SmackDown. On the February 16th edition of Raw - {{for the first time since}} their debut, Dusty Rhodes returned to speak to his sons as a way to commiserate and smooth out the problems they were having. Though at first Cody seemed to be in agreement with his family, after Goldust took the loss for his team against The New Day, Stardust hit his old finisher Cross-Rhodes thus dissolving their partnership entirely. After, when Dusty approached Stardust backstage, Stardust claimed that it was he and his brother that were responsible for the pressure Cody was subjected to from a young age. He then stated that Cody, and now his own family, were dead to him. A match between the two was set for Fastlane with Goldust promising to vanquish Stardust once and for all and to reclaim his brother and rekindle their partnership and brotherhood. Due to their father asking Goldust not to cause any real harm to Cody, Goldust won their first encounter via roll-up. Backstage, Stardust viciously assaulted Goldust and again proclaimed it was his family's fault for his mental decline.|$|E
5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> of her house hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down {{the window of a}} black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E
