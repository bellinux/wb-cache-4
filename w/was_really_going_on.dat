500|$|Sex is now {{considered}} a bold, post-feminist, work of art, besides being labeled a [...] "cultural book". Martin Amis from The Observer wrote an essay discussing the book's cultural meaning. Critical theorist Douglas Kellner affirmed that with Sex [...] "Madonna became herself, an artifact of pop culture". French academic writer Georges Claude Guilbert (author of three books about Madonna) described Sex {{as one of the}} most successful publicity stunts in history whereas Russell W. Belk, author of Handbook of Qualitative Research Methods in Marketing, mentioned that the book is a quality product in marketing. In 1992, Madonna had generated more than US$500million ($ in [...] dollars) to Time Warner in sales of both albums and the Sex book, despite the negative feedback. However, Taraborrelli commented in his book, , that those [...] "who knew Madonna well at that time, knew what <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> with her: the Sex book—and the outrageous antics that preceded it and would follow it—was really just something she used as a barrier between her and the rest of the world." [...] For years it had seemed to Madonna that both her personal and professional life was extremely scrutinized by the public and media, and although she had started this scrutinizing by her provocative works, she was tired of it. Being vexed at this interest in her personal life, Madonna fought back by creating the persona of a renegade, something so outrageous as to defy explanation, something found objectionable by most people. Taraborrelli said that in Madonna's view, [...] "she had no other way of fighting back". The Boston Globes Matthew Gilbert analyzed the singer's provocative attempt in an article published in the newspaper: ...|$|E

Rowling said [...] "the series is built around [...] ", and maintained that she always knew what Snape {{would turn out to be}} at the end and that she carefully plotted his storyline throughout the series. [...] "I had to drop clues all the way through because as you know in the seventh book when you have the revelation scene where everything shifts and you realise...what Snape's motivation was. I had to plot that through the books because at the point where you see what <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> it would have been an absolute cheat on the reader at that point just to show a bunch of stuff you've never seen before."

2500|$|General Murray {{also worked}} for a {{division}} of Lockheed Skunk Works. He {{was assigned to the}} project development of [...] "The Black Missile". This was the first missile that was undetectable by radar. It was being built in a large tan-colored hangar located on the north corner of The Burbank Airport, located in Burbank, California. The hangar was owned by Lockheed Skunk Works Division. It was accessed via San Fernando Rd. This hangar was not the typical hangar. It was larger than normal and heavily guarded. There were no signs of what <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> there. General Murray worked there daily, entering the door {{on the west side of}} the hangar. He explained, upon entering the hangar there was an enormous black curtain that was drawn across the center of the hangar, splitting the work space. He stayed on his side and the other workers stayed on their side. They never saw each other or looked beyond the curtain. General Murray was advised that the other side of the curtain contained a highly classified development, as his project wasn't classified enough. Years later, General Murray discovered what was going on behind the curtain. He was told the first stealth aircraft was in its early stages of development and testing. Murray declined to speak about which aircraft. The hangar was torn down in the year 2002, closing another door to an amazing piece of history.|$|E
2500|$|Brown {{was one of}} {{the first}} Catholic {{scholars}} in the United States to use the historical-critical method to study the Bible. In 1943, reversing the approach that had existed since Providentissimus Deus fifty years earlier, Pius XII's encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu expressed approval of historical-critical methods. For Brown, this was a [...] "Magna Carta for biblical progress." [...] In 1965, at the Second Vatican Council, the Church moved further in this direction, adopting the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation Dei verbum, instead of the conservative schema [...] "On the Sources of Revelation" [...] that originally had been submitted. While it stated that Scripture teaches [...] "solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation," [...] Brown points out the ambiguity of this statement, which opened the way for a new interpretation of inerrancy by shifting from a literal interpretation of the text towards a focus on [...] "the extent to which it conforms to the salvific purpose of God." [...] He saw this as the Church [...] "turning the corner" [...] on inerrancy, while adopting a face-saving wording: [...] "the Roman Catholic Church does not change her official stance in a blunt way. Past statements are not rejected but are requoted with praise and then reinterpreted at the same time. ... What <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> was an attempt gracefully to retain what was salvageable from the past and to move in a new direction at the same time." [...] While the document cited the two earlier encyclicals, it was clear to observers that much had changed. The Second Vatican Council, one scholar observed, “raised biblical exegesis from the status of second-class citizenship to which it had been reduced among Catholics by an overreaction to the Protestant claim for its autonomy.” ...|$|E

He, who could weep over all his other griefs as easily and as spontaneously as a woman, had not shed a tear since the fatal day when he had discovered that his brother had played him false--that brother who had been the god of his idolatry, the sacred object of his gratitude and his love! When a man of Oscar's temperament becomes frozen up for days together in his own thoughts--when he keeps his own counsel; when he asks for no sympathy, and utters no complaint--the sign is a serious one. There are hidden forces gathering in him which will burst their way to the surface--for good or for evil--with an irresistible result.

But I object that that was only the futile fancy of a gentleman of leisure. What <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> was the gathering up of the Macedonian power to smash through Greece, and then make Greece conquer Asia. Your literature and philosophy are really just the private entertainment of old gentlemen out of the hurly-burly and ambitious young men too delicate to hunt or shoot. Thought is nothing in the world until it begins to operate in will and act, and the history of mankind doesn't show now, and it never has shown, any consecutive relation to human thinking.

6000|$|Her visitor, {{settled on}} a small sofa that, with a palm-tree, a screen, a stool, a stand, a bowl of flowers and three {{photographs}} in silver frames, had been arranged near the light wood-fire as a choice [...] "corner"--Maud Blessingbourne, her guest, turned audibly, though at intervals neither brief nor regular, the leaves of a book covered in lemon-coloured paper and not yet despoiled of a certain fresh crispness. This effect of the volume, for the eye, would have made it, as presumably the newest French novel--and evidently, from {{the attitude of the}} reader, [...] "good"--consort happily with the special tone of the room, a consistent air of selection and suppression, one of the finer aesthetic evolutions. If Mrs. Dyott was fond of ancient French furniture and distinctly difficult about it, her inmates could be fond--with whatever critical cocks of charming dark-braided heads over slender sloping shoulders--of modern French authors. Nothing had passed for half an hour--nothing at least, to be exact, but that each of the companions occasionally and covertly intermitted her pursuit in such a manner as to ascertain the degree of absorption of the other without turning round. What their silence was charged with therefore was not only a sense of the weather, but a sense, so to speak, of its own nature. Maud Blessingbourne, when she lowered her book into her lap, closed her eyes with a conscious patience that seemed to say she waited; but it was nevertheless she who at last made the movement representing a snap of their tension. She got up and stood by the fire, into which she looked a minute; then came round and approached the window as if to see what <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> At this Mrs. Dyott wrote with refreshed intensity. Her little pile of letters had grown, and if a look of determination was compatible with her fair and slightly faded beauty, the habit of attending to her business could always keep pace with any excursion of her thought. Yet she was the first who spoke.|$|E
