In some areas of inquiry more than others, history and artifact must be at each other's service because neither alone can begin to suffice. Such is the case with the 300 -year period {{in the area of the}} Red River delta and adjacent Thanh-hoa Province in northern Viet-Nam, the cradle of the Vietnamese nation, between the middle of the third century B. C. and the revolt of the Trung Sisters in A. D. 40. It is a period which poses a number of highly interesting theoretical problems for the historian and philologist, and recent developments in archaeology have contradicted older biblio-centric and sinocentric notions (the two often go hand in hand) to the extent that a thorough reexamination is in order. As a preliminary step in that direction, this article aims at outlining the sociohistorical situation of Viet-Nam when the first extensive im-position of Chinese power on the area began. The object of the exercise is threefold: first, to point out what I believe are certain important historical implications of recent ar-chaeological activity; second, to suggest a few notions of a theoretical nature which might address those historical implications; and third, to set the stage for a more extensive ex-position at a later date of the development of Viet-Nam under Chinese hegemony from the first to the tenth centuries. I should like to indulge in a short digression before examining the specifics of the case.

40|$|High {{natural gas}} prices and {{domestic}} energy security concerns {{have led to a}} resurgent interest in substitute natural gas (SNG). This technology, which dates back several decades, is currently only utilized in one location in the U. S., though perhaps a dozen more are on the drawing board. This study evaluates the economic climate for plants in the U. S. Major factors of SNG viability such as coal prices, gas prices, and construction costs, are examined to {{set the stage for the}} analysis. Current technology and policy is then used to evaluate SNG in the context of recent {{natural gas prices}}. Two major viewpoints were considered in this sensitivity analysis – the savings to the end user from locking in the contract price, and the returns to the developer of the plant. In order for an SNG plant to be built, both parties must have a reasonable certainty of economic benefit. 	The results indicated a marginal environment for the long-term contracts that are necessary to finance these plants. Consumer savings scenarios changed drastically during the 3 -month period of this study. Initial projected savings of over 30 % fell to a loss of 9 %, far short of the minimum 25 % estimated savings required. This was a result of a significant drop in gas prices, and served to illustrate the consumers need for a large discount over spot prices to mitigate their price risk. As far as developers are concerned, an $ 8 price of gas was determined to be financially marginal, with returns of 8 % predicted. Rising plant costs would tend to put upward pressure on this price point, driving even higher minimum selling prices. 	In addition, if one adds the consumers need for a 25 % discount to the developers minimum price level of $ 8, it appears that at least $ 11 gas is required to satisfy both parties. The current climate of $ 8 gas thus look unfavorable to the development of SNG contracts, with the exception of potential site locations in regions of high gas prices, cheap coal, or more direct access to end users with the increased value capture that entails. While concerns about high gas prices and energy security <b>will</b> <b>not</b> likely <b>go</b> <b>away</b> any time soon, the time is not yet ripe for SNG development...|$|R

In the course of his travels he hears that the chief of Lada village has a daughter who is the living embodiment of goddess Lakshmi. He decides to see her in person. He disguised as a Sanskrit pundit (scholar) and was wonderstruck by her beauty and grace and decides to adopt her as his daughter. However, her father, the village chief, <b>will</b> <b>not</b> let her <b>go</b> <b>away</b> and the king decides to let Bhadu stay in the village. He decides to provide her the benefits of a royal princess. Dhruvachand stays behind to oversee her education. Bhadu's new identity, as a royal princess, is kept secret. Bhadu is very popular among the village people because she works actively for their betterment. Then she meets Anjan, son of the doctor (kaviraj) in the neighbouring village. They fall in love, much to the dismay of Dhruvachand. In the meantime the British imprison the king because of his active involvement in the popular uprising of 1857. He is, however, later released. When he hears about Bhadu's involvement with Anjan, he orders the latter's capture and secret imprisonment. Bhadu is heartbroken and, together with two of her companions, travels across the kingdom singing songs at the gates of various forts in which Anjan may be imprisoned, hoping that he will recognize her voice and respond. The king relents and Anjan is released, but by then Bhadu has disappeared. Her companions report that one morning she seemed to fade away, merging with the sky. Village women continue to sing the songs that Bhadu first sang in the fruitless search for her lover.|$|R
