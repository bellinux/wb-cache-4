5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and the plants often labelled. They were botanical gardens {{in the sense of}} building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although their collection policies were determined by those in day-to-day charge of them. They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and <b>were,</b> <b>indeed,</b> often under general parks administrations.|$|E
5|$|After the {{constitutional}} revolution in 1821, the Austrian Empire made political manouvres to exclude Carlo Alberto from the succession line, in hope to substitute him with Francesco IV d'Asburgo-Este.

In fact, there is evidence indicating that Guðrøðr and Muirchertach <b>were</b> <b>indeed</b> at odds {{at some point in the}} 1150s or 1160s, as the former appears to have briefly gained the kingship of Dublin at the expense of Muirchertach's authority as overlord.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{his major}} {{interest}} was {{the theory of}} the continuous spectrum and his first published paper, in 1926, concerned the quantum theory of molecular band spectra.

His calculations accorded with observations of the X-ray absorption of the sun, but not helium. Years later it was realized that the sun was largely composed of hydrogen and that his calculations <b>were</b> <b>indeed</b> correct.|$|E

In 1945, when American physicist Glenn T. Seaborg and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium, he realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row, instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium filling a fourth d-block row.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the early}} eighteenth century, hunting was mostly by {{indigenous}} Indonesians. Legend has it that sometime in the early eighteenth century, around 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising for right whales near shore, was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one. Although the story may not be true, sperm whales <b>were</b> <b>indeed</b> soon exploited by American whalers.

The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops <b>were</b> <b>indeed</b> largely taken by surprise when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion.

Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on by the executive in the exercise of discretion <b>were</b> <b>indeed</b> within the scope of section 8.|$|E

Rowell spent five years with the British Army or at British staff colleges, establishing valuable contacts with his British counterparts.

5|$|Cole {{completely}} reprinted {{the minutes}} of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of December 23, 1820, which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on November 5, 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small {{hole in the wall}} of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of December 20, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson’s Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages <b>were</b> <b>indeed</b> discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{has been}} going on about whether the tail spikes were used for display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted the tail was likely to have been much more {{flexible}} than that of other dinosaurs, as it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon. However, as Carpenter has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack. More recently, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney et al., which showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage, lends more weight to the position that the spikes <b>were</b> <b>indeed</b> used in combat. This study showed that 9.8% of Stegosaurus specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes. Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an Allosaurus into which a tail spike fits perfectly.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs diverged {{from their}} archosaur {{ancestors}} {{during the middle}} to late Triassic period, roughly 20million years after the Permian–Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators. The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals <b>were</b> <b>indeed</b> small, bipedal predators. Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago, as evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period, though known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives.|$|E
