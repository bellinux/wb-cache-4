5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved for those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option for those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E

5|$|Subclinical {{hypothyroidism}} is a milder form of hypothyroidism {{characterized by}} an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This milder form of hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic {{signs and symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared with those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> have antibodies.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundTo {{determine}} {{differences among}} persons who provided blood specimens for HIV testing {{compared with those}} <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> among those interviewed for the population-based Zimbabwe Young Adult Survey (YAS). MethodsChi-square analysis of weighted data to compare demographic and behavioral data of persons interviewed who provided specimens for anonymous testing with those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> Prevalence estimation to determine the impact if persons not providing specimens had higher prevalence rates than those <b>who</b> <b>did.</b> ResultsComparing those <b>who</b> provided specimens with those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> {{there was no significant}} difference by age, residence, education, marital status, perceived risk, sexual experience or number of sex partners for women. A significant difference by sexual experience was found for men. Prevalence estimates <b>did</b> <b>not</b> change substantially when prevalence was assumed to be two times higher for persons not providing specimens. ConclusionWhen comparing persons who provided specimens for HIV testing with those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not,</b> few significant differences were found. If those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> provide specimens had prevalence rates twice that of those <b>who</b> <b>did,</b> overall prevalence would not be substantially affected. Refusal to provide blood specimens <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear to have contributed to an underestimation of HIV prevalence...|$|R

30|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} myomectomy as a therapy for infertility and to define the factors that influence reproductive outcome, a retrospective study of a case series is summarised. To assess the role of leiomyomas and their surgical removal on pregnancy rates, 212 women who were investigated for infertility were studied. Patients were divided according to case control criteria as those who underwent laparoscopic removal of myomas (106) and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> (106); both groups were compared with 106 women with unexplained infertility without myomas. Of the 318 women, 83 (26 %) became pregnant and delivered live infants. The 44 (42 %) who underwent surgical removal of leiomyomas had higher delivery rates than 12 (11 %) <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> undergo surgery (P[*]<[*] 0.001) and 27 (25 %) <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have myomas (P[*]<[*] 0.001). Patients whose myomas were not surgically treated had fewer deliveries than women <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have myomas (12 vs. 27, P[*]<[*] 0.002). Fifteen women had spontaneous abortions before week 12 : 3 (3 %) who had surgery, 10 (9 %) <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have surgery, and 2 (2 %) <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have myomas. The conclusion of this study emphasised that myomectomy improved pregnancy rates over nonsurgical management of myomas [46].|$|R
