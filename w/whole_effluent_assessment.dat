40|$|The {{release of}} {{hazardous}} substances {{to the environment}} from industrial activities in Sweden is heavily restricted due to pieces of legislation such as the Industrial Emissions Directive (2010 / 75 /EU). In the directive, the <b>whole</b> <b>effluent</b> <b>assessment</b> (WEA) methodology is included as a suitable approach to characterization of effluent waters. The use of WEA methods {{in the evaluation of}} treatments for complex effluent waters has great advantages when comparing to using chemical analysis of individual substances alone. In this comparative study the WEA methodology of combining toxicity testing with chemical analysis was applied to evaluate the performance, stability and safety of four stormwater filter types in comparison with the conventional filter material active carbon. The filter materials were the two sorbent filter materials pine bark and polonite; and the two combination filters pine bark/polonite (filtration through pine bark followed by filtration through polonite) and polonite/pine bark (filtration through polonite followed by filtration through pine bark). The stormwater treated in the study was sampled from two points at a metals manufacturing site in mid-Sweden. A preliminary analysis of the water showed high concentrations of heavy metals and in particular of Zn, with concentrations exceeding 36 mg/L. The stormwater pH was neutral (7. 5) and suspended solids content was approximately 130 mg/l. Samples of the stormwater, corresponding to ten filter bed volumes, were filtered through a pilot-scale 250 ml filter columns with the four filters or activated carbon. The filtered water samples were analysed for Zn and pH. An aquatic ecotoxicity test battery was used to measure acute and chronic toxic effects of the untreated and treated stormwater samples. The test battery assessed luminescent bacteria acute toxicity (30 -min Microtox® ISO 11348 - 3 using Vibrio fischeri), growth inhibition of the green unicellular algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and genotoxicity with the bacterial umu assay using Salmonella typhimurium TA 1535 /pSK 1002 (ISO 13829). The pine bark sorbent showed the highest average Zn removal efficiency of the single filter materials after activated carbon. The results from the stormwater filtration with combination materials were difficult to interpret. All filter types, except pine bark, increased pH of the treated waters > 9. Pine bark lowered the pH of the treated water below 5 even after filtration of 10 bed volumes of stormwater. Although pH of the treated waters was only adjusted for the Microtox test, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the response of this test and the algal assay. Activated carbon showed the highest reduction of Zn contamination and toxicity of the treated waters. There was no significant correlation between the level of zinc contamination and toxic response of the treated waters. Although pine bark lowered pH significantly, in comparison to the other filter types, there was no significant correlation between the pH and the toxic response of the filtered waters. CLEA...|$|E

Given this, we highlight an alternative approach to assess potential toxicity of desalination outfalls. Specifically, we review three recent case studies from Australia in which simulated <b>whole</b> <b>effluents</b> were used in toxicity assessments before desalination plants were constructed. This approach enabled potential toxic effects of wastewater to be considered before the plants became operational and, in one case, even facilitated consideration of potential effects of different treatment processes and suppliers.

40|$|<b>Whole</b> <b>effluent</b> <b>assessments</b> (WEA) {{are being}} {{investigated}} as potential tools for controlling aqueous industrial discharges and minimizing environmental impact. The present study investigated how toxicity {{and the presence}} of potentially bioaccumulative substances altered when refinery effluents were subjected to biodegradation tests. Three petrochemical effluents were assessed, two freshwater and one saline, and subjected to two different types of biodegradation tests, resembling either a ready style (dissolved organic carbon (DOC) -die away) or an inherent style (Zahn-Wellens) test and the toxicity and potential to bioaccumulate parameters were re-analysed during and after biodegradation. A high proportion of the potentially bioaccumulative substances (PBS) in these effluents was easily biodegradable. Biodegradation not only lowered the PBS concentration but also toxicity. Appropriate controls are required however, as some increases in toxicity were observed after 4 h. In the present study, six other petrochemical effluents were also assessed for their PBS content and toxicity to increase the understanding of the relationship between PBS and toxicity. The results showed that the PBS concentrations in these samples were lower than the estimated benchmarks of acute toxicity for algae, fish and crustacean, although two samples were above the critical PBS values for chronic narcotic toxicity for Daphnia magna, which support the assumption that narcotic effects are mainly responsible for the observed toxicity in refinery effluents. It can be concluded that for facilities processing petroleum products that the measurement of PBS is a suitable surrogate for toxicity tests at the screening stage. Finally, the combination of persistency, bioaccumulation, and toxicity tests was shown to have additional value compared to an approach using only toxicity tests. © 2011 SETAC...|$|R

Toxicity of final effluents from 45 diverse facilities was examined to determine whether inferred toxicity based on presence and concentration of priority substances could predict WET, calculated from a battery of bioassays on bacteria, cladocerans and algae. Following corrections of inferred toxicity for particle-bound contaminants and adjustment for free ion activity, correlation between inferred and <b>whole</b> <b>effluent</b> toxicity was highly significant. Effluents with elevated metal concentrations exhibited lower WET than predicted, likely due to negative interactions among trace metals; kraft mill effluents exhibited higher WET than predicted {{which is consistent with}} findings in the literature. The ability of laboratory WET tests to predict thresholds of invertebrate community response to a complex industrial effluent was examined. Patterns in invertebrate community structure were detrended for environmental factors and compared to measured instream effluent concentrations. Laboratory effect thresholds, reported as Maximum Allowable Toxicant Concentrations (MATC), were calculated from a battery of toxicity tests on bacteria, algae, cladocerans and fish. Declines in taxonomic richness corresponded to calculated lab thresholds, while changes in abundance of total taxa and sensitive taxa, (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) occurred at lower concentrations than predicted from MATCs. The tendency for invertebrate abundance to decline at lower instream effluent concentrations than richness supports findings in the literature.

Estrogens, the primary female sex hormones, {{have been found in}} natural and synthetic forms in effluent and in receiving waters. Field and laboratory studies were carried out to determine if a local WWTP’s effluent affects survival, egg production, and vitellogenin (an egg precursor protein) concentrations in fathead minnows. Results from a 24 -day field study showed no significant difference in survival or egg production between fish caged at sites located upstream and downstream of the WWTP effluent pipe.

40|$|For the {{protection}} of the ecological Reserve in South Africa, the proposed introduction of compulsory toxicity testing in the licensing of effluent discharges necessitates the development of <b>whole</b> <b>effluent</b> toxicity testing. The elucidation of the effects of effluent on the local indigenous populations of organisms is essential before hazard and risk assessment can be undertaken. The limpet Burnupia stenochorias, prevalent in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, was chosen to represent the freshwater molluscs as a potential toxicity indicator. Using potassium dichromate (as a reference toxicant) and a textile <b>whole</b> <b>effluent,</b> the suitability of B. stenochorias was assessed under both acute and chronic toxicity conditions in the laboratory. In support of the toxicity studies, aspects of the biology of B. stenochorias were investigated under both natural and laboratory conditions. Using Principal Component and Discriminant Function Analyses, the relative shell morphometrics of three feral populations of B. stenochorias were found to vary. Length was shown to adequately represent growth of the shell, although the inclusion of width measurements is more statistically preferable. Two of the feral populations, one in impacted water, were studied weekly for 52 weeks to assess natural population dynamics. Based on the Von Bertalanffy Growth Equation, estimates of growth and longevity were made for this species, with growth highly seasonal. Age is not easily discerned from shell size. Egg laying occurred all year round, with early summer (peak egg lay), mid summer (a second, smaller peak in egg lay), and winter (limited presence of eggs) phases. In toxicity testing, consideration is given to the choice of the test organism based on age and sexual development. Consequently, the sexual development of B. stenochorias relative to shell length was determined with the aid of histological examinations of transverse sections of limpets, of all sizes, collected over one year. Limpets less than 3 mm shell length were found to be immature {{in the development of the}} oocytes and spermatozoa, and were later chosen for acute toxicity tests. A laboratory diet was developed, for both culturing and maintaining of the limpets during toxicity tests; however, the diet requires optimisation. Under laboratory conditions, growth was linear, and individual fecundity highly variable. Successful methods for the collection of limpets from naturally occurring populations, and their acclimation to the laboratory were developed. Three B. stenochorias populations, representing different hydrological and water quality conditions, were compared to a laboratory population (maintained for three years) in their responses to the textile <b>whole</b> <b>effluent</b> and potassium dichromate. Under acute conditions, variability of mortality between limpet populations and between seasons was consistent with acceptable international standards. However, seasonal differences between feral limpets were apparent, with early summer limpets significantly more susceptible to both potassium dichromate and textile effluent than winter limpets. Although mortality occurred within the effluent at all concentrations, no 96 hour LC₅₀ values were obtained. The chronic toxicity effects of the textile <b>whole</b> <b>effluent</b> were assessed over the entire life cycle of B. stenochorias, based on survival, growth and reproductive effects. Lower concentrations of effluent (# 10 %) gave greater variability of responses and toxicity than higher concentrations, with a 43 day LC₅₀ of 3. 9 % effluent. The No Observed Effect Concentrations for survival (over 43 days) were calculated in consecutive years as 0. 1 % and 1 % effluent. Survival is considered a useful tool for determining toxicity endpoints using B. stenochorias. Limpet growth remained linear in effluent, with an apparent stimulation of growth at the 3 - 10 % effluent concentration, confusing the toxicity and variability assessments. The possible addition of nutrients from the effluent points to either a potential inadequacy of the food quality provided in the chronic assessment, or the presence in the effluent of growth stimulants. Growth was also found to be too variable to allow adequate statistical conclusions about the toxicity of the effluent, although it is suggested that growth may be useful in the assessment of single compounds. Despite large individual variability in fecundity, statistical differences were discernible between effluent concentrations. The application of fecundity of B. stenochorias in hazard assessment therefore warrants further investigation. It was concluded that an <b>assessment</b> of textile <b>whole</b> <b>effluent</b> toxicity to B. stenochorias over an entire life cycle, and an F 1 generation, is unnecessary. The development of the bucket/plastic bag method for both acute and chronic toxicity assessment of B. stenochorias was useful. In the final assessment of the usefulness of B. stenochorias as a toxicity indicator, toxicity endpoints were compared with those of the standard laboratory organism Daphnia pulex. Both in acute and chronic toxicity, B. stenochorias was found to be more sensitive. B. stenochorias is therefore considered valuable as a South African freshwater molluscan ecotoxicological indicator, with a place in hazard assessment, although further development and research is necessary before the limpet can be effectively used...|$|R

40|$|The {{biological}} {{integrity of}} aquatic ecosystems has become {{threatened by the}} effects of high nutrient loads, inorganic and organic chemicals. The effect of these xenobiotics needs to be investigated by the application of biotests in <b>whole</b> <b>effluent</b> toxicity testing and biomarkers in active biomonitoring. <b>Whole</b> <b>effluent</b> toxicity (WET) testing determines the toxicity/effect of <b>whole</b> <b>effluent</b> on aquatic organisms. Sub-lethal effects can be determined by analysing the levels of subcellular/physiological indicators/enzymes in aquatic organisms exposed to in situ conditions. The procedure used for in situ assessments was active biomonitoring (ABM). The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the instream health of a known contaminated system (Rietvlei Wetland System, Gauteng, South Africa) using WET and ABM methodologies. Three sites in the Rietvlei Wetland System were selected and sampling was undertaken during high flow (April 2003) and low flow (August 2003) periods. The ABM sampling protocol involved the deployment of aquatic molluscs (Melanoides tuberculata) and fish (Oreochromis mossambicus) for a period of four weeks at the sites. Following the four week exposure period the organisms were transported back to the laboratory and the following biomarkers were assessed: ethoxyresorufin o-deethylase (EROD), acetylcholine esterase (AChE) and metallothione (MT). Water samples were also collected for WET testing during the low flow period, since this was the only period where mortality was observed in the ABM organisms. Standard WET protocols were used to assess the toxicity of the water from the three sites. These protocols were: 96 h Poecilia reticulata lethality test, 48 h Daphnia pulex lethality test and 72 h Selenastrum capricorutum growth inhibition test. In addition the same biomarker analyses that were done on the ABM organisms were carried out on WET exposed D. pulex and P. reticulata. The WET testing and ABM indicated highest toxicity at Sites 1 and 3. Algal growth inhibition test showed highest stimulation of algal growth at Site 2 and inhibition at Site 3. Sites 1 and 2 showed signs of contamination by organophosphates and carbamates due to elevated AChE and reduced EROD. However there were no significant differences in AChE activity between fish tested in the 96 h toxicity test and those used in ABM. Very low AChE activity was recorded in D. pulex. Snails also had lower AChE activity when compared to the exposed fish species. Metallothionein content was higher in field-exposed fish than those used in WET, however both assessment protocols indicated that Site 3 was affected the greatest by metals. Snails exhibited higher MT content than fish and D. pulex showed no MT activity. There were no significant differences in MT content between the sites. Acetylcholine esterase appears to be a relevant means of investigating biological effects of many neurotoxic contaminants on aquatic habitats and trophic levels. Metallothionein content is a good indicator of toxicity due to heavy metals for active biomonitoring as well as the WET test. Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase is a more difficult biomarker to work with since it shows no differences in activity between control and exposed organisms. The EROD assay does not detect very low levels of EROD induction. Acetylecholinesterase and MT are the recommended biomarker assays for the detection of sublethal responses in the WET laboratory toxicity test. The AChE activities and MT exhibit comparable results in both ABM and WET assessment protocols. In future studies WET testing needs to be complimented with a suite biomarker analyses to determine the type of pollutants in a system and sufficiently describe the pollution status of a system.

40|$|Abstract. In Rajasthan state particularly, textile mills {{represent}} an important economic sector. Pali district in Rajasthan has got {{largest number of}} textile industries in the State i. e. 989 units, mostly engaged in cotton and synthetic textile printing and dyeing. These industries liberate a variety of chemicals, dyes, acids and alkalis besides other toxic compounds like heavy metals, which {{are known for their}} hazardous properties. However, excessive and indiscriminate use of dyestuffs has become increasingly a subject of environmental concern. These dyes can enter the environment through the industrial effluents of dye manufacturing plants and from textile dyeing and printing operations, as wastewater <b>effluents.</b> <b>Assessment</b> of genotoxicity of dyes is therefore of utmost importance. Short-term genetic bioassays have proved to be an important tool in such studies because of their simplicity, sensitivity to genetic damage, speed, low cost of experimentation and small amount of sample required. A total of 7 dyes were tested for their mutagenicity, by Ames assay, using strain TA 100 of Salmonella typhimurium. Only 1 dye, Violet showed absence of mutagenic activity. The remaining 6 dyes were all positively mutagenic...|$|R
30|$|Toxicity tests using Daphnia magna are {{considered}} an effective biological assessment of aquatic environments because of various advantages such as broad distribution, ease of cultivation in laboratory, short life cycle, high reproduction rate, {{and sensitivity to}} toxicants (Farré and Barceló 2003). Indeed, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has standardized the assessment methodology for using Daphnia magna; they suggest the use of <b>whole</b> <b>effluent</b> toxicity test (WET) and toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) methods to estimate the biological assessment of contaminated water such as industrial wastewater and AMD (US Environmental Protection Agency 2002). The WET method is an integrated tool {{used to measure the}} toxicity of wastewater that is comprised of a diverse number of undefined toxicants. In contrast, the TIE method can be used to identify the main cause of toxicity, in which the procedures consist of the fractionation of wastewater by either physical and/or chemical manipulations. Both WET and TIE have been successfully applied to identify toxicants in industrial wastewater and environmental samples (Villamar et al. 2011; de Melo et al. 2013).|$|R

Median effective concentration (EC 50) were calculated using the probit analysis, considering several endpoints: immobilisation for D. magna assays, luminescence decrease of the marine bacterium Photobacterium phosphoreum, inhibition of succinate generated potential or the depolarisation caused by ADP addition for rat liver mitochondria by the mithocondrial transmembrane electric potential (TEP) and reduction in the amount of NADH oxidised by the electron transport system to form NAD+ {{in the case of the}} forward electron transport (FET) or the NADH amount that is reduced to NAD+ for SMP, in the case of the reverse electron transfer (RET). The TEP tests showed to be more sensitive than the others one are. The results obtained indicate the convenience of utilising in vitro systems such as the TEP or even SMP to test <b>whole</b> <b>effluent</b> ecotoxicity...|$|R
