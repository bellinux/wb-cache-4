Tatsuguchi was unable to tell his wife, now pregnant with their second child, {{where he would be}} assigned, but she noticed that he studied maps of the North Pacific area. At one point, he remarked to Taeko {{that he was going to}} an area <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> meet some of his former classmates from California.|$|E

25|$|By {{at least}} July, Flying Fish {{was under the}} command of Lieutenant Thomas Price. On 14 July she recaptured the Content, which the French {{privateer}} Republic (Republique) had captured the evening before off Black River. From the prisoners Price learned <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> intercept the privateer. The next day he encountered her and captured her after a five-hour chase. Republic was armed with one long gun and small arms, and had left St. Jago with a crew of 51 men. On her cruise she had taken three prizes. Another account reports that the privateer that Flying Fish captured had 37 men aboard her, and that Flying Fish succeeded in recapturing two of the privateer's prizes.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter of}} 1820-1821 passed and Franklin set out again on 4 June 1821. His {{plans for the}} coming summer were vague; {{he had decided to}} explore east {{from the mouth of the}} Coppermine in the hope of either meeting William Edward Parry or {{reaching}} Repulse Bay, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> obtain adequate supplies from local Inuit to allow him to return directly to York Factory by way of Hudson Bay. However, if Parry failed to appear, or he was unable to reach Repulse Bay he would either retrace his outward route or, if it seemed better, return directly to Fort Enterprise across the uncharted Barren Lands to the east of the Coppermine River.|$|E
25|$|It emerges {{that this}} {{messenger}} was formerly a shepherd on Mount Cithaeron, {{and that he}} was given a baby, which the childless Polybus then adopted. The baby, he says, was given to him by another shepherd from the Laius household, who had been told {{to get rid of the}} child. Oedipus asks the chorus if anyone knows who this man was, or <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be now. They respond that he is the same shepherd who was witness to the murder of Laius, and whom Oedipus had already sent for.

25|$|Rivers {{had already}} formed {{a career in}} {{physiology}} and psychology. But now he moved more definitively into anthropology. He wanted a demographically small, fairly isolated people, comparable to the island societies of the Torres Strait, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{be able to get}} genealogical data on each and every individual. The Todas in the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India, with their population then about 700 plus, suited Rivers’s criteria. And they had speciﬁc features of social organization, such as polyandrous marriage and a bifurcation of their society into so-called moieties that had interested historical evolutionists. Whether his fieldwork was initially so single-minded is questionable, however, since at first he looked at other local communities and studied their visual perception before fixing all his attention on the Todas.|$|E
25|$|Now it {{happened}} that on a cold and wintry day, as Lillinonah was out walking in the woods high above the swift rapids of the Housatonic, she came upon a handsome young white man wandering aimlessly through the forest, stumbling occasionally and falling to his knees before rising once more and continuing on. It was obvious to the Indian maiden {{that the man was}} sick with cold and fever, weak of body and confused of mind. With pity in her heart for the suffering stranger, she offered to assist him back to the village of the Pootatucks, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> find rest and treatment for his illness. When the white man nodded his assent, she slowly walked him to her home, though he had to lean heavily upon her for support, lest he collapse in the effort.|$|E
25|$|King Frederick's broad {{strategy}} {{had three}} parts. First, {{he meant to}} seize Saxony and eliminate it {{as a threat to}} Prussia, then use the Saxon army and treasury to bolster the Prussian war effort. Second, he would advance from Saxony into Bohemia, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> set up winter quarters at Austria's expense. Third, he would invade Moravia from Silesia, seize the fortress at Olmütz, and advance on Vienna to force an end to the war. To begin, Frederick divided his army in three: he placed a small force under Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt in East Prussia to guard against any Russian invasion from the east; he stationed Field Marshal Count Kurt von Schwerin in Silesia with 25,000 soldiers to deter incursions from Moravia and Hungary; finally, he personally led the main Prussian army into Saxony.|$|E

25|$|During {{this time}} Vincejo came to intercept, {{after a long}} chase and a warning shot, a large (6-700 ton (bm)) vessel. She {{turned out to be}} the Hercules, of Boston, and hence neutral, with no {{apparent}} cargo. The American captain explained to Long that Hercules had taken cargo to Leghorn, sold it there, and then had agreed to take a small number of invalid French officers to a French port <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> find a return cargo for the United States. Long was suspicious and ordered Hercules to accompany him overnight in Long's hope that they might encounter Cockburn and that he would decide what to do with the American vessel. Next day, when it turned out that Minerve was nowhere in sight, Long released the American vessel, which sailed off to Nice. Later, the British learned that Hercules had been ballasted with brass guns (violating her neutrality), and had hidden aboard her French plunder in the form of statues, pictures, plate, and the like.|$|E
25|$|French reconnaissances had {{confirmed}} Saxe in {{his belief}} that the allies would endeavour to relieve Tournai by attempting to force a passage from the south-east via the hamlet of Fontenoy and {{the small town of}} Antoing on the Scheldt. The French commander now cast about for a good spot <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> await the attack in security, finally settling on a potentially strong defensive position on {{the eastern side of the}} Scheldt, about 5 miles (~9km) south-east of Tournai. To guard against any break-out by the Dutch from within the besieged city the Marquis of Dreux-Brézé was left with 21,550 men in the trenches, and orders to contain the garrison of about 8,000 men at all costs. Louis XV took to the field in person, accompanied by his son Louis, and their enormous retinue. After observing the siege at Tournai, the King moved on to the Château de Calonne between Tournai and Antoing. That same day, 8 May, Saxe began to move his main troops into position to face the Pragmatic Army.|$|E
25|$|Test flights {{revealed}} problems initially {{believed to}} be tail flutter. During high-speed flight approaching Mach0.68, especially during dives, the aircraft's tail would begin to shake violently and the nose would tuck under, steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed compressibility stall and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot {{no option but to}} bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have a chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to stay with a YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using elevator trim. Lockheed engineers were very concerned at this limitation but first had to concentrate on filling the current order of aircraft. In late June 1941, the Army Air Corps was renamed the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF), and a total of 65 Lightnings were finished for the service by September 1941 with more on the way for the USAAF, the Royal Air Force (RAF), and the Free French Air Force operating from England.|$|E

As a former farm-boy from impoverished Ireland, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> never have owned even a house plot, Rush now purchased many acres of Clarence River land, much of it having little value. Rush's Irish background of tenant farming gave little understanding of managing capital, property, or conducting a business career.

500|$|Although it grew {{during its}} {{first five years of}} existence, ETNC {{relocated}} from Cooper to Commerce after its original campus was destroyed in a fire in July 1894. Due to the fire, the lack of railroad service in Cooper, his fairly poor personal financial situation, and a disturbing public execution that occurred near the college in 1894, Mayo looked to move ETNC to whichever community made him the best offer, ultimately selecting Commerce after it promised him land and $20,000. According to Gladys Mayo, the daughter of William and Etta Mayo, her father did not have [...] "any desire to rebuild in Cooper", and [...] "was anxiously looking around for a place <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> re-establish the college". One of Commerce's chief advantages was that it was well connected by rail, boasting regular service on the St. Louis Southwestern Railway of Texas ("Cotton Belt") to Dallas, Sherman, and Texarkana and on the Texas Midland Railroad to Paris, Ennis, and Houston.|$|E
500|$|While {{they had}} {{demonstrated}} that the fission of uranium produced more neutrons than it consumed, this was still not a chain reaction. Szilard persuaded Fermi and Herbert L. Anderson to try a larger experiment using [...] of uranium. To maximize the chance of fission, they needed a neutron moderator to slow the neutrons down. Hydrogen was a known moderator, so they used water. The results were disappointing. It became apparent that hydrogen slowed neutrons down, but also absorbed them, leaving fewer for the chain reaction. Szilard then suggested Fermi use carbon, {{in the form of}} graphite. He felt he would need about [...] of graphite and [...] of uranium. As a back-up plan, Szilard also considered <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> find a few tons of heavy water; deuterium would not absorb neutrons like ordinary hydrogen, but would have the similar value as a moderator. Such quantities of materiel would require a lot of money.|$|E
500|$|Romney held {{a series}} of Governor's Conferences, which sought to find new ideas from public {{services}} professionals and community activists who attended.
