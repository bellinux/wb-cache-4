At the same time, because families are sites <b>of</b> the <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> tyranny and the <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> neglect, a {{rule of law is}} needed that imposes public human rights obligations on families. The republican ideal is that this rule of law that constrains people in families should come from the people. Restorative {{and responsive}} justice has a strategy for the justice of the people to bubble up into the justice of the law and for the justice of the law to filter down into the justice of the people. The role of the social worker is to be a bridge across which both those democratic impulses are enabled to flow. The empowering side of the social work role fits the first side of the duality where the will of families bubble up; the coercive side of the social work role fits the second where the justice of the law filters down.

Apart from the [...] "galactic alignment" [...] already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it. Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 light years from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System. This reading of the alignment was included on the History Channel documentary Decoding the Past.

In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said its music was more genuine than Tommy or the aborted Lifehouse project because [...] "those were art – , even with its pretensions, is rock & roll." [...] BBC Music's Chris Roberts cited it as the band's best record and [...] "one of those carved-in-stone landmarks that the rock canon doesn't allow you to bad-mouth." [...] Mojo claimed its sophisticated music and hook-laden songs featured innovative use of rock synthesizers that did not weaken the Who's characteristic [...] "power-quartet attack". In The Encyclopedia of Popular Music (1998), Colin Larkin said it raised the standards for both hard rock and the Who, whose [...] "sense of dynamics" [...] was highlighted by the contrast between their powerful playing and a counterpoint produced at times from acoustic guitars and synthesizer obbligatos. Christgau, on the other hand, was less enthusiastic about the record during the 1980s when the Who became what he felt was [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> art-rock band", writing that Who's Next revealed itself to be less tasteful in retrospect because of Daltrey's histrionic singing and [...] "all that synth noodling".|$|E

In a low-scoring match, he top-scored for the entire match with 71 in the first innings as Australia took a 99-run lead. The tourists looked set for victory and retention of The Ashes {{at the start of}} the final day, but time-wasting and defiant defence from the English batsmen left Australia a target of 177 in the last two hours. This would have required a scoring rate much higher than in the first four days of the match. Harvey quickly scored 34 at a run a minute, and Australia had made 111 in 75 minutes and were on schedule for a win. At that point, English medium-pacer Trevor Bailey began bowling with the wicket-keeper more than two metres down the leg side to deny the Australians an opportunity to hit the ball, but the umpires did not penalise them as wides. The match ended in a draw, and Harvey described Bailey's tactics as [...] "absolutely disgusting". English wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans said that the tourists [...] "were absolutely livid" [...] and he sympathised with them, saying that [...] "they were right" [...] in claiming that Bailey's bowling was [...] "the <b>worst</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> negative cricket" [...] and that he had [...] "cheated [...] of victory".|$|E

40|$|It {{seems that}} the years of mankind {{struggle}} against poverty have ended to a symbolic belief: "We must empower people to stand up against poverty". Empowering people depends on the equal access to cultural, economical, and political opportunities. Equal accessibility to information and knowledge sources, has {{a key role in}} developing and maintaining those equal situations. Information can create money, power, and knowledge, and increase human capability. So, any inequality in information distribution is one <b>of</b> the <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> discrimination, which leads to ever-lasting poverty. The central premise of this research is that E-Government can act as a facilitator for equal access to information, empower people in all aspects of social arenas, and as a result, strengthen the poverty eradication process. To explain this hypothesis, a model was introduced, which showed how discrimination leads to poverty and inactive participation in social life. In another model, empowerment, equal access to opportunities, and their impacts on poverty eradication were developed. Finally, a comprehensive model emphasizing on the unique affect of e-government on reforming the public involvement level was suggested. The model shows how e-government results in proactive participation of people in social arenas and public policy processes...|$|R

Such people had committed their crimes in an unmanly and stealthy way. Additionally, they may have avoided taking responsibility for their actions. Such behaviour made an otherwise redeemable act irredeemable. This norm for proper conduct is firmly rooted in pre-Christian notions, and the Church {{used it as a}} platform {{to make it easier for}} the populace to understand that whereas most people belonged within the churchyard, others clearly did not. With some modifications during the high Middle Ages, typically when additional categories of criminals were excluded from Christian burial, this principle carried through well into the early modern period. Documents which can tell us how these rules worked out in practice are few and far between, but are enough to show that the Church tried to ensure that the worst outlaws remained out of the churchyard.

40|$|Violence in {{the post}} cold war era has changed both in {{dimension}} and form. There {{has been a significant}} decline in occurrence of interstate conflicts. However violence and armed conflicts continue to haunt humanity and impede its progress within the nations if not across them. The poverty ridden Africa has witnessed <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> violence and armed conflict. Economists across the globe have already invested appreciable time and intellect in unfolding the impacts of violence on economic development both at the Micro and the Macro level. It is indeed disheartening to know that none of the countries affected by violence have been able to achieve single Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). More recently developments in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and India and their fall out on the growth prospects of this region have attracted worldwide attention. In context of Asia one of the oldest reasons for interstate and intra state tension is the Kashmir Issue. An un resolved territorial dispute between India, Pakistan and China from at least 1947 entered into an armed rebellion phase in 1989. Since 1989 {{this part of the world}} has witnessed a huge loss of capital – both physical and human. Investments have been scarcer and import dependence has increased over the decades. The macro-economic effects of the conflict are evident if not measured. However the impact of the Kashmir conflict on the household welfare still remains a mystery. Hence, the present paper.

Gunilla Florby, in a well-written and cogent discussion, suggests that at least two Canadian writers, Robert Kroetsch and Margaret Laurence, deserve to be considered from a post-colonial perspective. She argues persuasively that while Canada has not experienced the <b>worst</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> colonial conditions, it continues to be dominated to this day by three different empires-French, British, and American. She further demonstrates that Canadian writers use the same forms of resistance as do other writers whose works are more easily identifiable as post-colonial. Although the two writers seem an unlikely pairing-Laurence being primarily a realist, Kroetsch a post-modernist Florby finds common ground based on their status as writers from a peripheral, rather than a central, nation. She sees Laurence and Kroetsch as twice removed from the center, first as Canadians on the edge of the Anglo-American empire, and then as regional prairie writers far from the Canadian center of power in Ontario. In prose refreshingly free of the most abstruse forms of literary jargon, she shows how the novels in each writer 2 ̆ 7 s body of work exemplify the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> cultural resistance found in postcolonial writing (and also evident in much of the literature written in Canada since the 1960 s). Supporting her close readings with extensive and useful citations from other scholars, Florby offers a convincing case that these disparate writers 2 ̆ 7 common desire to express a distinct Canadian ethos unites them within the postcolonial framework claimed, for the most part, by nations quite unlike their own...|$|R
