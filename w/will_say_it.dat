I actually really like her and think she's wonderful. I think it's the best thing that's happened to us in a long time. She's a very intelligent woman but I don't see much to fear. I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> is great to have a woman {{in charge of the}} country. She's very sensible and I think that's a good thing at this point in time".|$|E

2500|$|The [...]380 ACP is {{compact and}} light, {{but has a}} {{relatively}} short range and less stopping power than other modern pistol cartridges. According to gun author Massad Ayoob, [...] "Some experts <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> barely adequate, and others <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>it's</b> barely inadequate." [...] Even so, it remains a popular self-defense cartridge for shooters who want a lightweight pistol with manageable recoil and/or smaller pistol. It is slightly less powerful than a standard-pressure [...]38 Special and uses 9mm (.355in) diameter bullets. [...] though the standard has long been 85, 90 or 95 grains (5.5, 5.8 or 6.2g).|$|R

500|$|In the 1500m final race, {{with one}} lap {{remaining}} and currently in second place, Ohno {{attempted to make}} a pass on the leader Kim Dong-Sung, who then drifted to the inside and as a result, Ohno raised his arms to signal he was blocked. Kim finished first ahead of Ohno but was disqualified for impeding, awarding the gold medal to Ohno. Fourth-place finisher of the race, Fabio Carta of Italy, showed his disagreement with the disqualification decision saying it was [...] "absurd that the Korean was disqualified". China's Jiajun Li, who moved from bronze to silver, remained neutral saying: [...] "I respect {{the decision of the}} referee, I'm not going to say any more". Steven Bradbury, the 1000m gold-medal winner, also shared his views: [...] "Whether Dong-Sung moved across enough to be called for cross-tracking, I don't know, he obviously moved across a bit. It's the judge's interpretation. A lot of people <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was right {{and a lot of people}} will say it's wrong. I've seen moves like that before that were not called. But I've seen them called too".|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> I promise you that. But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain what he meant to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E

Ponor said, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> again, and I want {{everyone}} to know, I will quit without regrets.

Churchill, clad in robe and slippers, offered him a drink, beginning a relationship that had Vanderkloot flying the Prime Minister on sensitive diplomatic trips across war-torn Europe, Russia, North Africa and the Middle-East. [...] "He took calculated risks," [...] said his son, William III. There {{was a lot more}} risk in flying back then. It was a frontier, and I think all the old pilots <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> secretly to themselves, that they enjoyed being on their own. It was the wild blue yonder." [...] As Churchill's pilot, Vanderkloot flew Lord Mountbatten to England in June 1942, conveyed the Prime Minister and Chief of the Imperial General Staff Alan Brooke to Egypt in August 1942 to replace Claude Auchinleck commander of the British army in North Africa with Bernard Montgomery and also took Churchill to high-level talks in Moscow with Joseph Stalin, to Turkey to determine that country's wartime intentions, and to the Casablanca Conference in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|Although not {{initially}} receiving public and commercial praise until {{years after its}} release, the album is widely revered by critics, musicians, audiences. Serving as an inspiration for other artists, Afrodisiac has been credited {{as one of a}} precursors to the PBR subgenre. In a 2014 music and fashion conversation with NPR, singer and model Solange discussed the album, saying [...] "Brandy is really the foundation of a lot of this very innovative, progressive, experimental R Brandy really influenced a lot of that. Frank Ocean <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> Miguel will say it." [...] Barbadian singer Rihanna revealed in an interview with Entertainment Weekly that her 2007 multi-platinum album, Good Girl Gone Bad, was primarily influenced by Afrodisiac. In the interview she stated, [...] "Brandy's album really helped to inspire, because that album I listen to all day, all night when I was in the studio [...] I really admired that every song was a great song." [...] Rock musician John Frusciante, viruoso guitarist of the popular rock group Red Hot Chili Peppers, mentioned that Norwood and the album were the “main inspiration” behind the guitar work on the Red Hot Chili Pepper’s 2006 Grammy winning album, Stadium Arcadium. In 2008, singer Beyoncé Knowles chose the album cut [...] "Focus" [...] for her personal music playlist on iTunes, citing her love of the lyrics, and Brandy's voice and vocal arrangements. Hip-Hop producer Hit-Boy has often lauded the album as an influence on his work via his social media outlets. R singer Nivea interpolated the song [...] "I Tried" [...] on her 2010 single [...] "Love Hurts".|$|E
