40|$|The {{existence}} of a mass-metallicity (MZ) relation in star forming galaxies at all redshift has been recently established. We aim at studying some possible physical mechanisms contributing to the MZ relation by adopting analytical solutions of chemical evolution models including infall and outflow. We explore the hypotheses of a variable galactic <b>wind</b> <b>rate,</b> infall rate and yield per stellar generation (i. e. {{a variation in the}} IMF), as possible causes for the MZ relation. By means of analytical models we compute the expected O abundance for galaxies of a given total baryonic mass and gas mass. The stellar mass is derived observationally and the gas mass is derived by inverting the Kennicutt law of star formation, once the star formation rate is known. Then we test how the parameters describing the outflow, infall and IMF should vary to reproduce the MZ relation, and we exclude the cases where such a variation leads to unrealistic situations. We find that a galactic <b>wind</b> <b>rate</b> increasing with decreasing galactic mass or a variable IMF are both viable solutions for the MZ relation. A variable infall rate instead is not acceptable. It is difficult to disentangle among the outflow and IMF solutions only by considering the MZ relation, and other observational constraints should be taken into account to select a specific solution. For example, a variable efficiency of star formation increasing with galactic mass can also reproduce the MZ relation and explain the downsizing in star formation suggested for ellipticals. The best solution could be a variable efficiency of star formation coupled with galactic winds, which are indeed observed in low mass galaxies. Comment: Accepted by A&...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} least-squares fitting {{methods for}} estimating the <b>winding</b> <b>rate</b> of field lines {{about the axis}} of twisted magnetic-flux tubes. These methods estimate the <b>winding</b> <b>rate</b> by finding the values {{for a set of}} parameters that correspond to the minimum of the discrepancy between magnetic-field measurements and predictions from a twisted flux-tube model. For the flux-tube model used in the fitting, we assume that the magnetic field is static, axisymmetric, and does not vary in the vertical direction. Using error-free, synthetic vector magnetic-field data constructed with models for twisted magnetic-flux tubes, we test the efficacy of fitting methods at recovering the true <b>winding</b> <b>rate.</b> Furthermore, we demonstrate how assumptions built into the flux-tube models used for the fitting influence the accuracy of the winding-rate estimates. We identify the radial variation of the <b>winding</b> <b>rate</b> within the flux tube as one assumption that can {{have a significant impact on}} the winding-rate estimates. We show that the errors caused by making a fixed, incorrect assumption about the radial variation of the <b>winding</b> <b>rate</b> can be largely avoided by fitting directly for the radial variation of the <b>winding</b> <b>rate.</b> Other assumptions that we investigate include the lack of variation of the field in the azimuthal and vertical directions in the flux tube model used for the fitting, and the inclination, curvature, and location of the flux-tube axis. When the observed field deviates substantially from the flux-tube model used for the fitting, we find that the winding-rate estimates can be unreliable. We conclude that the magnetic-flux tube models used in this investigation are probably too simple to yield reliable estimates for the <b>winding</b> <b>rate</b> of the field lines in solar magnetic structures in general, unless additional information is available to justify the choice of flux-tube model used for the fitting.

40|$|Context. The mass-metallicity (MZ) {{relation}} in star-forming galaxies at all redshifts {{has been}} recently established. It is therefore {{important to understand}} the physical mechanisms underlying such a relation. Aims: We aim at studying some possible physical mechanisms contributing to the MZ relation by adopting analytical solutions of chemical evolution models, including infall and outflow. Methods: Analytical models assume the instantaneous recycling approximation, which is still an acceptable assumption for elements produced on short timescales such as oxygen, which is the measured abundance in the MZ relation. We explore the hypotheses of a variable galactic <b>wind</b> <b>rate,</b> infall rate, and yield per stellar generation (i. e. a variation in the IMF), as possible causes for the MZ relation. Results: By means of analytical models, we computed the expected O abundance for galaxies of a given total baryonic mass and gas mass.

The chemical evolution models for Draco and Ursa Minor, which are able to reproduce several observational features of these two galaxies, such as the several abundance ratios, take up-to-date nucleosynthesis into account for intermediate-mass stars and supernovae of both types, as well as the effect of these objects on the energetics of the systems. For both galaxies, the model that best fits the data contains an intense continuous galactic wind, occurring at a rate proportional to the star formation rate. Models with a <b>wind</b> <b>rate</b> assumed to be proportional only to the supernova rate also reproduce the observed SMD, but do not match the gas mass, whereas the models with no galactic winds fail to reproduce the observed SMDs. In the case of Ursa Minor, the same model as in previous works reproduces the observed distribution very well with no need to modify the main parameters of the model. The model for Draco, on the other hand, is slightly modified. The observed SMD requires a model with a lower supernova type Ia thermalization efficiency (η_SNeIa = 0. 5 instead of η_SNeIa = 1. 0) in order to delay the galactic wind, whereas all the other parameters are kept the same. The model results, compared to observations, strongly suggest that intense and continuous galactic winds play a very important role in the evolution of local dSphs.

When the wind speed below the <b>wind</b> turbine <b>rated,</b> the output power of generator can be maximized by controlling the generator speed at point of maximum power coefficient. When the wind speed above the <b>wind</b> turbine <b>rated,</b> output power of wind turbine will exceed the power generators rated. In this condition, the output power of wind turbine needs to be regulated {{to conform to the}} generator power rate. Output power of wind turbine can be regulated by adjusting the pitch angle of wind turbine. In this paper is developed the control strategies based intelligent control for controlling the generator speed and pitch angle of wind turbine, so the maximum output power tracking (MOPT) of wind turbine can be obtained at any wind speed variations. Generator speed is controlled using PI Fuzzy Logic Controller (PI-FLC) based Direct Field Oriented Control (DFOC). Pitch angle of wind turbine is controlled using Elman Recurrent Neural Network (RENN). The simulation results with Matlab Simulink shows that the both controller was successfully regulates the output power when the wind speed above the <b>wind</b> turbine <b>rated</b> and the output power can be maximum when the wind speed below the <b>wind</b> turbine <b>rated...</b>|$|R
40|$|Wind erosion {{is one of}} {{the major}} factors of land {{degradation}} in the typical steppe region, northern Mongolian Plateau. Using (137) Cs tracing technique, we estimated the <b>wind</b> erosion <b>rates</b> of different pastures and abandoned farmland at Bayannur and Karakorum in Mongolia. The pastures and cutting grassland at Bayannur were slightly eroded by <b>wind,</b> with the <b>rates</b> of 64. 58 - 169. 07 t. km(- 2). a(- 1). The abandoned farmland in Karakorum, however, was strongly eroded by wind, with annual surface soil loss of 4. 05 mm. a(- 1), and <b>wind</b> erosion <b>rates</b> up to 6723. 06 t. km(- 2). a(- 1). The total loss of surface soil due to wind erosion has been 17. 4 cm since the cultivation of the steppe land in the 1960 s. The <b>wind</b> erosion <b>rate</b> at the abandoned farmland was much higher than that at the typical steppe sites, showing that the cultivation led to serious wind erosion in the typical steppe region, northern Mongolian Plateau. By contrast, traditional livestock grazing resulted in less disturbance to the surface soil, and did not induce to devastating wind erosion, which plays an important role in maintaining the stability of the steppe ecosystem in the northern Mongolian Plateau...|$|R
25|$|The world's first {{wind farm}} was 0.6 MW, {{consisting}} of 20 <b>wind</b> turbines <b>rated</b> at 30 kilowatts each, {{installed on the}} shoulder of Crotched Mountain in southern New Hampshire in December 1980.|$|R
40|$|This paper mainly {{focuses on}} feature {{analysis}} and control {{design for the}} system of wind turbine generator set. Firstly, an Matlab/Simulink model for simulation is established and simulation results show that wind turbine generator can run stably {{but there is a}} lower <b>wind</b> power utilization <b>rate</b> under <b>rated</b> <b>wind</b> speed, however wind turbine output power overruns its rated power above <b>rated</b> <b>wind</b> speed; and then, PID controller for pitch angle sub-system is designed to control the pitch angle to achieve constant power output of wind turbine generator. The simulation results show that PID controlling can improve the stability of wind turbine generator set...|$|R
