Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion. Spence writes that [...] "the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital.

40|$|ABSTRACT Spermatogonial stem cells, which {{exist in}} the {{testicles}} since birth, are progenitors cells of male gametes. These cells are critical for the process of spermatogenesis, and not able to produce mature sperm cells before puberty due to their dependency of hormonal stimuli. This characteristic of the reproductive system limits the preservation of fertility only to males {{who are able to}} produce an ejaculate. This fact puts some light on the increase in survival rates of childhood cancer over the past decades because of improvements in the diagnosis and effective treatment in pediatric cancer patients. Therefore, we highlight {{one of the most important}} challenges concerning male fertility preservation that is the toxic effect of cancer therapy on reproductive function, especially the spermatogenesis. Currently, the experimental alternative for fertility preservation of prepubertal boys is the testicular tissue cryopreservationfor, for future isolation and spermatogonial stem cells transplantation, in order to restore the spermatogenesis. We present a brief review on isolation, characterization and culture conditions for the in vitro proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells, as well as the future perspectives as an alternative for fertility preservation in prepubertal boys. The possibility of restoring male fertility constitutes <b>a</b> research tool <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>huge</b> <b>potential</b> in basic and applied science.

It combines the advantages of electron beam lithography and holographic exposure, which are superior homogeneity, high resolution and pattern flexibility on one hand, and a fast, large aerial exposure with the option for smooth profiles on the other hand. This is accomplished {{by the use of}} an electron beam written phase mask which contains a very homogeneous pattern of diffractive features and is used for a full-field exposure in a proximity mask aligner. The key for the beneficial use of the technology is the proper design of the phase mask surface profile which can have a binary or multilevel geometry. Since the patterns to be exposed are periodic, this is also the case for the phase mask which allows calculating their physical light transmission with exact methods like rigorous coupled wave analysis. An optimization algorithm has been developed which can find mask geometries that synthesize a desired complex aerial image in the proximity distance of choice. Aerial images offering e. g. high resolution features, phase shifts, and tilted propagation directions can be realized that way.
