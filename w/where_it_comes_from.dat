500|$|Earlier manuscripts {{included}} more antagonistic actions by Elsa, such as intentionally cursing Arendelle with an eternal winter. Additionally, she is shown creating {{an army of}} snowmen similar to the original Snow Queen's army of snowflakes; the comedic character of Olaf {{was at the time}} written as a smaller snowman who was cast out by Elsa for being too unintimidating. Within two months, however, scripts were altered to give emphasis to her lack of control over her powers. Olaf was reduced to the only snowman created by Elsa, and he instead serves as a reminder of the sisters' childhood friendship. In the final version, Elsa creates a single giant snow creature that Olaf nicknames [...] "Marshmallow" [...] to act as a guard after being branded as a monster for her powers. According to director Jennifer Lee, the character ultimately became more of a composite of both Kai and the Snow Queen, enhancing her increasingly sympathetic portrayal. Del Vecho added, [...] "There are times when Elsa does villainous things but because you understand <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from,</b> from this desire to defend herself, you can always relate to her." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Ramana Maharshi, the I-thought is {{the sense}} of individuality: [...] "(Aham, aham) ‘I-I’ is the Self; (Aham idam) “I am this” or “I am that” is the ego."

He describes Peruchazhi as a spoof about how a politician from Kerala ends up being the chief political adviser to a state election campaign in California and the havoc he creates while chasing success there. Since Vaidyanathan wanted the protagonist to have international appeal, he named him [...] "Ulaganathan" [...] (conqueror of the world) in his original Tamil script; in Malayalam the name was changed to [...] "Jagannathan", its meaning unchanged.|$|E
