25|$|Seamen of the {{battleship}} Bismarck! You have covered yourself with glory! The {{sinking of the}} battle cruiser Hood has not only military, but psychological value, for she was the pride of Great Britain. Henceforth the enemy will try to concentrate his forces and bring them into action against us. I therefore released Prinz Eugen at noon yesterday {{so that she could}} conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. <b>We,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle. The German people are with you, and we will fight until our gun barrels glow red-hot and the last shell has left the barrels. For us, seamen, the question is victory or death.|$|E

But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the situation, about the mental and emotional numbness of the German soldiers. In short, it was again a [...] "victory".

500|$|During the Confessions Tour in 2006, {{the song}} was given a horse riding theme. Madonna wore a tight, black body suit, and {{performed}} the song atop a studded leather S carousel horse, while X-rays of her broken bones, {{the result of a}} horse-riding accident on her 47th birthday, flashed on the screens behind her. The performance was included on The Confessions Tour live album, released in 2007. In 2008's Sticky & Sweet Tour, Madonna sang the song in Rome and dedicated the song to Pope Benedict XVI, commenting [...] "I'd like to dedicate this song to the Pope, I know he loves me" [...] and saying that she is a child of God. She asked the audience to sing along with her. The song was again performed on The MDNA Tour (2012), during the third section of the show. [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] was stripped down to a simple Burlesque-version played on the piano, featuring elements of the soundtrack [...] "Evgeni's Waltz" [...] from the film, <b>W.E.</b> <b>On</b> the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–2016), a bass-heavy version of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] ended the second act of the show. The remix was created in 2008 by French music producer Denis Zabee, and features elements of [...] "Heartbeat" [...] and [...] "Erotica". Jim Farber of Daily News described it as the show's [...] "most stunning move".

He feared that Saddam could seize control of the Straits of Hormuz and restrict the transport of oil through them. In a 2007 interview, he said, [...] "people do not realize in this country, for example, how tenuous our ties to international energy are.

2500|$|Conservationists {{have fought}} {{to save the}} estate from demolition, which they claim is a unique {{surviving}} example of twentieth-century architecture. [...] Thus far they have succeeded in seeing Grade II listing applied by English Heritage to six buildings on the estate including St. Mark's Church. [...] The conservation of the estate has been spearheaded by the Twentieth Century Society; claiming that the overall layout and planning of the estate is key to its uniqueness and that just keeping six buildings and surrounding them with new houses does not suffice. [...] Despite the Twentieth Century Society campaigning for the entire estate to be made a conservation area and English Heritage recommending 21 buildings be listed, the Department for Culture would {{only go so far}} as to list six of the buildings. [...] Under listing guidelines for twentieth-century buildings, only buildings with few moderations should be listed; in the case of Excalibur, most buildings have modified windows and doors. [...] A prominent local resident favouring conservation stated: [...] "The Excalibur Prefab Estate is the largest of its kind now left in Europe. Europe values its war time history, <b>we</b> <b>on</b> the estate think it’s time we did too." [...] Emily Gee of English Heritage said of the estate: [...] "The historical resonance of the estate is considerable. The design of the buildings, with their subtle modern influences, and the community-focused planning of the estate testifies to the thoughtfulness of post-Blitz reconstruction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1920s {{and most}} of the 1930s, the Labour Party's {{official}} policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and collective security under the League of Nations. At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, [...] "We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country." [...] During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said [...] "We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. We think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. I shall be told that that is quite impossible." [...] Shortly after those comments, Adolf Hitler proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the Soviet Union, created [...] "A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but <b>we</b> <b>on</b> this side cannot accept that position." ...|$|E

A spokesman for Optimum Releasing, the film's UK distributor, said: [...] "The film was not due to be shown in Cannes. It is in post-production and will now be released early next year." [...] Weinstein Company announced in June 2011, that they planned to release <b>W.E.</b> <b>on</b> December 9, 2011, in the United States. It will open in New York and Los Angeles on the said date, expanding to additional markets throughout the month, before the wide release intended for mid-January. Harvey Weinstein, head of The Weinstein Company, said of the release date: [...] "Madonna beautifully interweaves past and present in W.E., It's a very smart film, and a stunning directorial debut. I'm incredibly excited about this movie and I wanted to give it a prominent release date." [...] After the showcase of the film in Venice and Toronto film festivals, Weinstein decided to cut the time of the film by about ten minutes. Talk of making changes began in advance of the Toronto showcase, and after negotiating with Madonna, they finally decided to remove around ten minutes from the film. Plans were changed later and Weinstein confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that the film would have only a limited, one-week run beginning on December 9, 2011, before opening wide on February 3, 2012.|$|E
