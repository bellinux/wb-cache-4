40|$|Although {{numerous}} modelling {{efforts have}} integrated {{food and water}} considerations at the farm or river basin level, very few agro-economic models are able to jointly assess water and food policies at the global level. The present report explores the feasibility of integrating water considerations into the CAPRI model. First, a literature review of modelling approaches integrating food and water issues has been conducted. Three agro-economic models, IMPACT, WATERSIM and GLOBIOM, have been analysed in detail. In addition, biophysical and hydrological models estimating agricultural water use have also been studied, in particular the global hydrological model WATERGAP and the LISFLOOD model. Thanks to the programming approach of its supply module, CAPRI shows a high potentiality to integrate environmental indicators {{as well as to}} enter new resource constraints (land potentially irrigated, irrigation water) and input-output relationships. At least in theory, the activity-based approach of the regional programming model in CAPRI allows differentiating between rainfed and irrigated activities. The suggested approach to include water into the CAPRI model involves creating an irrigation module and a water use module. The development of the CAPRI <b>water</b> <b>module</b> will enable to provide scientific assessment on agricultural water use within the EU and to analyze agricultural pressures on water resources. The feasibility of the approach has been tested in a pilot case study including two NUTS 2 regions (Andalucia in Spain and Midi-Pyrenees in France). Preliminary results are presented, highlighting the interrelations between water and agricultural developments in Europe. As a next step, it is foreseen to further develop the CAPRI <b>water</b> <b>module</b> to account for competition between agricultural and non-agricultural water use. This will imply building a water use sub-module to compute water use balances. JRC. J. 4 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|E

Water {{is needed to}} produce energy, and energy is used to clean, desalinate and transport water. To deal with anthropogenic pressure and climate change, long-term solutions to water scarcity and energy demand {{need to be developed}} jointly. Such strategies can be analyzed and developed by studying interconnections between the water and energy sectors. For this purpose, water allocation issues were implemented in an energy optimization model with a dedicated <b>water</b> <b>module.</b> The proposed model was used to assess an optimal "water-energy" mix considering opportunities for water reuse and non-conventional water use in the water-scarce Middle East region (i. e.

The aim consists in identifying the main mechanisms and in giving typical times concerning the long term evolution of the waste packaging and of the near-field, taking their interactions into account. It has been established that this evolution is greatly influenced by the environment. Control of the boundary conditions imposed on the system by the near-field is essential. In this context, a pilot plant, called « <b>Water</b> <b>Module</b> » has been built. The aim of this facility is to deliver natural water, representative of the deep granitic medium (stability of the chemical composition, geo-chemichal equilibrium, reducing character, conservation of the main dissolved gases). The method used consists in re-equilibrating pressurized water, sampled from a borehole. This stabilisation is obtained by circulating the sampled water in several triaxial columns (to avoid any depressurization), filled with crushed alterate granitic materials taken from deep sampled fissures.

40|$|Bambara {{groundnut}} (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc) is {{an indigenous}} legume {{that is still}} cultivated in subsistence agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa, {{despite the lack of}} any major research effort until recently. The crop is cultivated from local landraces as there are no true varieties of the species bred for specific traits. The variable and hostile climates in the region mean that annual yields of most rainfed crops including bambara groundnut are far below their agronomic or genetic potential. The lack of quantitative information on the eco-physiological responses of the crop to various abiotic factors has resulted in poor decision making on crop management practices especially in relation to sowing date and the selection of appropriate landraces for different locations. Modelling of bambara groundnut was initiated previously but there is still insufficient understanding of how growth and developmental processes can be simulated under abiotic stress and different photoperiods. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a crop simulation model for bambara groundnut to predict growth, development and yield under drought, heat and cold stress and different daylengths. The present model (BAMGRO) is an adaptation of the established CROPGRO and previous bambara groundnut models; BAMnut and BAMFOOD project model. It uses climate data, landrace specific parameters and soil characteristics and runs on a daily time-step to determine the canopy development, biomass production and yield of a landrace in a specific environment. The parameters of the model have been determined with glasshouses data (TCRU, University of Nottingham) and published information. BAMGRO is capable of describing differences between landraces, and the influence of drought, temperature and photoperiod using a simplified approach. The present modelling approaches with BAMGRO model provide useful predictive information on canopy development, biomass production and yield formation of bambara groundnut landraces under contrasting environments. Two contrasting landraces; Uniswa Red (Swaziland) and S 19 - 3 (Namibia) were used in the present study to evaluate the growth and yield performances under drought, heat and cold stress. BAMGRO has been primarily validated against independent data sets of two years glasshouse for two contrasting landraces; Uniswa Red and S 19 - 3 grown under two temperatures (23 ± 5 0 C, 33 ± 5 0 C) with drought. Further, it was validated for field data in Botswana with two sowing dates (January 18, February 1) during the 2007 season and for Swaziland for three landraces; Uniswa Red, DipC, OM 1. The model achieves a good fit between observed and predicted data for LAI (Nash and Sutcliffe (N-S), 0. 78 - 0. 98; Mean Absolute Error, ± 0. 14 - 0. 57) for tested four landraces. Pod yield simulation was correlated well with measured values especially for Uniswa Red and S 19 - 3 (N-S 0. 73 - 0. 87; Mean Absolute Error ± 16 g m- 2) while it was poor for DipC and OM 1 (N-S, 0. 46 - 0. 50; Mean Absolute Error, ± 15. 6 - 17. 7 g m- 2). Further, the comparison of simulated and measured data of TDM reported lower correlation compared to LAI and yield. (N-S, 0. 59 - 0. 79; Mean Absolute Error ± 48 - 100 g m- 2) indicating overall underestimation. The performance of the BAMGRO-soil <b>water</b> <b>module</b> was tested by validating the available soil moisture and results indicating that it over estimated for upper layers while deeper layers showed lower prediction.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} research, three modeling tools {{have been}} developed to help quantify the complex processes of integrated surface- and ground-water systems in an area under significant agricultural development of Nebraska. To evaluate irrigation effect on stream depletion for the Lower Platte River (LPR) basin, a regional three-dimensional, transient groundwater-flow model is established with MODFLOW. A simplified and more efficient solution has been developed to estimate the stream depletion rate by re-using the flow coefficients of the baseline run. The flow equation is linearized because the head coefficients become constant between solver iterations. The tool has been successfully applied to the LPR model. The results show that the stream depletion analysis tool can reduce the numerical errors produced in the conventional method and improve the computational efficiency. The second modeling tool is a cross-section based streamflow routing (CSR) package for MODFLOW to simulate the streamflow and the interaction between streams and aquifers for the stream with a width larger than the MODFLOW grid size. In the CSR package, streams are divided into stream segments which are formed by two consecutive cross-sections. A rapid algorithm is used to compute the submerged area of the MODFLOW grid. Stream-aquifer seepage is treated as lateral flow in the streamflow routing computation with the Muskingum-Cunge method or mass conservation method. A hypothetical problem was established to test the capabilities of the CSR package with steady- and transient-state models. The third part of this dissertation aims to quantify the impacts of natural processes and human activities on ground-water dynamics in highly agricultural areas by developing an integrated surface-ground water model (ISGWM). In ISGWM, SWAT and MODFLOW are linked by a soil <b>water</b> <b>module</b> (SWM), which is developed based on a non-iterative solution of the 1 D Richards equation. SWM explicitly represents infiltration, soil evaporation, unsaturated water flow, root water update, and lateral drainage. Taking advantage of the simulation capacities of these SWAT, MODFLOW and SWM, ISGWM can simulate the physical hydrologic processes in three domains and their interactions. The model has been successfully applied to the Johnson Creek watershed, which is located within the Lower Platte Basin. ...|$|E
40|$|Four {{different}} approaches for {{the calculation of}} the well established decoupling coefficient Ω are compared using measurements at three experimental sites (Tharandt – spruce forest, Grillenburg and Melpitz – grass) and simulations from the soil-vegetation boundary layer model HIRVAC. These investigations aimed to quantify differences between the calculation routines regarding their ability to describe the vegetation-atmosphere coupling of grass and forest with and without water stress. The model HIRVAC used is a vertically highly resolved atmospheric boundary layer model, which includes vegetation. It is coupled with a single-leaf gas exchange model to simulate physiologically based reactions of different vegetation types to changing atmospheric conditions. A multilayer soil <b>water</b> <b>module</b> and a functional parameterisation are the base in order to link the stomata reaction of the gas exchange model to the change of soil water. The omega factor was calculated for the basic formulation according to McNaughton and Jarvis (1983) and three modifications. To compare measurements and simulations for the above mentioned spruce and grass sites, the summer period 2007 {{as well as a}} dry period in June 2000 were used. Additionally a developing water stress situation for three forest canopies (spruce, pine and beech) and for a grass site was simulated. The results showed large differences between the different omega approaches which depend on the vegetation type and the soil moisture. Between the omega values, which were calculated by the used approach, the ranking was always the same not only for the measurements but also for the adapted simulations. The lowest values came from the first modification including doubling factors and summands in all parts of omega equation in relation to the original approach. And the highest values were calculated with the second modification missing one doubling factor in the denominator of the omega equation. For example, the averages of omega ranged in the summer period 2007 from 0. 11 to 0. 19 for the spruce site and moderate soil wetness and from 0. 42 to 0. 58 for the grass site and higher soil wetness. In the case of the simulated drying out of four different canopies the forest stands showed a similar change of omega from about 0. 65 (moderate soil wetness) to 0. 1 (low soil wetness). The absolute change of omega for the grass canopy was smaller than for the forest canopies (on average from 0. 95 to 0. 7). But the differences between the used omega approaches increased. Especially the results from the longer period in summer 2007 demonstrate that the various modifications of the decoupling coefficient lead to a change in the long-term quantity of omega. This has, for example, consequences for the description of the coupling of heterogeneous landscapes...|$|E

40|$|John Steele, {{a chemist}} and {{technical}} fellow from United Technologies Corporation, provided a <b>water</b> quality <b>module</b> to assist engineers and scientists with a metric tool to evaluate {{risks associated with}} the design of space systems with fluid loops. This design metric is a methodical, quantitative, lessons-learned based means to evaluate the robustness of a long-term fluid loop system design. The tool was developed by a cross-section of engineering disciplines who had decades of experience and problem resolution...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A <b>water</b> stress–compensating root-water-uptake <b>module</b> was {{developed}} {{based upon a}} newly proposed water stress reduction function and an asymptotic root distribution function. The water stress reduction function takes into account both soil water pressure head and soil resistance to water flow. I...|$|R
50|$|Mass {{water is}} {{different}} from the highly purified <b>water</b> from the <b>Module</b> 15 &40. It is only cleaned from germs, but particles will still be there. The module has the capacity to provide a maximum of 40,000 beneficiaries with basic sanitation facilities.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} static feed <b>water</b> electrolysis <b>module</b> (SFWEM) {{and associated}} instrumentation for generating breathable O 2 was developed. The system also generates a H 2 byproduct {{for use in}} an air revitalization system for O 2 recovery from metabolic CO 2. Special attention was given to: (1) eliminating water feed compartment degassing, (2) eliminating need for zero gravity condenser/separators, (3) increasing current density capability, and (4) providing a self contained module so that operation is independent of laboratory instrumentation and complicated startup/shutdown procedures...|$|R
