5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same tension and fear that the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
25|$|So, in {{the case}} of {{circular}} flow, {{it is unlikely that the}} speed of the parcel does not change in time around the full circle, because the air parcel <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> different intensity of the Coriolis force as it travels across different latitudes.|$|E
25|$|A new {{technology}} has been developed and is slowly becoming more popular with police. Called the Rumbler, it is a siren that emits a low frequency sound which can be felt. Motorists that may have loud music playing in their car, for example, may not hear the audible siren of a police car behind them, but <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> vibrations of the Rumbler. The feeling is that of {{standing next to a}} large speaker with pumped bass.|$|E

She <b>will</b> never <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> warmth of love or a kind embrace. She’s dead. She’s dead because of what this woman did.” ...|$|R

25|$|Spiritual, emotional, and {{mathematical}} intellectuality, too, {{is behind the}} family group of Archipenko. This group, in plaster, might have been made of dough. It represents a featureless, large, strong male—one gets the impression of strength from humps and lumps—an impression of a female, less vivid, and the vague knowledge that a child is mixed up in the general embrace. The faces are rather blocky, the whole group with arms intertwined—arms that end suddenly, no hands, might be the sketch of a sculpture to be. But when one gets an insight it is intensely more interesting. It is, eventually, clear that in portraying his idea of family love the sculptor has built his figures with pyramidal strength; they are grafted together with love and geometric design, their limbs are bracings, ties of strength, they represent, not individuals, but the structure itself of family life. Not family life as one sees it, but the unseen, the deep emotional unseen, and in making his group when the sculptor found himself verging upon the seen—that is, when he no longer felt the unseen—he stopped. Therefore the hands were not essential. And this expression {{is made in the}} simplest way. Some will hoot at it, but others <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> respect that is due one who simplifies and expresses the deep things of life. You may say that such is literature in marble—well, it is the most modern sculpture.|$|E
500|$|GameZone {{praised the}} game's sound effects, saying that [...] "you <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> explosions of the cannon balls, the muskets firing their endless volleys, and the {{destruction}} of a building. It all sounds extremely realistic, and makes the game come that much more alive." [...] Eurogamer said [...] "AoE3...sounds fantastic," [...] while Game Revolution mentioned that [...] "The ambient sounds, music and voice work all suit the colonial theme." ...|$|E
500|$|The GDR's {{leadership}} explicitly {{endorsed the}} use of deadly force. General Heinz Hoffmann, the GDR defence minister, declared in August 1966 that [...] "anyone who does not respect our border <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> bullet". In 1974, Erich Honecker, as Chairman of the GDR's National Defence Council, ordered: [...] "Firearms are to be ruthlessly used {{in the event of}} attempts to break through the border, and the comrades who have successfully used their firearms are to be commended." ...|$|E

500|$|Pulp {{sensitivity}} tests, usually {{carried out}} with a cotton wool [...] sprayed with ethyl chloride {{to serve as a}} cold stimulus, or with an electric pulp tester. The air spray from a three-in-one syringe may also be used to demonstrate areas of dentin hypersensitivity. Heat tests can also be applied with hot Gutta-percha. [...] A healthy tooth <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> cold but the pain will be mild and disappear once the stimulus is removed. [...] The accuracy of these tests has been reported as 86% for cold testing, 81% for electric pulp testing, and 71% for heat testing. [...] Because of the lack of test sensitivity, a second symptom should be present or a positive test before making a diagnosis.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{personalized}} {{the film}} with several cameos. While filming in Alabama, the crew tracked down Billy Redden, {{one of the}} original banjo players from Deliverance (1972). Redden was working as a part-owner of a restaurant in Clayton, Georgia, and he agreed to reprise his role in the Spectre vignette. As Edward Bloom first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking a few notes from [...] "Dueling Banjos". Burton was pleased with the result: [...] "If you're watching the film and don't recognise the solitary, enigmatic figure on the porch, that's fine. But if you do – well, it just makes me so happy to see him and I think other people <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same way." [...] Original Big Fish author Daniel Wallace makes a brief appearance as Sandra's economics teacher in the [...] "Courtship of Sandra Templeton" [...] scene.|$|E
2500|$|Prime Minister David Cameron {{condemned}} the [...] "terrible scenes of people looting, vandalising, thieving, robbing" [...] and told rioters [...] "You <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> {{full force of}} the law.

2500|$|E.R. Punshon in The Guardians {{issue of}} 2 April 1940 concluded, [...] "The {{story is told}} with all and even more of Mrs. Christie's {{accustomed}} skill and economy of effect, {{but it is a}} pity that the plot turns upon a legal point familiar to all and yet so misconceived that many readers <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> tale is deprived of plausibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|Small {{businesses}} {{also use}} {{social networking sites}} {{to develop their own}} market research on new products and services. [...] By encouraging their customers to give feedback on new product ideas, businesses can gain valuable insights on whether a product may be accepted by their target market enough to merit full production, or not. In addition, customers <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> company has engaged them in the process of co-creation—the process in which the business uses customer feedback to create or modify a product or service the filling a need of the target market. [...] Such feedback can present in various forms, such as surveys, contests, polls, etc.|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} all other sumo ranks yokozuna cannot be demoted. [...] A yokozuna is {{expected}} to retire if {{he can no longer}} compete {{at the peak of the}} sport or in some cases if he is deemed to have not upheld the dignity of the rank. [...] Expectations are so high that, even in the course of one tournament, a yokozuna who early on appears to be headed for a losing tournament <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pressure to retire; there are many cases of yokozuna dropping out mid-tournament with a real or imagined injury to avoid a make-koshi (a losing record) and the expectation to retire. These expectations are a large part of the reason that the promotion criteria for yokozuna are so strict in the first place.|$|E
