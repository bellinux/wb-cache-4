5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s {{just one of those}} moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} between Dusty Rhodes and Randy Savage {{was about to}} begin, Ted DiBiase {{appeared}} and {{announced that he had}} purchased Sapphire. Rhodes <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> toward DiBiase and Sapphire but was attacked from behind by Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and Sapphire but was unable to catch up to their departing limousine.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E

They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families, being joined at the door by the two youngest flower girls.|$|E

500|$|For the I Am... disc, Beyoncé was {{influenced}} by folk and alternative rock genres, while incorporating other instruments she had not normally used previously, such as the acoustic guitar. Tedder specifically assisted Beyoncé with crafting the album's balladry. The ballads were crafted {{in a way to}} combine [...] "the best elements" [...] of pop and soul music, while simultaneously [...] "expanding the possibilities of both genres". Beyoncé attempted something different as people had strong expectations from her; she experimented with stronger lyrics. Beyoncé worked with Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's [...] "Ave Maria" [...] after having co-written [...] "Disappear" [...] in London, England. Ghost told The Daily Telegraph that they were both inspired by their then-recent marriages and had <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> to [...] "Ave Maria".|$|E

Knowles worked with Amanda Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's [...] "Ave Maria" [...] after having co-written [...] "Disappear" [...] in London. She stated that the song {{was one of the}} most personal on the album. Ghost told The Daily Telegraph that Knowles' references to rapper Jay-Z are usually unclear and open to interpretation, yet her music, including [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "is the one place she can be incredibly expressive". Knowles and Ghost both liked Schubert's song and <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> to the song during their respective weddings.

500|$|The tag team Luchas de Apuestas {{match was}} the only match of the night {{conducted}} under best two-out-of-three falls rules. During their introductions, Art Barr made [...] "swimming" [...] motions as the team <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> mockingly invoking the image of illegal immigrants swimming across the Rio Grande to incite the Mexican attendees in the crowd. Barr and Guerrero had Madonna's Boyfriend in their corner while Hijo del Santo and Octagón had Blue Panther in their corner, playing off Panther's past history with Barr. La Pareja del Terror tried {{to take control of}} the match early by attacking their opponents before the bell had even rung, but were quickly tossed out of the ring as the US crowd began to chant [...] "Mexico". Once the match actually started, Hijo del Santo and Guerrero started off the match. After just a few minutes of wrestling, Barr lifted Hijo del Santo up on his shoulders, allowing Guerrero to leap off the top, taking Hijo del Santo down with a Huracanrana head scissors takedown, followed by a quick pinfall. Under the rules, that was not the end of the first fall, as both wrestlers on a team had to be pinned or forced to submit to end the fall. Moments later, Guerrero threw Octagón off the top rope with a Superplex, placing him in position for Barr to perform a Frog Splash diving move off a different turnbuckle to pin Octagón for the first fall.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the train}} {{approached}} the Merillon Avenue station, Ferguson drew the gun, dropped several cartridges on the ground, stood up, {{and opened fire}} at random. During the next three minutes, Ferguson killed six people and injured another 19. Some passengers mistook the gunshots for caps or fireworks until a woman shouted, [...] "He's got a gun! He's shooting people!" [...] Ferguson walked east on the train, pulling the trigger steadily about every half second. Several passengers tried to hide beneath their seats, while others fled to {{the eastern end of}} the train and tried to enter the next car. Ferguson <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> of the train and shot people to his right and left as he passed each seat, briefly facing each victim before firing. The New York Times later wrote the motions were [...] "as methodical as if he were taking tickets".

2500|$|Later, in Portland, Oregon, Betty (George's wife) told Dean Higinbotham, {{the nephew}} of Betty's sister, Evangeline [...] "Eva", how George got the name Gorgeous George. In the early 1940s George had a wrestling match at the Portland Oregon Armory. [...] As he <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> to the ring, there were two mature women on his right, two rows back from the ring. One of the women loudly exclaimed, [...] "Oh, isn't he gorgeous." [...] That word [...] "gorgeous" [...] struck George and he {{immediately}} felt he had found his new professional persona. [...] He would be [...] "Gorgeous George". [...] As Elsie Hanson, Betty's mother, was a skilled seamstress, George asked her to make him some resplendent capes that would accentuate his new persona. [...] George wore those capes in all his future matches.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} after the birth of her {{daughter}} in 1965, Joni Anderson was gigging again around Yorkville, beginning to sing more of her original material for the first time, written with her unique open tunings. In March and April she found work at the Penny Farthing, a folk club in Toronto. There she met Chuck Mitchell, an American folk-singer from Michigan. Chuck was immediately attracted to her and impressed by her performance, and he told her that he could get her steady work in the coffeehouses he knew in the United States. In one interview, Mitchell claimed she married Chuck only 36 hours after they met, but it is unclear if they were ever married in Toronto. Sometime in late April, Mitchell left Canada for the first time, going with Chuck to the US, where the two began playing music together. Joni, 21 years old, married Chuck in an official ceremony in his hometown in June 1965 and took his surname. She said, [...] "I made my dress and bridesmaids' dresses. We had no money...

2500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Frames were either written or co-written by DeWyze. He wrote around twenty songs and then {{selected}} thirteen to include on the album. Drew Pearson co-wrote [...] "Silver Lining", [...] "Fight" [...] and [...] "Like I Do" [...] with DeWyze. [...] "Like I Do" [...] {{was inspired by a}} friend of DeWyze's, who went through a similar situation. [...] "Who Would've Known" [...] was written for DeWyze's wife, Jonna Walsh, whom he married in July 2012. The song was played as she <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> at their wedding, and DeWyze also performed it himself during the reception. Walsh served as the inspiration for the song [...] "Breathing In" [...] as well, which DeWyze said is about how she is the anchor in his life and is able to bring him back to earth. Describing [...] "Don't Be Afraid" [...] as an [...] "internal monologue", DeWyze has called {{it one of the most}} personal songs that he has ever written. Although he generally does not like to release songs about himself and originally did not plan on having this one on the album, he was swayed by his manager, who overheard him working on it in the studio. Acoustic versions of all thirteen songs were recorded and included on the deluxe edition of the album.|$|E
