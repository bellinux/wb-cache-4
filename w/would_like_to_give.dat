We <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and {{to all the other}} people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E
5|$|By 1875 {{encroachment}} on Malvern's wastelands by landowners {{had reached}} new heights and {{action was taken}} by the people of Malvern and the Commons Society to preserve the hills and common land and to prevent encroachment. Local lords of the manor indicated that they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> their rights to the wastes to the public. After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern hills and the first Malvern Hills Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.|$|E

But the emperor, with Fuheng's encouragement, made it clear that no compromise with the Burmese could be made. The dignity of the state demanded a full surrender.

25|$|On the January 20 {{episode of}} Raw, Eric Bischoff made an {{announcement}} about how Stone Cold Steve Austin {{walked out on}} Vince McMahon {{during the summer of}} 2002 with no explanation and that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Steve Austin an opportunity to give his side of the story. Bischoff also invited Steve Austin to make an appearance at next month's No Way Out. The following week, Bischoff stated that Austin has agreed to tell his story in the Raw magazine. On the February 3 episode of Raw, Bischoff headed to Texas, to sign Austin to the Raw brand. But, he was unsuccessful in doing so, as he couldn't locate Austin anywhere. The following week on Raw, Bischoff (kayfabe) fired Jim Ross, after Bischoff stated that it was Ross' fault that Austin hasn't signed yet to the brand. Vince McMahon, who the previous week stated he would fire Bischoff and Chief Morley for the way they were running Raw the last couple of weeks, asked Bischoff if he'd signed Austin yet, which prompted Bischoff to say No. J.R. informed McMahon that Austin would be at No Way Out, which led to McMahon booking a match between Bischoff and Austin for the pay-per-view.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is {{notified}} by TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{that he has}} received a promotion as [...] "junior-in-charge-boy of the entire NBC page program" [...] but {{that he will have}} to move out to Los Angeles, which does not sit well with Kenneth. Kenneth tells Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) about this, but Tracy advises him to do a lousy job so that he loses the promotion. While giving a tour around the 30 Rock building, Kenneth does a terrible job, {{and as a result of}} his behavior, Pete is forced to dismiss him. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) is shocked to see her boyfriend and Jenna impersonator, Paul (Will Forte), dressed as singer Cher. At Feyoncé (Susan Heyward) and Grizz Griswold's (Grizz Chapman) wedding, which is being held at the TGS set, Jenna is not amused that Paul showed up dressed as Cher, but is surprised that Paul is dressed as her on his left side and Cher on his right, and as a result, the two make-up. Later, at Grizz's wedding, Jack tells Liz that Carol is looking for her. Carol tells Liz that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> her a chance so that the two can have a relationship. At the same time, Kenneth, who is drunk, gets on stage, and gives a ranting speech to his former co-workers, ultimately telling them that he loves them all and hopes that they get everything they want in life.|$|E

2500|$|In 1955, Liberace was at {{the height}} of his career when tapped by Warner Bros. for his first {{starring}} motion picture, Sincerely Yours (1955), a remake of The Man Who Played God (1932), as a concert pianist who turns his efforts toward helping others when his career is cut short by deafness. In April 1955, Modern Screen magazine claimed Doris Day had been most often mentioned as Liberace’s leading lady, [...] "but it is doubtful that Doris will play the role. Liberace’s name alone will pack theatres and generous Liberace <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a newcomer a break." [...] (Joanne Dru, an established movie actress, was the leading lady.) When Sincerely Yours was released in November, the studio mounted an ad and poster campaign with Liberace’s name in huge, eccentric, building-block letters above and much larger than the title. [...] "Fabulously yours in his first starring motion picture!" [...] was a tag line. The other players and staff were smallish at the bottom. The film was a critical and commercial failure since Liberace proved unable to translate his eccentric on-stage persona to that of a movie leading man. Warner quickly issued a pressbook ad supplement with new [...] "Starring" [...] billing below the title, in equal plain letters: [...] "Liberace, Joanne Dru, Dorothy Malone". TCM's Robert Osborne recalls a more dramatic demotion: When Sincerely Yours played first run at the Orpheum in Seattle, the billing was altered even more: Joanne Dru, Dorothy Malone, and Alex Nicol above the title (with big head shots of all three) and below the title in much smaller letters: [...] "with Liberace at the piano". [...] Originally, Sincerely Yours was meant to be the first of a two-picture movie contract, but it proved a massive box-office flop. The studio then bought back the contract, effectively paying Liberace not to make a second movie.|$|E

[...] The team resorts to releasing Angel's soul, believing Angelus knows helpful information about the beast. [...] Although the team takes safety precautions, Angelus is released from his cell by Cordelia, who is at the time {{under the influence of the}} soon to be born Jasmine. [...] Luckily they manage to restore Angel's soul, thanks to help from Faith and Willow. [...] Their efforts, however, do not prevent the coming of Jasmine, who was indirectly responsible for the work of the Beast. [...] Jasmine, it turns out, was formerly one of the Powers That Be and plans to solve all the world's problems by giving humanity total happiness through spiritual enslavement to her. [...] She arrives in our world through manipulation of Cordelia and Connor, using them as a conduit into our world, eventually forcing Cordelia to fall into a coma. [...] Fred is accidentally inoculated against Jasmine's spell by contact with her blood and frees the rest of the gang though they remain hopelessly outnumbered by thousands already entranced by Jasmine. [...] Angel travels through a magic portal into a world previously visited by Jasmine to find a way of breaking her power over L.A.'s populace. [...] By revealing her true name, they are able to break Jasmine's spell over everyone. [...] Jasmine confronts Angel, but is then killed by Connor. [...] Connor is revealed never to have been under Jasmine's influence, but he went along for the sake of having a semblance of family and happiness. [...] In the season finale, they are met by Lilah Morgan, the resurrected Head of Wolfram & Hart's Special Project Division, who congratulates them on preventing world peace, and says that as a token of their appreciation, Wolfram & Hart <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them the Los Angeles branch.
