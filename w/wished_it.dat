In January 2017 Gaiman confirmed the miniseries will be available on Amazon Prime in 2018 and will be broadcast on the BBC after its Amazon release.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} ratings {{near the}} season average, and garnered generally positive reviews from critics. Brown's performance was praised, {{as well as}} the twist in his character's storyline. Also applauded were both Sam's confrontation with Dean over his recent reckless behavior and the resulting reconciliation at the episode's end. Many critics found the presence of character Bela Talbot (Lauren Cohan) in the episode to be pointless, while the critic for TV Guide enjoyed McNab's cameo and <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> had been longer.|$|E
25|$|Although Tsar Peter the Great {{introduced}} the Idea of Progress to Russia, by the 19th century, the Tsars {{did not recognize}} “progress” as a legitimate aim of the state, {{to the degree that}} Nicholas II said “How repulsive I find that word” and <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> removed from the Russian language.|$|E

25|$|Among the South Slavs, {{and also}} among the Kashubs {{of what is now}} {{northern}} Poland, there was the belief that if a child was born with hair, a birthmark or a caul on their head, they were supposed to possess shape-shifting abilities. Though capable of turning into any animal they <b>wished,</b> <b>it</b> was commonly believed that such people preferred to turn into a wolf.|$|E
25|$|Twain's last {{work was}} his autobiography, which he {{dictated}} and {{thought would be}} most entertaining if he went off on whims and tangents in non-chronological order. Some archivists and compilers have rearranged the biography into a more conventional form, thereby eliminating some of Twain's humor and {{the flow of the}} book. The first volume of the autobiography, over 736pages, was published by the University of California in November 2010, 100years after his death, as Twain <b>wished.</b> <b>It</b> soon became an unexpected best seller, making Twain one of a very few authors publishing new best-selling volumes in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.|$|E

25|$|On 4 November 1569 Ferrières wrote from Holborn in London to Cecil recommending Giovanni Battista Agnello as 'a man {{of honest}} and industry'. With his letter he sent Cecil {{a copy of}} Agnello's book, saying that he <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> had been printed on cleaner paper, 'but that of dusky hue best suits the works of Vulcanicorum hominum'. The book which de Ferrières {{enclosed}} with his letter was Agnello's Espositione di Giouanbatista Agnello Venetiano sopra vn libro intitolato Apocalypsis spiritus secreti, published in London in 1566 as only the second book in Italian printed in England. The original work was an eight-page book in Latin, which Agnello had translated into Italian and elaborated with his own commentary. According to Linden, Agnello's purpose in the work was to explain the world soul in alchemical terms. Agnello's connection to Ferrières is not known, nor why he chose to recommend him to Cecil.|$|E
25|$|Agnello {{described}} {{himself on the}} title page of a published work in 1566 as 'Giovanbatista Agnello Venetiano'; however the date of his arrival in England from his native Venice is unknown. According to Castells, he was {{among a number of}} 'Protestant men of learning who came to London {{as a result of the}} Reformation'. Some sources state that he was the 'J.B. Agnelli' authorized to import gold bullion for use in English coinage from 1547 to 1549. However Jones states that Agnello did not arrive in England until 1569. According to Harkness, he lived in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and operated a 'dangerous blast furnace' there. What is known with certainty is that Agnello was recommended to Sir William Cecil by Jean de Ferrieres (1520–1586), the Vidame of Chartres, who on 4 November 1569 wrote to Cecil from Holborn commending Agnello as 'a man of honest and industry'. With his letter, the Vidame sent Cecil a copy of Agnello's book, saying that he <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> had been printed on cleaner paper, 'but that of dusky hue best suits the works of Vulcanicorum hominum'.|$|E
500|$|Brett Elston at GamesRadar {{thought the}} {{gameplay}} was [...] "fairly basic", but still enjoyed the game, calling it unusually well made. Nintendo Life's Dave Frear enjoyed the game, but <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> had included some puzzle elements {{rather than focusing}} entirely on combat; he did however find the strategic thinking involved in going back to earlier areas and {{figuring out how to}} save time to make up for this to some extent. Meanwhile, Jason Moore of N64 Magazine <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> had included role-playing elements. Frear enjoyed the replayability resulting from the multiple characters and difficulty settings. GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz called it [...] "excellent [...] solidly designed" [...] {{to the point where he}} would keep playing it despite the eye strain the Virtual Boy would give him.|$|E

500|$|By 1923, the Nazi Party (NSDAP) led by Adolf Hitler {{had created}} a small {{volunteer}} guard unit known as the Saal-Schutz (Hall Security) to provide security at their meetings in Munich. The same year, Hitler ordered {{the formation of a}} small bodyguard unit dedicated to his personal service. He <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> to be separate from the [...] "suspect mass" [...] of the party, including the paramilitary Sturmabteilung ("Storm Battalion"; SA), which he did not trust. The new formation was designated the Stabswache (Staff Guard). Originally the unit was composed of eight men, commanded by Julius Schreck and Joseph Berchtold, and was modeled after the Erhardt Naval Brigade, a Freikorps of the time. The unit was renamed Stoßtrupp (Shock Troops) in May 1923.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times {{thought it was}} a really good episode, and even <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> could have been turned into a movie, were Fringe to get into filmmaking. Josh Wigler of MTV {{thought it was a}} [...] "pretty cool" [...] mystery-of-the-week, and [...] "while not quite as strong as when the mythology is in full gear, 'What Lies Below' was {{nonetheless}} a compelling hour of television." [...] He was however bothered that there was no further information about the parallel universe. UGO Networks writer Alex Zalben compared [...] "What Lies Below" [...] to the similarly-plotted The X-Files episode [...] "Ice". Zalben concluded, [...] "Though both episodes are very good, 'Ice' {{is one of the best}} X-Files hours ever, perfectly channeling – but not ripping off – John Carpenter's The Thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as showing that Mitsuda was [...] "well ahead of the curve" [...] when he composed the Chrono Trigger soundtrack. [...] IGN described [...] "Chrono Trigger ~Orchestra Version~" [...] as having a heavy 1970's influence and as being [...] "a testament to Mitsuda's compositional skills", while calling [...] "Chrono Trigger Medley ~Orchestra Version~" [...] "playfully romantic" [...] with [...] "a fairy tale element" [...] {{in the beginning of the}} song that later transforms into [...] "an entirely more grandiose arena". Patrick Gann described the soundtrack as [...] "awesome" [...] and said that [...] "Kameoka is really good at orchestral arrangement". His primary complaint was the length of the album, as he <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> had been a full album instead of a [...] "mini-album" [...] of only two tracks.|$|E

500|$|In January 2015, a {{featurette}} {{focusing on}} Ultron was shown at Samsung's [...] "Night With Marvel" [...] {{event at the}} 2015 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Also at CES, Samsung revealed a selection of hardware inspired by the Avengers films, {{as well as a}} simulation of Avengers Tower via its Gear VR virtual reality device. A second trailer premiered on ESPN on January 12, 2015 during the broadcast of the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship. Mendelson enjoyed the trailer, but <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> did not reveal as many story elements as it did. However, he added, [...] "the marketing thus far [...] has been far superior to much of what sold The Avengers three years ago, both in terms of the specific footage and the artistic choices being made… I'm sold, and I imagine most of the general moviegoers are already onboard too." ...|$|E
500|$|The Maryhill Museum of Art in Maryhill, Washington was {{initially}} {{designed as a}} mansion for wealthy businessman Samuel Hill. However, at Loie Fuller's behest, the building {{was turned into a}} museum instead. Hill <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> to be dedicated in 1926, and he conceived it as a monument to peace, to his wife Mary, and to Queen Marie herself. Marie agreed to come to America and witness the dedication, especially as Fuller was an old friend of hers. Fuller quickly put together a committee that supported Marie's [...] "tour" [...] of America and arrangements were made for her departure. Marie viewed the tour as an opportunity to [...] "see the country, meet the people and put Romania on the map". She travelled by ship across the Atlantic Ocean and disembarked in New York, on 18 October 1926, accompanied by Prince Nicholas and Princess Ileana.|$|E
500|$|Other {{media outlets}} {{received}} the broadcast more positively. Film critic John Hartl of The Seattle Times {{noted that the}} ceremony [...] "was well-paced and filled with comics and comic film clips." [...] He also complimented producer Goldwyn for hiring comics including host Chase and presenters such as Rodney Dangerfield for helping [...] "to keep the show light and funny." [...] The New York Times columnist Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "This was the trimmest, most varied and best-paced program in years." [...] She also commented that without the witty banter of hosts Hogan and Chase, [...] "The show would have seemed notably lacking in luster." [...] Television editor Michael Burkett of the Orange County Register commented, [...] "Monday night's 59th installment was very nearly everything you could have <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> to be: quite entertaining, relatively fast-moving, unusually short on tastelessness and tackiness drenched in nostalgia, and featuring enough superbly chosen film clips for a monster round of Visual Trivial Pursuit.|$|E

[...] "I <b>Wish</b> <b>It</b> Would Rain's" [...] b-side, [...] "I Truly, Truly Believe", is a rare solo showcase for Franklin, the group's bass singer.|$|R

500|$|In {{more recent}} years, AllMusic critic Mark Deming {{noted in his}} review of the album that [...] "no major band had gone so deep into the sound and feeling of classic country (without parody or condescension) as the Byrds did on Sweetheart; {{at a time when}} most rock fans viewed country as a musical [...] "L'il Abner" [...] routine, the Byrds dared to declare that C could be hip, cool, and heartfelt." [...] Alexander Lloyd Linhardt, {{reviewing}} the album for Pitchfork Media, described it as [...] "a blindingly rusty gait through parched weariness and dusted reverie. It's not the natural sound of Death Valley or Utah, but rather, a false portrait by people who <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> was, which makes it even more melancholy and charismatic." [...] Journalist Matthew Weiner commented in his review for Stylus that [...] "Thirty-five years after it startled Byrds fans everywhere with its Podunk proclivities, Sweetheart remains a particularly fascinating example of two musical ships passing in the night, documenting both Parsons’ transformation into a visionary country-rock auteur and a pop band’s remarkable sense of artistic risk." ...|$|E
500|$|The Regionals {{songs by}} the Warblers {{were given a}} lukewarm reception. [...] "Stand" [...] was {{characterized}} by Lynch as [...] "bouncy fun, but in a bland, forgettable sense", and [...] "Glad You Came" [...] as [...] "rather unmemorable"; both songs received a [...] grade. Slezak gave the two songs a [...] "C+", and called Sebastian's lead vocals [...] "as bland as a bowl of plain lasagna noodles", and Canning described his as [...] "a weak voice that doesn't deliver a very convincing performance". Votta described [...] "Stand" [...] as [...] "lackluster and mild", but called [...] "Glad You Came" [...] the [...] "strongest Warbler number since Blaine's defection". She added, [...] "It's catchy and well-choreographed, and if Sebastian's addition to the Warblers spurred them to finally take their in-Dalton dance-heavy and exuberant performance style to competition, then it's a welcome one." [...] Hankinson noted that the Warblers [...] "performed two wonderful songs" [...] that were new to him. Flandez and Chaney, among others, <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> were Blaine leading the Warblers, not Sebastian.|$|E
500|$|Aly Semigran of MTV {{reviewed}} the episode's musical performances positively, calling [...] "Piano Man" [...] the series' [...] "most realistic musical number" [...] and writing that [...] "nothing even {{came close to}} the amount of awesome" [...] that was the [...] "Dream On" [...] duet. Semigran noted that McHale's songs [...] "proved he was {{a force to be reckoned}} with", and called the [...] "I Dreamed a Dream" [...] duet [...] "goosebump-inducing", observing: [...] "Pretty sure that's what musical theater lovers' dreams are made of." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal called Michele and Menzel's number [...] "one of the most touching duets in the show so far", stating: [...] "the vulnerability they both convey is stunning in its simplicity and perfection." [...] Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack wrote that the [...] "Piano Man" [...] duet was so good he <b>wished</b> <b>it</b> had been released for download. He rated the songs performed [...] "B+" [...] through to [...] "A" [...] and called [...] "Safety Dance" [...] one of his favorite moments of the episode, deeming it a [...] "joyous, huge performance—definitely one of the most elaborate numbers the show has done before." ...|$|E
