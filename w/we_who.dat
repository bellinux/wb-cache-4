Though at first less influential, Hazlitt's comments on the plays' dramatic structure and poetry and on the central themes and general mood of each play laid the groundwork for later critics' more elaborate interpretations. Frequently expressing the view that stage presentation could not do justice to Shakespeare's plays, Hazlitt nevertheless also found certain plays eminently actable, and he frequently admired the performances of certain actors, particularly Edmund Kean.|$|E

In his farewell speech at Johannesburg he concluded with {{a reference to the}} subject. 'When <b>we</b> <b>who</b> call ourselves Imperialists talk of the British Empire, we think of a group of states bound, not in an alliance or alliances that can be made and unmade but in a permanent organic union. Of such a union the dominions of the sovereign as they exist to-day are only the raw material.' This thesis he further developed in a magazine article written in view of the colonial conference held in London in 1907. He advocated the creation of a permanent deliberative imperial council, and favored preferential trade relations between the United Kingdom and {{the other members of the}} empire; and in later years he took an active part in advocating the cause of tariff reform and Imperial Preference.|$|E

500|$|Hazlitt {{incorporated}} into this chapter material from {{his review of}} Kean's performance of Hamlet at Drury Lane on 12 March 1814 ("Mr. Kean's Hamlet", The Morning Chronicle, 14 March 1814). That review already included Hazlitt's musings on the difficulty of presenting Hamlet on stage, after seeing how even his favourite Kean failed to interpret Hamlet's character adequately. The celebrated passages that begin with [...] "This is that Hamlet the Dane" [...] and include the assertion [...] "It is <b>we</b> <b>who</b> are Hamlet" [...] appear, however, only in the final form of the essay in Characters of Shakespear's Plays.|$|E

Hamlet to him as to his contemporaries was a modern character who was [...] "obsessed with evil in the world [...] long to escape from knowledge of it in themselves [...] pessimistic sense that suffering changes nothing and that the world must go on as it is." [...] Thus, Hazlitt could declare, [...] "It is <b>we</b> <b>who</b> are Hamlet." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{abstract}} {{patterns in}} dazzle camouflage inspired artists including Picasso. With characteristic hyperbole, he claimed credit for camouflage experiments, {{which seemed to}} him a quintessentially Cubist technique. In a conversation with Gertrude Stein shortly after he first saw a painted cannon trundling {{through the streets of}} Paris he remarked, [...] "Yes it is <b>we</b> <b>who</b> made it, that is cubism". In Britain, Edward Wadsworth, who supervised dazzle camouflage painting in the war, created a series of canvases after the war based on his dazzle work on ships. In Canada, Arthur Lismer used dazzle ships in some of his wartime compositions. In America, Burnell Poole painted canvases of United States Navy ships in dazzle camouflage at sea. The historian of camouflage Peter Forbes comments that the ships had a Modernist look, their designs succeeding as avant-garde or Vorticist art.|$|E

In Greenbank, Bristol, Stanton met with English suffragist Helen Bright Clark, and spoke to a group about the Bible position of woman. Clark questioned whether Stanton's liberal views had shocked some in attendance, and Stanton replied: [...] "Well, if <b>we</b> <b>who</b> do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, how is the world to make any progress in the theologies?

500|$|Before Eastman finishes, however, he enumerates {{several things}} that Hazlitt did {{formulate}} in an original manner. Besides such memorable expressions as [...] "It is <b>we</b> <b>who</b> are Hamlet", Hazlitt, like no critic before him, was supremely attentive to [...] "the whole interrelationship {{of one person}} with another, one mind with other minds—presences both physical and psychological upon a stage." [...] With this focus on what Hazlitt {{had to say about}} Shakespeare's stagecraft and the way his plays were acted, Eastman thus rescued him from the opprobrium of being associated, in the most superficial way, with the [...] "character" [...] critics. Differing from his contemporaries Lamb and Coleridge, [...] "Hazlitt [...] brings to Shakespeare both a drama critic's sense of the plays as theatre and a closet critic's sense that the theatre of the mind so far surpasses that of the stage that certain of the plays can only be acted there." ...|$|E
