50|$|In the {{horizontal}} columns a card may <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> {{to any other}} card in the column {{as long as it}} is in descending numerical sequence. For example, a six of hearts may <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> to a seven of any suit.

For example, a six and seven of hearts may <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> to an eight of any suit, but a six of hearts and seven of clubs cannot <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> together. Moving the top card in a column allows the topmost hidden card to be turned over. This card then enters into the play. Other cards can be placed on it, and it can <b>be</b> <b>moved</b> to other cards in a sequence or to an empty column.|$|R
