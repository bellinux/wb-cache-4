500|$|The first He 111B {{made its}} maiden flight {{in the autumn}} of 1936. The first {{production}} <b>batch</b> <b>rolled</b> off the production lines that summer, at Rostock. Seven B-0 pre-production aircraft were built, bearing the Werknummern (Works numbers) 1431 to 1437. The B-0s were powered by DB 600C engines fitted with variable pitch airscrews. The screws increased output by 149kW (200hp). The B-0 had a MG 15 machine gun installed in the nose. The B-0 could also carry 1,500kg (3,310lb) in their vertical cells. The B-1 had some minor improvements, including the installation of a revolving gun-mount in the nose and a flexible Ikaria turret under the fuselage. After improvements, the RLM ordered 300 He 111B-1s; the first were delivered in January 1937. In the B-2 variant, engines were upgraded to the supercharged 634kW (850hp) DB 600C, or in some cases, the 690kW (925hp) 600G. The B-2 began to roll off the production lines at Oranienburg in 1937. The He 111B-3 was a modified trainer. Some 255 B-1s were ordered. However, the production orders were impossible to fulfill and only 28 B-1s were built. Owing to the production of the new He 111E, only a handful of He 111B-3s were produced. Due to insufficient capacity, Dornier, Arado and Junkers built the He 111B series at their plants in Wismar, Brandenburg and Dessau, respectively. The B series compared favourably with the capacity of the A series. The bomb load increased to 1,500kg (3,300lb), while there was also an increase in maximum speed and altitude to 215mph (344km/h) and 22,000ft (6,700m) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} UV imprinting {{methods for}} fabricating a high-aspect-ratio pillar array. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold {{was selected as}} the UV imprinting mold. The pillar pattern was formed on a 50 × 50 mm 2 area on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film without remarkable deformation. The aspect ratios of the pillar and space were about four and ten, respectively. The mold was placed into contact with a UV-curable resin under a reduced pressure, and the resin was cured by UV light irradiation after exposure to atmospheric pressure. The PDMS mold showed good mold releasability and high flexibility. By moderately pressing the mold before UV-curing, the thickness of the residual layer of the imprinted resin was reduced and the pattern was precisely imprinted.

25|$|Further {{changes were}} made to the design, as No. A890 {{featured}} right-hand drive, impeding forward vision for viewing signals from the footplate. The main batch was produced with left-hand drive to resolve this problem. The main batch could also be distinguished by their higher running plates along the sides of the boiler, compared to the lower version on the rebuild that required larger wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving <b>wheels.</b> The main <b>batch</b> had also dispensed with the N class/Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) that was retained on the prototype, replacing them with one each side of the boiler. The production locomotives also had a flatter top to the dome covers than that seen on the rebuild. The cabside cutaways for driver visibility were also cut into the roof of A890, an arrangement reminiscent of the 2-cylinder U class rebuilds of K class locomotives.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the inter-roll pressures in the stands of 20 -high mills has been refined, with the profiling of the rolls taken into account. The determination of the contact arc distance has been made more accurate, with a great curvature of the contacting surface considered. A method of defining the rational hardness of the rolls for the stands of multi-roll mills has been devised. It {{has been suggested that}} the roll durability should be enhanced due to low-temperature tempering at the moment of achievement of the set condition of reversible damageability and release of carbides, as well as due to the creation of residual compression stresses in the near-surface layers of the rolls. The conditions providing a minimum wear of the rolls and a rational transfer of the microrelief to the strip have been defined. Steels for the microband mill rolls have been recommended. A process of making precision rolls has been developed. A test <b>batch</b> of the <b>rolls</b> has been made.

40|$|Quality is the watchword of {{any type}} of business. A product without quality leads to loss and lack of {{customer}} satisfaction. This is true in case of textile industries also. Textile manufacturing {{is a process of}} converting various types of fibers into yarn, which in turn woven into fabric. Weaving process is used to produce the fabric or cloth by interlacing two distinct set of yarn threads namely warp yarn and weft yarn. In textile industries, quality inspection {{is one of the major}} problems for fabric manufacturers. Currently in textile industries manual inspection is carried out. The fabric obtained from the production machine are <b>batched</b> into larger <b>rolls</b> and subjected to the inspection frame. The nature of the work is very dull and repetitive. Due to manual inspection of the manufactured fabric, there is a possibility of human errors with high inspection time. The development of an automated web inspection system requires robust and efficient fabric defect detection techniques. For the detection of fabric defects, the pre-processed image is decomposed into its bit planes. The lower order bit planes are found to carry significant information of the location and shape of defects. Then we find the exact location by means of weighted morphology. Robustness with respect to the changes in parameters of the algorithm has been examined. The test results obtained exhibit accurate defect detection with low false alarms, thus showing the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed detection scheme...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a one-dimensional cutting stock procedure which will minimize material wastage when {{a batch of}} small pieces are cut from several long pieces. The problem differs from the classical one-dimensional cutting stock problem in that {{the dimensions of the}} material to be cut are random variables due to fringe defects caused by the production process. Examples of such processes include the production of flat glass, laminated board, corrugated board, adhesive tape, carpeting, and insulating tape. The cutting procedure inevitably generates some material wastage and process delays caused by the need to set cutting knives in required positions. The approach followed in this paper is to minimize material wastage when cutting a <b>batch</b> of identical <b>rolls</b> of insulating tape from several long rolls with stationary cutting knives. An exact solution is presented for the case in which the variability of defects at both ends is independently distributed and the two distributions differ by a location parameter only. An approximate solution is also presented when the two end defect distributions differ by both scale and location parameters. The wastage resulting from the use of these procedures is then compared with the wastage generated when the positioning of the knives is altered every time an original piece is cut. This comparison enables management to decide when the positioning of the cutting knives should be fixed. production/scheduling: cutting stock, inventory/production: reject allowances, probability: stochastic model applications...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} the universal empirical relationships {{that allow for}} operational calculation of scale mass and decarbonized layer depth based on {{the parameters of the}} technological process for rolled coil steel production. Methodology. The research is carried out on the industrial <b>batches</b> of the <b>rolled</b> steel of SAE 1006 and SAE 1065 grades. Scale removability was determined in accordance with the procedure of «Bekaert» company by the specifi-cations: GA- 03 - 16, GA- 03 - 18, GS- 03 - 02, GS- 06 - 01. The depth of decarbonized layer was identified in accordance with GOST 1763 - 68 (M method). Findings. Analysis of experimental data allowed us to {{determine the}} rational temperature of coil formation of the investigated steel grades, which provide the best possible removal of scale from the metal surface, a minimal amount of scale, as well as compliance of the metal surface color with the require-ments of European consumers. Originality. The work allowed establishing correlation of the basic quality indicators of the rolled coil high carbon steel (scale mass, depth of decarbonized layer and inter-laminar distance in pearlite) with one of the main parameters (coil formation temperature) of the deformation and heat treatment mode. The re-sulting regression equations, without metallographic analysis, can be used to determine, with a minimum error, the quantitative values of the total scale mass, depth of decarbonized layer and the average inter-lamellar distance in pearlite of the rolled coil high carbon steel. Practical value. Based on the specifications of «Bekaert» company (GA- 03 - 16, GA- 03 - 18, GS- 03 - 02 and GS- 06 - 01) the method of testing descaling by mechanical means {{from the surface of the}} rolled coil steel of low- and high-carbon steel grades was developed and approved in the environment of PJSC «ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih». The work resulted in development of the rapid method for determination of total and remaining scale mass on the rolled coil steel surface of low- and high-carbon steel grades depending on the temperature coil formation.

40|$|Advantages of {{implementation}} of power plants based on electrochemical reactions are successfully {{demonstrated in the}} USA and Japan. One of the msot promising types of fuel cells (FC) {{is a type of}} high temperature fuel cells. At present, thanks to the efforts of the leading countries that develop fuel cell technologies power plants on the basis of molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) are really close to commercialization. One of the problems that are to be solved for practical implementation of MCFC and SOFC is a problem of corrosion of metal components of stacks that are assembled of a number of fuel cells. One of the major components of MCFC and SOFC stacks is a bipolar separator plate (BSP) that performs several functions - it is separation of reactant gas flows sealing of the joints between fuel cells, and current collection from the surface of electrodes. The goal of Task 1 of the project is to develop new cost-effective nickel coatings for the Russian 20 X 23 H 18 steel for an MCFC bipolar separator plate using technological processes usually implemented to apply corrosion stable coatings onto the metal parts for products in the defense. There was planned the research on production of nickel coatings using different methods, first of all the galvanic one and the explosion cladding one. As a result of the works, 0. 4 x 712 x 1296 mm plates coated with nickel on one side were to be made and passed to ANL. A line of 4 galvanic baths 600 liters was to be built for the galvanic coating applications. The goal of Task 2 of the project is {{the development of a new}} material of an MCFC bipolar separator plate with an upgraded corrosion stability, and development of a technology to produce cold roll sheets of this material the sizes of which will be 0. 8 x 712 x 1296 mm. As a result of these works, a pilot <b>batch</b> of the <b>rolled</b> material in sheets 0. 8 x 712 x 1296 mm in size is to be made (in accordance with the norms and standards of the Russian metallurgical industry) and supplied to the partner for tests in a stack of fuel cells. A feasibility study on the cost of the Russian material for a BSP is to be done on Tasks 1, 2 in case the annual order makes up 400, 000 sheets. The goal of Task 3 of the project is to research on possible implementation of cermet compositions on the basis of LiAlO{sub 2 }, TiN, B{sub 4 }C, ceramics with Ni and Ni-Mo binders. BaCeO{sub 3 } conductive ceramics with metal binders of Ni, Ni-Cr etc. were also planned to be studied. As a result of these works, a pilot batch of samples is to be made and passed to FCE for tests. The goal of Task 4 of the Project is development of a new alloy or alloys with a ceramic coating that will have upgraded corrosion stability in operation within a SOFC. A new alloy was to be worked out by the way of modification of compositions of industrial alloys. Ceramic coatings are to be applied onto ferrite steel produced serially by iron and steel industry of Russia as sheet iron...|$|R
