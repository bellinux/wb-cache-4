5|$|In 1848 the Hungarian Lazzlo Magyar {{ascended the}} Congo to the Yellala falls, before {{spending}} five years exploring {{the region to}} the south. Due to his lack of contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> the valuable information that he gathered received little circulation.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2005 {{profile in}} the book Madcap by biographer and {{journalist}} Tim Willis, Barrett, who had reverted to using his original name of Roger, continued to live in his late mother's semi-detached home in Cambridge, and had returned to painting, creating large abstract canvases. He was also {{said to have been}} an avid gardener and his main point of contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> was his sister, Rosemary, who lived nearby. He was reclusive, and his physical health declined, as he suffered from stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 11 he {{was sent}} to a reform school in Texas for two years. He {{explains}} the reason for this in an interview: [...] "I had too much energy for my body to contain”. In that school he lost touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world’s</b> art, especially music.|$|R

5|$|Communication <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> on {{the land}} side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed {{on the western side}} {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E
5|$|Dawson {{remained}} relatively lawful, {{protected by the}} Canadian NWMP, which meant that gambling and prostitution were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low. By contrast, especially the port of Skagway under US jurisdiction in Southeast Alaska became infamous for its criminal underworld. The extreme climate and remoteness of the region in general meant that supplies and communication <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> including news and mail were scarce.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the Mycenaean centers {{witnessed}} increased contacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> {{and especially}} with the Cyclades and the Minoan centers in the island of Crete. Mycenaean presence appears to be also depicted in a fresco at Akrotiri, on Thera island, which possibly displays many warriors in Boar's tusk helmets, a feature typical of Mycenaean warfare. In the early 15th century, commerce intensified with Mycenaean pottery reaching the western coast of Asia Minor, including Miletus and Troy, Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt.|$|E

In the novel The Golden Man (Az Arany Ember), published in 1872, Ada Kaleh is called the [...] "No One's Isle" [...] and it becomes an almost mythical symbol of peace, seclusion and beauty, juxtaposed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> material <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ex-State's Attorney Peter Florrick (Chris Noth) {{returns home}} to an {{emotional}} reunion with his children, Zach (Graham Phillips) and Grace (Makenzie Vega), while his wife Alicia (Julianna Margulies) looks on. Peter had been imprisoned for several months after being convicted of charges of corruption. He is allowed to return home under house arrest while his appeal is considered. Peter must wear an ankle monitor and cannot leave the apartment or communicate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> Alicia is uncomfortable about Peter's return because of his infidelity, which was exposed {{at the time of}} his conviction.|$|E
5|$|A new offer {{had arrived}} for Pei from the Chinese {{government}} in 1982. With {{an eye toward}} the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the Bank of China. The Chinese government was preparing for {{a new wave of}} engagement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.|$|E
5|$|Abe refines this {{proof-of-concept}} {{and builds}} a stable time-apparatus ("the box"), sized {{to accommodate a}} human subject. Abe uses this box to travel six hours into his own past—as part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, {{so as not to}} interact or interfere <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits inside the box for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist.|$|E

50|$|Lacan {{emphasised}} {{instead the}} importance of the third party in the Oedipus complex - what he called “the place that she mother reserves for the Name-of-the Father in the promulgation of the law”. He saw this as a vital element in helping each new member of the human race to move from an exclusive, primary relation to the motherer to a wider engagement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> cultural <b>world</b> - <b>the</b> symbolic order.|$|R

5|$|Albania still {{maintained}} some links <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> at this time, {{trading with}} neutral countries, such as Austria and Sweden, and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former colonial power Italy. However, a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals, {{the young and}} the military, whom he feared might threaten his hold on the country. A new constitution was introduced in 1976 that increased the Communist Party's control of the country, limited private property and forbade foreign loans. The country sank into a decade of paranoid isolation and economic stagnation, virtually cut off from the outside world.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{planners}} considered tactical {{surprise to}} be a necessary {{element of the}} plan for the landings. Information on the exact date and location of the landings was provided only to the topmost levels of the armed forces. Men were sealed into their marshalling areas {{at the end of}} May, with no further communication <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> Troops were briefed using maps that were correct in every detail except for the place names, and most were not told their actual destination until they were already at sea. A news blackout in Britain increased the effectiveness of the deception operations. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned, and movement within several kilometres of the coast of England restricted.|$|E
5|$|At 19:30 General Carey {{directed}} {{that the}} remaining elements guarding the Annex be withdrawn to DAO headquarters (the Alamo) where {{the last of}} the evacuees would await their flight. Once completed, the new defensive perimeter encompassed only LZ 36 and the Alamo. By 20:30 the last evacuees had been loaded onto helicopters. With the evacuation of the landing control teams from the Annex and Alamo completed, General Carey ordered the withdrawal of the ground security forces from the DAO Compound around 22:50. At 23:40 Marines destroyed the satellite terminal, the DAO Compound's last means of direct communication <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> At 00:30 on 30 April, thermite grenades, having been previously placed in selected buildings, ignited as two CH-53s left the DAO parking lot carrying the last elements of BLT 2/4.|$|E

5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it {{was in danger of}} being driven on the rocks. Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1999, Weezer had once again gone their separate ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special Goodness, guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs {{he was working on}} to Bell.|$|E
5|$|Communications <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> {{went through}} a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was {{replaced}} by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three teletypewriters with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since {{there was no way}} to prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.|$|E

5|$|During {{its early}} days of settlement, the Lower Clarence {{district}} lacked roads; virtually all communication within the area and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> depended upon water transport. Lower Clarence settlers were by necessity good oarsmen, and several of them became national and even world champion scullers. Rush, who in his prime was {{over six feet tall}} and weighed 13 stone, soon distinguished himself as a powerful 'puller'. He rowed the heavy settlers’ boats, also known as 'butcher boats' delivering meat to Clarence River customers. By 1866, Rush was competing in various regattas regularly held among the riverside settlements of Ulmarra, Lawrence, Brushgrove and Rocky Mouth.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm's final landfall, Mexico's Secretariat of National Defense {{deployed}} 800 {{troops to}} Nuevo León and Tamaulipas under Plan DN-III-E to help aid operations. The troops enforced mandatory evacuations of 3,337 residents of San Fernando and Soto la Marina in Tamaulipas. Throughout Nuevo León, 60,000 people were evacuated from their homes. In Tamaulipas, 263,000 people {{were affected by}} Hurricane Alex, and 2,260 homes were flooded. In Coahuila, 80,000 were affected by Alex's remnants, leaving 30% of the municipalities of the state without communication <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> 20,000 were considered total losses, {{most of them in}} Sabinas. Approximately 500,000 people were affected by floods throughout northeastern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} year, the {{garrison}} would be plagued by mosquitoes and the heat and humidity common to the Washington area during the summer. Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, {{a breeding ground for}} malaria. Communication <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule. Trips to Washington or Uniontown from the fort were uncommon, and by virtue of its location at the extreme end of the Eastern Branch defenses, Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts.|$|E
