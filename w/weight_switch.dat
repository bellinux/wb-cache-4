40|$|Photon-mediated {{switching}} of polymer solubility plays {{a crucial}} role in the manufacture of integrated circuits by photolithography. Conventional photoresists typically rely on a single switching mechanism based on either a change in polarity or, molecular weight of the polymer. Here we report a photoresist platform that uses both mechanisms. The molecular <b>weight</b> <b>switch</b> was achieved by using a poly(olefin sulfone) designed to undergo photo-induced chain scission. The polarity switch was achieved using pendant groups functionalized with o-nitrobenzyl esters. These are hydrophobic photosensitive-protecting groups for hydrophilic carboxylic acids. On irradiation, they are cleaved, making the polymer soluble in aqueous base. Importantly, the resists do not contain photoacid generator, so do not suffer from problems associated with acid diffusion that are detrimental to pattern fidelity. The 193 nm photochemistry of polymer thin films was followed using grazing angle attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry, and measurements of solubility in aqueous base. The nanoscale patterning performance of the polymers was also assessed using 193 nm interference lithography and electron-beam lithography. The implications of using dual switching mechanisms are discussed...|$|E

In this study, a <b>weight</b> <b>switching</b> tri-state {{median filter}} (TSM) is {{proposed}} for removing impulse noise in both smooth and complicated {{regions of the}} dealing images. The switching scheme adopted large center weight while removing impulse noise of the complicate regions and switched to small center weight while dealing with the smooth regions.

40|$|Using {{accurate}} value-added trade {{data would}} improve exchange rate assessments. Real effective exchange rates based on value-added trade weights would reveal more accurate measures of competitiveness {{of a country}} than those based on gross trade <b>weights.</b> <b>Switching</b> to value-added trade weights could have potentially important implications; for example, some exchange rates that might be considered “misaligned ” using gross trade weights {{may no longer be}} so using value-added trade weights (or vice-versa). Real effective exchange rates based on value-added trade would improve our estimates of the impact of changes in relative prices, including that on global rebalancing. For instance, in our forthcoming paper, 2 we find that a downstream (as opposed to upstream) position in a supply chain cushions the impact of relative price changes on both exports and imports. This reflects the higher foreign content in the downstream country’s exports, which mitigates the impact of exchange rate changes (see more detail below). Decomposing foreign value added (FVA) in exports by source country would help us understand how disruptions to supply chains can have spillover effects. Disruptions of trade flows could be either policy induced, such as preferential/regional trade agreements, o...|$|R
