40|$|Recent discoveries have {{revealed}} the key role of mTOR (target of rapamycin) in aging. Furthermore, rapamycin extends lifespan in mice, especially in female mice. Here, we treated obese male mice on high-fat diet with rapamycin given intermittently: either <b>weekly</b> (<b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week)</b> or alternating bi-weekly (three injections every other week). While only marginally reducing obesity, intermittent administration of rapamycin significantly extended lifespan. Significance was achieved for weekly treated group {{and for the}} three rapamycin-received groups combined. In weekly treatment group, 100 % mice were alive {{by the age of}} 2 years, whereas 60 % of mice died in untreated group by this age. The effect of weekly treatment on survival was highly significant and cannot be fully explained by partial reduction in obesity. Alternating bi-weekly treatments seem to be less effective than weekly treatment, although effects of additional factors (see Discussion) may not be excluded. After one year of treatment, all survived mice were sacrificed 8 days after the last administration of rapamycin to avoid its direct interference with parameters examined. Fasting levels of cardiac and hepatic p-S 6, a marker of mTORC 1 activity, were lower in weekly treatment group com-pared with control mice. In contrast, levels of p-Akt (S 473), glucose, triglycerides and insulin were unchanged, whereas leptin and IGF- 1 tended to be lower. Thus, weekly treatment with rapamycin may slow down aging in obese male mice on high-fat diet. Key words: aging; anti-aging agent; longevity; mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin; mortality; obesity; rapamycin...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Analyze {{the changes}} in the seminiferous {{epithelium}} in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis (CCl 4). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight male Wistar rats aged 45 - 50 days, weighing 150 - 180 grams were used. Twenty-two rats underwent CCl 4 -induced cirrhosis with CCl 4 0. 25 mL/Kg <b>weekly</b> intragastrically <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week,</b> during 10 weeks. Additionally, they had a 44 % food restriction diet (Group 1). The control group was divided in two subgroups: 13 rats had a 44 % food restriction diet and no CCl 4 (Group 2) and 10 rats were not submitted to CCl 4 or food restriction (Group 3). After 10 weeks, the rats were sacrificed and liver sections were collected for histological analysis. The testicular analysis was carried out to evaluate the frequency of tubules in stages VIII and XIV. RESULTS: The mean rates of stage VIII in animals with food restriction plus CCl 4 -induced cirrhosis and food restriction without CCl 4 were significantly different from animals without either food restriction or CCl 4 (18. 1 ± 5. 5 %, 20. 5 ± 2. 5 % and 13. 4 ± 3. 5 %, respectively, p = 0. 002). The mean rate of stage VIII in rats with cirrhosis was not significantly different from rats without cirrhosis (18. 1 ± 5. 5 % and 17. 4 ± 4. 6 % respectively). The mean frequency of stage XIV in rats with cirrhosis was significantly greater than rats without cirrhosis (4. 7 ± 2. 3 % and 6. 8 ± 1. 9 % respectively, p = 0. 027). CONCLUSION: Animals with CCl 4 -induced cirrhosis and food restriction have shown alterations in spermatogenic cycle that were not seen in rats without CCl 4 -induced cirrhosis and food restriction...|$|R
40|$|Background: Non-healing trophic ulcers in Hansen's disease {{patients}} {{is one of}} the major causes for disability. It has been shown that autologous platelet-rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) is effective in healing chronic non-healing leg ulcers. Aim: The objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of autologous platelet-rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) in non-healing trophic ulcers in patients treated for Hansen's disease. Design: A prospective study. Setting: An institution-based clinic. Participants: Seven treated patients with Hansen's disease, with a mean age of 38. 33 years, with nine non-healing trophic ulcer of more than 6 weeks duration. Measurements: Photographs were taken before treatment and at every subsequent sitting. Area and volume were calculated at baseline and every subsequent sitting till the closure was achieved. Materials and Methods: The healthy ulcers were treated with PRFM at <b>weekly</b> intervals, repeated <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> for <b>a</b> maximum of five sittings as per requirement. Results: The mean percentage improvement in the area was 93. 52 %, and volume was 97. 74 % at the end of the second sitting. All ulcers closed by a maximum of five sittings. No adverse events were noted. Conclusion: PRFM for the treatment of trophic ulcers in treated patients with Hansen's disease is a feasible, safe, simple and inexpensive method...|$|R
60|$|He had {{not said}} it surlily, but sadly, {{and with a}} gentle deprecation of their insistence. While the several monuments that testified to his cousin's wealth and munificence rose in the village beyond the brook, he {{continued}} in the old homestead without change, except that when his housekeeper died he began to do for himself the few things that the ailing and aged woman had done for him. How he did them was not known, for he invited no intimacy from his neighbors. But from {{the extent of his}} dealings with the grocer it was imagined that he lived mainly upon canned goods. The fish man paid him <b>a</b> <b>weekly</b> visit, and <b>once</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> he got from the meat man a piece of salt pork, which it was obvious to the meanest intelligence was for his Sunday baked beans. From his purchase of flour and baking powder it was reasonably inferred that he now and then made himself hot biscuit. Beyond these meagre facts everything was conjecture, in which the local curiosity played somewhat actively, but, for the most part, with a growing acquiescence in the general ignorance none felt authorized to dispel. There had been a time when some fulfilled a fancied duty to the solitary in trying to see him. But the visitors who found him out of doors were not asked within, and were obliged to dismiss themselves, after an interview across the pickets of the dooryard fence or from the trestles or inverted feed pails on which they were invited to seats in the barn or shed. Those who happened to find their host more ceremoniously at home were allowed to come in, but were received in rooms so comfortless from the drawn blinds or fireless hearths that they had not the spirits for the task of cheering him up which they had set themselves, and departed in greater depression than that they left him to.|$|R
