5|$|In October 1944, Leipzig {{collided}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> cruiser Prinz Eugen; {{the damage}} was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. The ship was patched up to keep her afloat, and she helped to defend Gotenhafen from the advancing Red Army in March 1945. She then carried a group of fleeing German civilians, reaching Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for minesweeping forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the kinematics of <b>the</b> throw <b>with</b> <b>the</b> competition hammer (7. 26 kg) and <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer (8. 0 kg). Sixteen male hammer throwers threw hammers of both weights at maximum effort. Utilizing 3 high-speed video cameras (300 fps), three-dimensional coordinates of the hammer head and 25 landmarks on the body were obtained by the direct linear transformation method. Hammer head velocity and distance thrown <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer were significantly lower than for <b>the</b> throw <b>with</b> <b>the</b> competition hammer. Durations of the turn and double support phase (DSP) in <b>the</b> throw <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer were significantly longer than <b>with</b> <b>the</b> competition hammer. Focusing on changes in the velocity of the hammer head, the duration of acceleration <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer during <b>the</b> 1 st and 2 nd turns was longer than for the competition hammer. The Y component of displacement of the center of gravity for <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer was longer in every phase than for the competition hammer. These results suggest that <b>the</b> throw <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavier</b> hammer can be an effective training method for acquiring a longer movement of the center of gravity toward the throwing direction during the DSP and longer acceleration of the hammer head...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the battle the ROK III Corps was located to the east of the US 24th Infantry Division of the US IX Corps, defending the 38th parallel to the north of Gapyeong (Kapyong) and Chuncheon. Composed of four divisions, the ROK III Corps placed its ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the corps' left flank at the hills north of Gapyeong, while the ROK 5th Infantry Division defended the corps' center at Chuncheon. The cold winter created great difficulties for the South Korean defenders, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> snow hindering construction and icy roads limiting food and ammunition supplies. North Korean guerrillas were also active in the region, and had caused serious disruption {{in the rear of the}} ROK III Corps.|$|E
5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war, though Leipzig was in very poor {{condition}} following an accidental collision <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> cruiser Prinz Eugen {{late in the}} war. Leipzig was therefore used as a barracks ship before being scuttled in 1946. Nürnberg, however, emerged from the war largely unscathed, and as a result, was seized by the Soviet Navy as war reparations, and commissioned into the Soviet fleet as Admiral Makarov; she continued in Soviet service until the late 1950s, and was broken up for scrap by 1960.|$|E
5|$|In a heavy fog in October 1944, Leipzig {{collided}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> cruiser Prinz Eugen; {{the damage}} was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. Instead, they repaired Leipzig enough to keep her afloat, and in that state, provided gunfire support to the defenders of Gotenhafen against the advancing Red Army in March 1945. As the Germans continued to retreat in the east, Leipzig was then used to transport a group of fleeing German civilians. She reached Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for minesweeping forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E

5|$|Repairs were {{completed}} by March 1941, Lützow returned to Norway {{to join the}} forces arrayed against Allied shipping to the Soviet Union.

Sunk in shallow waters in the Kaiserfahrt in April 1945 by Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers, Lützow was used as a gun battery to support German troops fighting the Soviet Army until 4 May 1945, when she was disabled by her crew. Raised by the Soviet Navy in 1947, she was subsequently sunk as a target in the Baltic.|$|E

5|$|After safely {{returning}} to port in Kiel, Leipzig {{was taken into}} the Deutsche Werke shipyard for repairs. She was decommissioned while under repair and reclassified as a training ship. To accommodate additional training crews, four of the ship's boilers were removed. She returned to service in late 1940. In early June 1941, she escorted the heavy cruiser Lützow (formerly Deutschland) to Norway. After {{she returned to the}} Baltic, she and the cruiser Emden provided artillery support to advancing German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. In September, she supported the invasion of the Baltic islands in the West Estonian archipelago. While bombarding Soviet positions on Moon Island, Leipzig was attacked unsuccessfully by the Soviet submarine Shch-317. In late September, the ship joined the German Baltic Fleet, centered on the battleship Tirpitz; the fleet was tasked with blocking a possible Soviet attempt {{to break out of the}} Baltic. Leipzig returned to Kiel in October, and conducted maneuvers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> cruiser Admiral Scheer. Leipzig became the flagship of the training fleet in 1942; she spent the year performing training duties.|$|E
5|$|In September, October and November 1810, British forces {{arrived from}} Madras, Bombay and the Cape of Good Hope, {{warships}} joining Rowley's squadron off Isle de France and soldiers gathering at Rodriguez. The buildup of forces {{was prompted by}} the defeat at Grand Port combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> losses of East Indiamen during 1809 and 1810; the British authorities were determined to end {{the threat posed by}} the French squadron on Isle de France before the hurricane season made travel in the region too dangerous. In fact, the threat from Isle de France was already substantially reduced: the damage suffered by the French frigates in the engagements at Grand Port and during September could not be repaired with the available naval supplies on Isle de France. In addition, food supplies were running low due to the large number of British prisoners on the island and morale had collapsed in the aftermath of Hamelin's defeat.|$|E
5|$|On the Texas coast, Arlene {{produced}} a small storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.2 m) in some areas, breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding. The storm tide also eroded up to a foot (0.3 m) of sand from beaches {{in the lower}} Texas coast. Combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall associated with Arlene, the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches. Beach erosion occurred {{as far north as}} Galveston Bay, where tides were reported to be as high as 5 ft (1.5 m). A woman was swept into the sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard. Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi, a large funnel cloud was reported but never touched down or caused any damage. Nearby, the John F.

The historian Hans Georg Prager examined the former Soviet archives in the early 2000s, and discovered that Lützow actually had been sunk in weapons tests in July 1947.|$|E
5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following the enforced retirement of Harry Wainwright, {{who had left}} a range of competent but unspectacular locomotive classes that struggled {{to cope with the}} increased train lengths and loadings. Maunsell reviewed the situation and planned to introduce six standard classes – using only two boiler designs – which would work the entire traffic of the railway. The first of these was the Nclass 2-6-0, which gave the SECR a capable mixed-traffic locomotive. For the express passenger design that could cope <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> boat trains, Maunsell wanted to enlarge the existing Lclass 4-4-0 with Walschaerts valve gear and an enlarged superheater, but this design would have resulted in a too heavy axle loading. Maunsell's newly recruited assistants, G.H.Pearson and Harold Holcroft from the Great Western Railway at Swindon and James Clayton from the Midland Railway at Derby, had recently been involved in the design of large passenger tank engines and persuaded him to use the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement, which would allow the class to operate at high speeds on the poor-quality track in north Kent.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese forces {{lacked the}} ability to lay siege to the city, so the {{evacuation}} order caught Peng by surprise. On the morning of January 3, Peng ordered the PVA 13th Army to pursue the retreating UN forces by attacking towards Seoul. The US 24th, 25th Infantry Division and the British 29th Infantry Brigade soon bore {{the brunt of the}} Chinese attacks. In US IX Corps' sector, PVA 38th Corps immediately attacked the US 24th Infantry Division as the American were trying to withdraw. In the fierce fighting that followed, the US 19th Infantry Regiment on the division's left flank was involved in numerous hand-to-hand struggles with the Chinese around Uijeongbu. The Chinese overran the E and G company of US 19th Infantry Regiment during their attacks, but American artillery and air strikes soon inflicted 700 casualties in return. Faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> Chinese pressure, the 27th Commonwealth Brigade was again called in to cover the retreat of US IX Corps. After the US 24th Division evacuated Seoul on the night of January 3, the 27th Commonwealth Brigade started to cross the Han River on the morning of January 4, and by 07:40 the entire US IX Corps had left Seoul.|$|E
