5|$|Before {{the trial}} began, public defender Blane Williams had urged Bell {{to accept a}} plea bargain. At trial he rested the defense case without calling any {{witnesses}} or offering any evidence. The six members of Bell's jury were all white. The 150-person jury pool included black citizens, who make up 10percent of the parish's population, {{but none of the}} 50potential jurors who showed up <b>was</b> <b>black.</b> Williams did not challenge the composition of the jury pool.|$|E
5|$|England have {{typically}} worn all-white shirts, white shorts with navy and white socks. The emblem on the shirts {{is a red}} rose, rather than the Plantagenet Three Lions displayed on the shirts of the England football and cricket teams. The strip is manufactured by Canterbury and O2 is the shirt sponsor. The change strip is normally red, although prior {{to the introduction of}} the red strip, navy blue was used and was reintroduced for the 2016-17 season. Purple was used as the change strip as of the 2009 autumn internationals, reflecting the traditional colour of the original England track-suits from the 1960s, 70s and 80s. For the 2011 Rugby World Cup the change kit <b>was</b> <b>black.</b>|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{also participated}} in the first {{integrated}} bowl game in the Deep South. The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers. There was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt {{should be allowed to}} play because he <b>was</b> <b>black,</b> and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to integration. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played which made the game the first integrated Sugar Bowl and the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte {{declared}} the First French Empire. In response to this, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II of the Habsburg dynasty declared his personal domain {{to be the}} Austrian Empire and became Francis I of Austria. Taking the colours of the banner of the Holy Roman Emperor, {{the flag of the}} Austrian Empire <b>was</b> <b>black</b> and gold. Francis II was the last Holy Roman Emperor, with Napoleon forcing the empire's dissolution in 1806. After this point, these colours continued to be used as the flag of Austria until 1918.|$|E
5|$|Rindt {{drove his}} first race at the Flugplatzrennen in 1961, in his grandmother's Abarth Simca 2000. After missing the {{official}} application period, he only entered after a friendly high-ranking motorsport functionary from Graz intervened on his behalf. During the race, he <b>was</b> <b>black</b> flagged for his dangerous driving style and therefore disqualified; {{he did not}} immediately return to the pit lane as {{he was unaware of}} the regulations. Rindt entered several rallies with his Simca but did not achieve good results. It was only when he was provided with a race-prepared Alfa Romeo GT 1300 at cost price and with free servicing by a local dealer that he became more successful. In the Alfa Romeo, he achieved eight victories.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{viewed the}} cosmos as highly structured; there were {{thirteen}} {{levels in the}} heavens, and nine levels in the underworld; the mortal world occupied a position between the heavens and the underworld. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour. Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours; north was white, east was red, south was yellow, and west <b>was</b> <b>black.</b>|$|E

5|$|The former England home strip {{was white}} with {{a strip of}} red around the neck, and the away strip <b>was</b> <b>black</b> (causing much {{controversy}} due to the famous All-Black kit of New Zealand), both kits had a ground breaking new technology {{in the form of}} a gripper print. A special strip was worn during the match versus Wales in the 2010 Six Nations Championship which replicated that worn in 1910 to celebrate the 100 year anniversary of Twickenham.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} home jersey was white {{with black and}} red stripes. The original 'away' jersey <b>was</b> <b>black,</b> with white and red trim. Shoulder patches used a winged 'S' 'established MDCCCXCIV' (1894) logo. The League changed its policies on coloured and white jerseys and the white jersey became the away jersey. The club would use the white jersey with the original logo {{until the end of}} the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship between black and white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship <b>was</b> <b>black.</b> If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E

This species has a very narrow base of elytra, elytra widened in the back and the head much bigger than similar ones.|$|R
2500|$|..... the {{statement}} that all ravens <b>are</b> <b>black</b> <b>is</b> not merely satisfied by evidence of a <b>black</b> raven but <b>is</b> favored by such evidence, since a black raven disconfirms the contrary statement that all ravens <b>are</b> not <b>black,</b> i.e. satisfies its denial. A black raven, in other words, satisfies the hypothesis that all ravens <b>are</b> <b>black</b> rather than not: it thus selectively confirms that all ravens <b>are</b> <b>black.</b>|$|R

5|$|Johnson {{allegedly}} remarried, {{this time}} to Angeline Johnson, in the early 1930s, but, as with Harris, {{it is unlikely that}} the union was officially registered. Throughout the Great Depression and the 1940s, he performed in several cities and towns in Texas, including Beaumont. A city directory shows that in 1945, a Reverend W. J. Johnson—undoubtedly Blind Willie—operated the House of Prayer at 1440 Forrest Street, in Beaumont. In 1945, his home was destroyed by a fire, but, with nowhere else to go, Johnson continued to live in the ruins of his house, where he was exposed to the humidity. He contracted malarial fever, and no hospital would admit him, either because of his visual impairment, as Angeline Johnson stated in an interview with Charters, or because he <b>was</b> <b>black.</b> Over the course of the year, his condition steadily worsened until he died, on September 18, 1945. His death certificate reported syphilis and blindness as contributing factors.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} restart, Ragan <b>was</b> <b>black</b> flagged for {{changing}} lanes {{before the start}} / finish line just before the sixteenth caution came out after a three-car accident, involving Earnhardt, Jr.; Newman; and Truex, Jr. During the caution, Ragan drove to pit road, giving the lead to Trevor Bayne, with Labonte second. On the final lap of a second green-white-checker finish, Edwards and David Gilliland mounted a charge on the inside lane. Exiting turn four, Edwards drew alongside Labonte and closed in on Bayne, {{who moved to the}} bottom to block Edwards and maintained the lead to win his first race in his Sprint Cup Series career at the age of 20. Edwards finished second, ahead of Gilliland in third and Labonte in fourth. Kurt Busch clinched the fifth position; Montoya, Smith, Kyle Busch, Menard, and Martin rounded out the top ten finishers in the race.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu was the {{smallest}} of all emus, and had darker plumage than the mainland emu. It <b>was</b> <b>black</b> and brown, and had naked blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the mainland. The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive Kangaroo Island emu (D. n. baudinianus) {{in a number of}} osteological details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island emu probably did not differ much from that of the mainland emu. The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly, and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow, and consisted of dead leaves and moss. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were incubated by both parents.|$|E

50|$|Between 1882 and 1968, 4,743 {{people were}} {{reported}} lynched in the United States and 3,446 <b>were</b> <b>black.</b> In 1914, the Tuskegee Institute reported that 51 of 55 lynching victims <b>were</b> <b>black.</b> That same year the Crisis, a NAACP magazine reported that 69 of 74 victims <b>were</b> <b>black.</b> In Florida, mobs lynched five victims.

5|$|The {{majority}} of material created for previous games, {{such as the}} BLiTZ system and the design of maps, was carried over. Alongside this, improvements {{were made to the}} game's graphics and some elements were expanded, such as map layouts, mission structure, and the number of playable units per mission. A part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character's body. In order to achieve this, the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed, as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements. They also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series' gameplay. The newer systems were decided upon early in development. The character designs were done by Raita Honjou, who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games. When creating the Nameless Squad, Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game: the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality, despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the Valkyria Chronicles world. The main color of the Nameless <b>was</b> <b>black.</b> As with the previous Valkyria games, Valkyria Chronicles III used the CANVAS graphics engine. The anime opening was produced by Production I.G.|$|E
