40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{from which}} we start our approach is the one according to which the philosophicaldiscourse is a specific way of communicating the reality. The base of the philosophical communication issurprise, doubt, uncertainty, anxiety, all generated by the fundamental interrogations of Kantian origin: Howmuch am I able to know? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do? What am I allowed to hope? The answers to all thesequestions were set up in philosophical concepts and visions, all of them leading to communication, trying toexpress themselves and make themselves understood. Communicability is {{the very essence of}} thephilosophical approach. Actually, communication is a fundamental philosophical attitude as I, in my capacityof human being, live only with the other, in full interaction. On my own I am nothing. Throughout this paperwe find arguments for the idea according to which the philosophical discourse subordinates an art ofgenuinely living and communicating about balance and avoidance of excess, about the ability to assume andovercome, about lucidity and wisdom, about credibility, certainty and truth, about freedom and limitation,about the meaning and value of the human condition...|$|E
40|$|Performance {{assessment}} and {{the measurement of}} the quality of service delivery have been associated in the public mind with innovative companies in the private sector, We are now in an environment where quality and customer service are becoming central to the success of any business, especially service industries.

The image of public' sector organisations such as health boards is often one of a large centralised bureaucracy, governed by multiple regulations where change is difficult to effect and where staff motivation, in the absence of monetary or other incentives, can be problematic. I am delighted that this project, linking staff motivation with voluntary performance assessment, has dispelled these myths, In the project, piloted in three different work locations, the group have established that irrespective of the type of service its quality can be measured and motivation of staff can be improved, leading to a significant improvement in service delivery.
