5|$|On October 10, 2011the {{day before}} Chandler's 65th birthdayFlorida Governor Rick Scott signed Chandler's death warrant. His {{execution}} {{was set for}} November 15, 2011, at 4:00pm. His lawyer, Baya Harrison, said that Chandler asked him not to file any frivolous appeals to keep him alive. Harrison said: He is not {{putting a lot of}} pressure on me to go running around at the end to find some magic way out. He is not going to make a scene. He's not going to bemoan the legal system. What he has told me is this: if there is some legal <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find to try to prevent him from being executed, he would like me to do what I reasonably can. Harrison also said that Chandler suffered from high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, problems with his kidneys and arthritis.|$|E

He said, [...] "If you impose this {{program on the}} small farmers, who are already overburdened, you're {{going to have to}} send the police for me. I'm 75 years old. I've about completed my responsibilities to my family. I'll lose very little in going to jail in opposition to your program – and I'll have to do it. Because I will be, in every <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> conceive of, a non-cooperator." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hudson {{has stated}} that her {{biological}} father [...] "doesn't know me from {{a hole in the}} wall", and that she considers Russell her father. Her biological father indicated that though he had made several efforts to connect with Kate and Oliver, neither of them reciprocated. Hudson has described her mother as [...] "the woman that I've learned the most from, and who I look up to, who has conducted her life in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> look up to". She has four half-siblings: Emily and Zachary Hudson, from her biological father's later marriage to actress Cindy Williams; Lalania Hudson, from his relationship with another woman; and Wyatt Russell, from her mother's relationship with Kurt Russell.|$|E
60|$|But {{the case}} was {{otherwise}} here. My mother was convicted of felony for a certain petty theft scarce worth naming, viz. having an opportunity of borrowing three pieces of fine holland of a certain draper in Cheapside. The circumstances are too long to repeat, and I have heard them related so many <b>ways,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> scarce be certain which is the right account.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a series}} of strong debate performances, Healey was able to cut Patrick’s lead in half, to 13 points, as voters became more {{familiar}} with her stances on key issues. [...] However, Healey was unable to overcome Patrick’s early lead and the split of conservative support caused by Mihos’ candidacy. In her concession speech, Healey stated: “I've been blessed to serve with our great governor, Governor Romney, and I will look forward to continuing to find <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> serve the Commonwealth and others throughout my life.” ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{we were so}} much of {{the same}} sentiments, in so many <b>ways,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hope to speak with sympathy, if not always with {{complete}} understanding, of Stevenson. Like a true Scot, he was interested in his ancestry, his heredity; regarding Robert Fergusson, the young Scottish poet, who died so young, in an asylum, as his spiritual forefather, and hoping to attach himself to a branch of the Royal Clan Alpine, the MacGregors, as the root of the Stevensons. Of Fergusson, he had, in early youth, the waywardness, the liking for taverns and tavern talk, the half-rueful appreciation of the old closes and wynds of Old Edinburgh, a touch of the recklessness and more than all the pictorial power which, in Fergusson, Burns so magnanimously admired.|$|R
2500|$|With {{the filing}} {{deadline}} for candidates looming, Lawrence said in January that [...] "we have adopted this other formula - a makeshift redistricting - and that's {{what it will}} be - to hurtle this present situation of avoiding having an election of all 27 member of Congress at large. Subsequent legislatures, I hope, will {{be in a position to}} redistrict the state properly, and have an equitable division somewhere close to the 419,000 mean". The governor called a special session of the legislature to convene on January 22, for the purpose of drawing up congressional districts. Chester's Democratic state representative, John E. Gremminger (aka [...] "Reds Gremminger"), attacked Bell's plan to combine Delaware and Chester counties into one district, with two congressmen elected at-large, calling it [...] "unworkable and un-American". After an inconclusive meeting with Lawrence and Morse, Bloom declared: [...] "If this matter had been left to the legislature to decide early last year, without outside interference, we would have had a solution now and there would have been no reason for a special session. As Republican state chairman I shall assist and advise in every <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can,</b> but the final decision on what districts will be eliminated is a matter for the legislature and its committees to decide." [...] Morse, in turn, retorted: [...] "It would appear that responsibility for the delay is going to be placed exactly where it belongs - with the Republicans." ...|$|E

He was one of {{fourteen}} players who made their international debut at the friendly tournament which ran from 15 January until 21 January. Berisha made his debut for the national team when he replaced Alexander Søderlund as a 62nd-minute substitute in a 1-1 friendly draw against Denmark League XI on 15 January 2012. He started the remaining two games of the tournament against Thailand and South Korea U23. When asked whether he agreed with the plaudits he had gained from the press and coaches at the tournament, Berisha said, [...] "I am very happy ... I've tried to show <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> work hard both <b>ways,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> take initiative {{with or without the}} ball, in challenge and with speed - I feel I've managed well." ...|$|R

Within a couple semesters, it's been pretty steady at 40 - 50 students each time. That has made it easier to make sure we have at least two sections of 20 students each. Because I was trained in English and now I am in American Studies, I think my approach is somewhat different from some of my colleagues [...] . I learned little tricks {{to make sure they are}} taking ownership of their own writing and taking ownership of their mistakes. There are <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> alert them without doing line-by-line editing, alert them of their grammar issues or their organizational issues without marking up their paper that much.

60|$|To deal truly, this is {{the only}} <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> discover, whereby the IDEAS OF THINGS are brought into the understanding. If other men have either innate ideas or infused principles, they have reason to enjoy them; and if they are sure of it, it is {{impossible}} for others to deny them the privilege that they have above their neighbours. I can speak but of what I find in myself, and is agreeable to those notions, which, if we will examine the whole course of men in their several ages, countries, and educations, seem to depend on those foundations which I have laid, and to correspond with this method in all the parts and degrees thereof.|$|E
40|$|An {{exhibition}} of graphic work by Simon Read: My {{proposal for the}} exhibition at the Cut Gallery is that, rather than show a selection of studio work, I would focus primarily on drawing and more specifically upon drawing that {{is used as a}} means of exploring ideas and even more specifically laying stress upon work that has been carried out within this region. My decision to do this was {{not just a matter of}} accessibility, but more to use it as a platform for how an artist can use work directly as a vehicle for exploration and engaging with contemporary issues, such as environmental change. Over the last ten years I have increasingly sought ways in which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> actively contribute to this debate. Being based upon the Suffolk Coast in daily contact with a changing estuary landscape, means <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have a privileged insight, which <b>I</b> now feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> articulate through my relationship with the local community. Now I find myself operating on many levels, my public role has expanded to put me on more committees than I would have initially imagined and I am energetically exploring <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> establish interdisciplinary collaborations in an academic context. It is always difficult to square this kind of involvement with the autonomy of an artist's practice. This is something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot claim to have an answer for but have the conviction that, if pursued, it is bound to make sense. To this end <b>I</b> have suggested <b>that,</b> rather than a finite show of work, this exhibition should be taken in the spirit of an open question.

40|$|My {{research}} interests involve {{looking at the}} system as a whole to identify new <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> innovate in some combination of the compiler, operating system, and hardware, for the sake of solving important systems problems. My particular emphasis is on software performance and reliability. <b>I</b> believe <b>that</b> my broad, end-to-end view of system behavior enables me to find creative ways to match the relative strengths of one part of the system with the relative weaknesses of other parts of the system, so that the pieces come together in a complementary way and my overall solution is effective. For example, my thesis research on a decoupled approach to monitoring the behavior of device drivers at run-time and preventing them from corrupting device state has involved novel hardware [1] and compiler [2] support to reduce monitoring overhead, along with novel operating system support [4] to enable the monitoring and prevent device corruption. Through this whole-system approach, I was able to create a new capability (that was previously impractical) for protecting systems from bugs in critical software with negligible run-time overhead in most cases. Looking ahead, <b>I</b> believe <b>that</b> my strengths as a researcher in this broad set of systems areas equip me well to tackle important challenges in executing software reliably and efficiently in future systems (especially in a cloud computing environment). 1 Research to date: Making correctness checking fast and effective The error-prone nature of software development has made it necessary for end users to carefully evaluate the inherent risks of running defective software.
