5000|$|An {{incentive}} {{to get out}} of the <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> is that the return to the labour market gives a person chances of moving up the career ladder, improving old and acquiring new job skills, etc., thus eventually improving standard of living. Policies that allow for the continued receipt of benefit payments for a period of time after entering work or up to a specific earnings ceiling may also eliminate the <b>welfare</b> <b>trap.</b> For example, for UK claimants of Incapacity Benefit or Employment Support Allowance, [...] "permitted work" [...] arrangements allow for paid work up to either 16 hours or £95 per week without the withdrawal of the disability benefit payments, leading to a net overall increase in income. However, any earnings over £20 may be taxed, and additional earnings may affect receipt of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, which is an example of the <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> reamaining potentially in effect. To eliminate the <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> entirely would require a policy that permanently continues benefit payments regardless of any conditions, with no income from paid work being withdrawn. One example of this would be unconditional basic income.|$|E

Ensuring the <b>welfare</b> of <b>trapped</b> individuals {{can only be}} achieved by trapping methods that meet accepted standards of animal welfare. At the international level, the assessment of mechanical properties of killing and restraining traps is set out in two documents published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Few traps currently in use have been tested according to the ISO standards and, in addition, new traps have been designed and old traps modified {{since the publication of}} the standards. In this paper we review trapping methods used in Europe and North America to see whether they meet the ISO standards and examine ways to improve the <b>welfare</b> performance of <b>traps.</b> In addition, international legislation is assessed to determine whether this ensures a sufficient level of <b>welfare</b> for <b>trapped</b> animals. Finally, trapping practices used in academic research are reviewed. We conclude that many of the practices commonly used to trap mammals cannot be considered humane. Current legislation fails to ensure an acceptable level of welfare for a large number of captured animals. New <b>welfare</b> standards for <b>trapping</b> wild mammals need to be established so that in future a minimum level of welfare is guaranteed for all trapped individuals...|$|R

5000|$|The {{term used}} for this concept varies {{depending}} on country.

50|$|Tim Worstall, {{a writer}} and blogger, has argued that {{traditional}} welfare schemes create a disincentive to work, because such schemes typically cause people to lose benefits at around the same rate that their income rises (a form of <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> where the marginal tax rate is 100 percent). He has asserted that this particular disincentive is not a property shared by basic income, as {{the rate of increase}} is positive at all incomes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> (or {{unemployment}} trap or poverty trap in British English) theory asserts that taxation and welfare systems can jointly contribute {{to keep people}} on social insurance because the withdrawal of means tested benefits that comes with entering low-paid work causes there to be no significant increase in total income. An individual sees that the opportunity cost of returning to work is too great for too little a financial return, and this can create a perverse incentive to not work.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} problem of {{effective}} taxation {{at the lower end}} of the income scale in Germany. For the recipients of social income maintenance [...] currently about 1. 8 million nationals [...] effective taxation consists not only of the explicit taxation through the tax code but also of the implicit taxation through the withdrawal of benefits. The paper calculates effective tax rates for recipients of social assistance; it is shown that for labor incomes in the lower income range explicit and implicit taxation add up to a marginal burden of just under 75 percent on average. The 1996 tax reform alleviates the explicit tax burden on low incomes, but it does not alleviate the total marginal burden on labor earnings of welfare recipients. It increases net incomes, but since the withdrawal of benefits increases with net incomes, too, the overall burden remains practically unchanged. Therefore, effective <b>welfare</b> <b>traps</b> remain prevalent; these could only be avoided through a reform of the system of social assistance and withdrawal. Constraints and possible steps for reform are discussed. ...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the main}} distortions {{sometimes}} said to have arisen in the United States and the UK {{as a result of}} tax policy is the creation of a permanent underclass, dependent on welfare and discouraged (by the tax system) from seeking work and betterment. In some countries the tax system can be badly designed to deal with such issues, e.g. sometimes the marginal tax rate that applies to earned income (as someone takes work attempting to escape from unemployment and welfare) is so high that the person's take-home income (post-tax and after taking account of any benefits or welfare receipts) does not increase as a result of taking work. This is known as the <b>welfare</b> <b>trap.</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite {{low levels}} of youth {{unemployment}} in Norway, concerns have been raised about the high numbers of youth in inactivity, receiving health related social security benefits. It is argued that parts {{of the system of}} social security may work as <b>welfare</b> <b>traps.</b> OECD recommends <b>welfare</b> policies with the overall aim of fostering youth employability, not benefit dependency. In this article we use a unique combination of register data and survey data from the panel survey “work, lifestyle and health”. This survey follows a representative sample of the cohorts born between 1965 and 1968 from 1985 through follow-ups in 1987, 1989, 1993 and 2003. This allows us to follow individual life trajectories from ages 17 - 20 to 35 - 39. The aim of the article is first to study the impact of substance abuse upon risk of receiving social assistance, since previous research has found that receiving social assistance increases the probability of labour market exclusion in adulthood. Second, we analyse the impact of receiving social assistance, to have mental health problems and substance abuse in youth and consequences for labour market integration in adulthood. Analyses reveal that neither cannabis use nor alcohol consumption in youth have a direct effect on the risk of labour market exclusion in adulthood. However, cannabis use increases the probability of receiving social assistance, which in turn increases risk of labour market exclusion in adulthood. Mental health problems in youth increase risk for later labour market exclusion, but these effects are mediated through factors like problem behaviour related to alcohol abuse and the use of illegal drugs other than cannabis. Receiving social assistance in youth has long time effects on the risk of labour market exclusion, especially for individuals from the lower socioeconomic groups...|$|R

50|$|A {{negative}} {{income tax}} {{is intended to}} create a single system that would not only pay for government, but would also fulfill the social goal {{of making sure that}} there was a minimum level of income for all. It is theorized that, with an NIT, the need for minimum wage, food stamps, welfare, social security programs and other government assistance programs could be eliminated, thus reducing the administrative effort and cost to a fraction of what it is under the current system, as well as eliminating the perverse incentives created by these overlapping aid programs, e.g. when a minimum wage worker who earns a little more nets out with less income because they are newly ineligible for aid. Theoretically, the worker would then be stuck in a <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> and would have no incentive to seek higher wages.|$|E

One report ordered by the House of Commons of England suggested that temporarily restoring the badge would serve to dissuade such individuals from seeking out relief. The report further argued that [...] "the Poor ought to know and feel that the eye of the public is upon them ready to check fraud and restrain importunity", and that the badge was one such means. Charles Jerram, an evangelical priest of the Church of England, did not go so far as to call for the revival of the badge, but did call for some means by which to distinguish [...] "the profligate pauper from the unfortunate and virtuous sufferer".|$|E

40|$|Does {{globalization}} {{undermine the}} fiscal {{basis of the}} welfare state? The conventional wisdom believes so: open borders cause tax competition, which in turn leads to a {{race to the bottom}} in capital taxation. However, the data show that revenues from capital taxation are fairly stable in OECD countries. Some observers conclude from this that globalization does not pose much of a challenge to the welfare state. This conclusion is unwarranted because it overlooks that tax competition was not the only challenge facing welfare states during the 1980 s and 1990 s. There was also slow growth, rampant unemployment, and high levels of precommitted spending. These problems exerted countervailing pressures that prevented a race to the bottom in taxation. Yet, {{this does not mean that}} national autonomy has not been diminished.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, EU {{institutions}} have been increasingly concerned with the issues of unemployment reduction and job creation. The EU has recommended that member states develop welfare systems that moderate {{the negative effects of}} market relationships on the one hand, and enhance the efficiency of market performance on the other. This paper provides an overview of labour market policies to protect individuals from unemployment. It shows that in the context of EMU and EU enlargement, policies such as unemployment insurance could improve welfare, {{to the extent that it}} encourages labour mobility, but has negative effects on individuals’ job search efforts. To counter <b>welfare</b> and inactivity <b>traps,</b> member state governments are asked to reform benefit and tax systems towards more employment-friendly policies. Further, the effect of population ageing on the labour force is considered, along with options to sustain labour force supply and state pension provision. The paper concludes that measures to expand the range and quality of employment opportunities available to older workers will become increasingly important and that governments will have an important educational and coordinating role to play in facilitating these adjustments. ...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{demonstrates}} {{the existence of}} a <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> in the Czech Republic, created by the tax and social security systems. Combining individual data from the Czech Labor Force Survey and the Czech Household Income Survey, the analysis exploits the difference between the available social benefits and the net household income when a person is employed. This information allows us to calculate the net replacement rate based on the parameters of the taxation system and rules for means-tested social benefits at the household level. Estimates imply {{the existence of a}} <b>welfare</b> <b>trap,</b> which means that individuals who receive relatively higher social benefits {{are also more likely to}} remain unemployed. It is shown that the most affected groups are those with low education and long unemployment spells. Furthermore, the paper documents the disadvantaged position of women in the Czech labor market. The estimates imply that women outflows to employment are particularly influenced by the high social benefits, and the existence of a <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> persists even when the job-search intensity is controlled. This finding contributes to the discussion on the persistent and large unemployment gender gap in the Czech Republic. The results of the analysis support policy improvements towards low-income households. A better harmonization of tax and social security systems is necessary in order to ensure that the incentives to leave unemployment are not hampered by high social benefits...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} public housing subsidies on employment outcomes using the 1999 - 2005 public housing administrative data from Western Australia. The existing public housing literature presents two opposing arguments on the impacts of public housing on employment. Public housing can {{have a positive impact}} by providing security of tenure. On the other hand, neighbourhood and stigma effects and the withdrawal of housing subsidies as income increases can depress work effort. It is often difficult to accurately measure the impact of public housing on employment because public housing is correlated with unobservable factors that may discourage employment. This study addresses this issue by using a quasi-experimental approach in which individuals who entered public housing within the timeframe form a treatment group that can be compared to a control group consisting of public housing applicants who did not enter public housing within the timeframe. We find that transition into public housing has a positive net impact on employment outcomes, and the impact is twice as high for males as it is for females. We attempt to unbundle this positive impact into a <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> effect and a housing stability effect. Where a <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> exists, individuals depress their labour supply while on the public housing wait list in order to maintain eligibility for public housing. A housing stability effect improves the employment outcomes of individuals once they hav...|$|E
40|$|Between May 1978 and December 1983, the {{sociologist}} Ray Pahl conducted seven extensive {{interviews with}} a couple from Sheppey that he called “Linda” and “Jim. ” These not only informed a key chapter in Pahl’s classic book Divisions of Labour but also evolved into a uniquely intimate account of how a family used to “getting by” (though never “affluent”) coped with the hardships and indignities of long-term reliance on welfare benefits. Perhaps inevitably, fascinating aspects of Linda and Jim’s testimony were left unused in Divisions of Labour, primarily because they were marginal to Pahl’s principal aim of demonstrating how the state <b>welfare</b> system could <b>trap</b> a family in poverty.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{distinctive}} challenges faced by female travellers (Roma, Sinti and Gypsy) in starting their own business. Design/methodology/approach – The paper details a pilot “start your own business” programme that was delivered in Ireland to 12 women from the traveller community. Findings – Four distinct categories of entrepreneurship barriers faced by female travellers were recognised: self-esteem, traveller identity, <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> and family responsibilities. Research limitations/implications – The findings are based on just one programme and so no general conclusions can be drawn. Practical implications – The paper identifies the successes and failures of the programme, plus it highlights the future steps that need to be taken to bring appropriate entrepreneurship support to traveller women who experience triple discrimination – discrimination as women, as travellers and as traveller women. Originality/value – Very little is known about female travellers in terms of entrepreneurship activity and so this is a significant addition to a very small body of knowledge...|$|E

40|$|Early Childhood Education in Australia {{has been}} {{identified}} in the current Federal government's Building the Educational Revolution educational reforms as a "critical starting point for policy action" (McKew, 2008). Consequently, additional Early Childhood Education places have been created at preservice teacher education institutions since 2007 to ensure Early Childhood Education is conducted by qualified teachers with specific expertise. Early Childhood teacher education programs are not only a way of {{improving the quality of}} education for the very young but also of lifting many childcare workers out of a poverty and <b>welfare</b> <b>trap,</b> from a largely casualized workforce into a more stable and better remunerated professional career pathway. Childcare workers, along with cleaners, have been identified in national research projects (Masterman-Smith, May & Pocock, 2005) as Australia's working poor. This paper examines the experiences of preservice teachers in an innovative wholly online Early Childhood teacher education program offered at James Cook University since 2007 which provides access to teacher education for childcare workers all over Australia.

40|$|This paper uses panel {{data from}} the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) to analyze welfare entry and exit among natives and {{immigrants}} after a substantial reform of the welfare system (``Hartz reform''). Using results from dynamic multinomial logit models, we calculate transition matrices between three mutually exclusive labor market states (inactivity, employment, welfare receipt) for five groups: natives, all immigrants, EU citizens, non-EU citizens, and immigrants with German citizenship. The empirical results show that temporal persistence in welfare participation can {{for the most part}} be explained by observed and unobserved characteristics. In general, immigrants appear to have a higher risk of welfare entry and a lower probability of welfare exit compared to natives. We find no evidence of a failure of the welfare system {{in the sense that it}} creates a <b>welfare</b> <b>trap.</b> Instead, the immigrant-native gap in welfare dependence arises from an insufficient labor market integration and an increased risk of unemployment for immigrants. The analysis identifies non-EU citizens, who are mostly of Turkish origin or citizens of the successor states of former Yugoslavia, as a group with particularly poor labor market prospects: they have the lowest employment stability, the highest persistence in welfare participation, the highest welfare entry rate, and the lowest welfare exit rate...|$|E

Hansen et al. (2006) use survey data to study social assistance dynamics in Canada from 1993 to 2000. They find evidence for the existence of true state dependence, but its extent differs among the different geographical regions of Canada. Hansen and Lofstrom (2009) use administrative panel data to study the transition dynamics among unemployment, employment and social assistance in Sweden from 1990 to 1996. They find that refugee immigrants experience a higher structural state dependence than natives. Whereas 17 % of the observed state dependence for natives is structural, the same figure amounts to approximately 80 % for immigrants from refugee countries. The authors argue that this observation might result from the existence of a <b>welfare</b> <b>trap</b> for refugee immigrants, while the high persistence rate of natives and non-refugee immigrants, in the raw data, mostly arises from unobserved individual heterogeneity. Bhuller et al. (2017) use comprehensive administrative data to study welfare state dependence in Norway.
