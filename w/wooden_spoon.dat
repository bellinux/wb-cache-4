5|$|France did not impress under Saint-André, {{finishing}} {{no higher}} than fourth in the Six Nations during his tenure and even claiming the <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> in 2013.

5|$|In {{what turned}} out to be their final ever game, Cumberland were only able to field eleven out of the {{required}} thirteen players. The club ended up borrowing two players from the opposing team North Sydney to play for them, who were 'Paddy' Boland and Bert Odbert. They lost this game 45–0 and were awarded the <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> for finishing on the bottom of the competition ladder.|$|E
5|$|A belief {{from the}} Leskovac region states the ala is a monster with an {{enormous}} mouth who holds in her hand a big <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon,</b> with which she grabs and devours everything that gets in her way. One story has it that a man kept such an ala in his barn; she drank thirty liters of milk every day. Another warns that ale {{in the form of}} twelve ravens used to take the crops from vineyards.|$|E

5|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{attributed to}} the ala is extreme voracity; in the Leskovac region, she was imagined as a monster with a huge mouth and a <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> in her hand, with which she grabbed and devoured whatever came her way. According to a widely spread tradition, ale used to seize children and devour them in her dwelling, which was full of children’s bones and spilt blood. Less often, they attacked and ate adults; {{they were able to}} find a hidden human by smell.|$|E
5|$|England {{started the}} {{following}} decade with a Grand Slam {{victory in the}} 1980 Five Nations – their first for 23 years. However in the 1983 Five Nations Championship, England failed to win a game {{and picked up the}} <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon.</b> In the first Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, England were grouped in pool A alongside Australia, Japan and the United States. England lost their first game 19–6 against Australia. They went on to defeat Japan and the United States, and met Wales in their quarter-final, losing the match 16–3.|$|E
5|$|Statistically, Cumberland are {{the worst}} team {{in the history of}} first-grade rugby league in Australia. They only have won 12.5% of their games, lowest to Annandale (18.3%), who are also a defunct team. They won the <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> for being last on the table in the 1908 season. They had only one win which was 14–6 over Western Suburbs, and had their worst loss in their final game against Norths, 45–0. They lost six {{consecutive}} games from 9 May 1908 until 27 June 1908, a win, then a final loss. They scored an average 4.75 points each game whereas they had an average of 23.88 points scored against them.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{claiming}} the premiership in 1945, Eastern Suburbs {{failed to make}} the finals for the following seven seasons. A runners-up finish in 1960 was the closest the club came to {{claiming the}} premiership during this era. Eastern Suburbs were soundly defeated 31–6 in the grand final that year, by the famous record-beating St George outfit. In 1966, the club fell to new depths and was winless {{for the first time in}} its history. It was also the last occasion in which the Roosters won the <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> until claiming it again in the 2009 season. It ended a poor run for Eastern Suburbs; from 1963 to 1966, they won 8 of 72 matches, finishing second to last in 1964 and last in the other three years. The club underwent a renaissance in 1967 after appointing Jack Gibson as coach (1967–68), and introducing a new emblem on the playing jerseys, the rooster.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the Roosters {{became the}} first club to play 100 seasons of first grade rugby league; {{they were the only}} outfit to play in each season since the competition's {{inception}} in 1908. They appointed Chris Anderson as coach in 2007 and 2008 following two relatively unsuccessful years under Ricky Stuart. On 9 July 2007, Anderson resigned after a 56–0 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. Assistant Coach Fittler acted as the caretaker {{for the remainder of the}} 2007 season, before being appointed in August to the top job for two years. With eight rounds remaining in a disappointing 2009 season in which the Roosters finished with the <b>wooden</b> <b>spoon</b> for the first time in 43 years, Fittler was informed he would not be the coach in 2010, his position to be taken by veteran coach Brian Smith. The Roosters wound up winning only five games for the entire season; twice against Cronulla and once against each of Canberra in Canberra, eventual grand finalists Parramatta and Newcastle in Newcastle.|$|E
