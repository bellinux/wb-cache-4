5|$|On December 12 the Dukes faced {{off against}} another local rival, Robert Morris. In a 59–54win, B.J. Monteiro again {{led the team}} with 17points. Monteiro's {{continued}} high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back to the bench, or if someone else would lose their starting position. Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of plant {{material}} is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of Ficus species, Leucopogon species, Exocarpos species, a cycad Macrozamia riedlei, a mistletoe Lysiana exocarpi, Astroloma humifusum, A.pinifolium, Myoporum insulare, Enchylaena tomentosa and Coprosma quadrifida. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as Pyracantha angustifolia and P.fortuneana, and Cotoneaster species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various stone fruit of the genus Prunus, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong {{has been identified as}} the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides). Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies monilifera), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs. In Tasmania, A.pinifolium is especially popular, and one observer noted that the normally noisy birds became quiet and sluggish after eating it, prompting him to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> plant had a narcotic effect on the birds.|$|E

Throughout the series it was maintained that Chappell was never fully fit because of a tonsil infection. {{if that were the}} case one can only feel sorry for the bowlers when he returns to full health.|$|E

25|$|Without {{denying that}} sex and gender can offer valid interpretive {{strategies}} for the investigation of Artemisia's art, we may <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> application of gendered readings has created too narrow an expectation. Underpinning Garrard's monograph, and reiterated in a limited way by R. Ward Bissell in his catalogue raisonné, are certain presumptions: that Artemisia's full creative power emerged only in the depiction of strong, assertive women, {{that she would not}} engage in conventional religious imagery such as the Madonna and Child or a Virgin who responds with submission to the Annunciation, and that she refused to yield her personal interpretation to suit the tastes of her presumable male clientele. This stereotype has had the doubly restricting effect of causing scholars to question the attribution of pictures that do not conform to the model, and to value less highly those that do not fit the mold.|$|E
500|$|Lord's {{invocation}} {{of an era}} of confidence and certainty was also a relevant theme {{at the height of}} the Cold War. The University of California sociologist Fred Davis comments that nostalgia [...] "thrives ... on the rude transitions wrought by such phenomena as war, depression, civil disturbance, and cataclysmic natural disasters – in short, those events that cause masses of people to feel uneasy and to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> world and their being are quite what they always took them to be." [...] The turmoil and uncertainty of the early Atomic Age and the onset of profound social changes made the old concepts of the nuclear family and traditional gender roles, reflected in the behaviour of Titanics passengers, resonate with a mid-1950s audience.|$|E
500|$|Tenar {{begins to}} {{question}} her beliefs {{when she hears}} Kossil defying the Nameless Ones, and sees {{that they do not}} punish her. She has a conversation with Penthe, her only friend, who expresses an [...] "unfaith" [...] in the divinity of the God-king. Though Tenar reacts to this with shock, the incident opens a new perspective to her. In her own thoughts, [...] "she felt as if she had looked up and suddenly seen a whole new planet hanging huge and populous right outside the window, an entirely strange world, one in which the gods did not matter." [...] Ged acts as a catalyst for this stream of thought, because he is completely alien to her; he is male, brown-skinned, and has a picture of the world is so different from Tenar's own. After speaking to him, she begins to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Nameless Ones, despite their power, deserve her worship, and begins to lose faith in them and in all the things she has been taught. She expects to find only evil in Ged, according to what she has been taught; but instead she finds light and love, further challenging her belief.|$|E

500|$|On 14 March 1895, {{after two}} false starts {{and with the}} ship's {{position}} at 84°4′N, Nansen and Johansen began their journey. Nansen had allowed 50days to cover the [...] to the pole, an average daily journey of seven nautical miles (13km; 8.1mi). After a week of travel a sextant observation {{indicated that they were}} averaging nine nautical miles a day, (17km; 10mi), putting them ahead of schedule. However, uneven surfaces made skiing more difficult, and their speeds slowed. They also realised that they were marching against a southerly drift, and that distances travelled did not necessarily equate to northerly progression. On 3 April Nansen began to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> pole was, indeed, attainable. Unless their speed improved, their food would not last them to the pole and then on to Franz Josef Land. He confided in his diary: [...] "I have become more and more convinced we ought to turn before time." [...] On 7 April, after making camp and observing that the way ahead was [...] "a veritable chaos of iceblocks stretching as far as the horizon", Nansen decided to turn south. He recorded the latitude of the final northerly camp as 86°13.6′N, almost three degrees beyond the previous Farthest North mark.|$|E
500|$|... "And Then There Were Fewer" [...] {{received}} widespread acclaim from {{critics and}} viewers, with one critic calling the storyline [...] "solidly funny, well-plotted, and nearly perfectly executed". In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded the episode, The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff commented that he enjoyed [...] "the 'a bunch of people go to an isolated place and start getting killed' murder mystery subgenre", and that the episode [...] "made fun of the conceits of the genre". In the conclusion of his review VanDerWerff called the episode [...] "excellent and fun", and [...] "full of surprisingly gorgeous animation and a nicely creepy feel that hung over all of the jokes" [...] and rated it as a B+, the best rating between The Simpsons episode [...] "Elementary School Musical" [...] and The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Harder, Better, Faster, Browner". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also praised the episode's writers for doing a [...] "solid job of creating a genuine mystery throughout the hour, keeping us guessing as to who did it and what their motive may have been". Hughes went on to comment positively on the episode's numerous guest stars, and compared its portrayal of Diane Simmons to that of The Simpsons character Sideshow Bob. Natalie Zutter of Ology also praised the episode, calling it, [...] "Surprisingly, {{the best of the}} evening." [...] In the summary of her review, Zutter wrote that it was a [...] "fun murder mystery that lets us see all our favorite Quahog folks", while continuing to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> characters who were killed off would remain dead.|$|E
2500|$|The 2003 {{grounding}} of the U.S. Space Shuttles {{caused many}} to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Russian Energia launcher or Buran shuttle {{could be brought}} back into service. [...] By then, however, all of the equipment for both (including the vehicles themselves) had fallen into disrepair or been repurposed after falling into disuse {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union.|$|E

2500|$|Asked in 2003 {{whether the}} almost 100-year-old Catechism of Saint Pius X was still valid, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger said: [...] "The faith as such {{is always the}} same. Hence the Catechism of Saint Pius X always {{preserves}} its value. Whereas ways of transmitting {{the contents of the}} faith can change instead. And hence one may <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Catechism of Saint Pius X can in that sense still be considered valid today." ...|$|E
2500|$|In some sequences, {{there is}} a {{question}} of whether or not there are ghosts present. In the scenes where Jack sees ghosts he is always facing a mirror, or in the case of his storeroom conversation with Grady, a reflective, highly polished door. Film reviewer James Berardinelli notes [...] "It has been pointed out that there's a mirror in every scene in which Jack sees a ghost, causing us to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> spirits are reflections of a tortured psyche." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{these and}} other {{remarkable}} brain-injury survivals accumulated, the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal pretended to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> brain has any function at all: [...] "Since the antics of iron bars, gas pipes, and the like skepticism is discomfitted, and dares not utter itself. Brains {{do not seem to}} be of much account now-a-days." [...] The Transactions of the Vermont Medical Society was similarly facetious: The times have been,' says Macbeth , 'that when the brains were out the man would die. But now they rise again.' Quite possibly we shall soon hear that some German professor is [...] it." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the {{six months}} after the British public learned of Gordon's death, {{newspapers}} and journals published hundreds of articles celebrating Gordon as a [...] "saint". The American historian Cynthia Behrman wrote the articles all commented upon [...] "...Gordon's religious faith, his skill with native peoples, his fearlessness in the face of danger (a recurrent motif is Gordon's habit of leading his troops into battle armed with no more than a rattan cane), his honor, his resourcefulness, his graciousness to subordinates, his impatience with cant and hypocrisy, his hatred of glory and honors, his dislike of lionization and social rewards, and on and on. One begins to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> man had any faults at all". [...] "The reading public wanted heroes, it wanted to read about one lone Englishmen sacrificing himself for glory, honour, God, and the Empire." ...|$|E
2500|$|Koss concludes that, in a [...] "long, eventful {{and complex}} career, (that) does not admit easily of a summing up, Asquith's failings were no less {{manifest}} than his achievements." [...] Brock maintains that [...] "his peacetime record of legislative achievement {{should not be}} overshadowed by his wartime inadequacy." [...] Of those achievements, his colleague Lord Buckmaster wrote; [...] "The dull senses and heavy lidded eyes of the public prevent them from seeing now all that you have accomplished, but history will record it and the accomplishment is vast." [...] Among his greatest domestic accomplishments, reform of the House of Lords is at the zenith. Yet Asquith's premiership was also marked by many difficulties, leading McKenna to write in his memoirs, [...] "friends began to <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> highest statesmanship consisted of overcoming one crisis by creating another". Hazlehurst, writing in 1970, felt there was still much to be gleaned from a critical review of Asquith's peacetime premiership, [...] "certainly, the record of a prime minister under whom the nation goes {{to the brink of}} civil war [...] must be subjected to the severest scrutiny." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Just Whitney {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with aggregated reviews on Metacritic awarding the album 53 out of 100. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that Just Whitney was [...] "an assertion that she 's {{returning to her}} basics." [...] He {{also said that the}} album was a measured attempt to salvage a career that's on the verge of destruction. He concluded by saying, [...] "It would be a good standard-issue Whitney album if it wasn't for her disarming, defensive attempt to defuse every rumor hurled in her direction." [...] Billboard reviewed the album commenting that [...] "Just Whitney appears and sounds more like a work-in-progress than a finished disk" [...] and said that the album showcased an artist simply going through the motions and her voice lacked emotion and verve." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today graded the album two-and-half stars out of four, giving a mixed review saying, [...] "At her best, Houston is full of sass and attitude and, most of all, joy. But with so much emphasis on what's bothering her, you can't help but <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> thrill is gone." [...] According to The Guardian, the album takes [...] "a musical step backwards".|$|E

2500|$|A direct suit of a {{state by}} the federal {{government}} is rare, and the action held possible political consequences for the 2010 U.S. midterm elections as well. [...] It was also seen as a preemptive measure to discourage other states considering similar laws from moving forward with them. [...] Immediate reaction to the Justice Department's decision was highly split, with liberal groups hailing it but with Governor Brewer calling it [...] "nothing more than a massive waste of taxpayer funds." [...] Senators Kyl and McCain released a joint statement noting that [...] "the American people must <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Obama Administration is really committed to securing the border when it sues a state that is simply trying to protect its people by enforcing immigration law." [...] Congressman Darrell Issa, one of nineteen Republicans to sign a letter criticizing the suit on the day it was announced, said [...] "For President Obama to stand in the way {{of a state}} which has taken action to stand up for its citizens against the daily threat of violence and fear is disgraceful and a betrayal of his Constitutional obligation to protect our citizens." [...] The federal action also led to a surge in contributions to the governor's defense fund for the law; by July 8, total donations were over $500,000, with the large majority of them being for $100 or less and coming from around the nation.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
