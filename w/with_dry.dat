5|$|Collected and {{described}} by Robert Brown {{in the early}} 19th century, Banksia speciosa is classified in the series Banksia within the genus. Its closest relative is B. baxteri. Banksia speciosa plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect-feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, {{and a variety of}} insects. In cultivation, Banksia speciosa grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil in areas <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> summers. It cannot be grown in areas with humid summers, though it has been grafted onto Banksia serrata or B.integrifolia.|$|E
5|$|From 1965 through 1968, {{the war in}} the {{northeast}} followed the monsoon cycle, <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> season communist offensives followed by wet season Hmong (and later Thai) counteroffensives. Each year the conflict slowly escalated. PAVN would introduce more (and better equipped) units and the U.S. would counter by the application of more airpower, producing a strategic stalemate.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, dragonflies and damselflies are {{sought out}} as a hobby similar to birding and butterflying, known as oding, from the Latin name of the {{dragonfly}} order, Odonata. Oding is especially popular in Texas, where 225 different species of odonates have been observed. With care, and <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> fingers, dragonflies can be handled and released by oders, as {{can be done with}} butterflies, though it is not encouraged.|$|E

5|$|Surveys {{also show}} that green is the color most {{associated}} with the calm, the agreeable, and tolerance. Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an agreeable temperature. Red is associated <b>with</b> <b>dry,</b> blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, {{is the color of}} neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons.

5|$|The Sibu Central Market is {{the biggest}} indoor market in Sarawak. It is located at Channel Street, {{opposite}} the Sibu wharf terminal. The central market has food stalls on top floor <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> and wet market on the ground floor. Among the items on sale in this market are exotic fruits, jungle produce, handicrafts, Bario rice, and poultry. There are 1,100 stalls in the market on weekdays and 400-500 additional stalls on weekends when the indigenous people from the interior brought their jungle produce to the market.|$|E
5|$|After being designated, the cyclone became disorganized, and {{contained}} little deep and persistent convection; <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> air infringing {{on the western}} edge of the storm, substantial intensification was deemed unlikely. Despite being sheared, the cyclone neared tropical storm status later that day, though it remained a depression due to a partially non-tropical appearance. Initially, the depression meandered towards the northeast due to weak steering currents, and it intensified into a tropical storm at 0600UTC. As such, it was named Hanna by the National Hurricane Center. Over the next 24hours, the low-level center rotated around the mid- and upper-level centers, and the entire tropical storm turned southwestward by late September12. After a jog to the northwest, the low-level center became separated from the convection. Meandering, the storm started to turn northward under the steering currents of a southwesterly flow associated with an approaching mid-level trough. Hanna then strengthened sharply to reach to its peak intensity of 60miles per hour (100km/h) at 0000UTC on September14.|$|E

5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> scrub forests of piñon and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Friskies is {{produced}} and marketed by Nestlé Purina Petcare, {{a subsidiary of}} Nestlé. Friskies was first introduced in the 1930s by Carnation through its subsidiary, Albers Company. By 1973, Friskies was one of five companies that controlled two-thirds of the $1.75 billion pet food market. At the time Carnation was known for dry milk products, but also had operations processing animal feed for farms. It experimented <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> food products for 3.5 years at Carnation Farms, initially with stray dogs in improvised cages, and later with pure-breds in a formal kennel. Carnation International was formed in 1966 to market Carnation's pet food products internationally in Japan, Spain, France, England and Italy, among others.|$|E

5|$|Frogs {{typically}} {{lay their}} eggs in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators {{and part of the}} food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.|$|E
5|$|TWR had {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of these racing V12 engines during the 1980s and they had been raced competitively, with a 7-litre version of this engine featuring in the Le Mans winning Silk Cut Jaguar XJR-9. Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> sump lubrication. These engines were chosen and considered to be especially useful as the dry sump would lower the vehicle's centre of gravity. The displacement of the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6222cc) for the XJ220. The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium connecting rods.|$|E

5|$|The Central African Republic is {{situated}} {{just north of}} the Equator with daily temperatures normally reaching at least 30 degrees Celsius. Bangui, close to the Equator in the south of the country is slightly hotter and wetter than the northern regions. It has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: Aw) <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> winters. While the warm season is from 23 January to 18 March, the cold season lasts from 20 June to 27 August, when rainfall is frequently accompanied by thunderstorms. The city is bordered by thick tropical rainforests along the river banks. Several of its neighbourhoods are in low-lying areas prone to recurrent flooding. Severe rains in June and July 2009 left 11,000 people homeless.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} the southern Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ivan weakened to Category4 status by 0600UTC on September 14. As it gradually {{turned to the}} north, southwesterly flow from a large trough over the central United States increased wind shear over the hurricane. An eyewall replacement cycle, along <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> air and restricted outflow, contributed to the weakening. By late on September 14 the weakening trend ceased as the eyewall became better defined, and Ivan was expected to restrengthen slightly over an area of warmer water temperatures. The eye diameter expanded to 60miles (95km/h), though concurrently westerly wind shear and dry air continued to increase. As Ivan approached the Gulf Coast of the United States, Hurricane Hunters reported erosion of the southern portion of the eyewall, and cooler waters just offshore contributed to further weakening. At around 0650UTC on September 16, Hurricane Ivan made landfall just west of Gulf Shores, Alabama with an intensity of 120mph (195km/h); the strongest winds occurred over a narrow area near the southern Alabama and western Florida border. Its landfall {{was accompanied by a}} 10–15feet (3–4.5m) storm surge from Destin, Florida westward to Mobile Bay.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus {{prefer to}} inhabit grasslands, forests, heath, urban areas and {{woodland}}. Nests {{are found in}} Callitris forest, dry marri forest, Eucalyptus woodland and forests, mallee scrub, in paddocks, riparian woodland, and wet and dry sclerophyll forests. They also live in dry sandplains, and coastal plain. When a queen establishes a new colony, the nest is at first quite simple structurally. The nest gradually expands as the colony grows larger. Nests {{can be found in}} debris, decaying tree stumps, rotten logs, rocks, sand, and soil, and under stones. While most species nest underground, M. mjobergi is an arboreal nesting species found on epiphytic ferns of the genus Platycerium. Two types of nests have been described for this genus: a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside, and a complex structure surrounded by a mound. Some species construct dome-shaped mounds containing a single entrance, but some nests have numerous holes that are constantly used and can extend several metres underground. Sometimes, these mounds can be 0.5 m (20in) high. Workers decorate these nests with a variety of items, including charcoal, leaves, plant fragments, pebbles, and twigs. Some ants use the warmth by decorating their nests <b>with</b> <b>dry</b> materials that heat quickly, providing the nest with solar energy traps.|$|E
