40|$|<b>Whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are oil-in-water {{emulsion}} which by whipping can be formed to a foam by {{the incorporation of}} air into the system. Traditionally <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are made out of milk but today imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> based on vegetable fat has gained {{a large share of}} the marked due to their many benefits compared to traditionally <b>whipping</b> <b>creams.</b> Imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are both cheaper and more flexible than traditionally creams. By vary the characteristics of the fat system and the cream recipe the properties of the imitation creams can be adapted to fit the purpose of a specific product. The aim of this thesis was to increase the understanding of how different types of fat systems and other ingredients affect the properties of imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> based on vegetable fat. This was done by studying three vegetable fat systems with different physicochemical properties. The properties of the fat systems were characterized and the three fat systems were then used for making different imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams.</b> The properties of the creams were characterized and the properties of the fat systems and the creams were assessed and compared with each other. The study showed that the fat characteristics that generally seem to have the highest impact on the properties of <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are the structure, the solid fat content and the crystallization temperature of the fat. A fat solution with a hard structure, a high crystallization temperature and a high solid fat content at a wide range of temperatures overall seem to provide the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> with the best properties. This as these fat properties provide the creams with a high foam stability, a high overrun and a short whipping time. This study has also shown that other ingredients than the fat systems provide the creams with diverging properties. This is best shown by the results of the freeze-thaw stability which indicate that a recipe with a high amount of sugar seem to provide the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> with good freeze-thaw stability. Other properties of the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> also seem to be very much influenced by other ingredients than the fat systems but further studies are needed to provide clarity to the complexity of the interplay of the ingredients in <b>whipped</b> <b>creams...</b>|$|R
40|$|Premix {{product is}} a {{ready-made}} flour processed food contained the ingredients and some additives that {{are stable in}} the mixture which still need some additional minimum such as; egg, water and butter. <b>Whipping</b> <b>cream</b> premix is a powder product which is strongly influenced by environmental temperature. The main objective {{of this study is}} to determine chemical and physical characteristics of <b>whipping</b> <b>cream</b> premix. Chemical analyses consist of moisture content and water activity variables, while physical analyses consist of overrun and stiffness variables, also observation on decoration properties. The second objective {{of this study is to}} determine the <b>whipping</b> <b>cream</b> premix shelf-life based on its chemical and physical characteristics. The <b>whipping</b> <b>cream</b> premix shelf-life measured using Accelerated Shelf Life Test (ASLT) Arrhenius Model, with three different extreme temperatures, i. e. 21 °C, 27 °C and 37 °C. The result shows that water activity was supposed as the key to determine <b>whipping</b> <b>cream</b> premix shelf-life, with regression linear equation follows order 0 (y = y =- 5. 507 x + 12, 50). Based on water activity variable, the shelf-life of <b>whipping</b> <b>cream</b> premix on supermarket temperature (25 °C) is 250 days...|$|R

5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or <b>whipped</b> <b>cream.</b> Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
5|$|In the United States and Canada, {{the drink}} is popular in instant form, made {{with hot water}} or milk from a packet {{containing}} mostly cocoa powder, sugar, and dry milk.

5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E
