The write enable sensor is also in a non-standard location, though most FileWare diskettes were produced without a <b>write</b> <b>protect</b> slot. The jacket had a corner cutout that keyed the diskette to prevent insertion in an incorrect orientation, and a rectangular hole that the drive could use to latch the diskette in place, preventing removal until the software allowed it.|$|R

40|$|This {{application}} note discusses how AES- 128 encryption {{can be implemented}} with Zilog’s Z 8 Encore! family of 8 -bit microcontrollers. The AES- 128 standard is an encryp-tion solution that has been developed to satisfy many rapidly-evolving security concerns that have arisen within the computer and embedded chip industries. This standard employs 128 -bit block data transfer and a 128 -bit key to cipher and decipher plain data. The AES algorithm was implemented {{in compliance with the}} NIST FIPS 197 that governs how data is transferred via advanced encryption methods. Implementing the AES- 128 standard with Zilog’s Z 8 Encore! XP MCUs offers high-speed performance when undergoing a encryption/decryption process, resulting in a 1. 8909 ms cipher rate and a 2. 604 ms decipher rate. The source code consumes a maximum of 2. 5 KB of MCU memory. Zilog’s Z 8 Encore! XP MCU also offers high level of protection from unauthorized attempts to read or write to the embedded code within Flash program memory. Users can select option bits for Flash Read <b>Protect,</b> Flash <b>Write</b> <b>Protect,</b> or both. The Flash Read Pro-tect option bit disables external user read access to Flash Program Memory; the Flash <b>Write</b> <b>Protect</b> bit disables external user access to program this Flash program memory. These features allows all encryption and decryption code to be fully secured. There are two source code files associated with this {{application note}}. AN 0338 -SC 01. zip contains a full representation of the AES routines described herein. In AN 0338 -SC 02. zip, some lines of code in the main. c file have been commented out to facilitate testing cipher and decipher times and memory usage when a terminal emulation program is not being used. All source code has been tested with version 5. 0. 0 of ZDS II for Z 8 Encore! XP MCUs; both of these. zip files are available for download from the Zilog website. Subse-quent releases of ZDS II may require you to modify the code supplied with this application note...|$|R
