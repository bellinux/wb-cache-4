According to bassist Colin Greenwood, his brother Jonny made the whole band watch the film, saying [...] "now this is how <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> videos," [...] Colin, however was critical of the direction, which he described as [...] "Dave Gilmour sitting on his arse playing guitar and Roger Waters with long greasy hair, sandals and dusty flares, staggers over and picks up this big beater and whacks this gong.

[...] "The members I had in the last lineup – Bobby Rondinelli, Neil Murray – they're great, great characters..." [...] Iommi told Sabbath fanzine Southern Cross.

500|$|The tritium leak, {{combined}} with other disclosures about improper handling and disposal of hazardous waste, had caused Secretary of Energy Federico Peña to fire the lab's previous manager, Associated Universities, Inc. Upon starting as the laboratory's director, Marburger noted the increased importance of health and environmental concerns {{since the beginning of}} the Cold War, stating that [...] "getting the people at Brookhaven to understand that won't be simple, and there may be some disagreement on how <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> it, but that's my job." [...] Marburger set up a permanent community advisory council and met with local environmental groups to increase communication between them and the laboratory's management. By 2001, when Marburger left to join the Bush administration, local environmental groups credited him with having largely dissipated the distrust that had existed between the groups when he started.|$|E

[...] Biden was {{a strong supporter of}} the 2001 war in Afghanistan, saying [...] "Whatever it takes, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] Regarding Iraq, Biden stated in 2002 that Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security, {{and that there was no}} option but to eliminate that threat. In October 2002, Biden voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, justifying the Iraq War. [...] While he soon became a critic of the war and viewed his vote as a [...] "mistake", he did not push to require a U.S. withdrawal. [...] He supported the appropriations to pay for the occupation, but argued repeatedly that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should [...] "level with the American people" [...] about the cost and length of the conflict.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{following}} {{the release of}} the Sugababes' fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways, it was announced in December 2005 that founding group member Mutya Buena had left the band. Two singles were subsequently released from the album featuring new group member Amelle Berrabah, who was announced as Buena's replacement 24 hours after her departure. In June 2006, the Sugababes began working on their fifth studio album which was confirmed for release in 2007. However, group member Heidi Range also revealed that a greatest hits album would be released in time for Christmas 2006, which would include all of the group's hits. When rumours arose that {{the release of the}} album was premature, band member Keisha Buchanan stated that the group had already started to plan a greatest hits album. She explained how it was essential for the album to be released following Buena's departure, saying: [...] "When Mutya left, we decided it was even more important, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> this as closure so we don't have to relive history all the time." [...] Group member Heidi Range also reflected upon this, saying: [...] "When Mutya was still in the band the greatest hits was always planned for this time anyway. But when she left it seemed even more appropriate." ...|$|E
500|$|Singapore has a one person, {{one vote}} system: plural voting– that is, voting {{more than once}} in the electoral {{division}} that one is assigned to, or voting in more than one electoral division– is illegal. Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: [...] "It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and get what they want without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government." [...] Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine Foreign Affairs in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because [...] "he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> it. ...
