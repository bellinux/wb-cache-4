5|$|Double Fine {{believed}} they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to Brütal Legend after the game's release, and had invested {{a great deal of}} development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled. Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what Brütal Legend contained. The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus. Schafer further noted {{that at the end of}} the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus. Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely be used due to Dio's death.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{announced}} a one-year moratorium on nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958, if the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom {{also agreed to}} suspend testing. Britain had already indicated that it would do so, and the Soviet Union agreed on 30 August. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, all three all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline. The British scientists needed to gather as much data as possible {{to allow them to}} design production nuclear weapons. Moreover, as the prospect of increased American cooperation grew after October 1957, they knew that {{the quality and quantity of}} what the Americans would share would depend on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such as the use of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride permitted a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. It would be the biggest and most complex British test series.|$|E

25|$|In their response, Somerset batted sensibly, knowing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> chase. Flintoff bowled aggressively, {{and claimed}} the early wickets of Marcus Trescothick, {{caught by the}} wicket-keeper for 10, and Matthew Wood, bowled for 22. Blackwell was out shortly after, caught by Law off the bowling of Gary Keedy, but at the other end, Smith {{remained}} steady. Wood had given the innings a boost by scoring four consecutive boundaries before his dismissal, and that allowed Smith and James Hildreth to bat patiently, although Smith's boundary-scoring drew comparisons to Viv Richards and Ian Botham. Smith and Hildreth built an unbeaten 53-run partnership, and won the match with eleven balls to spare. Smith was named man of the match for his captaincy and his score of 64 not out.|$|E

25|$|On Friday 15 October 1926 his HRH The Prince of Wales visited Halifax. It {{was another}} of several visits the Royal Family made to Halifax during Richardson's time in office. Richardson {{continued}} {{to establish his}} reputation of being a good Organiser and Planner. He prepared the Borough Police by devising a booklet of 28 pages. It shows, in detail, {{the route of the}} cars taking part, crowd control, Sergeants in charge of Sections, mounted police positions, roads to be blocked off and timings – to the minute. Everyone taking part had a copy of the booklet so every Policeman on duty knew not only <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do but what other Policemen had to do as well. It had the signature of A.H. Richardson on the cover to prove it was genuine and all copies had to be returned immediately the visit was over. Copies were later sent to other Chief Constables as a template for any Royal Visit they might get.|$|E

After hearing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say, the prince dismissed all except Coventry and Williams, and called for Gordon-Cumming, who told Edward that the accusation was [...] "foul and abominable"; the prince pointed out that [...] "there are five accusers against you". Gordon-Cumming then withdrew while the royal party discussed what the next steps would be. He returned {{after half an hour}} to find just the two courtiers, who urged him to sign a document that they had drafted. Under pressure, and still denying the accusations, Gordon-Cumming signed the document without knowing who else would sign it afterwards.|$|E

Sam Wollaston of The Guardian reacted positively to the episode, stating [...] "it's nice to see MI5 locking horns with the Russians again. Maybe the Spooks people just got bored with Islamic terrorism, so they did <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do: they restarted the cold war. A bold move, but an admirable one." [...] Gerard O'Donovan of The Daily Telegraph placed the episode as a [...] "critic's choice," [...] calling it a [...] "superb season closer," [...] and [...] "all terrifically exciting." [...] O'Donovan also said of the episode's settings; [...] "the streets and Underground tunnels of London have rarely been used to such climactic effect – with great performances from everyone involved." [...] He also complimented it for setting up a [...] "great cliffhanger ending that will leave fans absolutely gagging for the next series." ...|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{wrote to}} Elgin in January 1895 that Karim was deeply unpopular in the Household, {{and that he}} {{occupied}} [...] "very much {{the same position as}} John Brown used to". Princesses Louise and Beatrice, Prince Henry of Battenberg, Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Secretary of State for India Henry Fowler had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen, who [...] "refused to listen to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say but was very angry, so as you see the Munshi is a sort of pet, like a dog or cat which the Queen will not willingly give up". Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the India Office that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read, and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a confidential nature. Victoria's advisors feared Karim's association with Rafiuddin Ahmed, an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League. They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman Khan. There is no indication that these fears were well-founded, or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet.|$|E

500|$|On many occasions, Usher {{has named}} Michael Jackson as his biggest influence. Usher once told MTV, [...] "He {{influenced}} me {{in so many}} ways, more than just music ..... as a humanitarian, as a philanthropist, as an artist, as an individual who transcended culture. I wouldn't be who I am today without Michael Jackson." [...] During the television special '', Usher was able to dance with Michael while performing [...] "You Rock My World". Prince being another main influence, Usher said [...] "every album I’d always do like one song that is very Prince-influenced, because he's a great influence on me musically, especially just kind of being expansive and creating music that represents many different genres." [...] In Time magazine's [...] "100 Most Influential People" [...] issue, he explained [...] "I was interested in music {{and trying to find}} a model. It was Michael, or it was Prince. He had an attitude, a rawness that Michael didn't have. He was not urban, but he was our version of what cool could be." [...] In addition, he has spoken of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder as great musicians and philanthropists stating that [...] "they figured out what they were as they were going, by inspiration as well...allowing their music to speak to where they were and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say". Other musical influences include Luther Vandross, Janet Jackson, Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Al Green, and Boyz II Men.|$|E
500|$|The {{first game}} of [...] "Basket Ball" [...] was played in December 1891. In a {{handwritten}} report, Naismith described {{the circumstances of the}} inaugural match; in contrast to modern basketball, the players played nine versus nine, handled a soccer ball, not a basketball, and instead of shooting at two hoops, the goals were a pair of peach baskets: [...] "When Mr. Stubbins brot [...] up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them {{on the inside of the}} railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class... The class did not show much enthusiasm but followed my lead... I then explained <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men & tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon." [...] In contrast to modern basketball, the original rules did not include what is known today as the dribble. Since the ball could only be moved up the court via a pass early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also following each [...] "goal" [...] a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are obsolete in the rules of modern basketball.|$|E
2500|$|Library {{activists in}} the 1930s {{pressured}} the American Library Association to be more responsive to issues put forth by young members involved with issues such as peace, segregation, library unions and intellectual freedom. [...] In 1931, the Junior Members Round Table (JMRT) was formed to provide a voice for the younger members of the ALA, but much of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say resurfaced in the social responsibility movement to come years later. [...] During this period, the first Library Bill of Rights (LBR) was drafted by Forrest Spaulding to set a standard against censorship and {{was adopted by the}} ALA in 1939. [...] This has been recognized as the moment defining modern librarianship as a profession committed to intellectual freedom and the right to read over government dictates. [...] The ALA formed the Staff Organization's Round Table in 1936 and the Library Unions Round Table in 1940.|$|E

2500|$|The jobs {{available}} to the prisoners were few; between 1930 and 1960, about 200 inmates out of a population averaging 550 had something to do. [...] In the 1940s and '50s, most prisoners spent twenty-two {{hours a day in}} their cells. [...] The industries that were available were managed not by civilians or guards, but, due to the shortage of staff at the prison, by a system of inmate overseers. [...] Called [...] "con-bosses," [...] these privileged inmates had complete control over their areas, reserving the right to choose which inmates worked under them, how much work they received, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do to receive work at all. [...] Since work meant not only something to do other than sit in a cell but also time earned off a sentence, this system led to rampant corruption, favoritism, and ill-feelings among the prisoners, since the con-bosses often sold positions or used them as leverage for any number of illicit favors.|$|E
2500|$|It took 15 {{minutes for}} Don Canham {{to be sold}} on Bo Schembechler, {{resulting}} in Schembechler becoming the 15th coach in Michigan football history. At the time, Schembechler's current employer, the Miami RedHawks, could have thrown more money at Schembechler, but Canham managed to sell Schembechler on Michigan's tradition and prestige. Schembechler's respect for Michigan was evident early on when assistants complained about how the equipment they had was worse than <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work with at Miami. Schembechler gestured to a rusty chair and said, [...] "See this chair? Fielding Yost sat in this chair. See this nail? Fielding Yost hung his hat on that nail. And you're telling me we had better stuff at Miami? No men, we didn't. We have tradition here, Michigan tradition, and that's something no one else has!" [...] Schembechler immediately got to work in turning around his team. He {{had a reputation for}} being hard on his players, causing 65 of his 140 players to quit the team before the season even started. In response, Schembechler promised his team [...] "Those Who Stay Will be Champions," [...] assuring the players that remained that their efforts would be rewarded.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{progress}} of the Spaniards, it took many years for the natives to truly grasp key concepts of Christianity. In Catholicism, four main sacraments attracted the natives but only for ritualistic reasons, and they did not fully alter their lifestyle as the Spaniards had hoped. Baptism was believed to simply cure ailments, while Matrimony was a concept many natives could not understand and thus had violated the sanctity of monogamy. They were however, allowed to keep the tradition of dowry, which was accepted into law; [...] "bride-price" [...] and [...] "bride-service" [...] were practiced by natives despite labels of heresy. Confession was required of everyone once a year, and the clergy used the [...] confessionario, a bilingual text aid, to help natives understand the rite's meaning and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> confess. Locals were initially apprehensive, but gradually used the rite to excuse excesses throughout the year. Communion was given out selectively, for {{this was one of the}} most important sacraments that the missionaries did not want to risk having the natives violate. To help their cause, evangelism was done in the native language.|$|E
