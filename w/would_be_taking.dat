5|$|Woods {{had a much}} {{anticipated}} {{return to}} golf in 2009, when he performed well.

5|$|General Atkinson, {{who learned}} in early July that Scott <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> command, hoped {{to bring the}} war to a {{successful}} conclusion before Scott's arrival. The Americans had difficulty locating the British Band, however, {{thanks in part to}} false intelligence given to them by area Native Americans. Potawatomis and Ho-Chunks in Illinois, many of whom had sought to remain neutral in the war, decided to cooperate with the Americans. Tribal leaders knew that some of their warriors had aided the British Band, and so they hoped that a highly visible show of support for the Americans would dissuade U.S. officials from punishing the tribes after the conflict was over. Wearing white headbands to distinguish themselves from hostile Natives, Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis served as guides for Atkinson's army. Ho-Chunks sympathetic to the plight of Black Hawk's people misled Atkinson into thinking that the British Band was still at Lake Koshkonong. While Atkinson's men were trudging through the swamps and running low on provisions, the British Band had in fact relocated miles to the north. Potawatomis under Billy Caldwell also managed to demonstrate support for the Americans while avoiding battle.|$|E
5|$|Other Japanese games, {{particularly}} Guitar Freaks, led {{to development}} of Guitar Hero and Rock Band series that used instrument-shaped controllers {{to mimic the}} playing of actual instruments. Spurred by the inclusion of popular rock music, the two series revitalized the rhythm genre in the Western Market, significantly expanded the console video game market and its demographics. The games provided {{a new source of}} revenue for the artists whose music appeared on the soundtracks. The later release of Rock Band 3 as well as the even later Rocksmith would allow players to play the songs using a real electric guitar. By 2008, rhythm games were considered {{to be one of the}} most popular video game genres, behind other action games. However, by 2009, the market was saturated by spin-offs from the core titles, which led to a nearly 50% drop in revenue for music game publishers; within a few years, both series announced they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> a hiatus from future titles.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{response}} to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued {{when it was clear}} that Louis VII of France <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> part in the expedition. Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It is debatable whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about Quantum Praedecessores. In any case, Abbot Suger and other nobles were not in favour of Louis' plans, as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted Bernard of Clairvaux, who referred him back to Eugene. By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis' crusade. The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146, and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.|$|E
