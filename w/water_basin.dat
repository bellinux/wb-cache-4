25|$|Cathedrals {{always have}} a font or <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> at which the rite of Baptism is performed, {{in which a person}} is {{formally}} accepted into the Christian church. The font is often placed towards the door because the Baptism signifies entry into the community of the church. In some cathedrals, most particularly in Italy, the rite of Baptism is performed in a separate building.|$|E
25|$|The waves {{created in}} the open ocean are {{classified}} as deep-water waves. Deep-water waves have no bottom interaction and the orbits of these water molecules are circular; their wavelength is short relative to water depth and the velocity decays before the reaching {{the bottom of the}} <b>water</b> <b>basin.</b> Deep waves have depths greater than ½ their wavelengths. Wind forces waves to break in the deep sea.|$|E

We found 29 cyanoprokaryotic species, which belong to 13 genera from the orders Synechococcales, Spirulinales and Oscillatoriales. The frequency quotient of each species was calculated.

40|$|Zoobentos, zooperiphiton, their {{structure}} and functioning in the cooling <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> were investigated {{as well as}} the problem of control over the ecological systems with the aim of study of the influence of the thermal and nuclear power plants on the associations of the bottom and periphiton invertebrates and with the aim of determination of the quantitative changes of the main elements of the ecological systems in the cooling <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> in their dependence on degree of heat-up to be further used as the theoretical basis for the development of ways of control over the biological productiveness of the <b>water</b> <b>basins.</b> As a result the structure, composition, functioning and succession of zoobentos and zooperiphiton in the cooling <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> were studied for the firsttime.

25|$|In the 20th century, the {{outskirts}} of the city become filled with open pit mines for gravel and sand. There was even one opened on a hill in the San Diego and La Florecilla neighborhoods, near the historic center called Salsipuedes. These prompted environmental and local community organizations to protest, stating that the valley is a closed <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> and the mining negatively affects potable water supplies. Salsipuedes was closed in the 2000s.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the western}} end of the nave stands the font, or <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> at which the rite of Baptism is performed. It is placed towards the door because the Baptism signifies entry into the {{community}} of the church. Standing {{to the front of the}} nave is a lectern from which the Holy Scripture is read. In many churches this takes the form of an eagle which supports the book on its outstretched wings and is the symbol of John the Evangelist.|$|E

25|$|The Square Water Pavilion, {{also called}} the Queen's Bath, is in the {{south-east}} of the royal centre. It has a pavilion, a <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> and a method of moving fresh water to it and taking away wash water and overflows. The basin is enclosed within an ornate, pillared, vaulted bay. Nearby are ruins of the aqueduct. The modern name of this building, the Queen's bath, is probably a misnomer {{because this was a}} public bath for men and travellers. The building's interior arches show influence of the Indo-Islamic style, reflecting an era n which Hindu and Muslim arts influenced each other in India.|$|E
25|$|The cloister of {{the monastery}} was built during the reign of, and {{sponsored}} by, King Dinis I. It {{is one of the}} largest mediaeval Cistercian cloisters in Europe.

The Gothic Fountain Hall has an elegant early renaissance <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> inside, decorated with renaissance motifs including the coat-of-arms {{of the monastery}} and reliefs of gryphs. The second floor of the cloister, in manueline style as revealed by its typical twisted columns, was built in the early 16th century.|$|E
25|$|In Catholicism, holy water, as well {{as water}} used during the washing of the priest's hands at mass, {{is not allowed to}} be {{disposed}} of in regular plumbing. Roman Catholic churches will usually have a special basin (a Sacrarium) that leads directly into the ground for the purpose of proper disposal. A hinged lid is kept over the holy <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> to distinguish it from a regular sink basin, which is often just beside it. Items that contained holy water are separated, drained of the holy water, and then washed in a regular manner in the adjacent sink.|$|E

As part of a wider plan to reclaim parkland and improve park safety, the project also necessitates the closure of South Cornell Drive between 60th and 67th Streets, a 6-lane thoroughfare that runs along the western park lagoon and the park's golf course from Midway Plaisance to South Shore.|$|E

25|$|Deep-water waves {{travel to}} shore and become shallow water waves. Shallow water waves have depths less than ½ of their wavelength. Shallow wave's {{wavelengths}} are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The wave velocity effects the entire <b>water</b> <b>basin.</b> The water {{interacts with the}} bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction pulls {{on the bottom of}} the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.|$|E

500|$|It is a Grade II listed building, a {{national}} designation given to [...] "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort {{being made to}} preserve them", in particular because of the retention of medieval fabric in a predominately 19th-century building, and its [...] "fine" [...] memorials.

St Mary's has a number of memorials from the 18th and 19th centuries, some commemorating residents of a nearby manor house. There was once a tradition of decorating the interior with paper garlands, although writers differ on whether this was to celebrate parishioners' weddings or to mark the death of unmarried women.

500|$|The {{church is}} built from irregularly {{positioned}} pieces of rubble masonry, and Kennedy added red sandstone dressings in his 1882 work.

[...] The chapel is 17feet by 20feet 6inches (about 5.2 by 6.25m). There is medieval masonry {{in three of the}} walls: the west wall, and the lower parts of the north and south walls. The roof is made of slate, with a stone bellcote containing one bell at the west end. Inside, the wooden trusses of the roof are visible. The trusses were re-used when the roof was reconstructed. The church is entered through a porch on the south side, added in the 19th century, and a Tudor arch doorway; the porch contains a stone piscina (a <b>water</b> <b>basin),</b> said {{to be part of a}} font dating from the 12th century.
