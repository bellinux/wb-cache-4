In 1903, Malcolm declared that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the creator of the breed and insisted that his breed of white terriers be renamed.

500|$|After {{commissioning}} the pilot, ITV Network Centre did not dictate to {{the producers}} {{who should be}} cast. John Thomson, a comedian known for his work with Steve Coogan, {{was the first to}} be cast. He had played Rick, a minor character in The Perfect Match, a role Bullen describes as [...] "proto-Pete". Bullen was impressed by Thomson's natural comedy and Langan asked him to write a role for him to play in Cold Feet. Thomson accepted the role because he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> forever for playing [...] "Fat Bob", the sidekick of Coogan's Paul Calf in a series of sketches.
