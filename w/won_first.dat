She sold the company in 1886 with profit.|$|E
5|$|At the Conservatoire, Messiaen made {{excellent}} academic progress. In 1924, aged 15, he {{was awarded}} second prize in harmony, having been taught in that subject by professor Jean Gallon.

After studying with Maurice Emmanuel, {{he was awarded}} second prize {{for the history of}} music in 1928. Emmanuel's example engendered an interest in ancient Greek rhythms and exotic modes. After showing improvisation skills on the piano Messiaen studied organ with Marcel Dupré. Messiaen gained first prize in organ playing and improvisation in 1929. After a year studying composition with Charles-Marie Widor, in autumn 1927 he entered the class of the newly appointed Paul Dukas.

5|$|A year later, {{the band}} decided {{to enter into}} a battle of bands contest, which {{included}} over 250 musical ensembles. The music competition's prize was $3,000 and two days in a recording studio. The band then decided it was time for another guitarist, to fill in some of that empty sounds during guitar solo's and to add to the band for a more full sound live. Through friends, Barrales contacted guitarist Juan Juarez and asked him to join Bonded by Blood. Juarez accepted and he then met the rest of the members and they all liked him as well. After winning round after round, Bonded by Blood finally <b>won</b> <b>first</b> place. The band then recorded the demo Four Pints of Blood at Love Juice Labs in the Californian city of Riverside.

There he acquired a licentiate (at Universidad de Barcelona) and doctorate (at Universidad Central de Madrid).|$|E

5|$|Although {{trained as}} a lawyer, Carmelo began fencing at an early age, {{beginning}} in the 1910s, {{at the behest of}} his father and, much like his father, specialized in épée, while also being proficient at fleuret. In 1918 he came in first place in the former category and second in the latter at a competition, organized by the city of Buenos Aires. In the next two years, he finished at the top in both events and became nationally known. In 1921 the Argentine Fencing Federation was founded and, in 1922, the organization sent him to represent Argentina in the Olimpiados Latinamericanos, a celebration overseen by the International Olympic Committee to celebrate the centenary of Brazil's declaration of independence. His native country <b>won</b> <b>first</b> place in the épée, fleuret and sabre events in the host city of Rio de Janeiro.

5|$|During this period, Copeland {{received}} {{far more}} personal {{attention from the}} Bradley family than her mother could give each of her six children. Raised in a lapsed Christian household, when Copeland lived with the Bradley family, she attended their synagogue and celebrated Shabbat with them, enjoying their family's closeness. In addition to Bradley's intensive ballet training, her husband, a modern-dance teacher, served as Copeland's pas-de-deux instructor and partner. The summer before her fifteenth birthday, Bradley began to homeschool Copeland for 10th grade to free up more time for dance. At fifteen years old, Copeland <b>won</b> <b>first</b> place in the Los Angeles Music Center Spotlight Awards at the Chandler Pavilion in March 1998. Copeland {{said it was the}} first time she ever battled nervousness. The winners received scholarships between $500 and $2500. Copeland's victory in the 10th annual contest among gifted high school students in Southern California secured her recognition by the Los Angeles Times as the best young dancer in the Greater Los Angeles Area.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Lazzell {{was one of}} two West Virginians who {{received}} Federal Art Project grants through the Works Progress Administration. That same year she created a mural for a court room in the Monongalia County Courthouse entitled, Justice. The mural took fourteen weeks to complete. The mural is currently displayed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University in Morgantown, WV. She continued experimenting with woodprints and, in 1935, studied with the renowned German abstract expressionist Hans Hofmann in Provincetown. Hofmann's push/pull spatial theory is evident in the asymmetry of her later works. Lazzell's studies of flowers were inspired by her lavish potted gardens, such as Star Phlox (1931). Her 1948 floral print, Red and White Petunia, <b>won</b> <b>first</b> prize at the American Color Print Society exhibition. A collection of her prints are housed at the Art Museum of West Virginia University.|$|E

5|$|Trenyce {{was born}} in Memphis, Tennessee on March 31, 1980. Her father, Jesse Cobbins, worked for St. Joe Company, and her mother, Linda Ruth Cobbins, worked at FedEx. She has an older and a younger sister. As a child, she decided to be known by her middle name, feeling that it better suited her ambitions as a performer. Trenyce has written that her {{interest}} in music started after performing a solo in a musical production celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr. She grew up in North Memphis, where she attended Central High School and performed in various talent shows and pageants. In 1996, she <b>won</b> <b>first</b> place in a singing competition at the national NAACP Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Stanley {{produced}} a 'Panoptic Stereoscope' in 1855, which was financially successful. Stereoscopes had sold for five shillings each– Stanley discovered a simpler method to make them, which {{enable him to}} sell them for one shilling. He {{was able to take}} an additional shops at 3–4 Great Turnstile and 286 High Holborn, as well as a skilled assistant. He did not patent the Panoptic, so it was soon copied around the world, but he had sold enough to provide the capital required to manufacture scientific instruments. In 1861 he invented a straight line dividing machine for which he <b>won</b> <b>first</b> prize in the 1862 International Exhibition in London. Stanley brought out the first catalogue of his products in 1864. By the fifth edition, Stanley was able to list important customers such as several government departments, the Army, the Royal Navy, railways at home and abroad, and London University. From 1865, he worked on improving the elegance and stability of surveying instruments, especially the theodolite, whose construction he simplified. It had a rotating telescope for measuring horizontal and vertical angles and able to take sights on prominent objects at a distance. The component parts were reduced to fewer than half of the 226 used in the previous version, making it lighter, cheaper and more accurate.|$|E
5|$|The IOC {{does not}} track medalists in Olympic art {{competitions}} in its database {{and thus the}} prize winners are only officially recorded in the original Olympic reports. Judges {{were not required to}} distribute first, second, and third place awards for every category, and thus certain events lack medalists in these placements. Since participants were allowed multiple submissions, it was also possible for artists to win more than one in a single event, as Alex Diggelmann of Switzerland did in the graphic arts category of the 1948 edition. Diggelmann is tied with Denmark's Josef Petersen, who won second prize three times in literature, for the amount of medals captured in the art competitions. Luxembourg's Jean Jacoby is the only individual to win two gold medals, doing so in painting in 1924 and 1928. Of the 146 medalists, 11 were women and only Finnish author Aale Tynni was awarded gold. Germany was the most successful nation, with eight gold, seven silver, and nine bronze medals, although one was won by Coubertin himself, a Frenchman. He submitted his poem Ode to Sport under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach, {{as if it were a}} joint-entry, and <b>won</b> <b>first</b> prize in the 1912 literature category. The original report credits this medal to Germany. Two individuals, Walter W. Winans and Alfréd Hajós, won medals in both athletic and art competitions.|$|E
