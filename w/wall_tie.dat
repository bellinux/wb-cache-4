25|$|The advent {{during the}} mid twentieth century of the cavity wall saw the popularisation and {{development}} of another method of strengthening brickwork—the <b>wall</b> <b>tie.</b> A cavity wall comprises two totally discrete walls, separated by an air gap, which serves both as barrier to moisture and heat. Typically the main loads taken by the foundations are carried there by the inner leaf, and the major functions of the external leaf are to protect the whole from weather, {{and to provide a}} fitting aesthetic finish.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of both cavity and veneer wall systems is critically dependant on the effective {{performance of}} the ties which connect the outer and inner leaves. In veneer construction the ties are the principal means of support of the external masonry leaf as they transfer the veneer loads to the structural back-up frame. In cavity construction, the ties allow the sharing of load between the two masonry leaves, with the tie forces being influenced by the relative stiffness of the leaves {{and the nature of}} the support for each leaf. In recent years there have been attempts to model this behaviour analytically with varying degrees of sophistication. These studies have shown that the distribution of forces in the ties is dependant on a range of factors, with the tie force certainly not just being a function of the tributary loading area for the tie. The Masonry Research Group at the University of Newcastle is involved in an on-going study of <b>wall</b> <b>tie</b> behaviour with a view to developing more realistic <b>wall</b> <b>tie</b> design rules. Some results on the behaviour of ties in cavity walls have been presented previously. This paper reports a study on typical Australian brick veneer walling systems which has concentrated on developing techniques to accurately monitor individual tie forces in veneer walls subjected to lateral loads. A convenient method for measuring individual tie forces is presented, together with confirmation that tie force redistribution occurs in veneer systems once ties reach their individual capacity...|$|E

ISBN 978 - 1 - 138 - 02999 - 6 An experimental study {{was carried out}} to analyse the tension and compression behaviour of wall ties anchoring brick veneer walls to masonry infill walls as the backing support. Connection subassemblies were tested under monotonic and cyclic loading, simulating out-of-plane loading of veneer wall systems {{in order to understand}} the influence of six different ties with different design, thickness and attachment methods in the strength, stiffness and failure modes of the connection system. Experimental results from this study show more details about the behaviour of this system and importance of determined parameters. Tensile resistance capacity can be more influenced by <b>wall</b> <b>tie</b> design, while tie thickness was considered to be the most important parameter in compression behaviour. Attachment methods studied do not considered a very influential factor. This study can help to understand and justify the contribution of these elements for the mechanical masonry veneer walls under different loading conditions.

40|$|Between 2 and 6 pm the on the 27 th of November 2014 severe {{thunderstorm}} {{activity was}} observed in the South-East Queensland region. Two adjoining storm cells moving in a northerly direction subjected Brisbane and neighbouring suburbs to severe hail, damaging winds and localized flooding. A maximum gust wind speed of 141 km/h was measured at Archerfield Airport during this event. However, from wind field analyses and field observations, speeds were estimated to be approximately 40 to 80 km/h in other affected suburbs. Severe hail accompanied the storm (40 mm diameter typical), with hail damage to windows being widespread. Street and house surveys were conducted between the 28 th of November and the 5 th of December to assess structural damage and to compare overall impacts of the storm to what was reported by journalists and social media. An analysis of damage severity in relation to construction materials was then performed allowing patterns of housing stock vulnerabilities to be examined. Hail damage to windows and subsequent water ingress was particularly high, especially for older housing, with older window glass performing poorly against the wind-driven hail compared to newer window glass. Another contributing factor was most likely the significant horizontal component in the trajectory of the hail caused by the strong winds. Although winds were lower than design level, some cases of severe roof failures did occur. On several occasions, these failures were due to: (i) building age with rot in timber roof members and/or corrosion of connections or (ii) installation of new roof cladding without upgrading the batten to rafter or rafter to <b>wall</b> <b>tie</b> down connections to contemporary building standards. Roof structure damage was typically associated with a breach in the windward wall allowing a large increase in internal pressure and adding to the external suction loads on the roof. ...|$|E

O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a melhor técnica de ancoragem entre alvenaria-estrutura, avaliando sua eficiência no combate a esse tipo de fissura. Foram utilizados para a elaboração dos ensaios, além dos materiais usados na alvenaria de vedação (bloco cerâmico, argamassa etc), diferentes materiais de ancoragem (tela metálica eletrosoldada e barras de aço) e dispositivos de ligação (adesivo epóxi, pinos, arruelas e cantoneira), analisando-se assim o melhor conjunto do ponto de vista técnico. Foram feitos ensaios de caracterização dos materiais e de arrancamento à tração direta, até a ocorrência da primeira fissura visível a olho nu. Concluiu-se finalmente que a tela metálica eletrosoldada galvanizada malha 15 x 15 mm e diâmetro do fio 1, 65 mm, sem cantoneira e com tratamento de chapisco com adesivo acrílico no pilarete foi a melhor técnica de ancoragem para a prevenção do aparecimento de fissuras na interface alvenaria de vedação e pilar de concretoAbstract: The splitting of the fair-faced masonry-structure {{are very}} usual {{but it is}} not wellknown the reason of its occurrence, although they are frequent, specially the ones that appear in the linking of the masonry-concrete column. The purpouse of this work was to study the best anchorage technique between masonrystructure, being evaluated its efficiency to prevent this type of splitting. Beyond the materials that are usually used for masonry (ceramic block, mortar etc), changeable materials of anchorage (stell welded tie and steel wire) and apparatus of linking (adhesive epoxy, bolts, washers and angle-steel) were used, analyzing the best combination for the technical view. Tests of characterization of the materials and the pullout test were made, until the occurrence of the first splitting visible by naked eye. Finally, it was concluded that the metallic <b>wall</b> <b>tie,</b> 15 x 15 mm and the diameter of wire 1, 65 mm, without angle-steel and with mortar with acrylic adhesive in the concrete column was the best anchorage technique for to prevent occurrence of splitting in the fair-faced masonry-concrete structur...|$|E

40|$|After {{the second}} world war, cavity walls became a {{widespread}} external wall type in the North Western Europe including the Netherlands. Cavity walls consist of two leaves separated by a hollow space (cavity). The leaves are commonly made by masonry bricks, blocks, and <b>wall</b> <b>ties.</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>ties</b> are used to connect the two leaves of a cavity wall and are installed during construction. The ties are meant to withstand wind pressure mostly. Recently {{in the north of}} the Netherlands induced earthquakes took place. As consequence, many cavity walls may fail due to the crisis of the ties subjected to seismic solicitations for which they were not designed.

The {{wrought iron}} {{building}} structures constituting {{part of the}} architectural heritage, e. g. handrails, gate hinges, columns, arch <b>ties</b> and <b>wall</b> <b>ties</b> represent incorporeal value, but operate as load bearing structures as well. There are few information on their mechanical properties and quality. Due to the inhomogeneity of the material of wrought iron building structures generated during the production, the known metal testing methods, as the tensile and hardness tests or metallographic examination, are not enough to survey the properties of such structures in depth. For the further and more accurate examinations, the application of X-ray and back-wall echo ultrasonic tests are essential. The goal of our paper is {{the presentation of the}} application of the examinations used extensively in the machine industry for the testing of wrought iron building structures...|$|R
