25|$|After {{receiving}} her B.A. {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1963, Oughton {{spent the next}} two years in Guatemala with the American Friends Service Committee program (AFSC). Nearly half the women from Oughton's college senior class had gone on to graduate school. Oughton was assigned to Chichicastenango, at that time an isolated Indian market town. Oughton went to Guatemala as a liberal, believing that the problems could be identified and solutions devised and carried out. Eventually, she became a radical, and began to feel an urgency to change everything at once. While there, Oughton worked with young adults and older indigenous people to teach them to read. She helped local Catholic priests implement nutritional programs and edited a left-wing Guatemalan newspaper. Oughton lived in a small house with a dirt floor and a little outhouse. During this time, the questions with which she had struggled <b>with</b> <b>came</b> to a head. Oughton questioned what to do about poverty, social injustice, and revolution in the world. Oughton {{came to the conclusion that}} no matter how many hours were spent working to feed and educate, there would always be more people than jobs to earn wages, inadequate food supplies, and never enough shelter to protect people from the elements.|$|E

2500|$|On December 25, 1907, Stanford {{president}} David Starr Jordan wrote {{a letter}} to Sydney Peixotto, president of the Pacific Athletic Association, criticizing Coach Yost, who left Stanford for Michigan in 1901 and returned to the West Coast to defeat Stanford 49-0 in the 1902 Rose Bowl. [...] Jordan focused some of his attacks on Gregory, who had been a Stanford student and football player in 1900. [...] Jordan's letter was published in the Los Angeles Times under the headline, [...] "Jordan's Information Peddled Second-Hand," [...] and in The New York Times under the headline, [...] "Dr. Jordan Picks a New Victim." [...] In the letter, Jordan accused Gregory of having accepted money to play football at Michigan and of having flunked out of Stanford. [...] Jordan stated:"I referred to [...] Rose's career at Michigan with that of Gregory and [...] Heston as illustrating the irregularities which were among the evils of football. [...] Gregory, for example, was a special student – that is, one who had not passed the entrance examinations at Stanford. [...] He was not allowed to play in any of the intercollegiate games, and, failing in his work, was dropped at Christmas. [...] He went to Washburn School to make good his entrance requirements. [...] While there an offer of $1,500 a year to begin <b>with</b> <b>came</b> from Yost through a local agent. Gregory accepted and went to Michigan, played a dozen or more games a year, and was graduated with his class – a singular fact in connection with his failure at Stanford.
