2500|$|On 26 December 2004, {{a massive}} {{submerged}} earthquake and ensuing tsunami waves {{swept across the}} Indian Ocean basin, causing widespread devastation and killing over 230,000 people in fourteen countries. The military element of humanitarian and relief effort was designated Operation Unified Assistance {{under the direction of}} Combined Support Force 536 (CSF-536). On 28 December 2004, Carrier Strike Group Nine set sail from Hong Kong and arrived off the coast of Indonesia near Banda Aceh, Sumatra, on 1 January 2005. Rear Admiral William D.

[...] Abraham Lincolns Air Transportation Office coordinated the flow of supplies into the region, and the carrier provided air traffic control for the relief effort. SH-60 helicopters Seahawks from squadrons HSL-47 and HS-2 ferried supplies from collection points in Sumatra for trans-shipment to disaster victims in the vicinity. The intensive nature of the support missions drove the Seahawks to log over 1,000hours, {{more than three times the}} expected wear-and-tear of standard deployments. HSL-47 itself logged over 600hours during the month of January 2005. Strike group ships, such as the destroyer Benfold, served as re-fueling stations for helicopters involved in relief efforts.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the use of low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) material as a new platform for the packaging of multiple broad area single emitter diode lasers. This will address the recent trend in the laser industry of combining multiple laser diodes in a common package to reach the beam brightness and power required for pumping fibre lasers and for direct-diode industrial applications, such as welding, cutting, and etching. Packages based on multiple single emitters offer advantages over those derived from monolithic diode bars such as higher brightness, negligible thermal crosstalk between neighbouring emitters and protection against cascading failed emitters. In addition, insulated sub-mounted laser diodes based on telecommunication standards are preferred to diode bars and stacks because of the degree of assembly automation, and improved lifetime. At present, lasers are packaged on Cu or CuW platforms, whose high thermal conductivities allow an efficient passive cooling. However, as the number of emitters per package increases and improvements in the laser technology enable higher output power, the passive cooling will become insufficient. To overcome this problem, a LTCC platform capable of actively removing the heat generated by the lasers through impingement jet cooling was developed. It was provided with an internal <b>water</b> <b>manifold</b> capable to impinge water at 0. 15 lmin- 1 flow rate on the back surface of each laser with a variation of less than 2 °C in the temperature between the diodes. The thermal impedance of 2. 7 °C/W obtained allows the LTCC structure to cool the latest commercial broad area single emitter diode lasers which deliver up to 13 W of optical power. Commonly, the emitters are placed in a “staircase” formation to stack the emitters in the fast-axis, maintaining the brightness of the diode lasers. However, due to technical difficulties of machining the LTCC structure with a staircase-shaped face, a novel out-plane beam shaping method was proposed to obtain an elegant and compact free space combination of the laser beam on board using inexpensive optics. A compact arrangement was obtained using aligned folding mirrors, which stacked the beams {{on top of each other}} in the fast direction with the minimum dead space...|$|E

By using standard methods of bacterial identification, the aerobic oral flora of 8 strains and stocks of mice were determined on their arrival at our animal facility.

40|$|An {{innovative}} small dynamic {{water desalination}} plant {{was developed and}} tested under laboratory conditions. The system {{is a combination of}} a heat pipe evacuated tube solar collector, conventional condenser and novel fluid piston converter. Saline water is boiled and turned into vapour in the manifold of the solar collector. A small fraction of the solar energy supplied to the plant is used to drive the fluid piston converter. Oscillations of the fluid piston periodically change the volume and pressure in the plant. For the duration of approximately half of the periodic cycle the pressure in the plant drops below the atmospheric level causing flash boiling of saline <b>water</b> in the <b>manifold</b> of the solar collector. Generated vapour is turned into fresh water in the condenser which is surrounded by a cooling jacket with saline water. The flash boiling effect improves the fresh water production capacity of the plant. Additionally, the fluid piston converter drives a pump which provides lifting of saline water from a well and pumps this through the cooling jacket of the condenser to a saline water storage tank. This tank replenishes saline <b>water</b> in the <b>manifold</b> of the solar collector. Experimental investigations demonstrated the saline water self-circulation capability of the plant and increase in the fresh water production compared to the static mode of operation.
