6000|$|I {{enjoyed the}} triumph--the unholy triumph, I fear I must admit--of seeing Mr. Bruff utterly confounded and overthrown {{by a few}} plain words from Me.

[...] "And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Ablewhite now?" [...] I asked, with the utmost {{possible}} gentleness, as soon as I had done.|$|E
60|$|CYRIL. There is {{something}} in what you say, {{and there is no}} doubt that whatever amusement we may find in reading a purely model novel, we have rarely any artistic pleasure in re-reading it. And this is perhaps the best rough test of what is literature and what is not. If one cannot enjoy reading a book over and over again, there is no use reading it at all. But <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the return to Life and Nature? This is the panacea that is always being recommended to us.|$|E

6000|$|... "You may {{say what}} you please," [...] said Madame Merle, who had listened to this quick {{outbreak}} none the less attentively, we may believe, because her eye wandered away from the speaker and her hands busied themselves with adjusting the knots of ribbon on her dress. [...] "You Osmonds are a fine race--your blood must flow from some very pure source. Your brother, like an intelligent man, has had the conviction of it if he has not had the proofs. You're modest about it, but you yourself are extremely distinguished. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> your niece? The child's a little princess. Nevertheless," [...] Madame Merle added, [...] "it won't be an easy matter for Osmond to marry Miss Archer. Yet he can try." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rembrandt {{shows the}} episode of Jesus {{and the woman}} taken in {{adultery}} from the Gospel of Saint John. In this scene, a few Jews, mainly Scribes and Pharisees, tried to catch Jesus condoning disobedience to the Jewish Law, knowing that Jesus pitied wrong-doers. To do this, they produced {{a woman who had}} been caught taking part in adultery. Then, they said [...] "Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> her?"

5000|$|On December 4, 2008, in an {{appearance}} on CNN's Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, Nardelli was asked, [...] "So <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> {{the argument that the}} Japanese, the Germans, Koreans make better cars than the Americans?" [...] He responded, [...] "We spent about half a billion dollars in the first several months. Our warranty costs are down 29%. It's an interesting comparison because in the hearing today, going around the panel, the majority of the Senators said that citing specific vehicles that they own that they've got 60, 70, 80,000 miles. The comment was you guys are making them too good and therefore, we're not buying vehicles and we're contributing to your problem. That was from the Senators on the committee today." ...|$|E

[...] John’s answer was — [...] "I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know; he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal." [...] This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.|$|E
40|$|In 1994 [1], {{this author}} {{reported}} on a package of random number generators for the NEC SX- 3. Mostly concerned with speed, that article dealt only very briefly with quality. In the current article, we update the earlier report with some quality tests in Cray floating point format (float 2 on the NEC machines). In particular, the suite of tests written by the Helsinki/ Tampere/ Espoo group {{was used to test}} several generators. The quality of the generator reported in the earlier article, by the standards of this test suite, will be left to the judgement of the reader. A couple of other worthy generators are also discussed here. I say, tell me, do you think that a single grain of wheat is a heap? Thereupon you say: no. Then I say: <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> 2 grains?
