Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> part of the body.|$|E

5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E

Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks.

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, Eline was still encountering wind shear and dry air. Despite these factors, the eye became better defined and the storm intensified, aided by favoring upper-level conditions. The cyclone turned {{more to the}} west toward Madagascar, despite a <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> the ridge to the south. While approaching the country, Eline quickly intensified, reaching 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph) by 18:00UTC on February17. Around that time, the cyclone made landfall on eastern Madagascar near Mahanoro. Eline rapidly weakened over land while moving to the west-southwest, and the JTWC downgraded the storm to tropical depression status within 18hours of moving ashore.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A <b>weakness</b> <b>in</b> the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.|$|E
