40|$|AbstractIn {{specialized}} literature {{the issue}} of students’ mentality is analysed {{in relation to their}} attitudes. Some authors believe that the students’ attitude towards learning is influenced by the characteristics of the classroom environment (Fabunmi, 2007), or by students’ commitment and acceptance of tasks (Riaz, 2011). The paper aims at discussing Romanian students’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> learning and the factors that influence them. It is based on experimental research conducted on a group of 200 subjects, all students from various faculties of “Dunărea de Jos” University of Galaţi, Romania. A questionnaire was prepared with the aim of determining the students’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> learning. Among the methods of statistical assessment used, the following could be mentioned: frequency analysis, to illustrate the composition of the group of subjects; the calculation of the median for students’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> learning as variables; Pearson's correlation coefficient, to verify the correlation among such variables as students’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> learning, personal involvement factors, purpose, etc. Partial results seem to indicate the fact that students’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> learning are influenced by such factors as: involvement, purpose, achievement, etc. Students react differently to school tasks: some lay stress on involvement for successful educational outcomes, while others believe that success can be achieved in other ways as well...|$|R

This conceptualization, which has been labeled the biopsychosocial model, views health and illness as the product of a combination of factors including biological characteristics (e.g., genetic predisposition), behavioral factors (e.g., lifestyle, stress, health beliefs), and social conditions (e.g., cultural influences, family relationships, social support).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} explore how young people {{appear to be}} {{employing}} more sophisticated <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> popular media icons that transcend more dichotomous understandings reflected in the literature. It appears that typically popular media icons are conceptualised in the literature {{in terms of a}} dichotomy: they influence young people in either negative or positive ways, never both. Young peoples’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> these icons, however, appear to transcend these binaries, and even hold such binaries together in paradoxical ways. As a ‘for instance’ of these new understandings, the paper draws on recent research conducted by the author about the fashion model. The paper examines more specifically how young girls conceptualise the fashion model body in ways that hold together the typically dichotomous <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> fashion model reflected in the literature. Whereas the literature sets up a discursive binary about the model body as either ‘fatal’ or ‘fun’, young girls draw on more erudite <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the model body as both fatal and fun. In light of this, the paper highlights the need to move to more ironic theoretical tools in order to better understand young peoples’ engagement with popular cultural icons in ‘new times’...|$|R
25|$|With these {{limitations}} in mind, fitness landscapes {{can still be}} an instructive <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> evolution. It is fundamentally possible to measure (even if not to visualise) some of the parameters of landscape ruggedness and of peak number, height, separation, and clustering. Simplified 3D landscapes can then be used relative to each other to visually represent the relevant features. Additionally, fitness landscapes of small subsets of evolutionary pathways may be experimentally constructed and visualized, potentially revealing features such as fitness peaks and valleys. Fitness landscapes of evolutionary pathways indicate the probable evolutionary steps and endpoints among sets of individual mutations.|$|E
25|$|Abduction, deduction, and {{induction}} make incomplete {{sense in}} isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, {{in the struggle to}} move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E

25|$|McLuhan {{writes about}} robotism {{in the context}} of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways of {{thinking}} about technology. The Western <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of Blade Runner and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: “Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours.” The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.|$|E

He argued that it was in the basic tenets of Protestantism to boost capitalism. Thus, it can be said that the spirit of capitalism is inherent to Protestant religious values.|$|E

500|$|In {{his last}} public lecture, which was {{published}} posthumously, Havelock addressed {{the political implications of}} his own scholarly work. Delivered at Harvard on 16 March 1988, less than three weeks before his death, the lecture is framed principally in opposition to the University of Chicago philosopher Leo Strauss. Strauss had published a detailed and extensive critique of Havelock's The Liberal Temper in Greek Politics [...] in March 1959, as [...] "The Liberalism of Classical Political Philosophy" [...] in the journal Review of Metaphysics. [...] (Strauss died 14 years later in 1973, the same year in which Havelock retired.) Havelock's 1988 lecture claims to contain a systematic account of Plato's politics; Havelock argues that Plato's idealism applies a mathematical strictness to politics, countering his old teacher Cornford's assertion that Platonic arguments that morality must be analyzable in arithmetical terms cannot be serious. This <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> politics, Havelock concluded, could not be used as a model for understanding or shaping inherently nonmathematical interactions: [...] "The stuff of human politics is conflict and compromise." ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{academic}} Rikky Rooksby, [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] {{is an example}} of Brian Wilson's growing interest in musical development within a composition, something antithetical to popular music of the time. Suppressing tonic strength and cadential drive, the song makes use of descending harmonic motions through scale degrees controlled by a single tonic and [...] "radical disjunctions" [...] in key, texture, instrumentation, and mood while refusing to develop into a predictable formal pattern. It instead develops [...] "under its own power" [...] and [...] "luxuriates in harmonic variety" [...] exemplified by beginning and ending not only in different keys but also in different modes. Comparing [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] to Wilson's previous work Pet Sounds, biographer Andrew Hickey has said: [...] "he best <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> [...] is that it's taking the lowest common denominator of 'Here Today' and 'God Only Knows' and turned the result into an R track. We have the same minor-key change between verse and chorus we've seen throughout Pet Sounds, the same descending scalar chord sequences, the same mobile bass parts, but here, rather than to express melancholy, these things are used in a way that's as close as Brian Wilson ever got to funky." [...] Author Jon Stebbins adds that [...] "unlike Pet Sounds the chorus of 'Good Vibrations' projects a definite 'rock and roll' energy and feel." ...|$|E

We need to develop inquiry that will not only reflect the changing circumstances in which journalism finds itself but anticipate them as well, because, judging from the present state of affairs, journalism means at once both too much and too little.
