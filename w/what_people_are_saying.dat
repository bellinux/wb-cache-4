500|$|Even {{after winning}} the NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award for the 2005 season, a 2006 [...] Sports Illustrated poll of 361 NFL players named Urlacher the second most overrated {{player in the league}} behind Terrell Owens. In response, Urlacher has stated [...] "Just watch the film. I don’t know <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> but I’m not too worried about it anymore. All I can do is go out there and play hard and try and help my team win, and that's what I’m going to keep doing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “I’m {{just going}} down to the town,” {{announced}} Mr. James Gurtleberry, with an air of some importance: “I want to hear <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> about Albania. Affairs there are beginning to take on a very serious look. It’s my opinion that we haven’t seen the worst of things yet.” ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Moore became deaf {{as a result}} of otosclerosis, which her doctor said {{resulted}} from a deposit of calcium in her middle ear. Moore said that she had to read lips to understand <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b> An operation restored her hearing.|$|R

But I can only do my duty by my client {{to the best of my}} judgment. In the first place, you must remember that he has himself acknowledged the Countess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{will come}} back to me, Miss Tranquil," [...] he said. [...] "I know <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> but that does not trouble me. They do not know Marcella as I do. She promised and she will keep her word--keep it joyously and gladly, too. If I did not know that I would not wish its fulfilment. When she is free she will turn her back on that {{brilliant}} world and all it offers her and come back to me. My part is to wait and believe." ...|$|E

'It's {{all very}} well to say impossible, my dear,' said Lady Monogram; 'but still that's <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> You see Mr Melmotte is a very great man, but perhaps--something else has turned up, so {{that he may be}} thrown over. Things of that kind do happen. You had better finish dressing. I shall. But I shan't make sure of going till I hear that the Emperor is there.' Then she descended to her husband, whom she found forlornly consoling himself with a cigar. 'Damask,' she said, 'you must find out.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Tintin in the Congo {{reflected}} the dominant colonialist ideology at that time. As put by Hergé {{in a later}} interview, [...] "This was in 1930.

50|$|Chattering en {{plein air}} was indeed very risky, {{as a special}} section of {{investigators}} dealt with <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> on the roads; an eventual accusation by some policeman in disguise was evidently very hard to disprove and many people reported of having been falsely accused of anti-national sentiments, just for personal interests of the spy. Consequently, after the first cases, people commonly avoided talking publicly.|$|R
6000|$|How {{could she}} meet him? She must! For {{an hour of}} talk. He was all that she was hungry for. She could not {{let him get away}} without a word--and she would have to. She pictured, and ridiculed, herself as walking up to him and remarking, [...] "I am sick with the Village Virus. Will you please tell me <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> and playing in New York?" [...] She pictured, and groaned over, the {{expression}} of Kennicott if she should say, [...] "Why wouldn't it be reasonable for you, my soul, to ask that complete stranger in the brown jersey coat to come to supper tonight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't you see," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "that {{the great thing}} against me is that Beatrice left me {{suddenly}} {{when we were on}} that wretched expedition, and came back alone? She is in London, I know, quite close to me, and still she hides. Pritchard asks himself why. Mr. Tavernake, go and tell her <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> go and tell her everything that has happened, let her understand that her keeping away is doing me a terrible injury, beg her to come and let people see that we are reconciled, and warn her, too, against Pritchard. Will you do this for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, Miss Covington," [...] Mr. Farmer continued, [...] "it is a {{thousand}} pities {{that you and}} your friend cannot utilize your singular accomplishment in the detective line. You ought to make a fortune by it. I have, of course, heard from my partner of the education that you had in Germany, and of your having acquired some new system by which you can understand <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> by watching their lips, but I certainly had no conception that it could be carried to such an extent as you have just proved it can. It is like gaining a new sense. Now I suppose you have come to us for advice as to what had best be done next." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} so much {{of you and your}} niece, Miss Purcell," [...] he said as he shook hands with her, [...] "that I do do not feel that you are a stranger. You {{certainly}} seem to have worked wonders between you for my niece, and I must own that in the first place I thought it a mistake her being here by herself, for I had no belief that either her hearing would be restored or that she would ever be able to follow <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> by only staring at their lips." ...|$|R

50|$|The two {{brothers}} walk from Gray's Inn to Whitehall, speaking candidly, as Christopher disabuses Mark about the rumours defaming him and Valentine. It {{turns out that}} Mark, asked by his father {{to find out about}} Christopher (in case he needed money), had asked his flatmate Ruggles to discover <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> about Christopher; and that it was Ruggles who relayed the malicious gossip to their father. As they get to the War Office they run into Valentine, who has come to say goodbye to Christopher. He leaves her to talk to Mark while he goes in for a meeting, at which he is offered the chance to be given a posting at home rather than be returned to France for active service, but he refuses.|$|R
60|$|October 13.--Nocte pluit tota--an {{excellent}} {{recipe for}} a mob, so they have been quiet accordingly, as we are informed. Two or three other wet nights would do much to weary them out with inactivity. Milman, whom I remember a fine gentlemanlike young man, dined here yesterday. He says the fires have never ceased in his country, but that the oppressions and sufferings occasioned by the poor's rates are very great, {{and there is no}} persuading the English farmer that an amended system is comfortable both for rich and poor. The plan of ministers is to keep their places maugre Peers and Commons both, while they have the countenance of the crown; but if a Prince shelters, by authority of the prerogative, ministers against the will of the other authority of the state, does he not quit the defence which supposes he can do no wrong? This doctrine would make a curious change of parties. Will they attempt to legitimize the Fitz Clarences? God forbid! Yet it may end in that,--it would be Paris all over. The family is said to have popular qualities. Then what would be the remedy? Marry! seize on the person of the Princess Victoria, carrying her north and setting up the banner of England with the Duke of W. as dictator! Well, I am too old to fight, and therefore should keep the windy side of the law; besides, I shall be buried before times come to a decision. In the meantime the King dare not go to stand godfather to the son of one of his most powerful peers, a party of his own making, lest his loving subjects pull the house about the ears of his noble host and the company invited to meet him. Their loyalty has a pleasant way of displaying itself. I will go to Westminster after breakfast and see <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> and whether the Barham is likely to sail, or whether its course is not altered to the coast of the Low Countries instead of the Mediterranean.|$|E

30|$|Considering {{the great}} volume of {{information}} generated by citizens, {{it becomes more}} and more necessary to provide emergency operation centers with specific tools for analyzing and tracking these data. Several contributions apply visual analytics to the collected messages. They mainly focus on <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> in social networks, extracting opinions together with other useful details, like time, geolocalization and word frequency, but in a domain like emergency management this is not enough. Whenever a crisis happens, thousands of data are generated by citizens, but many of them are irrelevant, inaccurate or even false. One of the main challenges that emergency management agencies and corps face to integrate social networks in their practice is the lack of resources to extract meaningful knowledge from such a heterogeneous mass of data (Díaz et al. 2014). Therefore, a tool is needed to analyze the information flow from social networks and to extract the most relevant knowledge respect to a specific scope, as for example the evolution of a critical event.|$|R
5000|$|With Akercocke's gig in Belfast {{scheduled}} for Friday 18 May, BBC Northern Ireland's producers arranged a video link {{up to take}} place the Wednesday before. Shortly after the show at Rock City, the band's Mendonca and Gray appeared on the debate, {{but they had a}} four-second delay on their satellite link and could not hear <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b> As Terrorizer magazine pointed out, [...] "viewers expecting a decent debate about censorship and religion witnessed Gray and Mendonca heading off criticism from both the audience and furious Christian panellists." [...] During the debate, Mendonca said he wanted to challenge the idea that just because Akercocke play satanically motivated music, they are anti-Christian. In response, a Christian panellist promised Mendonca that he would pray for him [...] "on the day you wake up in a pool of your own vomit."
