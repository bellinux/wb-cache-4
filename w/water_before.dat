5|$|Between 2011–2015, Thistle's mascot was Jaggy MacBee, a large {{bumble bee}} {{that had been}} {{introduced}} {{as part of the}} clubs sponsorship with MacB <b>Water.</b> <b>Before</b> that, Thistle used a brightly coloured toucan called Pee Tee as its official mascot.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1998, the TSB {{initiated}} a heavy lift operation {{to retrieve the}} major portion of the wreckage from the deep <b>water</b> <b>before</b> the expected winter storms began. By 21 October, an estimated 27% of the wreckage was recovered.|$|E
5|$|In the video, Selena {{is sitting}} in a {{restaurant}} where a mariachi band is performing. A waiter offers her a glass of water. As the singer enjoys her dinner, the waiter returns with a note saying that her lover (for whom she has been waiting) has left her for another woman. Selena takes a sip of <b>water</b> <b>before</b> she leaves the restaurant, crying.|$|E

5|$|She {{remained}} in service until 8 February 1945, {{when she ran}} aground in the Alverstraumen narrows. Kommandøren remained aground for five weeks, and was filled by sea <b>water</b> <b>before</b> being salvaged and towed to Bergen to await repairs. Although the ship's hull was intact, the interior and engine were heavily water damaged.|$|E
5|$|The Cunard White Star Line's RMS Queen Elizabeth {{was named}} after her. She {{launched}} the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank, Scotland. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the <b>water</b> <b>before</b> Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before it slid out of reach. In 1954, Queen Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake.|$|E
5|$|When {{ready to}} emerge, several {{different}} strategies are used. In some species, {{the transformation of}} the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent {{for a minute or two}} resting on the exuviae (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the <b>water</b> <b>before</b> transforming.|$|E
50|$|Former:These {{were the}} Offshore <b>waters</b> <b>before</b> the Ocean Prediction Center {{implemented}} new smaller zones on April 1, 2014.|$|R
25|$|Following the war, Townsville {{was engaged}} in {{minesweeping}} and patrol duties in Australian and New Britain <b>waters,</b> <b>before</b> being decommissioned into reserve in Fremantle on 5 August 1946.|$|R
25|$|Goulburn {{spent the}} first part of 1945 {{operating}} in Australian <b>waters,</b> <b>before</b> returning to New Guinea in May. She spent a month on escort and minesweeping duties, before sailing to Darwin and escorting a floating dry dock to Milne Bay. The corvette remained in New Guinea waters {{until the end of the}} war on 15 August. On 30 August, Goulburn and two sister ships escorted a convoy to Hong Kong, arriving on 21 September. The corvette was involved in minesweeping operations throughout Chinese <b>waters,</b> <b>before</b> returning to Sydney in December 1945.|$|R
5|$|Early on 8 July, U-255 caught another {{ship from}} Convoy PQ 17, the 6,069 ton American {{merchant}} ship Olopana, loaded with 6,000 tons of explosives, gasoline, and trucks as deck cargo. A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, {{and asked if they}} had enough food and <b>water</b> <b>before</b> leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
5|$|For half of {{the year}} or longer, adults live in slow-flowing river margins, lakes, or ponds, where {{reproduction}} takes place. Males perform a courtship display, and females lay around 200 eggs individually onto leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop two to four months in the <b>water</b> <b>before</b> reaching metamorphosis. For the remainder of the year, the newts live in shady land habitats, usually forests. Although not yet considered threatened, Danube crested newt populations have declined significantly, the reason being mainly habitat loss. The species is protected by law in the European Union.|$|E
5|$|In {{the short}} time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford {{engineers}} produced many significant technological advances. As {{no one had ever}} built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, DuPont engineers installed ammonia-based refrigeration systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river <b>water</b> <b>before</b> its use as reactor coolant.|$|E
50|$|The cross-Channel ferry {{featured}} {{in one scene}} is the MS Free Enterprise I. The ship spent many years as a day cruise ship in Greek <b>waters</b> <b>before</b> being scrapped in 2013.|$|R
50|$|Argonne {{remained}} in the western Pacific {{through the end of}} hostilities with Japan in August 1945, and briefly served with the occupation forces in Japanese <b>waters</b> <b>before</b> returning to the United States.|$|R
50|$|State Highway 2 {{follows the}} course of the river for most of its length, with the {{exception}} of the Kaitoke Gorge and the head <b>waters,</b> <b>before</b> crossing the Rimutaka Range into the Wairarapa.|$|R
5|$|Lactation {{proceeds}} for 19 to 42 months, but calves, rarely, may suckle up to 13 years. Like other whales, {{the sperm}} whale's milk {{has a higher}} fat content than that of terrestrial mammals: about 36%, compared to 4% in cow milk. This gives it a consistency similar to cottage cheese, which prevents it from dissolving in the <b>water</b> <b>before</b> the calf can eat it. It has an energy content of roughly 3,840 kcal/kg, compared to just 640 kcal/kg in cow milk. Calves may be allowed to suckle from females other than their mothers.|$|E
5|$|On October 3, United States President Bill Clinton {{declared}} nine Florida counties as disaster areas, which allocated {{federal funding}} for debris removal, emergency services, and restoration of damaged public facilities. In Franklin County, many residents had to boil <b>water</b> <b>before</b> consumption due to contaminated water wells. As a result, the local Red Cross chapter provided water bottles to the affected residents. The Red Cross also deployed two Mobile Feeding Vehicles to Wakulla County, {{and a total of}} 700meals were ultimately distributed.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Flight 825 took off, a {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas scored a hit on its {{starboard}} wing with a Soviet-made Strela-2 surface-to-air infrared homing missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing. An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of Karoi was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because {{they had gone to}} look for <b>water</b> <b>before</b> the guerrillas arrived.|$|E
50|$|A Tropical Depression {{formed in}} the Bay of Bengal on December 8. The {{depression}} was monitored by the IMD, not the JTWC. The depression remained out over open <b>waters</b> <b>before</b> dissipating on December 10.|$|R
50|$|Upon completion, {{the ships}} served briefly in home <b>waters</b> <b>before</b> being {{assigned}} to various oversea stations (China, Halifax, and the Caribbean). During this time HMS Bedford was wrecked in the East China Sea and scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Hunter Marshall got {{underway}} from Boston, Massachusetts, on 3 August 1945 {{to conduct}} shakedown training in Caribbean <b>waters.</b> <b>Before</b> she could complete this training, {{the surrender of}} Japan on 15 August 1945 ended World War II.|$|R
5|$|The Batavian {{government}} immediately {{ordered an}} expeditionary force to sail to the Cape and recapture the colony. This force comprised two ships {{of the line}} and five smaller vessels, all under the command of Rear-Admiral Engelbertus Lucas. Security regarding the plans was weak and the British knew of the operation before Lucas had sailed. The British warned Elphinstone, who further reinforced the Cape. Lucas's journey took nearly six months, suffering shortages of drinking water leading to a near-mutinous state among his crews. On arrival, the Batavian fleet anchored in Saldanha Bay to take on fresh <b>water</b> <b>before</b> deciding to abandon the operation and sail to the French base at Île de France in the Western Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The text {{asserts that}} fresh water is Amrita (nectar) of cuisine, and Visha (poison) otherwise. Someshvara III {{recommends}} fresh water from rains (autumn), springs (summer), {{rivers and lakes}} (winter) for daily use, {{after it has been}} filtered with a clean cloth. The text recommends boiling the <b>water</b> <b>before</b> use and using the water so in a day. For drinking, if boiling is not possible, the text recommends alternate purification method based on Triphala, and then adding a piece of mango, patala or champaka flower or powder of camphor for flavor and delight. The text mentions fresh coconut water and drinks called Panakas.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins as}} Rihanna, scantily dressed and wearing fishnet stockings, stands against a {{convertible}} {{car in a}} desert. Timberlake, wearing a leather jacket and black jeans, arrives on a motorcycle. He unbuttons his jacket to cool down and bathes in pink-colored <b>water</b> <b>before</b> greeting Rihanna at her Airstream trailer. The pair then climb onto {{the hood of the}} vintage car. In the next scene, Timberlake plays a guitar while lying on a large rocket. Throughout the video, Timberlake and Rihanna vary their poses from sultry to defensive.|$|E
25|$|Brisbane {{spent the}} first nine months of her career {{undergoing}} exercises in US <b>waters,</b> <b>before</b> sailing for Australia on 28 September 1968. After visits to Pearl Harbor and Suva, Brisbane arrived in her namesake city on 17 October.|$|R

25|$|After the refit, Geelong briefly {{operated}} in Australian <b>waters</b> <b>before</b> being assigned to New Guinea. Using Milne Bay {{as a base}} of operations, the corvette served as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship throughout the South West Pacific Area.|$|R
5|$|The video {{opens with}} shots of a dank {{underground}} sewer. Stevens {{and a group}} of women walk through the sewer and put on sunglasses before climbing out of manholes and shafts. A large crowd of women, with Stevens leading them, parades down the streets as men observe the spectacle. The women begin spraying each other with bottles of <b>water,</b> <b>before</b> Stevens returns to the sewer. Throughout the video, sequences of Stevens {{and a group of}} backup dancers performing in the sewer are shown.|$|E
5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher lanolin content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce <b>water</b> <b>before</b> it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E
5|$|Bird entered {{politics}} in 1981. Three {{years later he}} was elected to the House of Representatives and became Minister of Aviation, Public Information and Public Utilities. As minister, Bird conducted a purchase deal for Dominican <b>water</b> <b>before</b> being made Minister of Public Works and Communications on 1 January 1987. In this role, he oversaw the reconstruction of V. C. Bird International Airport, which was the subject of controversy after it was discovered that he had granted a contract for the construction of a new runway to a company in which he was a shareholder. This led to conflict within the ALP, but Bird remained a minister. He was later fired after a scandal in which Israeli weapons, sold to Antigua and Barbuda, were found in the hands of the Medellín Cartel of Colombian drug smugglers – it was discovered that the weapons had been transferred at Bird's instruction, and a report by Sir Louis Blom-Cooper recommended that he be prohibited from holding public office again.|$|E
50|$|The cave systems usually carry {{away any}} <b>waters</b> <b>before</b> {{they reach the}} fall; however, Malham Cove {{temporarily}} became a waterfall for what {{is believed to be}} the first time in centuries on 6 December 2015, after heavy rainfall from Storm Desmond.|$|R
50|$|Analysis {{of stable}} oxygen isotope {{composition}} of otoliths {{has shown that}} Monomitopus pallidus and Monomitopus kumae undergo an ontogenetic habitat shift, spending their early life pelagically in shallower <b>waters,</b> <b>before</b> descending to the deep-sea floor where they stay for rest of their lives.|$|R
