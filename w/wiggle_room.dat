5000|$|Gift basket {{diplomacy}} {{is an attempt}} to solve the [...] "lowest common denominator" [...] problem of multilateral diplomacy. In United Nations style fora when countries issue a communiqué, or statement about their activities, a common process is for all countries to agree in consensus to the precise wording of a document or some output that characterizes their discussion. For issues with large numbers of countries, it becomes difficult to build complete consensus on a document without most countries having to give up much of the language they had proposed. This process leads to a series of scaled-back drafts where countries adjust their language to ever weaker positions in order to negotiate consensus. It is not uncommon for countries to be disappointed in a final communiqué because they had to discard much of their language in order to appease other countries with significantly opposing views. The result often is a communiqué document with heavily caveated with hedged language that provides ample <b>wiggle</b> <b>room</b> so that participants can justify not following through on commitments.Gift basket diplomacy attempts to circumvent the need for consensus by seeking out like-minded parties who support similar language in a document and agreeing among these smaller groups to particular language or negotiating position. These smaller groups often more quickly finalize negotiations amongst themselves and issue a joint statement on their own without the consensus or agreement of the larger group. The result usually is much stronger language or pledges for more concrete action with fewer caveats.|$|E
