In 2015, another later amendment is the SOLAS Container <b>Weight</b> <b>Verification</b> Regulation VI/2. This regulation, implemented by the IMO Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) requires that {{the full weight of}} loaded containers must be obtained prior to being onboarded on an ocean vessel. Communicating a weight value has called for the introduction of a new Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) communication protocol called VGM (Verified Gross Mass) or VERMAS (Verification of Mass), and involves cooperation between ocean carriers, Freight Forwarders/NVOCCs, EDI providers as well as exporters. The regulation states that exporters (shippers) are ultimately responsible to obtain a verified container weight. Originally scheduled for implementation on July 1, 2016, the regulation allows for flexibility and practical refinement according to the Maritime Safety Committee Memorandum #1548 to October 1, 2016.|$|E

One of the known difficulties, when separately verifying components, is producing compositional proofs for progress properties of distributed systems.

40|$|Conference PaperThe {{transmit}} diversity concept adopted for teh FDD mode {{of the third}} generation WCDMA system in 3 G standardization has an open-loop and a closed-loop mode. The open-loop mode applies a space-time block for two transmit antennas. The closed-loop mode has two sub-modes, which both utilize downloink measurements at terminal and subsequent feedback in controlling the phase and/or gain transmit weights in the transmit antennas in order to approximate matched beamforming. These concepts are summarized in this paper for two transmit antennas and they are compared to a soft-weighted {{transmit diversity}} concept, proposed here, in which the relative transmit powers of the space-time encoded signals are controlled by feedback signaling.

A technique was developed to accurately describe the geometry of the cervical spine using a set of unique geometry parameters measured from Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Cervical spine parameters were measured from CT scans from 73 volunteers (50 male, 23 female). A modeling procedure was developed to accurately and efficiently construct parametric finite element models of the cervical spine using the defined geometry parameters and was used to represent each gender and <b>weight</b> group. <b>Verification</b> and validation (V&V) of the FE models were performed using a hierarchical approach. The procedure consisted of verifying the model performance at increasing levels of complexity, each step building upon the previous one. Four hierarchical levels were used in this study: the component level (individual tissue properties), the meso-component level (the intervertebral disc construct), a complete motion segment, and the final full cervical spine column. At each hierarchical level the model predictions were validated against experimental data. The uncertainties of both the model and the experimental result...|$|R

In these closed-loop systems, feedback delay and feedback error, as well as the sub-optimum reconstruction of the quantized feedback data, are the usual sources of deficiency. We address the efficient reconstruction of the beamforming weights {{in the presence of the}} feedback imperfections, by exploiting the residual redundancies in the feedback stream. Focusing on the issue of feedback delay, we propose two approaches to improve the performance. One is based on using a channel predictor at the receiver to compensate for the delay, and using a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) method similar to our previous work [2] to compensate for the feedback error. Another approach deals with the feedback imperfections in a unified reconstruction algorithm using JSCC techniques.

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} limitations of mobile radio communications is their time-varying fading channel. This thesis addresses the efficient use of channel state information to improve the communication systems, with a particular emphasis on practical issues such as compatibility with the existing wireless systems and low complexity implementation. The closed-loop transmit diversity technique is used to improve {{the performance of the}} downlink channel in MIMO communication systems. For example, the WCDMA standard endorsed by 3 GPP adopts a mode of downlink closed-loop scheme based on partial channel state information known as mode 1 of 3 GPP. Channel state information is fed back from the mobile unit to the base station through a low-rate uncoded feedback bit stream.

We propose a number of algorithms for reconstruction of beamforming weights at the base-station, with the constraint of a constant transmit power.

We introduce the concept of Blind Antenna Verification which can substitute the conventional Antenna <b>Weight</b> <b>Verification</b> process without the need for any training data. The closed-loop mode 1 of 3 GPP is used as a benchmark, and the performance is examined within a WCDMA simulation framework. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithms have substantial gain over the conventional method at all mobile speeds, and are suitable for the implementation in practice. The proposed approach is applicable to other closed-loop schemes as well. The problem of (long-range) prediction of the fading channel is also considered, which is a key element for many fading-compensation techniques. A linear approach, usually used to model the time evolution of the fading process, does not perform well for long-range prediction applications. We propose an adaptive algorithm using a state-space approach for the fading process based on the sum-sinusoidal model. Also to enhance the widely-used linear approach, we propose a tracking method for a multi-step linear predictor. Comparing the two methods in our simulations shows that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the linear method, for both stationary and non-stationary fading processes, especially for long-range predictions. The robust structure, as well as the reasonable computational complexity, makes the proposed algorithm appealing for practical applications...|$|E

The bill is large and solid, with the culmen measuring 15.2 - 17.6 cm. The chin and central portion of the underside are whitish in color (per the common name), contrasting strongly against the dark grey color on the back. The legs are blackish with scale-like texture on the tarsus which measures 17.1 to 21.6 cm. In flight, it has a uniform dark grey upperwing and white underwing-coverts contrasting with dark grey flight feathers. The rump appears paler grey.At 127 cm (50 in) in height, it is the second largest heron on earth, after the Goliath heron. Included in the length, the mid-sized tail measures 19.9 to 21.6 cm. The wing chord measures 54.6 to 57.2 cm, with an estimated wingspan of 2 m or more. One estimate of body mass was relatively low at 2 - 2.6 kg, however a deceased juvenile of the species reportedly weighed much more at 5.6 kg.

By re-examining the earliest sources where the unification is described (i. e. the Shiji, the Hanshu, and the Shuowen jiezi). This paper argues that there was a political and ideological agenda behind ascribing the process to a single person, namely, the victorious Qin ruler.

Even edict plates issued by the Qin government and attached to the new standardised <b>weights</b> as a <b>verification</b> of them being standardised did not reveal a presence of a uniform script. Moreover, the weights themselves showed a certain degree of deviation from their face value, revealing that the idea of a “standard”, even if it existed, was much loser than today.

40|$|The central {{topic of}} this thesis is Alperin's weight conjecture, a problem {{concerning}} the representation theory of finite groups. This conjecture, which was first proposed by J. L. Alperin in 1986, asserts that for any finite group {{the number of}} its irreducible Brauer characters coincides {{with the number of}} conjugacy classes of its weights. The blockwise version of Alperin's conjecture partitions this problem into a question concerning the number of irreducible Brauer characters and weights belonging to the blocks of finite groups. A proof for this conjecture has not (yet) been found. However, the problem has been reduced to a question on non-abelian finite (quasi-) simple groups in the sense that there is a set of conditions, the so-called inductive blockwise Alperin <b>weight</b> condition, whose <b>verification</b> for all non-abelian finite simple groups implies the blockwise Alperin weight conjecture. Now the objective is to prove this condition for all non-abelian finite simple groups, all of which are known via the classification of finite simple groups. In this thesis we establish the inductive blockwise Alperin weight condition for three infinite series of finite groups of Lie type: the special linear groups SL_ 3 (q) in the case q> 2 and q ≡ 1 3, the Chevalley groups G_ 2 (q) for q ≥ 5, and Steinberg's triality groups ^ 3 D_ 4 (q) ...|$|R

The <b>weight</b> and <b>verification</b> of the gold while being transferred to Soviet authorities was done conjunctly by Soviet and Spanish representatives. The Spanish government stipulated that it would have the faculty to pay off orders made abroad and to carry out currency transactions through the Soviet State Bank based on the gold reserves deposited in the Soviet Union.According to the information received, the Spanish government made numerous payments for its foreign purchases and gave instructions for currency transactions, that were executed by the Bank of the Soviet Union. According to the data of the Soviet authorities, the Spanish government exhausted the gold deposited in the Soviet Union. All the orders of the Spanish Republican government were appropriately signed conjunctly by Francisco Largo Caballero, Spanish Republican Prime Minister, and Negrín, Minister of Finance. Later on, when Negrín went on to become Prime Minister, he signed as such and as Minister of Finance. The last letter from Negrín, dated April 8 of 1938, proves that the gold had been exhausted. The letter requests in the name of the Council of Ministers of the Spanish Republic, that all the Spanish gold that remains in the Soviet Union be liquidated. And so it was. It must be mentioned that, upon requirement of the Spanish Republican government, the Soviet government gave it a credit of 85 million dollars, of which they only repaid 35. There is thus still a debt the Soviet governmentof 50 million dollars. Negrín knew it, as he signed all his orders relative to the gold and the credits. None of the deposited gold was used for the support of the emigrants and Spanish children that sought refuge in the Soviet Union.

40|$|Research in {{aircraft}} design {{is focusing on}} novel aircraft configurations in search for a step change in terms of overall transport efficiency. Aircraft design relies heavily on empirical methods, so-called Class 2 methods, to evaluate {{the performance of a}} design. Since these methods are based on statistical data their validity is limited when these are used for the design of novel aircraft. There is therefore a strong need for methods that are valid for the conceptual {{aircraft design}} of these novel aircraft. The method proposed in this thesis is a semi-analytical method for estimating the weight of a fuselage constructed using the oval fuselage concept. The oval fuselage is a concept for a wide unobstructed pressurized cabin specifically useful for Blended Wing Body aircraft. A parameterization of the oval fuselage is presented and it is demonstrated that the oval cross-section can be used for the design of conventional tube-and-wing aircraft with a single-deck or twin-deck layout as well as for blended-wing-body aircraft. It is also shown that the oval cross-section allows for additional design freedom of the fuselage shape without introducing any bending loads in the fuselage skin panels. Using this parameterization, a method is presented for estimating the weight of this fuselage when used in conventional and novel aircraft configurations. The weight estimation of the fuselage is based on the combination of pressurization loads, steady-state maneuver loads, aerodynamic loads and landing loads. Each of the structural members of the inner structure is sized based on two-dimensional structural analysis satisfying requirements on bi-axial strength, global buckling, crippling, dimpling, and wrinkling. The outer structure is sized using a global buckling criteria adapted from cylinders and a local buckling criteria based on buckling of slender plates. Empirical methods are used to calculate the nonstructural weight and additional <b>weight.</b> A <b>verification</b> of the structural analysis method by a finite-element analysis shows that the made assumptions for the analysis of the structure are valid within the application of aircraft fuselage design. The weight estimation method is compared with weight estimation methods from the open literature and with weight data of existing aircraft. The accuracy of the weight estimation {{is similar to that of}} empirical methods for circular fuselages. Examples are shown of oval fuselages in aircraft designs and weight estimations are performed on these fuselages to form a basis for future research on this subject.

O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em blocos casualizados, num arranjo fatorial 2 x 2, sendo os fatores: probiótico e desafio, os quais definiram os tratamentos: T 1 - emprego do probiótico, com desafio (CPCD); T 2 - emprego do probiótico, sem o desafio (CPSD); T 3 - ausência do probiótico, com desafio (SPCD); T 4 - ausência do probiótico e sem o desafio (SPSD). As faixas de ganho médio de peso diário consideradas foram: dos 21 aos 35 dias (GMPD 35); dos 35 aos 49 dias (GMPD 49); dos 49 aos 63 dias (GMPD 63) e dos 21 aos 63 dias (GMPD Total). Os leitões foram submetidos ao desafio em sala separada, 14 dias após a distribuição nos tratamentos. O desafio foi realizado com uma amostra de E. coli positiva para as toxinas LT e ST b e para as fímbrias K 88 e F 18. A colheita das fezes foi feita após o desafio, em três períodos (35, 42 e 49 dias de idade dos leitões), para contagem de coliformes fecais, sendo analisadas pelo Laboratório de Sanidade Suína da FMVZ-USP, em São Paulo. A ração oferecida aos leitões foi semelhante à empregada comercialmente nas criações, havendo somente suplementação ou não do probiótico. O experimento avaliou o desempenho dos leitões através do ganho de peso diário (GMPD) e peso (P), acrescido da verificação da consistência das fezes e da contagem de coliformes fecais. Os resultados mostraram interação significativa entre probiótico e desafio quanto ao GMPD 49, indicando nesse período, o ponto de inflexão que caracterizou o início da mudança no comportamento desta variável. Com relação à consistência das fezes, o probiótico agiu reduzindo o percentual de fezes cremosas, confirmando sua ação protetora da mucosa intestinal, reduzindo a perda de líquido e, conseqüentemente, a diarréia. Além de atuar melhorando os parâmetros relativos ao desempenho e à consistência das fezes, a utilização do probiótico promoveu uma alteração na contagem de E. coli, reduzindo-a para um valor inferior, 14 dias após o desafio, reforçando assim a sua ação benéfica junto á manutenção da integridade intestinalThe {{experiment was}} conducted in the nursery unit at the Swine Research Laboratory from the FMVZ, University of São Paulo, Pirassununga campus, where we used 72 piglets recently weaned (about 21 days) with the average weight of 6, 5 kg. The experiment was outlined in random blocks system, 2 x 2 factorial arrangements, being the factors: probiotic and challenge. The treatment was: T 1 ? use of the probiotic, with challenge (CPCD); T 2 ? use of the probiotic, without the challenge (CPSD); T 3 ? no probiotic, with challenge (SPCD); T 4 ? no probiotic and no challenge (SPSD). The intervals of weight daily gain considered were 21 to 35 days (GMPD 35); 35 to 49 days (GMPD 49); 49 to 63 days (GMPD 63) and 21 to 63 days (GMPD Total). The piglets were kept in two different rooms. One of the groups was challenged 14 days after the distribution in the treatments, in a separated room and for the challenge we used a sample of E. coli positive for the toxins LT and ST b and also for the pilli K 88 and F 18. The samples of feces were collected after the challenge in three periods (35, 42 and 49 days of age of the piglets) {{and sent to the}} Swine Health Laboratory at the FMVZ-USP, São Paulo campus, where the count of some species of intestinal bacteria was performed.
