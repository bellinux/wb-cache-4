In the process, she defeated three players ranked in the world top 20. She successfully defended the title in Penang in 2001, becoming one of only two players in the history of squash to have won it twice; her coach <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Glanfield.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Wilder's agent {{sent him}} a script for a film called Super Chief. Wilder accepted, but told the film's {{producers}} that he thought {{the only person who}} could keep the film from being offensive <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Pryor. Pryor accepted the role in the film, which had been renamed Silver Streak, the first film to team Wilder and Pryor. They became Hollywood's first successful interracial movie comedy duo.|$|E

5|$|Richard Swinefield died on 15 March 1317, and {{was buried}} in Hereford Cathedral, where a {{memorial}} in the transept's north wall depicts him in bishop's robes and holding a building. Two of his nephews were given offices within the diocese, with John given the precentorship in Hereford Cathedral, and Gilbert made the chancellor there. Another possible relative <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Swinfield, who also held a prebend in the diocese.|$|E
5|$|The {{architect}} of Bush House <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Shackleton Pope, who constructed first the south {{part of the}} warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835–1836. Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D., E. & A. Acraman. The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with arched ground level entrances and arched windows above. This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s. Later conversion to a tea warehouse added interstitial floors.|$|E

5|$|Watership Down <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Adams' first novel. Although it was {{rejected}} by several publishers before Collings accepted it, it won the annual Carnegie Medal, annual Guardian Prize, and other book awards. It was adapted into the 1978 animated film Watership Down. Later there was a television series also titled Watership Down which ran from 1999 to 2001.|$|E
5|$|As a {{relatively}} rural environment {{in an increasingly}} urbanised area, Kersal Moor was also used for more peaceful pursuits. During the 18th and 19th centuries it was much frequented by amateur naturalists and botanists. One of the botanists <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Buxton {{who went on to}} write A Botanical Guide to Manchester. In 1829 an amateur insect collector named Robert Cribb collected a series of about fifty small yellow and brown moths from a rotting alder on the moor. These {{turned out to be a}} previously unknown species of moth, but they were mistakenly attributed to a friend of Cribb's, the collector R. Wood, who had asked an expert to identify them. The moths were classified as Pancalia woodiella (today Euclemensia woodiella) in Wood's honour.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert's {{successor}} in 1842 <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Harrington, who {{inherited a}} college in good shape: income was around £15,000; only Christ Church was significantly bigger in size. Academic reforms, {{particularly with regard}} to examinations– which were to be administered by the university, rather than the college– were instituted across Oxford {{in the first half of}} the century. Brasenose's proportion of first-class degrees fell sharply from its previous peak. By 1850, no matriculation exam was instituted at Brasenose, as at other colleges, although the other examinations were altered: responsions moved forward and moderations instituted. Brasenose, like the University, was yet to truly reform the range of subjects studied, however. It was only in 1849 that modern sciences were only given a separate School (and thus examination) in 1849; law and modern history a year later.|$|E

5|$|James Russell Lowell {{was born}} February22, 1819. He {{was a member}} of the eighth {{generation}} of the Lowell family, the descendants of Percival Lowle who settled in Newbury, Massachusetts, in 1639. His parents were the Reverend Charles Russell Lowell Sr. (1782–1861), a minister at a Unitarian church in Boston who had previously studied theology at Edinburgh, and Harriett Brackett Spence Lowell. By the time that James Russell Lowell was born, the family owned a large estate in Cambridge called Elmwood. He was the youngest of six children; his siblings were Charles, Rebecca, Mary, William, and Robert. Lowell's mother built in him an appreciation for literature at an early age, especially in poetry, ballads, and tales from her native Orkney. He attended school under Sophia Dana, who later married George Ripley; he later studied at a school run by a particularly harsh disciplinarian, where one of his classmates <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Henry Dana Jr.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, CryoSat-2 was {{constructed}} by EADS Astrium, with its main instrument being built by Thales Alenia Space. Construction {{and testing of}} the spacecraft's primary instrument was completed by February 2008, when it was shipped for integration {{with the rest of}} the spacecraft. In August 2009, the spacecraft's ground infrastructure, which had been redesigned since the original mission, was declared ready for use. Construction and testing of the spacecraft had been completed by mid-September. The Project Manager for the CryoSat-2 mission <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Francis, who had been the Systems Manager on the original CryoSat mission.|$|E
5|$|Madgwick's {{second term}} as {{chairman}} expired on 30 June 1973 and {{he hoped to}} be extended for a third. McClelland, however, told Madgwick in early 1973 that Whitlam was concerned about Madgwick's age and therefore planned to replace him. Privately, Madgwick felt that Whitlam wanted him replaced because Whitlam suspected Madgwick and his vice-chairman of being biased in favour of the previous government. Madgwick, as with Darling, was not officially informed that would be replaced as chairman until shortly before his term expired. The new chairman <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Downing, Assistant Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne and a Labor supporter.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{promoters}} for a canal <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> Prat, who was {{a lawyer}} in Glastonbury, had been the town clerk since 1813, and held several important offices in the town. He saw the canal {{as a way to}} halt the economic downturn in the town and its drainage problems, and called a meeting in August 1825, at which a firm plan was formulated. Richard Hammett, a local man from Street, was commissioned to conduct a survey of the route in 1826. Hammett had experience of building a manure canal through peat heathland. He considered two main routes; the first followed the course of the River Brue, but was rejected on the grounds of engineering costs, and the interference with its drainage function. The second route followed the South Drain, which had been newly constructed following floods in 1794, to connect with the River Brue near Cripps Bridge, and to re-use the old course of that River at Highbridge to create a basin.|$|E
5|$|Richard Edward O'Connor {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Glebe on 4 August 1851. His mother was Mary Anne, née Harnett, while his father <b>was</b> <b>Richard,</b> an Irish-born Catholic who at that time served as {{librarian}} to the New South Wales Legislative Council, and would later become Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, chairing its first meeting. His family believed itself to be descended from the Irish republican rebel Arthur O'Connor, and also counted the prominent Tasmanian pioneer Roderic O'Connor among their relations. Richard Edward, sometimes known as Dick, attended St Mary's College, a Benedictine school in Lyndhurst, from 1861 to 1866 before matriculating at Sydney Grammar School in 1867 and studying at the University of Sydney. From a young age his closest friend was Edmund Barton, in whose Cabinet O'Connor would later serve. He won the Wentworth medal for the best English essay in 1870, and received a Bachelor of Arts in 1871 and a Master of Arts in 1873.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} a French {{invasion}} did not subside, but instead grew stronger into 1386. At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Polein his capacity of chancellorrequested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm. Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed. The parliament (later known as the Wonderful Parliament) was presumably working {{with the support of}} Gloucester and Arundel. The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a scullion from his kitchen at parliament's request. Only when threatened with deposition <b>was</b> <b>Richard</b> forced to give in and let de la Pole go. A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.|$|E
