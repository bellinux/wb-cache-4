5|$|Morality is {{measured}} by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game. For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> they gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from the entire team surviving to the entire team being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between. Upon completing the game, a New Game Plus option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.|$|E

25|$|Leaders need {{to ensure}} that {{conflict}} remains constructive. That is, they must stimulate task-oriented disagreement and debate while trying to minimize interpersonal conflict. Eilerman (2006) claims that the way conflict is handled <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> the outcome is constructive or destructive. According to Roberto (2005) leaders can create constructive conflict by taking concrete steps before, during, and after a critical decision process.|$|E

The FISA Court thereafter will enter an order either approving the procedures or directing the government to submit new procedures within 30 days or cease any acquisitions under the government procedures. The government may appeal a ruling of the FISA Court to the FICA and ultimately the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Knights of the Old Republic takes place almost 4000 {{years before the}} {{formation}} of the Galactic Empire, where Darth Malak, a Dark Lord of the Sith, has unleashed a Sith armada against the Republic. The player character, as a Jedi, must venture to different planets in the galaxy in order to defeat Malak. Players choose from three character classes and customize their characters {{at the beginning of the}} game, and engage in round-based combat against enemies.

25|$|If an {{aircraft}} wreck is over fifty years old, which includes all aviation wreck sites from WWII, and crashed {{on what is}} currently federal lands, the sites are automatically protected under National Park Service Law 36CFR2.1 against disturbance of any kind without a permit. Sites on federal land are further protected under the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 throughout a determination process. The act stipulates that all historic sites must undergo a Section 106 review to determine eligibility for the National Register of Historical Places prior to being disturbed. Federal lands include, among others, National Parks, National Forests, National Marine Sanctuaries, and land owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Aviation sites, for example a vintage hangar on an airport or a wreck site {{on the path of}} a proposed highway, are also immediately subject to Section 106 review {{if they are to be}} disturbed by a project that either requires a federal permit or uses federal funds. In most cases, the State Historic Preservation Officer <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> or not an aviation site is eligible for the register.|$|E
25|$|Omer and {{his cousin}} Majid were {{selected}} for the provisional World Cup squad which is {{to take place in}} 2007 in the West Indies. They were both told to improve their fitness. Omer was offered a place {{to take part in a}} 7-week fitness improvement at the ICC 'boot camp' in the University of Pretoria. Omer was not selected for the tour of Dubai and Kenya, and for the World Cricket League Division One tournament which <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> Scotland will play in the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship being held in South Africa later in the year. Omer was not given the opportunity to show his batting skill and is determined to board the plane in which the English cricket team will also travel on. Omer is currently in Pakistan and is training with the Multan cricket team to improve his batting skill even more and mark his place in future cricket with Scotland. Omer Hussain was called to Kenya to compete in the ICC World Cricket League after fellow cricketer, Glenn Rogers was diagnosed with typhoid. Omer was officially reprimanded by the International Cricket Council after gesturing against his dismissal by the umpire in which he claimed was a wrong decision. Omer scored 121 runs for the Scotland A team in the 2nd XI County Championship against Yorkshire 2nd XI.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Procuring wood {{during the}} winter months for a pulpmill in the Southeast has some difficulties, {{especially}} in hardwood. Soft ground reduces the operational feasibility of many sites, forcing companies to store hardwood in woodyards for retrieval during wet weather. Intensively managed, short rotation hardwood grown on dry sites could economically supply a pulpmill during a wood shortage and thereby eliminate stop-gap measures taken by procurement organizations. This paper will discuss the pro’s and con’s associated with short rotation hardwood plantations, along with its potential. A comprehensive study plan is presented that includes using wood cost from three southeastern pulpmills over a three year period. The study <b>will</b> <b>determined</b> <b>whether</b> short rotation hardwood could be economically substituted for purchased wood...|$|R

The full board <b>will</b> <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> to adopt it on October 28. Among {{the elements of the}} plan were social supports to help students transition from one grade level to the next, as well as the introduction to students of college information and career choices as early as elementary school, to ensure they understand their options after high school. The plan would also align programs and curricula across the district, establish a network to provide students better access to college courses and tutoring, and a push for more students to take advanced placement courses. Additionally, the plan would require high schoolers to pass mandatory, internationally recognized exit exams to graduate from high school.|$|E
