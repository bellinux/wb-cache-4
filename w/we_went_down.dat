2500|$|Steinway and {{his circle}} of touring and transplanted European musicians {{comprised}} Lüchow's core clientele {{during the early}} years. A pre-sailing farewell engagement at Lüchow's {{in honor of the}} pianist Ignaz Paderewski – which lasted six hours – is noted by The New York Times in 1906. James Huneker, writing for the Times in 1919, describes how he was called upon in the 1890s to introduce Antonín Dvořák – who is referred to [...] as [...] "Old Borax" [...] – to New York society by founder of the National Conservatory Jeanette Myers Thurber, who had engaged the composer to lead her nascent musical institution: [...] "Later <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to Gus Lüchow's. For a musician not to be seen at Lüchow's argued that he was unknown in the social world of tone." [...] Huneker aslso relates several anecdotes about Oscar Hammerstein, another Lüchow's habitué.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 February 1892 Penley {{produced}} the farce Charley's Aunt at the Theatre Royal, Bury St. Edmunds, {{appearing in the}} role of Lord Fancourt Babberley (who reluctantly impersonates a rich widow from Brazil). Brandon Thomas wrote the play as a vehicle for Penley; later the two disagreed (and went to court) about how much, if any, of the plot was Penley's invention rather than Thomas's. [...] Penley told a journalist in 1894, [...] "The play was my idea and Brandon Thomas wrote it. [...] Later on, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> into the country and worked at it. [...] Then we worked it out on the stage." [...] The provincial production was a success, and Penley then {{produced the}} play in London at the Royalty in December 1892, after which it transferred to the larger Globe in 1893. Charley's Aunt became an unprecedented hit, running for 1,466 performances in London, a record that lasted for decades. The original run finally ended in December 1896, but the play was revived several times. The Times commented that it was probable that although the [...] "long runs filled his pockets, [...] broke his strength". Penley's last new role was as the eccentric Lord Markham, in the comedy A Little Ray of Sunshine, by Mark Ambient and Wilton Heriot, in which he toured from May 1898 and opened at the Royalty in January 1899.|$|E

2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E
