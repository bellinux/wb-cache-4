5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> situation in which Mr. Whitlam {{woke up one morning}} finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E

25|$|For {{the other}} implication, assume that every set of graphs has a finite subset of minimal graphs and let a minor-closed set F be given. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> set H of graphs such that a graph is in F if {{and only if}} it does not have a minor in H. Let E be the graphs which are not minors of any graph in F, and let H be the finite set of minimal graphs in E. Now, let an {{arbitrary}} graph G be given. Assume first that G is in F. G cannot have a minor in H since G is in F and H is a subset of E. Now assume that G is not in F. Then G is not a minor of any graph in F, since F is minor-closed. Therefore, G is in E, so G has a minor in H.|$|E

500|$|In the release, Steven Grover, BK Vice President of Global Food Safety, Quality Assurance, and Regulatory Compliance, {{confirmed}} the factuality of the QSR report {{and that if}} the dispute between the growers and the CIW continues, the company would go forward with its plans to stop purchasing tomatoes from farms in the Immokalee region. The company stated it would purchase only one percent of its tomatoes from that area and other suppliers could easily make up the difference. Speaking on the dispute, Grover stated, [...] "We’re {{being asked to do}} something that we have legal questions about.

[...] CIW spokesperson Julia Perkins faulted this move, stating, [...] "...farm workers across the country and world face the same problems as those in the Immokalee region, but many do not have a human rights organization, such as the CIW, to stand up for their interests. Running away from the scene of the crime, does that make you any more innocent?

500|$|By April 2010, Joss Whedon {{was close}} to {{completing}} a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn's script, and was officially announced in July 2010. When Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not [...] "have anything" [...] and they should [...] "pretend this draft never happened". Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline [...] "Avengers: Some Assembly Required", riffing on the [...] "Avengers Assemble" [...] slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the movie done for its May 2012 release. On the hiring, Arad stated: [...] "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's {{part of his life}} so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better". Feige added, [...] "I've known Joss for many years.
