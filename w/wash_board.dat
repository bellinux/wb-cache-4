50|$|The washhouse {{is where}} clothes, tablecloths, and bed-covers were cleaned and ironed. It also {{sometimes}} had living quarters for the laundrywoman. Cleaning laundry {{in this period}} was labor-intensive for the domestic slaves that performed it. It required various gadgets to accomplish the task. The wash boiler was a cast iron or copper cauldron in which clothes or other fabrics and soapy water were heated over an open fire. The wash-stick was a wooden stick with a handle at its uppermost part and four to five prongs at its base. It was simultaneously pounded {{up and down and}} rotated in the washing tub to aerate the wash solution and loosen any dirt. The items would then be vigorously rubbed on a corrugated <b>wash</b> <b>board</b> until clean. By the 1850s, they would be passed through a mangle. Prior to that time, wringing out the items was done by hand. The items would then be ready to be hung out to dry or, in inclement weather, placed on a drying rack. Ironing would have been done with a metal flat iron, often heated in the fireplace, and various other devices.|$|E

40|$|In the United States, 53 {{percent of}} all the roads are unpaved. That {{translates}} into 1. 6 million miles of unpaved roadways most of which are gravel roads. Currently they are being exposed to increased amounts of agricultural and industrial traffic. Also the problem of fugitive dust causes the loss of fine, binding material which increases the amount of floating aggregate and the tendency to develop washboards or corrugations. With use, fine and course portions of the aggregate segregate which also diminishes road performance. As the aggregate sources have been depleted and reduced in quality, unpaved roads increasingly have performance and economic challenges. The use of Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP) on gravel roads helps to improve the overall performance and life. Past studies also show substantial dust reduction when RAP is included in the road surface. However no clear relationship or methodology has been established to understand the connection between the RAP percentage and performance. A primary objective of this research project is to assess RAP as a material that can be incorporated into unpaved road surfaces to reduce dust, <b>wash</b> <b>boarding,</b> and their negative effects on performance. Case study on Recycled Asphalt Shingle (RAS) road sections was performed to understand the interaction of asphalt binder and gravel roads, results suggest that an optimal binder content percentage should be targeted for best performance. A subsequent laboratory test program was conducted on various RAP mixes to draw comparisons. This was followed by construction of test sections in Minnesota and testing of the performance of the road on the ground. This investigation attempts to identify factors can be traded off between RAP percentage, road performance, environmental sustainability and economic feasibility in order to achieve the goals of the road agency...|$|R

The daughter of a saxophone playing pastor and evangelist mother, Wells grew up a member of Mt. Olive Church of God in Christ (COGIC) located on 21 st and Naomi in Los Angeles, California. During the interview she talks extensively about COGIC music and spiritual practices including shouting, tarrying, foot washing, old time hymns and congregational songs, scrub <b>boards</b> (<b>wash</b> <b>boards)</b> as musical instruments, and the process and effects of receiving the Holy Spirit. The challenges and opportunities of growing up within the church community also serve as one of her points of emphasis. Mrs. Wells migrated from Los Angeles to Banning, California as a teenager. The interview covers the interpersonal transition that resulted as a part of her relocation, church services and Gospel music in the Inland Empire (Riverside and San Bernardino Counties), and how she became a member of the Kurt Carr Singers.; The influence and contributions of Kurt Carr as a composer, music director and mentor, the exhilaration of touring with Kirk Franklin and the Family in the mid- 1990 ’s, and Mrs. Wells’ debut as a solo artist are also keys subjects in the interview. Influenced greatly by Tramaine Hawkins and her song “Changed”, Mrs. Wells speaks at length about the music and mentorship of Andrae Crouch, the impact of COGIC Bishop E. E. (Elmer Elijah) Cleveland and evangelist/pastor Ernestine Cleveland Reems on her spiritual and musical life, the power of song as tool of conversion and deliverance, holiness/sanctification, and the potential dangers of “watering down” gospel in an effort to reach new audiences.

This research aims to investigate the food safety knowledge and awareness of food handlers working for the National School Nutrition Programme (NSNP), Mpumalanga, South Africa. A cross-sectional, quantitative research method was used and food handlers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. A total of 440 food handlers from 147 randomly selected public schools participated in this survey. The vast majority (98. 9 %) of the respondents were females of 36 years and older with a high school education. Up to 91. 4 % of NSNP food preparation facilities did not have a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) programme in place and about 93. 2 % of food handlers did not know about HACCP.

In 1903 the then Headmaster, Mr Browning, founded a second Rose Hill School in Banstead, Surrey, taking {{the vast majority}} of the original school with him. Following the outbreak of World War II, this second Rose Hill School re-located to the small village of Alderley, near Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire in 1939. The school was based around the 20-acre site of Alderley House, a Grade II Listed neo-Elizabethan 19th century manor house designed by Lewis Vulliamy and built for Robert Blagden Hale between 1859 and 1863. The house was built on the site of a previous Jacobean property, and the cellars from the original building remain to this day under the house. On the ground floor of the house were located the dining room, the library, the Headmaster's study, two classrooms, the school office, a billiards hall, a small laundry, the staff room, the staff dining room and the kitchens, whilst the upper floors (including the former servants' quarters on the top floor) provided the Sick-Bay and all dormitory accommodation and <b>washing</b> facilities for <b>boarding</b> pupils, as well as living quarters for the matrons and some teachers. All of the dormitories were named after local villages, including Alderley, Badminton, Hawkesbury, Hillesley, Kingswood and Stinchcombe.|$|R
