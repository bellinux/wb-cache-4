5|$|By a {{day after}} the storm made landfall, the record power outages were largely restored. However, salt damage {{prevented}} restoration in some areas for several days. The outages left residents temporarily without water after water pumps were shut down. In Hiroshima, lack of power caused traffic congestion, shut down banks, and disrupted hospitals. The widespread power outages related to Mireille prompted the government to reconstruct transmission towers with anemometer, or <b>wind</b> <b>measurement</b> devices. Following the storm, insurance companies paid $6billion to policy holders in Japan, which was a world record related to wind damage; this was surpassed {{less than a year later}} by Hurricane Andrew striking Florida. The typhoon still holds the title as the costliest non-Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{north of}} Rodrigues Island on March30, Hudah {{produced}} moderate winds, though effects to infrastructure and crops {{on the island}} were minimal. During {{the night of the}} following day, Hudah passed near the Saint Brandon archipelago. A weather station on the island maintained by the Maritius Meteorological Services reported a minimum pressure of roughly 996mbar (hPa; 29.42inHg) and a maximum sustained <b>wind</b> <b>measurement</b> of 70km/h (45mph). During the night of April1, the cyclone passed approximately 35km (20mi) south of Tromelin Island, producing strong winds. A Météo-France station on the isle recorded sustained winds of 125km/h (80mph) and a gust of 180km/h (110mph). A minimum pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg) was also recorded. Due to a lack of sustainable infrastructure on the latter two islands, damage was minimal.|$|E
5|$|In early August, an extratropical trough {{moved off}} the coast of South Carolina and Georgia, with a {{stationary}} front extending from it. A weak low-pressure area began to develop {{at the southern end of}} the front just offshore of Jacksonville, Florida. Initially, the storm had an open center of circulation and remained a frontal low as it moved southwestward across Florida, and thus was not considered a fully tropical system at the time. Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico, however, observations indicated that the disturbance developed a closed center of circulation. As a result, the storm was analyzed to have developed into a tropical depression off the western coast of Florida at 1200UTC on August3. At the time, weather reports revealed a definite cyclonic rotation, though the depression had a shallow minimum barometric pressure of 1012.5mbar (hPa; 29.90inHg). Moving west-southwest, the depression steadily intensified and attained tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on August4. Late that evening, the tropical storm executed a slight northward curve. Strengthening continued into the following day, and ships in the storm's vicinity began to report a much stronger storm than was previously suggested. A ship reported the first gale-force winds associated with the storm at 2100UTC on August4. The S.S. Connecticut observed force11 winds, the strongest <b>wind</b> <b>measurement</b> associated with the storm as recorded by vessel. A minimum pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.39inHg) was analyzed for the system at 0600UTC on August5 based on an observation from a nearby ship.|$|E
40|$|Wind energy {{resource}} assessment applications require accurate <b>wind</b> <b>measurements.</b> Most of the published studies used data from existing weather station network operated by meteorological departments. Due to relatively {{high cost of}} weather stations {{the resolution of the}} weather station network is coarse for wind energy applications. Typically, meteorological departments install weather stations at specific locations such as airports, ports and areas with high density population. Typically, these locations are avoided during wind farms siting. According to WMO regulations, weather stations provide measurements for different weather elements at specific altitudes such as 2 Â m for air temperature and 10 Â m for <b>wind</b> <b>measurements.</b> For <b>wind</b> {{energy resource}} assessment applications, minimum of one year of <b>wind</b> <b>measurements</b> is required to build wind climatology for a certain site. Therefore data collected from a certain site cannot be used before one year of operation. Due to these limitations, wind energy resource assessment application needs to use data from different sources. Recently, wind assessment studies were conducted using data generated by Numerical Weather Prediction models. This paper reviews the use of the Numerical Weather Prediction data for wind energy resource assessment. It gives a general overview of NWP models and how they overcome the limitations in the classical <b>wind</b> <b>measurements.</b> <b>Wind</b> energy assessment <b>Wind</b> <b>measurements</b> Numerical Weather Prediction...|$|R

5|$|Rodrigues {{began to}} {{experience}} the effects of Amara on December20, when strong gusts caused by the tropical cyclone swept across the island. These initial winds uprooted trees and toppled utility poles, resulting in power outage. At the height of power outages, over 12,000households were without power, primarily in Port Sud-Est, Mount Lubin, and Rivière-Cocos. By the afternoon of December22, only 20%of homes had access to electricity. Some of the fallen trees rendered roads impassable. Heavy rains caused some creeks to overflow their banks, and riffles became impassable. The rainfall also caused extensive soil erosion. Amara also triggered a strong storm surge, resulting in coastal flooding. Despite the heavy rainfall, total precipitation amounts remained relatively low, peaking at 78mm (3.07in) in Citronelle. On December21, a wind gust of 152km/h (94mph) {{was reported in the}} locality of Pointe Canon, which was the highest <b>wind</b> <b>measurement</b> recorded in associated with Amara. Another station at Sir Gaëtan Duval Airport reported a similarly strong wind gust clocked at 135km/h (84mph). The strong winds tore metal sheets off of buildings and cut telecommunications between Rodrigues {{and the rest of the}} world. Despite the widespread precautionary measures taken beforehand, Port Mathurin suffered marginal impacts. Following the storm, local police groups and the Special Mobile Force were mobilized in order to assist in relief efforts. Technicians from the Mauritius Central Electricity Board were dispatched to resolve power issues.|$|E

25|$|These systems had {{two primary}} {{problems}} {{in terms of}} accuracy. The first {{was that there were}} several steps that had to be carried out in sequence in order to set up the bombsight correctly, and there was limited time to do all of this during the bomb run. As a result, the accuracy of the <b>wind</b> <b>measurement</b> was always limited, and errors in setting the equipment or making the calculations were common. The second problem was that the sight was attached to the aircraft, and thus moved about during maneuvers, during which time the bombsight would not point at the target. As the aircraft had to maneuver {{in order to make the}} proper approach, this limited the time allowed to accurately make corrections. This combination of issues demanded a long bomb run.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simple method, based on routine meteorological data, to produce high-resolution wind analyses throughout the {{planetary boundary layer}} (PBL). It is {{a new way to}} interpolate <b>wind</b> <b>measurements.</b> According to this method, high-frequency information from surface <b>wind</b> <b>measurements</b> is extrapolated to greater heights by assuming that the vertical shear of the horizontal wind, that is, the differential vertical wind profile, is horizontally more homogeneous than the wind profile itself. Under this assumption, it is sufficient to combine high-resolution surface <b>wind</b> <b>measurements</b> with low-resolution vertical profiles of differential winds—for which high-resolution measurements usually do not exist—to yield high-resolution wind analyses throughout the PBL. The method can thus be viewed as a diagnostic downscaling of large-scale wind fields. Downscaling works best during daytime within a homogeneous air mass and in flat terrain. A validation against sodar <b>wind</b> <b>measurements</b> demonstrates that downscaling actually improves large-scale wind fields. A comparison of trajectories calculated from large-scale wind fields, from downscaled wind fields, and from wind fields produced by a conventional diagnostic wind field model, with daytime constant level balloon flights, again shows that the downscaled wind fields are most accurate. 1...|$|R

40|$|Our {{purpose in}} this report is two-fold: 1) {{describe}} the basics of the coherent and incoherent systems, particularly the latter, and 2) compare {{the performance of the}} two technologies in a meaningful way.

An incoherent system can make useful <b>wind</b> <b>measurements</b> even when the aerosol concentration is very low. This insures that global <b>wind</b> <b>measurements</b> can be made. An incoherent system has no problems with speckle, and the measurements can be readily averaged to reduce the total <b>wind</b> uncertainty (<b>measurement</b> error plus atmospheric wind variance).
