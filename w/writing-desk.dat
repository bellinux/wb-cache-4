60|$|Sir Patrick paused, {{and looked}} up quickly from his <b>writing-desk.</b>|$|E
60|$|She darted {{across to}} a <b>writing-desk,</b> {{unlocked}} it, and drew {{out a long}} blue envelope.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Crocker hoisted himself nimbly {{onto the}} <b>writing-desk,</b> and sat there, beaming, with {{dangling}} legs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It IS {{the same}} thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the {{conversation}} dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and <b>writing-desks,</b> which wasn't much.|$|R
60|$|I {{went forward}} to the men's quarters--a plain room {{in the front of}} the ship, with only a rough carpet on the floor, a few simple arm-chairs, <b>writing-desks,</b> {{spittoons}} of a plain pattern, and small brass beds with blue-and-green screens. It was Sunday morning, and the men were mostly sitting about in their dressing-gowns.|$|R
50|$|Maggiolini's {{characteristic}} furniture {{consists of}} commodes and chests, coffers and <b>writing-desks</b> and tables, inlaid {{with a wide}} variety of European woods and exotic woods imported from abroad, used in their natural colors or tinted green, like blue or rose. Cartoons for execution in marquetry were provided by artists such as Levati and Appiani, and panels of pictorial marquetry were produced purely for displays as tours de force.|$|R
60|$|She {{put back}} the page of vellum in her <b>writing-desk,</b> locked it, {{and led the}} way to the door.|$|E
60|$|He hadn't as yet insured his automobile! He {{had meant}} to do so. The papers were on his <b>writing-desk.</b>|$|E
60|$|Scott is {{striking}} the tents and loading the baggages, so I must deliver up my <b>writing-desk.</b> We meet, please God, on Tuesday.|$|E
60|$|When we {{was taken}} to look at rooms I remembered that there was always danger of Jone's {{tendency}} to thankful contentment getting the better of him, and I took the matter in hand myself. Two rooms good enough for anybody was shown us, but I {{was not going to}} take the first thing that was offered, no matter what it was. We settled the matter by getting a first-class room, with sofas and <b>writing-desks</b> and everything convenient, for only a little more than we was charged for the other rooms, and the next morning we went there.|$|R
60|$|In a lofty room, ill-lighted {{and worse}} ventilated, {{situated}} in Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, there sit nearly {{the whole year}} round, one, two, three, or four gentlemen in wigs, {{as the case may}} be, with little <b>writing-desks</b> before them, constructed after the fashion of those used by the judges of the land, barring the French polish. There is a box of barristers on their right hand; there is an enclosure of insolvent debtors on their left; and there is an inclined plane of most especially dirty faces in their front. These gentlemen are the Commissioners of the Insolvent Court, and the place in which they sit, is the Insolvent Court itself.|$|R
6000|$|The {{whole scene}} {{was a strange}} one; but what most excited our {{surprise}} was the incongruous assemblage of the most costly objects from all quarters of the globe. Cheek by jowl, they lay beside the rudest native articles, without the slightest attempt at order. Superb <b>writing-desks</b> of rosewood, inlaid with silver and mother-of-pearl; decanters and goblets of cut glass; embossed volumes of plates; gilded candelabra; sets of globes and mathematical instruments; the finest porcelain; richly-mounted sabres and fowling-pieces; laced hats and sumptuous garments of all sorts, with numerous other matters of European manufacture, were strewn about among greasy calabashes half-filled with [...] "poee," [...] rolls of old tappa and matting, paddles and fish-spears, and the ordinary furniture of a Tahitian dwelling.|$|R
60|$|She locked {{her door}} and opened her <b>writing-desk.</b> Knowing {{what she had to}} do, she tried to collect herself and do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's his boy," [...] said Mr. Direck at last, confidentially to the <b>writing-desk.</b> [...] "How can one {{argue with}} him? It's just hell for him...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The signorina's <b>writing-desk</b> is gone," [...] replied Kenyon; [...] "it always {{stood on}} this table, and I myself saw it there {{only a few}} days ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{carriage}} was unpacked of such of {{its contents}} as were indispensable for the night. There was the usual parade of trunks and <b>writing-desks,</b> and portfolios, and dressing-boxes, and those other oppressive conveniences which burden a comfortable man. The observant loiterers about the inn door, wrapped up in great dirt-colored cloaks, with only a hawk's eye uncovered, made many remarks {{to each other on}} this quantity of luggage that seemed enough for an army. And the domestics of the inn talked with wonder of the splendid dressing-case, with its gold and silver furniture that was spread out on the toilette table, and the bag of gold that chinked as it was taken out of the trunk. The strange [...] "Milor's" [...] wealth, and the treasures he carried about him, were the talk, that evening, over all Terracina.|$|R
6000|$|Dick {{was a huge}} {{man with}} a large expanse of good-natured visage, and a {{tendency}} to make all his statements with the solemnity of an oracle. Big and little men, like large and small dogs, have usually a sympathetic liking for each other. Dick Moy's chief friend on board was little Jack Shales, who was {{the life of the}} ship, and was particularly expert, as were also most of his mates, in making, during hours of leisure, beautiful workboxes and <b>writing-desks</b> with inlaid woods of varied colours, which were sold at a moderate price on shore, in order to eke out the monthly wage and add to the comforts of wives and little ones at Ramsgate. It may be added that Jack Shales was unquestionably the noisiest man on board. He had a good voice; could sing, and did sing, from morning till night, and had the power of uttering a yell that would have put to shame the wildest warrior among the Cherokee savages! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He was {{not exactly}} remarkable," [...] Marlow {{answered}} with his usual nonchalance. [...] "In a general way it's very difficult for one to become remarkable. People won't take sufficient notice of one, don't you know. I remember Powell so well simply because {{as one of the}} Shipping Masters in the Port of London he dispatched me to sea on several long stages of my sailor's pilgrimage. He resembled Socrates. I mean he resembled him genuinely: that is in the face. A philosophical mind is but an accident. He reproduced exactly, the familiar bust of, the immortal sage, if you will imagine the bust with a high top hat riding far {{on the back of the}} head, and a black coat over the shoulders. As I never saw him except from the other side of the long official counter bearing the five <b>writing-desks</b> of the five Shipping Masters, Mr Powell has remained a bust to me." ...|$|R
60|$|Ogden {{lowered himself}} {{into the depths of}} his {{favourite}} easy chair, and, putting his feet restfully on the <b>writing-desk,</b> met Jimmy's gaze with a glassy but knowing eye.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she went}} to her <b>writing-desk,</b> took out a little ivory {{miniature}} of their mother, came and sat down by him, and laid her hand on his head.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is my place, I suppose," [...] said Marco; and so {{saying he}} sat down in a great arm-chair, before the {{portable}} <b>writing-desk,</b> which was open on the table.|$|E
60|$|I had {{not gone}} very far when I came across three more balls hanging over a shop. In I went, and saw a long counter, {{with a sort of}} picket-fence, running all along from end to end, and three little holes, with three little old men {{standing}} inside of them, like prisoners looking out of a jail. Back of the counter were all sorts of things, piled up and labeled. Hats, and caps, and coats, and guns, and swords, and canes, and chests, and planes, and books, and <b>writing-desks,</b> and every thing else. And in a glass case were lots of watches, and seals, chains, and rings, and breastpins, and all kinds of trinkets. At one of the little holes, earnestly talking with one of the hook-nosed men, was a thin woman in a faded silk gown and shawl, holding a pale little girl by the hand. As I drew near, she spoke lower in a whisper; and the man shook his head, and looked cross and rude; and then some more words were exchanged over a miniature, and some money was passed through the hole, and the woman and child shrank out of the door.|$|R
5000|$|The {{style was}} a {{modification}} of the Italian Renaissance; and the material of the walls was a gray Indiana limestone. The portico was decorated with stone carvings. The main staircase and corridors were carved in Siena marble and bronze. A London magazine characterized it as the handsomest staircase {{of its kind in}} America. The hotel office, in Italian Renaissance, and encased in Siena marble, contained a large safe, in which are a number of steel safe-deposit boxes {{for the use of the}} guests. On the main floor was the restaurant, with a seating capacity of 300 persons. On the same floor was the cafe, with its furnishings in the manner of Holland House in London with screens of glass, marble and bronze in tones of gray and pale yellow. The buffet, in a soft yellow and golden brown, had high wainscots of panelled wood. The foyer, on the parlor floor, was lit by four immense torchères, bearing electric lights. The ladies' reading-room, with pale satin and plush hangings, contained files of newspapers and <b>writing-desks.</b> The drawing room was in the style of Louis XVI., with its walls covered with salmon-tinted satin damask, embroidered portieres, furniture in the Adams and Chippendale styles, and fawn-colored Axminster carpet. The Gilt Room was a reproduction of the Gilt Room in London's Holland House, in Elizabethan architecture, with carved wainscotting, heraldic devices, gold-crown ornaments, antique furniture in natural cherry and gold, fire-places, English parquet floors, Flemish chandeliers, and plush curtains embroidered with fleur-de-lys.|$|R
60|$|The besiegers being now in {{complete}} {{possession of the}} house, spread themselves over it from garret to cellar, and plied their demon labours fiercely. While some small parties kindled bonfires underneath the windows, others broke up the furniture and cast the fragments down to feed the flames below; where the apertures in the wall (windows no longer) were large enough, they threw out tables, chests of drawers, beds, mirrors, pictures, and flung them whole into the fire; while every fresh addition to the blazing masses was received with shouts, and howls, and yells, which added new and dismal terrors to the conflagration. Those who had axes and had spent their fury on the movables, chopped and tore down the doors and window frames, broke up the flooring, hewed away the rafters, and buried men who lingered in the upper rooms, in heaps of ruins. Some searched the drawers, the chests, the boxes, <b>writing-desks,</b> and closets, for jewels, plate, and money; while others, less mindful of gain and more mad for destruction, cast their whole contents into the courtyard without examination, and called to those below, to heap them on the blaze. Men who had been into the cellars, and had staved the casks, rushed to and fro stark mad, setting fire to all they saw--often to the dresses of their own friends--and kindling the building in so many parts that some {{had no time for}} escape, and were seen, with drooping hands and blackened faces, hanging senseless on the window-sills to which they had crawled, until they were sucked and drawn into the burning gulf. The more the fire crackled and raged, the wilder and more cruel the men grew; as though moving in that element they became fiends, and changed their earthly nature for the qualities that give delight in hell.|$|R
60|$|On his <b>writing-desk</b> {{appeared}} a few sheets of manuscript that increased only very slowly. He {{was trying to}} express his Cambridge view of aristocracy in terms of Finacue Street, West.|$|E
60|$|Trevor thanked him, {{and took}} the keys. He opened every drawer and {{examined}} the <b>writing-desk.</b> The bat was in none of these places. He looked in the cupboards. No bat there.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{was written}} to-day, my <b>writing-desk</b> having been forgot at Parkgate, but Tom Crighton kindly fetched it up to-day, so {{something}} {{more or less}} may be done to-morrow morning--and now to dress.|$|E
60|$|Again: pay a {{visit with}} a similar object, to a part of London, as unlike both of these {{as they are to}} each other. Cross over to the Surrey side, and look at such shops of this {{description}} as are to be found near the King’s Bench prison, and in ‘the Rules.’ How different, and how strikingly illustrative of the decay of some of the unfortunate residents {{in this part of the}} metropolis! Imprisonment and neglect have done their work. There is contamination in the profligate denizens of a debtor’s prison; old friends have fallen off; the recollection of former prosperity has passed away; and with it all thoughts for the past, all care for the future. First, watches and rings, then cloaks, coats, and all the more expensive articles of dress, have found their way to the pawnbroker’s. That miserable resource has failed at last, and the sale of some trifling article at one of these shops, has been the only mode left of raising a shilling or two, to meet the urgent demands of the moment. Dressing-cases and <b>writing-desks,</b> too old to pawn but too good to keep; guns, fishing-rods, musical instruments, all in the same condition; have first been sold, and the sacrifice has been but slightly felt. But hunger must be allayed, and what has already become a habit, is easily resorted to, when an emergency arises. Light articles of clothing, first of the ruined man, then of his wife, at last of their children, even of the youngest, have been parted with, piecemeal. There they are, thrown carelessly together until a purchaser presents himself, old, and patched and repaired, it is true; but the make and materials tell of better days; and the older they are, the greater the misery and destitution of those whom they once adorned.|$|R
60|$|Every {{appliance}} {{that could}} make study pleasant and give ease to the overtoiled brain was there; chairs made to relieve each limb and muscle; reading-desks and <b>writing-desks</b> to suit every attitude; lamps and candles mechanically contrived to throw their light on any favoured spot, as the student might desire; a shoal of newspapers to amuse the few leisure moments which might be stolen from the labours of the day; and then from the window a view right through a bosky vista along which ran a broad green path from the rectory to the church,--at {{the end of which}} the tawny-tinted fine old tower was seen with all its variegated pinnacles and parapets. Few parish churches in England are in better repair, or better worth keeping so, than that at Plumstead Episcopi; and yet it is built in a faulty style: the body of the church is low,--so low, that the nearly flat leaden roof would be visible from the churchyard, {{were it not for the}} carved parapet with which it is surrounded. It is cruciform, though the transepts are irregular, one being larger than the other; and the tower is much too high in proportion to the church. But the colour of the building is perfect; it is that rich yellow gray which one finds nowhere but in the south and west of England, and which is so strong a characteristic of most of our old houses of Tudor architecture. The stone work also is beautiful; the mullions of the windows and the thick tracery of the Gothic workmanship is as rich as fancy can desire; and though in gazing on such a structure one knows by rule that the old priests who built it, built it wrong, one cannot bring oneself to wish that they should have made it other than it is.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{said the}} latter, as if {{answering}} {{a question from}} him. 'Not in the drawer of the <b>writing-desk</b> that opens with a spring; it is not there, and it never will be there again.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{happened}} to want some fishing-tackle {{for the use}} of a guest, when it occurred to me to search the old <b>writing-desk</b> already mentioned, in which I used to keep articles of that nature.|$|E
60|$|Her next {{proceeding}} was to {{open her}} <b>writing-desk,</b> and look into the old account-book once more. While it lay open on her lap, she recalled what had passed that morning, between Mrs. Ellmother and herself.|$|E
60|$|Afterwards {{he asked}} me to come to him into his study; it was a room with a <b>writing-desk</b> and full of pieces of {{earthenware}} and suchlike litter, and we had our great row about Cambridge.|$|E
60|$|Toward sundown that evening, Pierre {{stood in}} one of the three bespoken {{chambers}} in the Black Swan Inn; the blue chintz-covered chest and the <b>writing-desk</b> before him. His hands were eagerly searching through his pockets.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then the <b>writing-desk.</b> That's {{what a man}} has {{to endure}} when he will make himself head {{schoolmaster}} to a young lady. And so you're going to look after your charge with your limbs still in bandages?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Stone {{came from}} his <b>writing-desk,</b> and stood so that light might fall {{on a sheet of}} paper in his hand. Cecilia noted the scent that went about with him of peat and baked potatoes. He spoke: ...|$|E
