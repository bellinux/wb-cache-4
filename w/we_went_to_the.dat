25|$|Edwin Beete, {{one of the}} British Guiana side, {{was later}} quoted as follows: On the Friday morning <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Garrison and practised on the pitch there. Consequently the islanders had to prepare a pitch on the Savannah. And such a pitch! The outfield was very high with grass, you could not run after a ball. The pitch itself was so studded with small pieces of corral that the ball had to be changed twice in an innings which lasted about two hours and mangled balls were brought back as a memento. We practised on Saturday and the match was fixed for the Monday and Tuesday {{following}} but was postponed until the Wedmesday and Thursday.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said:The clan in China {{is responsible for}} the individuals and in collecting from the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have been surprised to hear that this was criticised.|$|E

500|$|After {{the long}} trip, the Wolverines beat the Trojans 490. Dworsky {{recalled}} that {{the coaching staff}} {{did an excellent job}} of scouting the Trojans. [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rose Bowl, we had USC down pat. We knew their system as well as they did." [...] The Trojans gained only 91yards rushing and 42yards passing, moving past midfield only twice. Dworsky played center during the Rose Bowl, blocking USC's All-American tackle (and future Los Angeles city councilman), John Ferraro.|$|E
500|$|On {{the wedding}} tent for Bill and Fleur's wedding in Part 1, Craig commented {{on his aim}} to [...] "rather than make it an {{extension}} of the house, which is rather eccentric, homemade, we decided to make it rather elegant [...] [...] [...] It's lined with silk and beautiful, floating candelabra. So it's a nice contrast with the house." [...] For the Ministry of Magic set, he noted, [...] "This is an underground world; this is a ministry, so <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real ministries, the Muggle ministries – Whitehall, in London – and decided that our magical ministry was kind of a parallel universe to these real ministries." ...|$|E
500|$|Corman felt Poe's two strongest stories after Usher were Masque of the Red Death, and Pit and the Pendulum. He {{considered}} {{making the}} former but {{was worried about}} similarities between the story and The Seventh Seal (1957), so he decided on adapting the latter. However Samuel Z. Arkoff said it was his and James H. Nicholson's decision to make Pit as the second Poe film [...] "because {{it was a lot}} more graphic and in the second place, Masque of the Red Death would have needed a dancing troupe that would have been quite expensive. In all those early Poe pictures we had relatively few actors, so when we did finally make Masque of the Red Death <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK where it would be less expensive to do it." ...|$|E

500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E
500|$|... "Now You Know" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Marc Cherry and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. The episode featured the debut of Dana Delany as Katherine Mayfair, a former Wisteria Lane resident who moves back to the neighborhood. Cherry describes the character as [...] "a woman who was clearly different in the past... an alpha female who goes up against all-out women, especially Bree." [...] Cherry developed Katherine {{with the intention of}} making her [...] "a character everyone loves to hate," [...] citing J. R. Ewing (Larry Hagman) from Dallas and Amanda Woodward (Heather Locklear) from Melrose Place as inspirations. Cherry ensured that character would have [...] "a comedic point of view," [...] unlike the Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) character from the series' second season, stating: [...] "In the second season <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mystery that was just kind of dark and stopped the action. [...] we're using humor, drama, pathos, everything [...] have to offer." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} {{generally}} remains true {{to the original}} novels, several scenes and characters were removed or merged with others to bring the script to a reasonable length. [...] Noting that [...] "there wasn't time for everything", the producers cut completely {{the scene in the}} Temple of Bel-Shamharoth and the associated plotline about the significance of the number eight; Director Vadim Jean defended the decision, saying [...] "we could have gone there, but <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wyrmberg instead. There [...] time constraints and we could have gone one way or the other, so we went the whole hog on just one." [...] The scenes in the Wyrmberg were themselves shortened and simplified, reducing the character of Li!ort to a cameo and losing the characters of K!sdra, Greicha and Hrun completely. [...] The inter-wizard rivalry at Unseen University, by contrast, was expanded and spread out throughout the film, while in the novels the sequences are short and mainly found in The Light Fantastic. [...] This established Trymon as a more easily recognisable antagonist. To avoid the necessity of explaining the deus ex machina in detail, the Octavo in the film simply causes A'Tuin to roll to recapture Rincewind, whereas in the novel, a complicated 'change spell' returns him to the disc. [...] The creatures from the Dungeon Dimensions which invade reality at the end of The Light Fantastic, and Rincewind's fight in the Dungeon Dimensions themselves, are completely omitted, and Trymon is simply driven mad by reading the Octavo spells {{at the end of the}} film version. Galder Weatherwax is also killed by Trymon in the film version, whereas, in the books, he is killed by accidentally summoning the Luggage instead of Rincewind.|$|E

We wanted to get fresh ideas, we felt we were getting a bit stale living in England." [...] For the album, songwriters Holder and Lea drew much inspiration from living in New York City.|$|E

2500|$|Capote based the {{character}} of Idabel in Other Voices, Other Rooms on his Monroeville neighbor and best friend, Harper Lee. Capote once acknowledged this: [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Lee, Harper Lee's mother and father, lived very near. She was my best friend. Did you ever read her book, To Kill a Mockingbird? I'm a character in that book, which {{takes place in the}} same small town in Alabama where we lived. Her father was a lawyer, and she and I used to go to trials all the time as children. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trials instead of going to the movies." [...] After the Pulitzer Prize was awarded to Lee in 1961 and Capote published In Cold Blood in 1966, the authors became increasingly distant from each other.|$|E

[...] We chased the others back a long way and then caught up with our own men again and went on. [...] It was a very cold winter. [...] There were twenty of us and each had four horses.

2500|$|Because {{her father}} was a [...] "Roman Catholic in the Irish tradition" [...] it has been {{incorrectly}} assumed that Whittlesey grew up as a Catholic, when in fact her mother's family did not approve of her father's Catholicism. [...] "o he left the Catholic Church," [...] Whittlesey explained in her Memoirs. [...] "He attended the Methodist Church with my mother and brother, Tom, and me. I was thus raised as a Methodist. As a family <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Williamsville, New York, Methodist Church every Sunday. I went to regular Sunday school and sang in the choirs." [...] Her husband's family was Presbyterian. Whittlesey converted to Roman Catholicism in 2000 in Staten Island, New York, having been greatly influenced {{as a result of her}} Reagan administration association with John Cardinal O'Connor of New York. She was baptized and confirmed by Father Michael Reilly, principal of St. Joseph's By-the-Sea High School in Staten Island, New York.|$|E
2500|$|A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in the museum – it was {{discovered}} in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: [...] "That's all we do! My husband and I have never been on a cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had nutcrackers waiting for us to pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{was profoundly}} deaf and communicated on-field with his {{teammates}} in sign language. [...] He {{is credited with}} helping to expand and make universal the use of sign language throughout the modern baseball infield, including {{but not limited to}} the use of pitching signs. [...] According to Sean Lahman in his biography of Taylor, [...] "The Giants didn't just add Taylor to their roster; they embraced him {{as a member of the}} family. [...] Player-manager George Davis learned sign language and encouraged his players to do the same. [...] John McGraw did likewise when he took over as Giants manager in July 1902." [...] In Lawrence Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, Taylor's teammate, Fred Snodgrass, recalled:We could all read and speak the deaf-and-dumb sign language, because Dummy Taylor took it as an affront if you didn't learn to converse with him. [...] He wanted to be one of us, to be a full-fledged member of the team. [...] If <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vaudeville show, he wanted to know what the joke was, and somebody had to tell him. [...] So we all learned. [...] We practiced all the time.|$|E
