Although he trained with the team, he was omitted from playing as the coach, Jo Rauto, thought he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> and would get hurt. He was eventually selected {{to play for the}} senior provincial side when he was 17. Several months later he was asked to join the Nabua Rugby Club – under the guidance of coach Ratu Kitione Tuibua – by his uncle Vesito Rauluni. Serevi's Nabua team were highly successful in Fiji's sevens tournaments.|$|E

5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> and the ground station's geographical position was out of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E

The synagogue followed the Orthodox nusach Ashkenaz, but some members wanted to adopt Isaac Mayer Wise's reformist Minhag America Prayer-Book.|$|E

The coroner's report of a junior college student who killed himself because he believed his penis <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> {{was reported}} in the international media. The pressure exerted by parents on their children to produce good academic results has also been a contributing factor in some suicides.|$|E

5|$|On November 4, 1824, {{just months}} after the election, the state capitol {{building}} was destroyed by a fire. Some furnishings and records were saved, but the four-year-old building was a total loss. When Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette toured the United States in 1825, a new capitol {{had not yet been}} constructed and the governor's mansion <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> to host a proper reception, so the governor had to entertain the dignitary at Weisiger's Tavern.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the sheriff of St. George, {{accompanied}} by a posse of 30 men, arrested 25 members of the Miners Union, including Matthew O'Loughlin. As Silver Reef's jail <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> to hold all 25 prisoners, {{most of them were}} jailed in the Rice Building. The Rice Building could not hold all of the prisoners, so a line was drawn around the building, and anyone who crossed the line was threatened with shooting. The Miners Union members were transferred to Beaver, where they were tried for riot, conspiracy, and false imprisonment. Thirteen of the members were sentenced to imprisonment; three were bailed out, while ten were sent to the Utah Territorial Penitentiary. Matthew O'Loughlin was sentenced to twenty days in prison and was charged a $75 fine.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> to house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only {{to be used by}} the inhabitants of the city {{in the case of an}} Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E

5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small.</b> A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} Ivy League pitcher focus, Krichell also {{unearthed}} several position players. He signed Charlie Keller, a highly touted prospect {{playing for the}} University of Maryland. To encourage Keller to sign, Krichell met and had dinner with his family. In 1937, Krichell signed shortstop Phil Rizzuto, who had tried out with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, but was dismissed by them {{on the grounds that}} he <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small.</b> Even so, Krichell decided to look at the infielder and was impressed by the way Rizzuto accomplished double plays; his technique reminded Krichell of Leo Durocher, one of his favorite players. He signed Rizzuto for $75 a month and sent him to the Yankees' farm club in Bassett, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|At one time, three churches {{stood on}} Hirta. Christ Church, in {{the site of}} the {{graveyard}} at the centre of the village, was in use in 1697 and was the largest, but this thatched-roof structure <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> to hold the entire population, and most of the congregation had to gather in the churchyard during services. St Brendan's Church lay over a kilometre away on the slopes of Ruival, and St Columba's at the west end of the village street, but little is left of these buildings. A new kirk and manse were erected at the east end of the village in 1830 and a Factor's house in 1860.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1950s the Australian Government and Royal Australian Navy (RAN) {{considered}} options {{to replace the}} aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne, and her air group. While Melbourne had only been commissioned in 1955, the de Havilland Sea Venom fighters and Fairey Gannet maritime patrol aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) were becoming obsolete. It was believed that Melbourne <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> to operate more modern aircraft types, and the RAN investigated options to buy a larger carrier. The Government judged {{that the cost of}} a new aircraft carrier was too high, especially given the expense of the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) procurement programs at that time, and in November 1959 it was announced that the FAA would cease to operate fixed-wing aircraft in 1963.|$|E
5|$|General Krueger was gravely {{concerned}} about {{the seriousness of the}} situation on Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for the movement {{of the rest of the}} 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use them, and to permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E
5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>small.</b> I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
