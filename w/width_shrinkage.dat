Direct polymer patterning is an emerging NIL technique with structure dimensions being much different from those in high resolution nanoimprint lithography resulting in new challenges and resist behavior being also much different from established NIL techniques. Special focus was put on very high structure aspect ratios, their filling behavior and structural shrinkage. Filling of large structures proceeded via squeezed flow rather than capillary filling.

40|$|Purpose– The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a new method to predict the {{potential}} shrinkage of plain‐knitted fabric. Design/methodology/approach– The presented method is based on deformable curve. The delivered plain‐knitted fabric is represented as a deformable parametric curve, and the relaxed fabric can be reached by minimizing the energy of the curve. Compared to the delivered‐knitted fabric, the length and <b>width</b> <b>shrinkage</b> percentages can be calculated accordingly. Findings– The new method is more convenient than the traditional trial and error method, and need less‐input parameters than the STARFISH technique. Experimental results show that this method is feasible. Originality/value– This paper presents a new method for shrinkage prediction of plain‐knitted fabric based on deformable curve and energy minimum. The work can be linked with shrinkage control in textile industry. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
40|$|Commercially {{available}} extractors and dryers {{are equipped}} with spreading and overfeeding devices to regain width and return the stretched loops to a more normal state. Spreading must be accompanied with overfeed {{in order to be}} effective ’ Relaxation drying allows those excessive tensions to be released since the fabric is dried under little or no restraints. Most relaxation dryers are based on the belt principle, where the fabric is placed between two belts and then passed through the drying zone. The bottom belt supports the fabric but allows for shrinkage, while the top belt prevents any stretching. In some cases, the bottom belt can be vibrated for additional mechanical action. Air flow is normally directed down and up through the fabric to give a ripple/wave effect. Once the drying is completed under relaxed condtions, those excessive tensions which have occurred during prior processing, have been released. If the fabric has been spread with overfeed prior to relax drying, <b>width</b> <b>shrinkage</b> occurs first. This may prevent the length from shrinking initially, but as the drying progresses, both width and length shrinkage occurs. At the exit of the relaxation dryer, the fabric width will be inconsistent and may not be completely wrinkle-free. Thus, calendering or compacting is necessary to provide a uniform, finished roll for cut and sew 3. Fabrication If there is any one statement which should provide a quideline for optimum shrinkage control, it is that prouer construction is essential. Without a doubt, too often many fabrics are not constructed properly to meet end-use specifications. In most cases, a particular fabric is made using a certain gauge machine with a specific yarn which should have 5 x 5 shrinkage at a certain weight and width. Once finished, the customer may find that at 5 x 5 shrinkage, the...|$|E

40|$|Cracks in the {{concrete}} slab of continuous composite bridges are common due to the tensile stresses at the supports. These bridges are allowed to crack {{as long as the}} cracking is controlled and not exceeding the design crack width (according to Bro 94 the crack should be injected if they are bigger than 0. 2 mm). The Ångermanälven Bridge (railway bridge part of the Bothnia line project) was designed with big edge beams of width 1. 2 m, 40 % of the total area of {{the concrete}} deck cross-section. During the final inspection cracks larger than the design crack width (0. 3 mm according to Bro 94) were observed over the supports. In this thesis the design and the construction procedure of the bridge is studied to clarify the causes of the cracking in the edge beam. The objectives of this thesis were addressed through a literature study of the different types of cracks and the Swedish bridge codes. The expected crack width was calculate according to the same code, using a 2 -D FEM model for the moment calculation, and compared with the crack width measured at the bridge. The result of the calculations shows that tensile stress due to ballast and only restraining moment due to shrinkage is not big enough to cause the measured crack <b>width.</b> <b>Shrinkage</b> force and temperature variation effects {{may have contributed to the}} concrete cracking in the edge beams.

40|$|For {{finished}} cotton {{knitted fabrics}} required areal density, <b>width</b> and lower <b>shrinkage</b> values are vital quality requirements {{in order to}} produce garments with satisfactory dimensional performance. So achieving required finished areal density (generally expressed as GSM i. e.

As there is no direct relation with grey knitting parameters to the finished fabric specification,knitters and finishers generally go for a number of sample trials to meet the target. But this practice is too much time consuming and expensive.

30|$|Based on this {{experimental}} study, it can {{be concluded}} that warp density and weft density of denim fabric were changed due to change in position of whip roller both in horizontal and vertical way. That’s why areal density was also affected by backrest roller position. Warp way crimp% gradually decreased with increasing height at fixed depth of whip roller both in grey and finished state while it showed vice versa result with increasing depth at fixed height in both state of fabric. The sample made at height position of + 12 and depth 5 showed maximum warp crimp% value of 13.33 and 16.36 in grey and finished state respectively. Weft way crimp% also showed a significant result in finished state. The maximum finished weft crimp% value found at the position of + 16 height and depth 4 was 7.8. The position of whip roller affects grey fabric’s weft way crimp% slightly. Warp way tensile strength tremendously increased with ascending of whip roller position. But after a certain position again it gradually decreased in both state. Warp strength had a similar relation with decreasing depth position of whip roller in fixed height. The maximum warp strength value for grey and finished fabric were 761.77 N and 688.06 N respectively found at height position of + 14 and depth position of 4. No significant effect was found on weft strength, <b>width</b> wise <b>shrinkage</b> and skewness of denim fabric both in grey and finished state due to change in settings of whip roller. Air permeability of denim fabric simultaneously decreased with increasing height of whip roller but after a certain position it started to increase. This trend was found for both (grey and finished) fabric at fixed depth position of whip roller. But air permeability changed in inversely proportional way with variable depth at constant height position of whip roller. The highest value of air permeability (in cm 3 /s/cm 2) for grey and finished denim was found 160.42 and 156.94 respectively at the position of height + 8 and depth 4. <b>Width</b> wise fabric <b>shrinkage</b> gradually increased with increasing height position of whip roller at fixed depth and similarly decreased with decreasing depth of whip roller at fixed height setting but only in case of grey state. The maximum value of shrinkage% was 12.6 at height + 12 and depth 3. In finishing state of fabric, shrinkage% had so negligible value due to different finishing treatment. Generally whip roller setting is kept unchanged in different woven fabric production. But it directly affects EPcm and PPcm which change the cover factor of fabric. Moreover, the research result shows that it also deviates different physical properties of fabric. So if this position is optimized, fabric properties can be enriched as well as faults can be minimized.|$|R

40|$|This project {{examined}} the effects of burning on saw mark characteristics of isolated semi-fleshed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) long bones as a substitute for human remains. Different classes of saws were examined to determine which type of saw mark characteristics are obliterated when burned and which are not. The saw mark characteristics that were examined are superficial false start scratches, false start kerfs, and completely sectioned cuts with breakaway spurs/notches. The long bones were burned at the Boston University School of Medicine using a muffle furnace, at differing temperatures and at differing time increments. The author hypothesized that the higher the temperature and the longer the duration of bone burning, the greater will be the obliterative effect on saw mark characteristics. All samples were examined using a Motic® Digital Light Microscope 12 VDC with a Nikon® MKII Fiber Optic Light attached with accompanying Motic® imaging and measuring software. Distances were measured between striations on complete cuts, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths using the Motic® imaging and measuring software. Images were also taken of the cross sections of the kerf floors. The striations on the kerf walls, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths were compared to the control samples. Measurements taken from false start scratches, false start kerfs, and complete cuts were averaged and compared to the averages from each temperature and the control samples, to assess the degree of shrinkage from thermal alteration. The false start kerf profile shapes were blindly examined and classified into Class A, B, C, or D(following the system of Symes 1992) and compared to the control samples. Kerf flare and blade drift were examined to determine if thermal alteration obliterated those saw mark characteristics. The chainsaw false start kerfs and complete cuts were examined macroscopically to determine what effects thermal alteration had on those types of marks. All thermally altered samples were assessed for color change, heat-related fracturing, and whether or not the saw marks were still visible. The author found that all saw marks made with the mitre saw, crosscut saw, and bow saw were still visible and identifiable, even in a fractured state and, when burned up to 700 °C for one hour. Most of the false start kerf samples were classified into the correct kerf profile shape as outlines in Symes (1992). False start kerfs and complete cuts made with the chainsaw were blindly examined and showed that these marks are distinct and easily identifiable when the bone is completely intact or has very minimal fracturing. The crosscut saw false start scratch and crosscut saw complete cut samples showed signs of <b>shrinkage.</b> The average <b>width</b> of the false start scratch samples burned at 700 °C for one hour was about 50 % smaller than the control sample's average width. The same was true for the complete cut striation <b>widths.</b> <b>Shrinkage</b> did not appear to alter the crosscut saw false start kerf widths or the bow saw false start scratch widths. For all cuts made with the mitre saw shrinkage did appear to alter the samples. Warping did occur where some of the burned averages were larger than the control sample averages. This suggests that some warping did take place by widening the kerf, thus changing the analysis of the saw mark characteristics. Blade drift and kerf flare were seen in the samples and thus were not affected by thermal alteration. The author's hypothesis was not rejected, because in some cases thermal alteration did modify the saw mark characteristic measurements and in some cases thermal alteration did not alter the measurements. Some of the saw marks were affected by shrinkage, while others were not. False start kerf profile shape classification was not affected by thermal alteration. The chainsaw samples were affected most by the thermal alteration, because of the obliterative effects of heat-related fracturing which progressed generally with the greater temperature...|$|R

The thesis research embodies theoretical development by building on previous ECC micromechanical models, and experimental investigations into three specific new versions of ECC with added functions aimed at addressing societal demands of our built infrastructure. Specifically, the theoretical study includes three important ECC modeling elements: Steady-state crack propagation analyses and simulation, predictive accuracy of the fiber bridging constitutive model, {{and development of the}} rate-dependent strain-hardening criteria. The first element establishes the steady-state cracking criterion as a fundamental requirement for multiple cracking behavior in brittle matrix composites. The second element improves the accuracy of crack-width prediction in ECC. The third element establishes the micromechanics basis for impact-resistant ECC design. Three new ECCs with added functions were developed and experimentally verified in this thesis research through the enhanced theoretical framework.

Giysilerin kullanım alanlarının ve kullanım Ģekillerinin çeĢitliliği de bunu gerekli kılmaktadır. Bir rekabet unsuru haline gelen konfor özelliklerini sağlayabilecek yeni lif türlerinin arayıĢına gidildiği görülmektedir. Konfor; memnuniyet ve rahatlık hissi veya fiziksel ya da ruhsal olarak iyi durumu ifade eden bir terimdir. Konfor fiziksel, psikolojik ve fizyolojik olmak üzere üç baslık altında ele alınmaktadır. Farklı liflerin giysi konforuna ne kadar katkıda bulunduğunu, bu katkıyı sağlarken giysinin fiziksel performansında ne gibi değiĢiklikler oluĢturduğunu tespit etmek amacıyla yapılan bu çalıĢmada lif olarak modal, bambu, soya, tencel, pamuk ve viskon gibi doğal lifler ve Coolmax, Thermolite, Thermocool gibi sentetik esaslı lifler ve kullanılmıĢtır. Seçilen bu lifler, sürekli tene temas halinde bir giysi olan, günlük kullanıma yönelik {{standart}} çorap formunda hazırlanmıĢtır. Bu liflerden elde edilen ipliklerle örülen çoraplar orta ve gevĢek olmaz üzere iki farklı sıklıkta örülmüĢ, böylece örgü ayarının da çorapların performans ve konfor özelliklerine katkısı gözlenmiĢtir. Bu Ģekilde hazırlanan numunelere, çorapların konfor özelliklerini belirlemek için, su buharı geçirgenliği, sıvı transferi, kuruma ve hava geçirgenliği testleri; fiziksel performansını tespit amaçlı olarak patlama mukavemeti, aĢınma, boncuklanma ve boyutsal değiĢim testleri yapılmıĢtır. Yapılan deneyler neticesinde elyaf tipinin giysi konfor özelliklerine direkt ve dolaylı etkisinin olduğu görülmüĢtür. Çorapların ıslanma davranıĢlarındaki farklılıkların direkt olarak lif tipinden kaynaklandığı tespit edilmiĢtir. Bununla birlikte çalıĢmalar sonucunda çoğu selülozik esaslı olan liflerin giysi konforu üzerine olan etkilerinin farklı seviyede olduğu görülmüĢtür. Thermolite, thermocool ve Coolmax lifleri yüksek fiziksel performans ve hızlı kuruma özelliği sergilediği gözlenmiĢtir. Pamuk ise diğer liflere göre konfor performansının çok asağılarda olmadığı görülmüĢ, hatta fiziksel performansı en yüksek olan elyaf olarak karsımıza çıkmıĢtır. Yapılan çalıĢmada eldeedilen en dikkat çekici sonuç, pamuk ile karıĢım halinde kullanılan liflerdenelde edilmiĢ çoraplar, aynı liflerin % 100 oranında kullanıldığı çoraplardan hemkonfor açısından hem de fiziksel performans açısından daha iyi sonuç verdiği görülmüĢtür. Yeni liflerden optimum verim alabilmek için pamuk ile karıĢım halindekullanılması daha uygun olacağı görülmüĢtür. SUMMARY The {{expectation is}} what specialities of using {{of clothing and}} additionally the superiorphysical performance and comfort features born in the result of increaserising livingstandards {{and the level of}} the consumption. The diversity of using areas of clothes and using types of clothes also makes it necessary. So, new types of fibers are searched to providecomfort features have become a competitive factor. Comfort is a term that refers satisfaction and feeling relaxation or good status as physical or mental. Comfort is came up under three headings including physical, psychological and physiological. The comfort of clothing can be mentioned when the user is able to ease movement and finds himself adequate aesthetically. Comfort is not only means fully relaxed, but also it is feeling comfortable in the garment whatever the conditions. Person cannot change the properties of the body and the environment, but he can chance the clothing factor alone. Selecting the properties of clothing depends on person and person chooses the clothing that is most appropriate to the environment is he in. Comfort is an important characteristic to enhance the value of textile products. Various consumers consider comfort {{as one of the most}} important attributes in their purchase of apparel products, therefore companies tend to focus on the comfort of apparel products. Slater defined comfort as "a pleasant state of physiological, psychological and physical harmony between a human being and the environment". In this study,natural fibers as modal, bamboo, soybean, tencel, cotton, viscose and synthetic fibers as Coolmax, Thermolite, Thermocool are used for determination how contribution different fibers to clothing comfort and determination of creating what changes in the physical performance of the garment. These selected fibers are prepared in the form of standard socks is a clothing continuously contact skin for daily using. This is derived from fiber to yarn knitted socks in two different frequency as the middle and loose. Thus effect of knitting setting is observed what contribution performance and comfort features. In this way prepared sample, to determine the comfort properties of the sock, water vapor permeability, fluid transfer, drying and air permeability tests; to purpose of determining the physical performance, bursting strenght, abrasion, thickness, fabric weight, wear, pilling and shrinkage tests are done. Measurement results are statistically evaluated by IBM SPSS 22. In vertical wicking analysis fabric samples are immersed into distilled water for 5 minutes and water height is recorded. Vetical wicking is governed by capillary pressure. Fibers with small and smooth pores have high capillarity. In transfer wicking test liquid transfer between wet and dry fabric samples that are put in rubber discs is measured. Pressure applied by discs simulate the pressure applied to textile materials during use. In transfer wicking test liquid transfer characteristics of fabrics under pressure are analyzed. Water evaporation rate is a measure of drying rate of a fabric. The most important parameter for water evaporation rate is the fiber regain. Water vapour permeability is important for determination of fabric comfort features because perspiration is excreted from body in vapour form. Fabrics touching the skin should be water vapour permeable. In water vapour permeability the most important parameter is the pores between fibers. According to examination results, it's seen that fiber type has effects on comfort properties of garments both directly or indirectly. The difference in wetting behaviour of socks was resulted directly from fiber type. Besides it is observed that the effects of the sellulosic fibers on the comfort properties of cloths are different. Thermolite, thermocool ve Coolmax fibers showed high physical performans and fast drying properties. Wear and burst strength have highest value compared to all other types of fibers but <b>width</b> and height <b>shrinkages</b> are lowest values. When Thermolite fiber is comparable air permeability value for all fiber types, Thermocool and Coolmax fibers has a moderate air permeability. The highest level of pilling is observed the Thermocool and Coolmax Synthetic fiber. This is a major disadvantage for these types of fibers. These three fiber exhibited the lowest performance as fluid transfer. In addition, very fast drying behavior has been observed. Tencel fiber which made of cellulose exhibited high dimensional change. Other physical performance values are also moderate, but has seen improvement in physical values in cotton blend. For the wetting behavior, transfer wetting and wicking test showed the highest value. Air permeability was found better level than cotton and viscose. Cotton was found as not so bad respect to other fibers regarding comfort properties; it has the highest physical performance as well. The most conspicuous result of the project is that socks produced with blend of the other fibers and cotton showed higher performance for bothcomfort and physical properties than the socks produced with 100 % of that other fiber. To obtain optimum efficiency from new fibers, it will be useful to use them asblended with cotton. Generally,test results of loose and medium setting knitted socks showed approximate values each other. Air permeability and water vapor permeability values in the loose setting knitted socks were observed to be better than mid frequency ones. In this study as seen, expected physical performance of the garment, clothing will be used in what the season, level of comfort features according to use of the clothes should be known for yarn selection. According to determined specialties, options should be done by acquired data. As a continuation of this study, examining of impact of yarn count, knitting type and the other parameters will contribute in the way of detailsYüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
