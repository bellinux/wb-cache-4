She later apologized for commenting on the presumptive Republican nominee calling her remarks [...] "ill advised"(sic).|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Aronofsky {{reflected}} on the reception of The Fountain, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} Fountain-haters out [...] The film's about the fact that it's OK that we die, and we should come to terms with it. But many, many people don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> that, so why pay money for a meditation on losing someone you love? Everything about western culture denies that." [...] He also believed the film was released at the wrong time, [...] "It was pre-Obama, {{smack in the middle of}} Paris Hilton time. But there has been a serious turn now, people are starting to realise that the party's over, finally. So we can stop thinking about the culture of superficiality, start to remember there are other things going on." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming for the {{television}} pilot began {{on location in}} Los Angeles in February 1999 and took six weeks. Ultimately, the network was unhappy with the pilot and decided not to place it on its schedule. Objections included the nonlinear storyline, the ages of Harring and Watts (whom they considered too old), cigarette smoking by Ann Miller's character and a close-frame shot of dog feces in one scene. Lynch remembered, [...] "All I know is, I loved making it, ABC hated it, and I don't like the cut I turned in. I agreed with ABC that the longer cut was too slow, but I was forced to butcher it {{because we had a}} deadline, and there wasn't time to finesse anything. It lost texture, big scenes and storylines, and there are 300 tape copies of the bad version circulating around. Lots of people have seen it, which is embarrassing, because they're bad-quality tapes, too. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richard Fortus, {{being interviewed}} by the French music website Rock N' Live in June 2012, {{revealed}} that the band would not play any more dates for the [...] "Up Close and Personal Tour", as the band members hoped {{to spend more time}} in the studio, hoping to complete the next album {{by the end of the}} year. Fortus said, [...] "I'm pretty much focused on GnR right now. We're getting ready to go back in the studio, so that's where my head's at right now, that's all I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> until the end of the year, pretty much." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{after the}} war, Hitchens scolded those within the US who had {{opposed the war}} by observing that [...] "the peace {{movement}} {{in this country in}} my opinion acted in a very narrow, isolationist, and almost chauvinistic way. It said that a war was more or less alright with it as long as it could be guaranteed in advance that American casualties could be kept low... I thought that was a dishonourably narrow way of approaching the question. ... When large numbers of Iraqis were turned into soap...and many others, as we've since found out, were bulldozed and buried alive and in other ways done away with and people don't even <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the body count ...because they’re afraid of what they might find out." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial airing, reviews of the show were mostly negative. Matt Roush, writing in USA Today, {{characterized}} the show as [...] "painfully bogus," [...] and a cynical and exploitative new low in television, commenting, [...] "Watching The Real World, which fails as documentary (too phony) and as entertainment (too dull), it's hard to tell who's using who more." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales commented, [...] "Ah to be young, cute, and stupid, and to have too much free time...Such is the lot facing the wayward wastrels of The Real World, something new in excruciating torture from the busy minds at MTV." [...] Shales also remarked upon the cast members’ creative career choices, saying, [...] "You might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> getting a real job." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jeff Gordon scored {{his record}} 5th {{win in the}} Brickyard 400 after passing Kasey Kahne on a restart with 17 laps to go. The race was {{dominated}} {{by a variety of}} pit strategies. Kasey Kahne lead the most laps in the race with 70 as Hendrick powered cars led 127 of the 160 laps. [...] "Those emotions take over. There's nothing better, especially in a big race, coming to Victory Lane with your family here," [...] said an emotional Gordon. [...] "I was trying so hard with 10 to go not to focus on the crowd. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it too much, but you can't help it." [...] "Looking back, I should have chosen the (outside lane)," [...] Kahne said. [...] "They pretty much let Jeff control that restart. I took off and never spun a tire and the inside had been more grip throughout the race and I started on the inside and I {{thought it was a great}} decision. But I didn't spin a tire and Jeff drove right by me before we were even got to the second (restart line)." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} stated that indignation {{provides}} the capacity <b>to</b> <b>think</b> through certain situations (Bromell, 2013, p. 290).

5000|$|In {{his first}} full season {{following}} the trade, Neely's 36 goals led the club, and his 72 points more than doubled his previous year's performance. In the same season, he also spent 143 minutes in the penalty box [...] "Mike Milbury said, 'I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> what you're doing by putting yourself into the penalty box. If you're going to fight, make sure it's on your terms {{and not just because}} someone is challenging you.' He was trying to make me understand who I was going in the box with. He'd say, 'I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take away from you dropping your gloves, but, I don't <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> not doing it. I just <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how your reaction affects both their team and our team.' So it got me to thinking a little more about my role.

She was pluckier than he had imagined and was obviously sincere, since she did not know Jim would be rich, but he doubted if she could keep it up. Jim was rude and tempestuous, and she would not be satisfied with him long.
