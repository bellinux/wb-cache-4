50|$|In the First World War {{the line}} was {{important}} in providing transportation for armament makers between Steyr and Letten. A temporary roll-block <b>wagon</b> <b>transfer</b> system was provided to Letten from 1916 to 1918.|$|E
50|$|In 1923 the GWR {{found itself}} with two {{stations}} at both Marlborough and Savernake, and duplicate lines between them. No immediate action was taken, except that distinguishing names were allocated from 1 July 1924: Marlborough Low Level and Savernake High Level for the M&SWJR stations; {{and the original}} {{connection between the two}} lines at Marlborough was reinstated for <b>wagon</b> <b>transfer</b> in November 1926.|$|E
50|$|In 1902 a short westward {{connection}} {{was made at}} Granton, serving Granton Gas Works. Joining in the Granton Harbour railway network, goods interchange with the Caledonian Railway also took place at Granton over the harbour lines, as for some decades the two companies had no direct connection in Edinburgh (other than the Haymarket connection which was unsuitable for goods <b>wagon</b> <b>transfer</b> due to congestion).|$|E
50|$|Correspondingly the {{connection}} to the GWR line at Marlborough was removed in 1898 on opening of the M&GR line; it was reinstated for <b>wagon</b> <b>transfers</b> in November 1926.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{as part of}} a {{liberalisation}} process, Russian Railways established First Freight Company {{which holds}} a large number of freight wagons; in 2010, it was announced that Second Freight Company would be established, and remaining freight <b>wagons</b> <b>transferred</b> to that.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 January 1847 a ½-mile {{connecting}} {{line from the}} Wicker to the Bridgehouses station of the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway had been constructed {{in order to increase}} goods traffic and enable <b>wagon</b> <b>transfers.</b> This short steeply gradded line, enclosed within a tunnel for almost its entire length was known locally as the Fiery Jack.|$|R
5000|$|Metre gauge.The railway {{operates}} a basic hourly frequency on all its lines using {{a fleet of}} electric railcars with driver trailers. The oldest operational class is Be 4/4 dating from 1903 which are, nowadays used on the special trains in conjunction with visits to the chocolate factory at Broc, or on special excursions. These usually, subject to demand, work with an elderly passenger coach as trailer. Normal services {{are in the hands}} of either class Be 4/4 single cab power units built in 1977 or double ended BDe 4/4 built in 1972 coupled to single end driving trailer cars (class Bt) to form two-coach sets or double ended class BDe 4/4 units built by Ateliers de Constructions Mécaniques de Vevey (ACMV) / ABB in 1992 (No's 121 to 124 inclusive) which work on their own on lightly loaded trains or with driving trailers by the same makers. For (school) peak traffic, some more driving trailers may be added.The line was home to just two main line electric locomotives, Class GDe 4/4, built by SLM / BBC in 1983 and which are identical to the Class 6001 of the Chemin de Fer Montreux-Oberland- Bernoise. These are No. 101, named [...] "Ville de Bulle" [...] and No. 102, named [...] "Neirivue". They were usually used on workings with standard gauge wagons loaded on transporter bogies or ballast hopper trains originating from Grandvillard. The company has also in its stocklist two vintage electric shunting locomotives, Class Te 2/2, No's 11 and 12, built by Oerlikon in 1912. One of these is usually to be found at Bulle in connection with the <b>wagon</b> <b>transfer</b> between standard and metre gauge, the other at Montbovon.|$|E

50|$|South of Eidelstedt {{there was}} a slope that caused {{difficulties}} for longer trains. In 1902, a connection was built to the state railway in Eidelstedt, where freight <b>wagons</b> were <b>transferred.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bridgehouses {{railway station}} was the {{terminal}} station of the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway from its opening in 1845 until {{the opening of}} the Wicker Arches, a 660 yd long viaduct across the Don Valley, which supported the new Sheffield Victoria opened on 15 September 1851. On 1 January 1847 a ½-mile connecting line to the Wicker station of the Midland Railway had been constructed in order to increase goods traffic and enable <b>wagon</b> <b>transfers.</b> This short steeply graded line, enclosed within a tunnel for almost its entire length was known locally as the Fiery Jack.|$|R
50|$|Tinnoset Station (Tinnoset stasjon) was {{a railway}} station on Tinnoset Line located at Tinnoset in Notodden, Norway. At {{the station was}} the docks where <b>wagons</b> were <b>transferred</b> from trains to the Tinnsjø railway ferry.|$|R
50|$|When BR {{began to}} build air braked wagons they had B prefixes, but this was dropped and six-figure numbers were used without prefix. Prefixes were re-introduced when <b>wagons</b> were <b>transferred</b> to the departmental/engineer's fleets.|$|R
5000|$|May 2001: [...] "Steamfreight 2001", the 3rd such {{event to}} be held. K160, J549, T333 and 61RM operated. 2 L type sheep <b>wagons</b> were <b>transferred</b> by {{road from the}} {{collection}} at Castlemaine and restored for this event.|$|R
50|$|The {{successor}} railway to the E&NR, the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway, installed train ferries {{for goods}} and mineral traffic: the <b>wagons</b> were <b>transferred</b> on to rails on the ferryboats, avoiding the transshipping, {{but this was}} still an imperfect arrangement.|$|R
50|$|When the Marlborough and Grafton {{line was}} opened, the {{connection}} from the B&HER line at Wolfhall junction was left as a disused siding; however {{it started to}} be used for <b>wagon</b> <b>transfers</b> from 1 November 1900. It was later replaced by a facing connection controlled from a new M&SWJR signal box also called Wolfhall Junction on 28 July 1902. The GWR had obtained running powers to Ludgershall in connection with anticipated troop movements, and the GWR opened a double line east curve at Wolfhall on 6 September 1905; the earlier MS&WJR was relocated somewhat to the south so as to control the junction for this curve as well as the previous west curve.|$|R
50|$|Pawn had a {{post office}} from 1915 to 1933. Four area {{residents}} combined the first letters of their last names—Poole, Ackerley, Worthington, and Nolen—to manufacture the post office name. One of them, Monroe Poole, was the first postmaster. Mail reached Pawn by horse or <b>wagon,</b> sometimes <b>transferred</b> from a boat further downstream.|$|R
50|$|A {{goods station}} (also {{known as a}} goods yard or goods depot) or freight station is, in the widest sense, a railway station which is {{exclusively}} or predominantly where goods (or freight), such as merchandise, parcels and manufactured items, are loaded or unloaded from ships or road vehicles and/or where goods <b>wagons</b> are <b>transferred</b> to local sidings.|$|R
50|$|In 1919 Aveling and Porter {{joined the}} Agricultural & General Engineers (AGE) combine. The combine had been formed at the joint {{instigation}} of T.L.Aveling and Archibald Maconochie. As well as Aveling & Porter, AGE took over James and Frederick Howard Ltd and twelve other companies. Production of Aveling and Porter steam <b>wagons</b> was <b>transferred</b> to Richard Garrett & Sons.|$|R
50|$|Pacific National {{lost the}} {{contract}} for the APEX rock trains (Kilmore East mines to Westall and Brooklyn) in mid 2015, with the last run to Westall on 24 December with G536 and 21 wagons. The <b>wagons</b> were <b>transferred</b> to Tottenham Yard awaiting further instructions. QUBE now runs the service, using eleven PHAY wagons in the range 1018 to 1220.|$|R
5000|$|Cumberland Mills {{was served}} by the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad (later Maine Central Railroad) and the Portland and Rochester Railroad (later Boston and Maine Railroad). Horse-drawn <b>wagons</b> <b>transferred</b> freight between the mill and the railroads. The wagons rode on [...] narrow gauge rails after 1874. Steam {{locomotives}} replaced the horses in 1895. The first three locomotives weighed 7 tons each, and carried 200 gallons of water. [...] The locomotives were originally oil fueled; but were converted to burn coal after three employees died in an oil fire during refueling in 1921. [...] Pulpwood was transported into the mill in 20-foot-long cars carrying 2 cords of pulpwood. [...] There were 110 pulpwood cars in 1938 and the mill consumed 180 cords of pulpwood per day. [...] Narrow gauge locomotives transferred 250 tons of coal per day to the mill boilers and transported ash from the boilers to a disposal pile.|$|R
50|$|The Ranch <b>Wagon</b> {{name was}} <b>transferred</b> to the Ford Fairlane range for 1963, {{leaving only the}} Country Sedan and Country Squire models in the {{full-size}} Ford Station Wagon Series.|$|R
50|$|A {{demonstration}} journey {{using the}} flying bridge system {{took place on}} 30 January 1850, when 12 <b>wagons</b> were <b>transferred</b> from the shore to Leviathan, followed by the Directors' in their own coach. Leviathan then crossed the Forth and the directors alighted at Granton without mishap. Commercial operations could not be started immediately as further work on the shore installations was required.|$|R
50|$|The GWR and the LSWR {{lines were}} of course on {{different}} track gauges, and a transfer shed was built between the routes; it was {{provided with a}} siding for each gauge, and goods were unloaded from one <b>wagon</b> and <b>transferred</b> to another for onward transit. This was a considerable inconvenience. A covered footbridge was provided between the two passenger stations, as passengers required to change trains.|$|R
5000|$|But beyond {{doing the}} falling-horse stunt, Hoy said, [...] "Jack drove stagecoaches, he wrecked <b>wagons,</b> he could <b>transfer</b> from {{the horse to}} the train -- he could do {{anything}} pertaining to horse work." ...|$|R
50|$|The Pressnitz Valley Railway was {{the last}} Saxon narrow gauge railway to be closed by the East German government. Passenger {{services}} were terminated in 1984; the transportation of freight for the refrigerator factory in Niederschmiedeberg ceased in 1986. The process of gradually dismantling the line took several years, from January 1984 until the summer 1989. Locomotives and <b>wagons</b> were <b>transferred</b> to other Saxon narrow gauge railways or decommissioned.|$|R
50|$|They were {{converted}} from former Brake Gangwayed (BG) vehicles in 1968 {{to supplement the}} Class 419 Motor Luggage Van fleet. However, following the decline of boat train traffic, they were all stored in 1975. After a period in use as match <b>wagons</b> for <b>transferring</b> new Class 432 and 491 units from York Works, they were all taken into departmental stock initially as stores vans, but later as breakdown train tool vans.|$|R
50|$|Sludge {{was pressed}} into 'Cake' at the Press House, a 237 ft long, by 92 ft wide {{building}} which housed the railway wagons in the basement. This allowed the 'Cake' to be gravity {{fed into the}} railway <b>wagons</b> for <b>transfer</b> {{to another part of}} the site. This would involve running into a siding, dumping the 'Cake' and leaving it to dry, before being sold as fertiliser and transhipped via the exchange sidings on the Midland line.|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of the lyrics are subject to debate. Historically the [...] "Black Betty" [...] of the title may refer to the {{nickname}} given {{to a number of}} objects: a musket, a bottle of whiskey, a whip, or a penitentiary <b>transfer</b> <b>wagon.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} part of Radebeul Ost station formerly had three through platforms. The northern {{part of it is}} a terminal station of the narrow gauge railway, with a freight yard with marshalling facilities and facilities for <b>transferring</b> <b>wagons</b> between the standard-gauge and narrow-gauge lines using transporter wagons.|$|R
50|$|The busiest {{facility}} was that at Dynon, {{in a typical}} year (1981-82), 24,110 wagons were bogie exchanged, an average of 66 per day. This was done by one shift of 18 men, compared with the 100 men required if {{the same amount of}} freight were <b>transferred</b> <b>wagon</b> to wagon.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} conducted by Alan Lomax {{with a former}} prisoner of the Texas penal farm named Doc Reese (a.k.a. [...] "Big Head"), Reese stated that the term [...] "Black Betty" [...] was used by prisoners {{to refer to the}} [...] "Black Maria" [...] — the penitentiary <b>transfer</b> <b>wagon.</b>|$|R
25|$|The two {{fastback}} models (along {{with the}} Oldsmobile Cutlass Salon) proved unpopular, possibly {{because they did}} not appeal to Buick's older, more conservative customer base. With the introduction of the new front wheel drive Century in 1982 (see below), the existing notchback sedan and <b>wagon</b> models were <b>transferred</b> to the Regal line.|$|R
50|$|The Federal Freight is {{a railway}} {{business}} established in Russia by Russian Railways, {{as part of}} plans {{to open up the}} rail transport market in Russia. A fleet of 180 thousand freight <b>wagons</b> will be <b>transferred</b> to the new company from RZD. It will have a share capital of 46.4 billion rubles. The company is headquartered in Ekaterinburg.|$|R
50|$|In March 1993, two further underframes {{were taken}} and {{converted}} to VZZF, for transfer of bogie frames (without the wheels). VZZF 1 {{came from the}} frame of VLEX 845; VZZF 2 came from VLEX 942. These wagons were converted {{with the intention of}} transporting standard gauge bogies from the Goninan workshops in Bendigo, and North Melbourne goods yard, where <b>wagons</b> were <b>transferred</b> between gauges. In 1997 one of the VZZF vans was seen in storage at the Bendigo Workshops; it was fitted with 18 wooden floor bolsters spaced evenly along the floor. These bolsters appeared to extend 150 - 200 mm {{over the side of the}} wagon sides.|$|R
50|$|From 1859 to 1868, great {{quantities}} of goods were transported across the Sierra {{to and from}} California {{on the backs of}} mules. When the Central Pacific Railroad line was completed to the Truckee Meadows, this hauling was bi-directional from Reno to Virginia City via the Geiger Grade <b>wagon</b> road, for <b>transfer</b> to rail for delivery to points east and west.|$|R
50|$|Two changes {{brought about}} {{the decline of the}} Cardiff Maintenance Centre, the name it adopted in March 1987. The first was the {{decision}} to maintain all wagons at a One Spot facility, a centre where freight rolling stock could receive all its necessary maintenance at one location. From April 1993 the <b>wagon</b> work was <b>transferred</b> to Port Waratah One Spot facility.|$|R
