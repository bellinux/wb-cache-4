Using public software, we have set up an automated pipeline to reduce the EPIC MOS & pn spectro-imaging data, optimized for extended sources analysis. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>developped</b> a code to perform intensive spectral and imaging analysis particularly focussing on proper background estimate and removal. XMM deep spectro-imaging of these clusters allowed us to fit a standard beta-model to their gas emission profiles as well as a standard MEKAL emission model to their extracted spectra, and test their inferred characteristics against already calibrated relations.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we report}} the {{synthesis}} of monodisperses and size controlled (6 and 18 nm) magnetic nanoparticles (NPs), from the pyrolysis of iron oxyhydroxide with oleic acid in high temperature solvents. The SQUID measurements revealed that the iron oxide nanoparticles exhibit a superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature. In order to evaluate the potential application of these NPs in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging, we investigated using 1 H NMR spectroscopy the modiﬁcations of T 1 and T 2 relaxation times at a magnetic ﬁeld (4. 7 Tesla) for diﬀerent concentrations of NPs. The following transverse (r 2) and longitudi- nal (r 1) relaxivities were found : (r 2 = 17. 85 mM − 1 s− 1, r 1 = 6. 90 mM − 1 s− 1) and (r 2 = 9. 20 mM − 1 s− 1, r 1 = 4. 30 mM − 1 s− 1) for a nanoparticle size 18 and 6 nm, respectively. These results conﬁrm that these magnetic NPs present a high con- trast enhancement capacity and have both high r 1 and r 2 relaxivities responsible for positive or negative enhancement properties. This eﬀect increases with the nanoparticle size. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>developped</b> a new recognition motif (coating) of sac- charide type (Rhamnose) for targeting at the tissular and cellular levels biological models (plants) in order to track the ﬂow {{of the water and}} saccharide (main drivers of plant growth) in NMR imaging.

40|$|We {{determine}} NOx emissions for Paris {{in summer}} 2009 and winter 2009 / 2010 {{by applying the}} closed integral method (CIM) to a large set of car Multi-AXis (MAX) -DOAS measurements performed {{in the frame of}} the MEGAPOLI project. MAX-DOAS measurements of the tropospheric NO 2 vertical column density (VCD) are performed at large circles around Paris. From the combination of the observed NO 2 VCDs with wind fields the influx into and the outflux from the encircled area is determined. The difference of both fluxes represents the total emission. Compared to previous applications of the CIM, the large number of measurements during the MEGAPOLI campaign allowed the investigation of important aspects of the CIM. In particular the applicability of the CIM under various atmospheric conditions could be tested. Another important advantage of the measurements during MEGAPOLI is that simultaneous atmospheric model simulations with high spatial resolution (3 [*]×[*] 3 [*]km 2) are available for all days. Based on these model data it is possible to test the consistency of the CIM and to derive information about favorable or non-favorable conditions for the application of the CIM. We find that in most situations the uncertainties and the variability of the wind data dominate the total error budget. Also measurement gaps and uncertainties in the partitioning ratio between NO and NO 2 are important error sources. Based on a consistency check, we deduced a set of criteria on whether measurement conditions are suitable or not for the application of the CIM. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>developped</b> a method for the calculation of the total error budget of the derived NOx emissions. Typical errors are between ± 30 [*]% and ± 50 [*]% for individual days (with one full circle around Paris). From the application of the CIM to car MAX-DOAS observations we derive daily average NOx emissions for Paris of 4. 2 [*]×[*] 1025 [*]molecules/s for summer and of 7. 8 [*]×[*] 1025 [*]molecules/s in winter. These values are by a factor of about 1. 4 and 2. 0 larger than the corresponding emissions derived from the application of the CIM to the model data, using the TNO-MEGAPOLI emission inventory, in summer and winter, respectively. Similar ratios (1. 5 and 2. 3 for summer and winter, respectively) were found for the comparison with the MACC-III emission inventory...|$|E
