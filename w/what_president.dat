Despite this high volume of traffic, very {{little has been}} done to protect the millions of users who log on to Facebook and other social media platforms each month. President Barack Obama tried to work with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to attempt to regulate data mining. He proposed the Privacy Bill of Rights, which would protect the average user from having their private information downloaded and shared with third party companies. The proposed laws would give the consumer more control over what information companies can collect. President Obama was unable to pass most of these laws through congress, and it is unsure <b>what</b> <b>President</b> Trump will do with regards to social media marketing ethics.|$|E

2500|$|Under Obama's plan, middle-class {{families}} would see their income taxes cut, with no family making less than $250,000 seeing an increase. In June 2008, Obama {{voted in favor}} of a budget that would raise the taxes on unmarried individuals with a taxable income of over $32,000 by pushing their tax bracket from 25% to 28%. Obama has proposed a tax plan which includes tax credits to lower the amount of taxes paid. It is argued that the typical middle-class family would receive over $1,000 in tax relief, with tax payments that are 20% lower than they faced under President Ronald Reagan. According to the Tax Policy Center, the Obama plan provides three times as much tax relief for {{middle-class families}} as the McCain plan. Obama's plan includes a temporary [...] "Making Work Pay" [...] program, which gives a tax credit at 6.2% of earned income up to $400 for single workers (making less than $75,000/yr), and an $800 for married couples (making less than $150,000/yr), expiring at the end of 2010; this is claimed on Schedule M of Form 1040. Families making more than $250,000 would pay either the same or lower income tax rates than they paid in the 1990s, leaving no family to pay higher income tax rates than they would have paid in the 1990s. For the wealthiest 2% of families, Obama plans to reverse a portion of the tax cuts they have received over the past eight years. [...] Dividend rates would be 39 percent lower than <b>what</b> <b>President</b> George W. Bush proposed in his 2001 tax cut.|$|E
