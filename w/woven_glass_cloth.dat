A two-resonator method, {{based on}} TE 011 -mode and TM 010 -mode {{resonance}} cavities with a disk sample {{has been developed}} for measurement of the longitudinal and transversal dielectric constants and dielectric loss tangent of dielectric substrates (dielectric anisotropy), used in modern electronics. The the-oretical background of the method is presented: the analytical expressions of the dispersion equations for the considered modes in both cavities and expressions of the energy balance for computation of the permittivity and the dielectric loss tangent of the unknown sample in two directions. The sensitivity and the mea-surement errors are discussed. Practical examples are given for illustration of the dielectric anisotropy characterization of modern reinforced substrates with built-in <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> <b>cloth</b> and filling plastics or powders.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Strength and {{stress-strain}} {{properties are}} investigated for plain woven glass fiber laminates using thin tubular specimens under biaxial static and cyclic loadings. Some composites show large distortion and fiber reorientation close to failure under biaxial load-ing. For such composites {{the usage of}} the 2 nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress instead of the nominal stress is proposed for strength evaluation. The experimental result reveals that the Tsai-Wu criterion fits the biaxial strength expressed by the 2 nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress {{much better than the}} strength expressed by the nominal stress. Strong interaction between axial and shear deformations is found beyond the knee/yield points while, within the elastic range no interaction is found between the axial and shear stiffness. Fiber misalignment with the loading axis affects the observed stress-strain behavior under cyclic loading. More than two S-S curves are distinguishable when the fiber misalignment is higher than 2 &deg;. Such stress-strain relations are successfully simulated using an incremental method in conjunc-tion with updating fiber orientation. Good agreement between the calculated result and ex-perimental one confirms that the proposed model which considers fiber misalignment can explain the observed stress-strain response under biaxial fatigue loading.

40|$|The {{original}} thesis {{was written}} in 1989 / 90 on a Macintosh Plus with a processor at 8 Mhz and 2. 5 Mb of RAM; it was written using Micro$oft Word Version 4 for the Macintosh {{and all of the}} figures, {{with the exception of the}} photographs, were included. Significant changes in computer technology have occurred in the years between the writing and the generation of this electronic copy in 2008, there have been some problems with backward compatibility of the software used, in particular with respect to the graphics handling capability, so there have been some significant problems with the use of old file formats; consequently not all of the figures are as clear as they were when the original was written. Tubes of glass reinforced thermosetting resins have been tested in axial compression between steel platens with one end chamfered to prevent critically high loads causing catastrophic centre failure. By testing in such a manner these tubes crush in a progressive and controlled manner, and are capable of exhibiting high levels of energy absorption, particularly when related to the material mass involved. Polymers are known to display viscoelastic behaviour and polymer composites are similarly sensitive to test speed and temperature. Energy absorption in tube crushing has been shown to be speed and temperature sensitive and the purpose of this project has been to understand the variability of the energy absorption and the associated mechanisms. The main aim has been to show how the two variables interrelate. The materials used have been produced by hot rolling of pre-preg cloth or by resinjection into closed moulds. Reinforcement has consisted of <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> <b>cloth</b> or random glass mat; matrix materials have been epoxy and polyester resins. Trends to higher values of specific energy absorption with increasing speed have been observed for epoxy matrix tubes, while polyester matrix tubes have shown less certain trends and give lower values of specific energy absorption at high speeds. All the tubes have shown a rapid drop in specific energy absorption with increasing temperature above normal room temperature, with changes in crush mode being very apparent. At temperatures in excess of about 100 degrees C the tubes have failed by centre buckling, the transition temperature from normal crushing to buckling being sensitive to the crush speed. The interrelation between speed and temperature effects has been examined. Three factors that prevent simple interrelation have been identified; these are inertial effects of crush debris, residual stresses in the hoop direction of the tube and frictional heating in the crush zone. Speed sensitivity of the energy absorption has been determined over a range of temperatures and various features of these responses related to the responses of the material properties. Frictional temperature rises have been modelled mathematically and the predictions have been shown to be reasonably consistent with experimental measurements. These temperature rises have been shown to be important in determining the speed sensitive behaviour of the energy absorption levels, particularly for polyester resin matrix tubes tested at high speeds...|$|E

Measurements were carried out on <b>woven</b> fabric (<b>weave</b> <b>glass</b> <b>cloth</b> / polyester) composite material. From the measured velocity data, the elastic constants were determined through a numerical inversion. Ultrasonic tests were achieved also on polyester and aluminium specimens as a representative of isotropic material.

It is found that the applicability of the ultrasonic pulse echo technique is in a good agreement for the isotropic material rather than the orthotropic material...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, for {{the purpose}} of {{achieving}} enhanced mechanical properties of fiber reinforced composites, hybridized composites containing a combination of two or more types of fiber reinforcements have been explored. Perhaps the main parameter which controls the mechanical properties of the hybrid composites is the flexibility to arrange the hybrid fiber reinforcement layers {{in a variety of ways}} within the hybrid laminate. In this study, low velocity drop weight impact resistance of plain <b>weave</b> <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> and carbon hybrid composites has been investigated. The study explores the effects of intra-ply arrangement sequence on the impact resistance of 24 and 32 ply laminates in which glass and the carbon plies have been differently stacked. The results show that impact resistance of <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fiber composites can be enhanced by hybridizing <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fabrics with <b>woven</b> carbon fabrics. The results indicate that the impact resistance is a function of the positions of the glass and carbon layers in the hybridized inter ply laminates...|$|R

Two different types of laminates were fabricated by hand lay-up technique; (i) <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre epoxy matrix laminates and (ii) <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> fibre epoxy matrix laminates with 3 % graphite particulate fillers. End Notch Flexure (ENF) test was adopted for the measurement of delamination resistance. The two GFRPs laminates show similar mode II delamination resistance. At impact velocities between 2. 215 and 4. 429 m/sec, the GFRP developed a smaller damage size than the graphite-based GFRP laminates, indicating higher impact toughness. Difference of the impact resistance between the two GFRPs is mainly on the impact damage size developed. The total energy absorbed during the impact remains the same, which is independent of mode II delamination resistance of the GFRP. The history of relevant dynamic and energetic quantities, both to synthesize the dependency of the energy parameters and force threshold values on the impact velocity are discussed...|$|R
