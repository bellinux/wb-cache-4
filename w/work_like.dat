5|$|Alkan's {{attachment}} to his Jewish origins is displayed both {{in his life}} and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This <b>work,</b> <b>like</b> many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and a closing chorale. He scored the <b>work,</b> <b>like</b> other cantatas written in Weimar, {{for a small}} ensemble of three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T), bass (B)), a four-part choir only in the chorales, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four violas (Va), cello (Vc), bassoon (Fg) and basso continuo. The setting for four violas is unusual. In a similar orchestration, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 also omits violins.|$|E
5|$|In Baroda, Aurobindo {{joined the}} state service in 1893, working {{first in the}} Survey and Settlements department, later moving to the Department of Revenue {{and then to the}} Secretariat, and much {{miscellaneous}} <b>work</b> <b>like</b> teaching grammar and assisting in writing speeches for the Maharaja of Gaekwad until 1897. In 1897 during his work in Baroda he started working as a part-time French teacher at Baroda College (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda). He was later promoted to the post of vice-principal. At Baroda, Aurobindo self-studied Sanskrit and Bengali.|$|E

5|$|Less {{reactive}} than iodine, astatine is {{the least}} reactive of the halogens, although its compounds have been synthesized in microscopic amounts and studied as intensively as possible before their radioactive disintegration. The reactions involved have been typically tested with dilute solutions of astatine mixed with larger amounts of iodine. Acting as a carrier, the iodine ensures there is sufficient material for laboratory techniques (such as filtration and precipitation) to <b>work.</b> <b>Like</b> iodine, astatine {{has been shown to}} adopt odd-numbered oxidation states ranging from −1 to +7.|$|E
5|$|Who's Your City? was {{intended}} to be a self-help book, based on scholarly research and an academic theory, that provided a reader the mental framework necessary to match their personality and life situation with the optimum city to reside. Florida drew upon his past research on the geographical aspects of wealth generation and locational decisions of members of the creative class, as well as theories and opinions of other academics, like Jane Jacobs, and even those who have been critical of Florida's <b>work,</b> <b>like</b> Tim Harford. New research included a psychological aspect to his theory. Maps, graphs, tables, and indices illustrate the text.|$|E
5|$|Each of the cover, main body, {{and foot}} of the cup is made of an inner and outer plate, and the {{enamelled}} medallions inside the cover and bowl were made separately before attachment. The enamel areas may have been designed by the goldsmith, or an artist more used to painting on panels or in manuscripts may have produced drawings. A number of names of goldsmiths appear in records of the period, but in contrast to many contemporary manuscripts, the few surviving goldsmith's pieces are not signed or marked and cannot be matched to any names. Not a single maker's name is recorded for the more than 3,000 items in precious metal in the inventory mentioned above of the possessions of Berry's brother Anjou. High quality courtly <b>work</b> <b>like</b> the cup is conventionally assigned to Paris {{in the absence of}} other stylistic evidence; this is where other documentary sources locate the main concentration of goldsmiths.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel narrative that reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, it provided a model for Mary Shelley's <b>work.</b> <b>Like</b> her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque.|$|E
5|$|The new <b>work,</b> <b>like</b> its predecessor, {{attracted}} minimal readership. On 21 June 1791, {{just days}} after it was published, all attention became focused on King Louis XVI's ill-fated flight to Varennes, and Saint-Just's theories about constitutional monarchy were made suddenly irrelevant. Yet the episode had another effect – it fostered a public anger toward the king which simmered all year until finally a Parisian mob attacked the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792. In response, the Assembly declared itself ready to step down ahead of schedule {{and called for a}} new election, this one under universal male suffrage. The timing was excellent for Saint-Just, who turned the legal age of twenty-five {{before the end of the}} month. The fear inspired by the invasion of the Tuileries made most of his opponents retire from the scene, and Saint-Just was elected as one of the deputies for the département of Aisne. He left for Paris to join the National Convention as its youngest member.|$|E

25|$|Kinetochore {{proteins}} and proteins binding to MTs (+) end (collectively called +TIPs) regulate kinetochore movement through the kMTs (+) end dynamics regulation. However, the kinetochore-microtubule interface is highly dynamic, {{and some of}} these proteins seem to be bona fide components of both structures. Two groups of proteins seem to be particularly important: kinesins which <b>work</b> <b>like</b> depolymerases, such as KinI kinesins; and proteins bound to MT (+) ends, +TIPs, promoting polymerization, perhaps antagonizing the depolymerases effect.|$|E
25|$|Sprinkling with {{holy water}} {{is used as}} a sacramental that recalls baptism. Holy water is kept in the holy water font, which is {{typically}} located {{at the entrance to the}} church (or sometimes in a separate room or building called a baptistery). Smaller vessels, called stoups, are usually placed at the entrances of the church, to enable people to sprinkle themselves with it on entering. In recent years, with the concerns over influenza, new holy water machines that <b>work</b> <b>like</b> an automatic soap dispenser have become popular.|$|E

The super-regenerative receiver <b>works</b> <b>like</b> that of an intermittent oscillation detection circuit. The superheterodyne <b>works</b> <b>like</b> the one in a radio receiver. The superheterodyne receiver is used because of its stability, high sensitivity and it has relatively good anti-interference ability, a small package and lower price.|$|R
25|$|Makart's <b>work,</b> <b>like</b> {{those of}} other {{academic}} artists of the time, consisted of allegorical painting and history painting as seen in Catherina Carnaro, Dianas Hunt, The Entry of Charles V into Antwerp, Abundantia , Spring, Summer, The Death of Cleopatra, The Five Senses, and Bacchus and Ariadne. He was considered the Austrian rival to the French William-Adolphe Bouguereau. Within Austria, his nearest competitor {{was considered to be}} Hans Canon, and he was associated with the sculptor Viktor Tilgner, who travelled with him to Italy.|$|E
25|$|On April 24, 2006, eBay {{opened its}} new eBay Express site, which was {{designed}} to <b>work</b> <b>like</b> a standard Internet shopping site for consumers with United States addresses. It closed in 2008. Selected eBay items were mirrored on eBay Express, where buyers shopped using a shopping cart to purchase from multiple sellers. The UK version was launched to eBay members in mid-October 2006, but on January 29, 2008, eBay announced its intention to close the site. The German version, eBay Express Germany, was also opened in 2006 and closed in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Weightlessness {{can cause}} serious {{problems}} on technical instruments, especially those consisting of many mobile parts. Physical processes {{that depend on}} {{the weight of a}} body (like convection, cooking water or burning candles) act differently in free-fall. Cohesion and advection play a bigger role in space. Everyday <b>work</b> <b>like</b> washing or going to the bathroom are not possible without adaptation. To use toilets in space, like the one on the International Space Station, astronauts have to fasten themselves to the seat. A fan creates suction so that the waste is pushed away. Drinking is aided with a straw or from tubes.|$|E
50|$|On {{his return}} to London, Tillyer began to make radically {{experimental}} work which {{raised questions about the}} relationship of art to the world - man to nature.
