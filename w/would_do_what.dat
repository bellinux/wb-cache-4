5|$|The Japanese embassy {{met with}} King Philip III in Madrid on 30 January 1615. Hasekura remitted to the King {{a letter from}} Date Masamune, as well as offer for a treaty. The King responded that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he could to {{accommodate}} these requests.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1229, Alice {{arrived in}} Acre, whereupon she laid {{claim to the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem against the infant Conrad, son of her niece, Isabella II, and Frederick. She {{appeared}} before the High Court of Jerusalem declaring that Conrad had forfeited his right to the kingdom as {{he had failed to}} personally take possession of it within a year and a day of the death of his mother, as required by a local law regarding fiefs inherited by a non resident heir. The members of the High Court, who had recently pledged fealty to Conrad's father, rejected Alice's claim, emphasizing that Conrad was a minor. However, they sent their envoys to Frederick in Foggia, Italy, requesting that he send Conrad to the Holy Land within a year and a day. Frederick informed the envoys that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he thought best in May 1230.|$|E
5|$|Schneider started Vancouver's {{next game}} against the Calgary Flames. For the second-straight game, Vancouver lost a two-goal lead in a game which {{eventually}} went to a shootout. In contrast to his first start, Schneider had a strong game, making 34 saves {{by the end of}} overtime. In the shootout, he stopped four of the five shooters he faced, earning the Canucks their first win of the season. Two nights later, as they began their first road trip, the Canucks played a rematch with the Ducks in Anaheim. Schneider made the start and earned some redemption, stopping all 30 Anaheim shots, helping the Canucks to the 5–0 win and earning his fifth career shutout. Following the win, Schneider started the next game, a 4–1 loss to the San Jose Sharks. Luongo started the next four games, finishing off the month of January and beginning February. Vigneault joked that he was making his starting goaltender decisions based on coin tosses. He further noted that the two goaltenders were team guys and they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> was asked of them and never complain. The coin became a running joke for Vigneault and the Canucks in general, as Ryan Kesler stated he flipped it before announcing his return from injury.|$|E

25|$|Ned Courtney had no {{relationship}} with Harvard. He {{worked as a}} waiter at the Café Dreyfus and probably had sex with several Harvard students. Nevertheless he responded to the Court's summons and submitted to its questioning. The Court's notes indicate that Harvard <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> it could to terminate his employment.|$|E
25|$|Defenders {{of the use}} of bank {{interest}} (principally M.A.Khan and M.O.Farooq) reply that that orthodox opponents provide scant evidence that interest is to blame for what the orthodox allege or that banning interest <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> they say it would. Often legitimate complaints about world financial status quo (economic inequality, over indebtedness and speculation, providing for riskless markets that don't need funds at the expense of slightly more risky market that could use finance) are used to draw illegitimate conclusions that the solution is a ban on all interest.|$|E
25|$|In 1916, at {{the behest}} of Winston Churchill, Lydia {{infiltrated}} and eliminated a German Templar spy facility in Tower Bridge. She later sought out, on his request, {{the rest of the group}} and their Sage leader that he deemed to be a pressing matter of national security which he was unable to broach with the government as he lacked strong enough evidence. In exchange for her services, Churchill promised Lydia that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he could for the enfranchisement of women when he had returned to parliament after the War.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{his high}} profile, Furtwängler's public {{opposition}} prompted a mixed reaction from the Nazi leadership. Heinrich Himmler wished to send Furtwängler to a concentration camp. Goebbels and Göring ordered their administration to listen to Furtwängler's requests and {{to give him the}} impression that they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he asked. This led him to believe that he had some positive influence to stop the racial policy. He subsequently invited several Jewish and anti-fascist artists (such as Yehudi Menuhin, Artur Schnabel, and Pablo Casals) to perform as soloists in his 1933/34 season, but they refused to come to Nazi Germany. Furtwängler subsequently invited Jewish musicians from his orchestra such as Szymon Goldberg to play as soloists.|$|E

500|$|In October 1957 Palewski was {{appointed}} as France's ambassador to Italy. Mitford's meetings with him, {{which had become}} increasingly rare because of [...] his many political and social commitments, were now reduced to a single visit a year, supplemented with occasional letters. [...] Mitford mainly concealed her true feelings on this separation, although one acquaintance noted her increasingly [...] "savage" [...] teasing of friends, which was perhaps a safety valve: [...] "If she would only tell one she is unhappy one <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> one could to comfort her". In March 1958 Mitford's father, Lord Redesdale, died. After the cremation, she informed her sister Jessica, [...] "the ashes were done up {{in the sort of}} parcel he used to bring back from London, rich thick brown paper & incredibly neat knots".|$|E

In a 2000 interview, Wayne noted that there had always been a major split within the group about Secunda's tactics: [...] " [...] had the animals who <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he wanted to do in Trevor, Ace, and me — the fiery part of the stage act. I think Roy would obviously qualify this himself, but I believe he was slightly embarrassed by the image and the stunts — but the rest of us weren't ... We were always willing to be Secunda puppets".|$|E
2500|$|Following {{his actions}} in Herzegovina Prazina left for Croatia, {{spending}} {{several months in}} a villa on the Dalmatian coast provided for by the Croatian government. General Stjepan Šiber would later recount to Sarajevo media a brief encounter he had {{with him in a}} Zagreb hotel lobby in early May 1993. He stated that a jean-clad Prazina approached him, expressed regret for his actions and asked to be forgiven and reinstated to the ARBiH. Šiber assured Prazina he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he could, after which the two never saw each other again. Not allowed to carry weapons by the Zagreb authorities, Prazina allegedly grew bitter and restless.|$|E
2500|$|He {{showed no}} remorse {{and stated that}} Jasenovac was not an {{extermination}} camp but a work camp designed to hold the enemies of the NDH, whom he claimed were treated in a kind and benevolent manner. He claimed that no killings had occurred during his command. He maintained that the camp was organized to hold those complicit in the [...] "Serbian genocidal policies" [...] that he claimed were implemented against the Croats from 1919 until 1941. Šakić stated that his conscience was clear before God and that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he had done in Jasenovac again if the [...] "biological existence" [...] of Croats were threatened once more. He acknowledged that Jews and Romanis were detained because of their ethnicity but claimed Serbs and others were held as enemies of the state who wanted to destroy Croatia.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the failure}} of the Royal Expedition, General Espartero {{received}} an official letter signed by Queen Isabella II's Secretary of War, in which he was given responsibility for the termination of the war along with 25 million reales for the proceedings. General Isidro de Alaix Fábregas, in the name of Espartero, communicated this letter to Maroto. Maroto insisted that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> was best for the good of Spain. The result was a meeting between the two opposing generals {{that took place in the}} hermitage of San Antolín de Abadiano near Durango. The English colonel Wylde attended the Abadiano conference as an observer, because of Britain's recent role as mediator; also present was brigadier Francisco Linage, secretary to Espartero. But the negotiations were stymied by the matter of fueros: Maroto had promised to [...] defend the fueros and Espartero held that they were unconstitutional.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{well known}} story is of Slhx̱i7lsh [...] or Siwash Rock. The story passed down {{tells of a}} men {{committed}} to his marriage, trained for the coming of his future child by taking morning swims in the water near Ambleside Park {{in what is now}} West Vancouver. During his lap returning, the Transformers in their canoe blocked his passage. They told him he had to move and that he could not pass, but his determination told him he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he must for his wife and future child. The Transformers were amazed at his defiance of them as the emissaries of the Great Spirit, and decided upon his fate. He would be transformed into the rock outcropping for all future generations to remember his sacrifice for cleanliness and fatherhood. His wife was also transformed into a rock, which is nearby Siwash Rock.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, 24 December, saw further developments. [...] Despite Smuts's {{actions in}} {{ordering}} Jones {{to be tried}} {{on a charge of}} murder, and the assurance of British officials that they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> they could to defuse the situation, the South African League held their illegal protest meeting. [...] Here the League intended to present a petition to the British High Commissioner, a petition addressed to the Queen, calling got the British government to take such steps as were necessary for the 'protection of their lives and liberties'. [...] This was the intention, but Sir Alfred Milner, who would have welcomed the petition as leverage against Kruger, was still in London. [...] Instead, his temporary replacement, Sir William Butler, refused to accept it. [...] Sir William had no sympathy with Milner's aims; he refused the petition and in a dispatch to London he condemned the whole controversy as nothing than a storm whipped up by the League.|$|E

2500|$|These events {{known as}} the Haymarket Riots angered many people and gave a bad {{impression}} of the labor unions due to the violence that they had incurred. [...] However, protests such as these helped to make an impression upon the industrial heads. [...] It made them start {{to realize that they}} were going to have to make changes for the workers or suffer the consequences. [...] The Haymarket Riots were one of the things that set the era of worker reform into motion to help millions of people improve their lives. [...] Working to reform the eight-hour day paid off eventually and continues on today. [...] This showed the people in charge that laborers were no longer willing to be treated so inhumanely and that they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> needed to be done in order to change what they wanted. [...] Because of this push for the eight-hour day, doors were open for reform of other unfair treatments of laborers. [...] It helped to work towards a more just labor system in general. [...] Young Jay Fox had been a part of this at the age of sixteen; he had helped in a cause to make a difference. [...] Not only this but he was able to leave behind writings that let future generations know what had happened in his account of the event “I Was At Haymarket.” [...] Through this piece of writing he showed what was going on at the time, what people decided to do about the unfair treatment, and the injustice of the authorities handling the situation.|$|E
2500|$|The Dubois Brothers {{were known}} to terrorize the owners of nightclubs and bars in order to force the owners into paying {{protection}} taxes and then would begin to take over their business. They {{were known to}} use these tactics similarly with drug dealers, prostitutes, pimps, loan sharks, strippers, thieves and fences. The Brothers would start by frequenting a bar or nightclub either themselves or through sending an associate or cronies, they would begin by seeming friendly {{and then move on}} to picking fights with patrons, vandalizing the premises, commence harassing staff and assaulting the owner in a hostile take over. It would continue to get progressively worse until the owner could not take anymore of the attacks and agreed to what they Dubois Brothers were wanting. Majority of the time {{there seemed to be no}} option for the owners once the Brothers became interested, they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> it took in order to get what they wanted. [...] The Dubois Brothers would often settle for $100 a week in protection tax or payments, which at the time would have been equivalent to around $1000 a week today, with the Brothers collecting individually from dozens of bars or clubs. One witness, Charles Houle, who owned a bar on Notre Dame street west in Montreal claimed to police that the Dubois Brothers, specifically Raymond, in 1965 had paid a quick visit to his bar shortly they had opened and demanded he pay the weekly fee for the protection tax. It turned out that even at his testimony many years later he was still paying the tax and at this time it was believed to have totalled $50,000. Once there was control over the bar by Dubois Brother they would force integration of other criminal activities such as: control hiring so they could hire criminals, loansharking, drugs, gambling, etc. The owners would have no say in the matter and the criminal activities and the Dubois Brothers would gain a business or home base for their transactions and other criminal business.|$|E
