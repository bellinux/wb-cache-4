50|$|Maurice Merleau Ponty (1908-1961) was a French phenomenologist philosopher, {{strongly}} influenced by Edmund Husserl.

50|$|Existential {{crisis has}} indeed {{been seen as}} the {{inevitable}} accompaniment of modernism (1890-1945). Whereas Durkheim saw individual crises as the byproduct of social pathology and a (partial) lack of collective norms, others have seen existentialism as arising more broadly from the modernist crisis {{of the loss of}} meaning throughout the modern world. Its twin answers were either a religion revivified by the experience of anomie (as with Martin Buber), or an individualistic existentialism based on facing directly the absurd contingency of human fate within a meaningless and alien universe, as <b>with</b> <b>Sartre</b> <b>and</b> Camus.|$|E
50|$|Alongside his journalistic activities, Gorz {{worked closely}} <b>with</b> <b>Sartre</b> <b>and</b> adopted an existentialist {{approach}} to Marxism, leading him {{to emphasize the}} questions of alienation and of liberation {{in the framework of}} existential experience and an analysis of social systems from the viewpoint of individual experience. This intellectual framework formed the basis of his first books, Le Traître (Le Seuil, 1958, prefaced by Sartre), La Morale de l'histoire (Le Seuil, 1959) and the Fondements pour une morale (Galilée, 1977, published fifteen years later), which he signed {{for the first time as}} André Gorz, from the German name of the now Italian city (Görz) where the eyeglasses given to his father by the Austrian Army were made.|$|E

50|$|When the Allies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus {{witnessed}} {{and reported}} {{the last of}} the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, {{he was one of the}} few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bombs on Japan. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Café de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris <b>with</b> <b>Sartre</b> <b>and</b> others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre.|$|E
5000|$|During {{these six}} years, Lévy worked <b>with</b> <b>Sartre,</b> <b>and</b> {{the two men}} {{produced}} four books until Sartre's death. While working with Sartre, Lévy began to discover Judaism, initially through his research into the Kabbalah, which he conducted with his mentor. Their work together created a stir among the circle that surrounded Sartre, because Sartre had begun introducing new ideas and terms that evoked religious and, more specifically, Jewish concepts, such as Redemption and Messianism. Some, including Simone de Beauvoir began accusing Lévy of brainwashing Sartre and faking his writings. After this Ms de Beauvoir and Mr Levy were no longer on speaking terms. Two months before his death, Sartre responded to these critics, claiming that he had indeed abandoned some of his earlier ideas. [...] In 1978, Lévy encountered Levinas, and started learning Hebrew and beginning Talmudic studies.|$|E

40|$|Albert Camus is {{typically}} categorized as an atheistic thinker, {{in the same}} breath as Sartre. Yet there is a sizable, often sympathetic, theological response to his works, which deal at great length with Christian themes, wrestle with the problem of evil, and are animated by his own avowed desire — in strong contrast <b>with</b> <b>Sartre</b> <b>and</b> other existentialists — to preserve a sense of the sacred without belief in human immortality. This essay reconstructs three components of Camus’s rapport and disagreement with Christian theology, which he approached pre-eminently through the figure of Augustine, central to his early Diplome thesis. First, we recount the young Camus’s neopagan ‘‘religiosity’’ — a sense of the inhuman majesty and beauty of the natural world at the heart of what he termed (and later regretted terming) the ‘‘absurd,’’ and rooted in Camus’s own unitive experiences growing up amidst the sea, sand, and blazing sun of North Africa. Second, we look at Camus’s engagement with the problem of evil, which for Camus — as for many early modern thinkers such as Bayle or Voltaire — represented the decisive immanent tension in later medieval theology, vindicating — in ethical terms — the modern rebellions against altar, pulpit, and throne. The essay closes by rebutting the charge, strongly argued recently by Ronald Srigley, that Camus was (both) anti-modern because anti-Christian. Camus’s aim, we propose, was instead to bring together a neopagan sense of the wonder of the natural world and our participation in it, with the egalitarian components of Christian ethics, severed from secularized eschatological content...|$|E

40|$|Production of mini {{vegetables}} in organic {{system is a}} good alternative to improve profit, {{but there are no}} researches about the optimum plant density for these cultivars in Brazilian conditions. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the production of mini lettuce cultivars in different plant densities.

The experimental design was completely randomized blocks, with six treatments in factorial scheme, 3 mini lettuce cultivars (Tudela, Renoir <b>and</b> <b>Sartre)</b> x 2 spacing between plants (16 and 20 cm), with eight replications and plots (2. 04 m 2) with six rows, spaced 15 cm. Experiment 2 was conducted from June 6 th (sowing) to July 18 th (harvesting), 2012. The cultivars <b>Sartre</b> <b>and</b> Renoir were evaluated under four plant densities (444, 444; 333, 333; 266, 667 and 200, 000 plants ha- 1, corresponding to spacing of 15 x 15, 15 x 20, 25 x 15 and 25 x 20 cm, respectively). Eight treatments were defined by a factorial scheme 2 (cultivars) x 4 (plant densities) and arranged in a completely randomized block design, with nine replications and plots with 2. 04 m 2. The evaluated characteristics in both experiments were total and marketable fresh weight per plant, plant dry weight, plant diameter and height, marketable yield and discard percentage. In first experiment, during the summer, cultivar Sartre showed the highest marketable fresh weight (72 g plant- 1). Heaviest plants (91. 6 g plant- 1) were obtained with the higher plant spacing, but the highest yield (2. 51 kg m- 2) was obtained with the smaller spacing. In winter, plants with higher total (190 g plant- 1) and marketable (146 g planta- 1) fresh weight were obtained <b>with</b> cultivar <b>Sartre,</b> <b>and</b> the same was observed in low plant density.
