5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and {{asked him why he}} had broken up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, but he wanted to be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
25|$|While {{he was in}} the Nice prison, Calderone became {{convinced}} {{that he was about to}} be killed by other Sicilian inmates. Suddenly, he began screaming for a prison guard and demanded to see the head of the prison. He said he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to judge Giovanni Falcone. Calderone was moved to an insane asylum for his own protection.|$|E
25|$|The {{feature film}} drama, The Accused (1988), was {{loosely based on}} this case. It starred Jodie Foster as the woman {{attacked}} and Kelly McGillis as an Assistant District Attorney prosecuting the case. In press coverage related to the film, McGillis acknowledged that she had survived an assault and rape herself. She discussed her long struggle {{to get over the}} attack, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it to help other victims.|$|E

I find they are perfectly willing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people, but they don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people who are shocked by their ideas, nor do they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> older people who are not realistic." ...|$|R
25|$|Abderrahmane Meziane Chérif, the Minister of the Interior of Algeria, came to {{the airport}} control tower to begin {{negotiating}} with the hijackers. The hijackers, using the captain to speak for them, demanded the release of two Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) political party leaders, Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, who were in house arrest; the FIS was banned in Algeria in 1992. Chérif demanded that the hijackers begin releasing children and elderly if they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the Algerian government. The media began arriving at the airport to cover the crisis.|$|E
25|$|As a {{conservative}} Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles {{that he felt}} might compromise his beliefs—including a role with sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In {{one of his first}} films, April Love, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss (which was not in the script). Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to his wife first, {{to make sure it was}} all right with her. He had his own film production company, Cooga Mooga Productions.|$|E
25|$|Steiner {{called the}} Egyptian pilot {{on the radio}} telling him that his plane was now {{in the custody of}} US Military. The pilot {{informed}} Steiner that an Egyptian ambassador was aboard and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> with him. A ladder was lowered from the forward door and the pilot, Captain Amed Moneeb, descended followed by Egyptian diplomat Zeid Imad Hamed. SEAL Team commander Bob Gormly met them and examined Hamed's credentials – finding them in order he escorted Hamed into the base and let him phone Egypt's foreign minister.|$|E

25|$|A {{short time}} later, detectives from the RHD {{who had been}} {{selected}} for their lack of personal connection to Lazarus called her one morning from the lockup at Parker Center, the department's headquarters. Bratton had ordered that location be used since Lazarus would have to surrender her gun in order to enter it, limiting the possibility she might resist violently when she was arrested (immediately following the interview, as was the plan) or {{realized that she was}} the prime suspect. The detectives, Greg Stearns and Dan Jaramillo, told her they had someone in custody who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about an art theft.|$|E
25|$|Morphy {{was unable}} to {{successfully}} build a law practice after the war ended. His attempts to open a law office failed; when he had visitors, they invariably <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about chess, not their legal affairs. Financially secure thanks to his family fortune, Morphy essentially {{spent the rest of}} his life in idleness. Asked by admirers to return to chess competition, he refused. He did attend the New York Tournament of 1883 and met world champion Wilhelm Steinitz (who had tried unsuccessfully to get Morphy to agree to a match in the 1860s) there, but declined to discuss chess with him.|$|E
25|$|Chief Flying Hawk {{appreciated}} that youth education {{was essential to}} preserve Lakota culture. During his travels, he frequently visited public schools for presentations, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about making over the white man’s history so that the young people would know the truth. Flying Hawk wanted school history programs to tell the stories of Native American warriors and statesmen who fought to protect their families, defend the invasion of their lands and preserve their culture. He selected Native American warriors and statesmen from different tribes: Red Jacket, Seneca; Little Turtle, Miami; Logan, Oneida; Cornplanter, Seneca; Osceola, Seminole; Red Bird, Winnebago; Pontiac, Ottawa; Tecumseh, Shawnee; Black Hawk, Sauk; Red Cloud, Lakota; and Sitting Bull, Lakota. Flying Hawk {{was impressed with the}} oratory of Red Jacket, Logan, Black Hawk, Tecumseh, Sitting Bull and Red Cloud, and requested that their speeches be included in his commentaries.|$|E

25|$|Despite admitting {{throughout}} {{the work that}} he very regularly used EPO, testosterone pills and patches, and autologous blood transfusions (all banned practices), Hamilton staunchly opposed the sanction, since he had never used the blood of another person. It was speculated that Fuentes and his assistant had mixed the blood of another rider with his. His career in a shambles, he raced for lesser team after his suspension, tested positive for DHEA (in an OTC herbal anti-depressant) and retired. He later {{received a call from}} federal investigator Jeff Novitzky, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to him. He refused and was served a subpoena, whereupon he decided to tell everything. Some former teammates of Lance Armstrong and other witnesses appeared, until the federal government dropped the charges. The USADA took over the investigation under civil law, and Armstrong was ultimately stripped of all his titles from August 1998 onward. He was also banned from bicycle racing and triathlon competition.|$|E
25|$|In early 1968, he was {{contacted}} {{by a friend}} from Chicago who said that Toyota wanted to establish a dealer network in the Southeast U.S. and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Jim Moran, who asked what a Toyota was. The company had been unsuccessful at breaking into the American market {{at the end of}} the 1950s and was trying again. Moran declined, but his friend was insistent that Moran drive one. According to Moran, he tested everything to see if it would break. While cruising at 55mph on the interstate, Moran shifted into reverse, and the engine and transmission survived. Moran concluded that although Toyotas weren't as stylish or comfortable as domestic vehicles, they were well-built, reasonably priced, and destined to change the automotive business. On October 26, 1968 he entered into an agreement to distribute Toyota vehicles from the port in Jacksonville, Florida to the states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North and South Carolina. His Southeast Toyota Distributors (SET) was founded that year and in 2006, distributed over 400,000 vehicles, 20% of all new Toyotas sold in the United States.|$|E

It turns out that Dylan wants {{to try to be}} a family again with her and Sammy. However, this would mean they would have to move away from Beverly Hills. After much thought, Kelly breaks up with Ryan, as she said that she needs to try to work things out with Dylan. Ryan asks Kelly why Dylan would call Brenda's phone, not hers, if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Kelly. Fearing Brenda and Dylan were {{secretly}} back together, Kelly confronts Brenda. After hearing Brenda say that her and Dylan's relationship is platonic, Brenda and Kelly make up. Kelly decides to try to repair her relationship with Dylan, while Brenda sadly deletes his number from her cell phone. It is implied {{that there may have been}} more to the story of Brenda and Dylan's relationship that she didn't share with Kelly, as Brenda shed some tears when deleting Dylan's phone number.|$|E

I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E

Sometime after shooting [...] "Enemy Mine", the producers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Smith about the possibility of having him return to the spin off series, Stargate Atlantis. After the talk, Smith auditioned for a part, he won and received a different character. According to Smith, this {{character was}} more of a [...] "military guy", but the producers eventually decided to give Smith back his old character, Lorne.|$|E

Behr thought he was so charming that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> {{to him about the}} role on the spot, but his friend talked him out of it as he felt that Darren would think he was insane. Surma got in touch with Darren at Behr's prompting. Darren initially rejected the role, having heard that the part was a singer. Darren's agent went back to him three times and eventually convinced him to read the script, which is when {{he fell in love with}} the character. He later called it a [...] "dream come true".|$|E
