5|$|In 1924, Bush and Marshall {{teamed up}} with {{physicist}} Charles G. Smith, who had invented a device called the S-tube. This enabled radios, which had previously required {{two different types of}} batteries, to operate from mains power. Marshall raised $25,000 to set up the American Appliance Company on July 7, 1922, to market the invention, <b>with</b> <b>Bush</b> and Smith among its five directors. The venture made Bush wealthy, and the company, now known as Raytheon, ultimately became a large electronics company and defense contractor.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Bush {{established}} Arbusto Energy, a small {{oil exploration}} company, {{although it did}} not begin operations until the following year. He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., <b>with</b> <b>Bush</b> becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8807, {{creating}} the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), <b>with</b> <b>Bush</b> as its director personally responsible to the president. The new organisation subsumed the NDRC, now chaired by James B. Conant. The Uranium Committee became the Uranium Section of the OSRD, which was soon renamed the S-1 Section for security reasons. To the S-1 Section, Bush added Samuel K. Allison, Breit, Edward U. Condon, Lloyd P. Smith and Henry D. Smyth; Gunn was dropped {{in line with}} an NDRC policy not to have Army or Navy personnel in the sections. Briggs remained the chairman, with Pegram as the vice chairman.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} the loss in the Rose Bowl, Reggie Bush {{announced}} his plans to skip his senior season and declare for the 2006 NFL Draft. Along <b>with</b> <b>Bush,</b> ten other Trojans were drafted. Bush was the first Trojan selected and the second overall pick by New Orleans, while 2004 Heisman-winner, Matt Leinart, was taken tenth overall by Arizona. Three players were taken in the second round, Winston Justice by Philadelphia, Taitusi Lutui by Arizona, and LenDale White by Tennessee, and two more were taken in the third round, Frostee Rucker to Cincinnati and Dominique Byrd by St. Louis to end {{the first day of}} the draft. On the second day, Darnell Bing was taken in the fourth round by Oakland, David Kirtman taken in the fifth round by Seattle, LaJuan Ramsey taken in the sixth by Philadelphia, and, finally, Fred Matua was taken in the seventh by Detroit to end the Trojans' draft day.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{soon became}} {{dissatisfied}} with the dilatory way the project was run, with its indecisiveness over the selection of sites for the pilot plants. He was particularly disturbed at the allocation of an AA-3 priority, which would delay completion of the pilot plants by three months. Bush complained about these problems to Bundy and Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson. Major General Brehon B. Somervell, {{the commander of the}} army's Services of Supply, appointed Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves as project director in September. Within days of taking over, Groves approved the proposed site at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and obtained a AAA priority. At a meeting in Stimson's office on September 23 attended by Bundy, Bush, Conant, Groves, Marshall Somervell and Stimson, Bush put forward his proposal for steering the project by a small committee answerable to the Top Policy Group. The meeting agreed <b>with</b> <b>Bush,</b> and created a Military Policy Committee chaired by him, with Somervell's chief of staff, Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer, representing the army, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell representing the navy.|$|E
5|$|Bush was displeased {{with being}} rushed into making the second album. She set {{up her own}} {{publishing}} company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain complete control over her work. Members of her family, along <b>with</b> <b>Bush</b> herself, composed the company's board of directors. Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour. The tour, named The Tour of Life, began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. This live show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician Simon Drake. Typical of her determination to have creative control, {{she was involved in}} every aspect of the production, choreography, set design and staff recruitment for the show. The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her intention to dance as she sang, her sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a radio microphone to fashion the first headset microphone to be used by a rock performer since the Swedish group the Spotnicks used a very primitive version in the early 1960s.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} days of the complex, the entire area was covered <b>with</b> wild <b>bushes</b> and trees. Devotees had to make way through the bushes to reach the temple.

5|$|The German {{invasion}} of Belgium in May 1940 generated {{concern over the}} fate of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo, the world's largest source; the subsequent Battle of France created alarm in the administration over the direction the war was taking. On June 12, 1940, Bush and Harry Hopkins went to the president with a proposal to create a National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) to coordinate defense-related research. The NDRC was formally created on June 27, 1940, <b>with</b> <b>Bush</b> as its chairman. It immediately absorbed the Advisory Committee on Uranium, which was indeed one of its purposes. Bush immediately reorganised the Advisory Committee on Uranium as the NDRC Committee on Uranium, reporting directly to him. Briggs remained chairman, but Hoover and Adamson were dropped from its membership, while Tuve, Pegram, Beams, Gunn, and Urey were added. For security reasons, no foreign-born scientists were appointed to the Uranium Committee. Publication of research into uranium, fission and isotope separation was now banned.|$|E

According to the organization's communications director, John Kartch, the meeting was one of several gatherings <b>with</b> <b>Bush</b> sponsored by ATR. On the same day, the chief of the Louisiana Coushattas also attended an ATR-sponsored gathering <b>with</b> <b>Bush.</b> The Coushattas also gave $25,000 to ATR soon before the event.|$|E
25|$|Abramoff {{asked for}} $9 million in 2003 from the {{president}} of Gabon, Omar Bongo, to arrange a meeting <b>with</b> <b>Bush</b> and directed his fees to an Abramoff-controlled lobbying firm, GrassRoots Interactive. Bongo did meet <b>with</b> <b>Bush</b> in the Oval Office on May 26, 2004. There has been no evidence in the public record that Abramoff had any role in organizing the meeting, or that he received any money or had a signed contract with Gabon.|$|E
