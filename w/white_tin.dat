They {{then began to}} cover the tin glaze with a coat of clear glaze which gave depth to the fired surface and smoothness to cobalt blues, ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} {{elemental}} tin (Sn), which is malleable near ambient temperatures but is brittle when cooled. This change in mechanical properties due to existence {{of its two}} major allotropes, α- and β-tin. The two allotropes that are encountered at normal pressure and temperature, α-tin and β-tin, are more commonly known as gray tin and <b>white</b> <b>tin</b> respectively. Two more allotropes, γ and σ, exist at temperatures above 161°C and pressures above several GPa. <b>White</b> <b>tin</b> is metallic, and is the stable crystalline form at or above room temperature. Below 13.2°C, tin exists in the gray form, which has a diamond cubic crystal structure, similar to diamond, silicon or germanium. Gray tin has no metallic properties at all, is a dull gray powdery material, and has few uses, other than a few specialized semiconductor applications. Although the α–β transformation temperature of tin is nominally 13.2°C, impurities (e.g. Al, Zn, etc.) lower the transition temperature well below 0°C, and upon addition of Sb or Bi the transformation may not occur at all.|$|E
25|$|The JNF {{was founded}} at the Fifth Zionist Congress in Basel in 1901 with Theodor Herzl's support {{based on the}} {{proposal}} of a German Jewish mathematician, Zvi Hermann Schapira. In its early years, the organization was headed by the Jewish industrialist Johann Kremenezky. Early land purchases were completed in Judea and the Lower Galilee. In 1909, the JNF {{played a central role}} in the founding of Tel Aviv. The establishment of the “Olive Tree Fund” marked the beginning of Diaspora support of afforestation efforts. The Blue Box (known in Yiddish as a pushke) has been part of the JNF since its inception, symbolizing the partnership between Israel and the Diaspora. In the period between the two world wars, about one million of these blue and <b>white</b> <b>tin</b> collection boxes could be found in Jewish homes throughout the world. From 1902 until the late 1940s, the JNF sold JNF stamps to raise money. For a brief period in May 1948, JNF stamps were used as postage stamps during the transition from Palestine to Israel.|$|E

60|$|But {{there were}} no {{particular}} pools in that river. It was a succession of pools, and fish swarmed in all of them. There were at least fifteen different species which nothing short of an ichthyologist could enumerate correctly.

500|$|Tin, for example, has two allotropes: tetragonal [...] "white" [...] β-tin and cubic [...] "grey" [...] α-tin. <b>White</b> <b>tin</b> {{is a very}} shiny, ductile and {{malleable}} metal.

It is the stable form below 13.2°C and has an electrical conductivity of between (2–5) × 102S·cm−1 (~1/250th that of <b>white</b> <b>tin).</b> Grey tin has the same crystalline structure as that of diamond. It behaves as a semiconductor (with a band gap of 0.08eV), but has the electronic band structure of a semimetal.

2500|$|Although it {{was once}} a large and {{important}} mine, there are no known plans of its extensive underground workings, and there are few extant records of its output of tin ore.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of tin pest {{has been known}} for hundreds of years. It was observed in pewter in the 18 th century.

The “normal ” <b>white</b> (beta) <b>tin,</b> with a density of 7. 31 g/cm 2, is slowly converted into gray (alpha) tin with a much lower density of 5. 77 g/cm 2.

40|$|Tin-rich organ pipes {{are often}} {{affected}} by localised {{deterioration in the}} form of grey pustules, pinholes, cracks and exfoliations at the surface. Two main types of decay of tin-base materials that might have a similar appearance, i. e. the surface of the object covered with dark grey pustules, are known. The first is the allotropic transformation of <b>white</b> metallic <b>tin</b> into grey tin, the so-called tin-pest The second form of decay is due to corrosion {{in the form of}} localised oxidation of tin. The identification of the causes of deterioration is of main concern because, whereas oxidised material can be treated, an object that suffers tin pest cannot be reconstituted. In the present paper the results of investigations on ancient tin-rich organ pipes affected by localised degradation are presented. The study of the composition and the microstructure of the pipes has been coupled with the results of analyses on the corrosion products. It was shown that oxidation clearly has {{a significant role in the}} deterioration of tin pipes, but it was not possible to establish if the allotropic transformation took place or not, because of the low probability of detecting the residual grey tin...|$|R
30|$|An {{unidentified}} yellow pigment {{was found}} in a single yellow robe on one painting in the manuscript produced in Bukhara but altered in India, Table  1, # 28. XRF analysis showed this yellow contains high levels of lead and tin. FTIR analysis of a small sample did not produce a match for any yellow pigment, including the historic pigment lead–tin yellow. Despite widespread use in European painting from the 15 th to 17 th centuries [30], lead–tin yellow has not been reported in any Indian or Islamic work. An alternative possibility might be use of a yellow lead compound such as litharge or massicot mixed with a <b>tin</b> <b>white.</b> Further work is required to identify this yellow pigment and determine whether this was a Mughal alteration.|$|R
