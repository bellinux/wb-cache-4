5|$|Upon Mowry's death, {{his wife}} {{retained}} the house until {{selling it to}} Stephen Paine on September 5, 1671. Paine conveyed it to Samuel Whipple who resided in the house {{until his death in}} 1711. Upon his death the house was recorded as having a two-story lean-to.

Hope Whipple <b>would</b> <b>marry</b> Robert Currie and upon her death, Robert Currie <b>would</b> <b>marry</b> her sister Abigail Whipple, and upon her death fell to Robert Currie's ownership. In 1737, Currie sold the house to William Smith, Job Whipple and John Whipple. It remained in the Whipple family until 1761 when it was sold to Captain Joseph Owen. The house would take its final name, the Abbott House, from Thomas Abbott who married Joseph Owen's daughter and resided in the house until his death in 1826. The Mowry Tavern was allegedly one of only five buildings not burned by the Indians during King Philip's War. It is believed that it was spared because Roger Williams, a friend of the Indians, held Christian worship services in the building. The house was located on Abbott Street adjacent to the North Burial Ground. The entire structure was demolished in 1900 to construct a triple decker tenement house. At the time of its demolition, it was the oldest house in Providence.|$|E
