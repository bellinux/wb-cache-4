5|$|Parker {{published}} in 1572 a work entitled De Antiquitate Britannicae Ecclesiae & Priuilegiis Ecclesiae Canuariensis, cum Archiepiscopis eiusdem 70, {{which is the}} first privately printed work to appear in English. Although Parker claimed in a letter that he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> it is likely that at the very least Joscelyn did most of the research, and the manuscript of the work, which is now Vitellius E xiv, is largely in his handwriting. Further, Parker's son, after the archbishop's death, noted beside the bequest notation for Joscelyn's brother Thomas that John Joscelyn <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of the work.|$|E

5|$|Nothhelm died on 17 October 739. and {{was buried}} in Canterbury Cathedral. He is {{considered}} a saint, and his feast day is 17 October. The antiquaries and writers John Leland, John Bale, and Thomas Tanner all felt that Nothhelm <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of various works, but later research has shown them to be authored by other writers. A verse eulogy for Nothhelm, of uncertain date, survives in a 16th-century manuscript now at the Lambeth Palace library.|$|E

5|$|With a {{reputation}} as a storyteller, Wiesenthal <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of several memoirs containing tales that are only loosely based on actual events. In particular, he exaggerated his role in the capture of Eichmann in 1960. Wiesenthal died in his sleep at age 96 in Vienna on 20 September 2005 and was buried in the city of Herzliya in Israel. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, located in Los Angeles, is named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} chronicles that mention Breton's death {{also note that}} he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of a legal {{treatise}} entitled le Bretoun, but this cannot be the surviving work called Britton, {{at least not in}} the current form, as that work discusses laws composed 15 years after Breton's death. It is unclear why he was credited with the work, and whether this attribution is just a confusion of Breton with the real author or if he did in fact author the work, which was later revised. The fact that the Britton is written in French, not Latin, and that it contains little information about the theory of law, being mostly concerned with the practical application of laws, points rather strongly to an author who was a royal justice, which Breton was.|$|E
5|$|After Chickamauga, Rosecrans and his Army of the Cumberland {{retreated to}} {{fortified}} Chattanooga. Bragg held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, {{but refused to}} take any further action as the Union forces there were reinforced by Ulysses S. Grant and reopened a tenuous supply line. Many of Bragg's subordinates, including Buckner, advocated that Bragg be relieved of command. Thomas L. Connelly, historian of the Army of Tennessee, believes that Buckner <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of the anti-Bragg letter sent by the generals to President Jefferson Davis. Bragg retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{presence}} of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of {{the second half of the}} History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series. He takes the view that the vast stylistic differences between the two halves of the History means they cannot have been written by the same author.|$|E
5|$|In United States v.

The Court recounted the history of criminal severance in English law, and concluded that the practice merely arose to prevent co-defendants from each using their peremptory challenges to deplete the venire such that too few jurors remained for trial. Justice Story <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of the opinion of the Court, as well as a substantially similar opinion in the Massachusetts circuit court below.|$|E
