Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> able to work every other day.|$|E
5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E

Dawkins states: [...] "the main residual reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think it was when I realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design.

500|$|According to Icelandic legend, the Lodsilungur is a furry trout {{that is the}} {{creation}} of demons and giants. The Lodsilungur are described as inedible fish that overwhelm rivers and are a form of punishment for human wickedness. In 1900, The Scottish Review featured an account of the Lodsilungur as a poisonous [...] "Shaggy trout" [...] of northern Iceland. In 1854, a shaggy trout was [...] "cast on shore at Svina-vatn" [...] and featured in an 1855 illustration in Nordri, a newspaper. It was described as having a reddish hair on its lower jaw and neck, sides and fins, but the writer of the Nordri article did not specifically identify it by name. Sjón, a popular Icelandic writer, became obsessed with the folk tale when he was nine. Sjón recounted that if a man were to eat the furry trout he would become pregnant and that his scrotum would have to be cut open to deliver the baby. Sjón noted that the story [...] "might explain <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> later propelled towards surrealism." ...|$|E

But then, for me it assumed an enormous level of responsibility to the people I met, to the issue, to the community." [...] He met thousands of people, but only a few agreed to appear in the film, as most were too frightened of being expelled from their community. Even when interviewing those who did agree to appear, DuBowski had to hide his film equipment so their neighbors would not know that they had agreed to take part. As a result, the documentary took six years to complete.|$|E

500|$|On 3 September 1939, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain {{announced}} {{the commencement of}} war with Nazi Germany. The following day, the Viceroy, Lord Linlithgow, without consulting Indian political leaders, announced that India had entered the war along with Britain. There were widespread protests in India. After meeting with Jinnah and with Gandhi, Linlithgow announced that negotiations on self-government were suspended {{for the duration of}} the war. The Congress on 14 September demanded immediate independence with a constituent assembly to decide a constitution; when this was refused, its eight provincial governments resigned on 10 November and governors in those provinces thereafter ruled by decree for the remainder of the war. [...] Jinnah, on the other hand, was more willing to accommodate the British, and they in turn increasingly recognised him and the League as the representatives of India's Muslims. Jinnah later stated, [...] "after the war began, ... I was treated on the same basis as Mr. Gandhi. I was wonderstruck <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> promoted and given a place side by side with Mr. Gandhi." [...] Although the League did not actively support the British war effort, neither did they try to obstruct it.|$|E

He also discussed his attempt to focus on his original inspiration to produce music, stating [...] "The sound and feel of my music {{are going to be}} affected by what motivates me to do it". On his visit to South Carolina, D'Angelo stated that he [...] "went through this runnel, through gospel, blues, and a lot of old soul, old James Brown, early, early Sly and the Family Stone, and a lot of Jimi Hendrix", and [...] "I learned a lot about music, myself, and where I want to go musically". In the same interview, he cited the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. as having a great effect on him during the period.

Cool noted that, [...] "It's got the sarcasm, it's got the snottiness, but it's got a little {{light at the end}} of the tunnel." [...] Warning also contains more explicitly political themes, as exemplified by tracks such as [...] "Minority". [...] This was inspired by Armstrong's fear that presidential nominee Al Gore was going to lose the 2000 U.S. presidential election and that [...] "someone really conservative" [...] would take office. He recalled, [...] "We've always tried to keep an ear to the ground and keep our eyes open to what's going on...that's one reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really taking my time writing songs to really [...] Instead of just writing an overly knee-jerk reaction." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the lyrics of [...] "Minority" [...] serve as [...] "a reminder of the youthful mentality of Green Day's early work". [...] "Misery" [...] tells various stories in its verses, all of which end unhappily. The first verse centers on a girl named Virginia who was a [...] "lot lizard", a term for a prostitute who exchanges sex for money with truck drivers at interstate highway truck stops. [...] "Blood, Sex and Booze" [...] explores the subject of sadomasochism.|$|E
500|$|According to Rod Roddewig, a {{contemporary}} of Wilt's, Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer. Every time Chamberlain {{went to bed}} with a different woman, he put a check in his Day-Timer. Over a 10-day period, there were 23 checks in the book, {{which would be a}} rate of 2.3 women per day. Chamberlain divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence. In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity, Chamberlain later emphasized that [...] "the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That's the reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> single." [...] In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate {{at the time of his}} escapades, and warned other men who admired him for it, closing with the words: [...] "With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, I have learned in my life I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying." [...] Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children. However, in 2015 a man named Aaron Levi came forward claiming to be Chamberlain's son based on non-identifying papers from his adoption and information from his biological mother. Chamberlain's sister refused to provide DNA evidence for testing, so Levi's claim is not conclusive.|$|E

500|$|Two {{directors}} {{were assigned to}} the series – Ken Hannam and Christopher Barry. Hannam had previously directed such series as Colditz and Paul Temple while Barry had worked extensively on Doctor Who, having directed some 31 episodes at the time, including the stories The Dæmons and The Mutants for Letts and Dicks, as well as episodes of Out of the Unknown, Paul Temple and The Onedin Line. [...] Hannam and Barry alternated directing the episodes between them with filming on Moonbase 3 beginning on 24 April 1973 at the BBC film studios in Ealing. The Ealing filming mainly centred around the scenes set on the lunar surface which proved a difficult experience for the actors. Star Donald Houston told the Radio Times that the spacesuits got [...] "hot and claustrophobic. In the end they had to have oxygen standing by. [...] the dust rose in clouds and the cameramen all wore surgical masks. The actors just choked". [...] Recalling his guest appearance on Moonbase 3, in the episode [...] "Behemoth", Peter Miles told TV Zone in 1991 that he was [...] "asked to be like a gazelle and leap as I came down the hillock in full astronaut gear. [...] The tech crew wondered <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> steaming up furiously in my astronaut's head. They'd forgotten to put air holes into the helmet. [...] I said, 'Help help! Help help! I'm not breathing folks!' They took the helmet off before drilling the holes or I wouldn't be here now". [...] Filming continued at Ealing until 30 May 1973 before production moved to BBC Television Centre for the remaining scenes, mostly those set inside the moonbase, which would be recorded on videotape beginning on 18 June 1973. The episodes were recorded in a different order than that in which they were broadcast with [...] "Departure and Arrival" [...] recorded first followed by [...] "Castor and Pollux", [...] "Behemoth", [...] "View of a Dead Planet", [...] "Outsiders" [...] and, lastly, [...] "Achilles Heel" [...] with recording wrapping on 15 August 1973. [...] Music was provided by Dudley Simpson who, at this time, was the regular composer on Doctor Who. Simpson composed the main title theme that accompanied the opening and closing credits as well as approximately 60 minutes of incidental music.|$|E
500|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired {{out of law school}} as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979. [...] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: [...] "There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem." [...] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court. [...] Working in the trial division, she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders. She also worked on cases involving police brutality. She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses. [...] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate. [...] In 1983 in her highest profile case she helped convict the [...] "Tarzan Murderer" [...] (who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason). [...] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: [...] "No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous." [...] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: [...] "The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other." [...] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time. [...] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness. [...] One of her job evaluations labelled her a [...] "potential superstar". Morgenthau later described her as [...] "smart, hard-working, [...] a lot of common sense," [...] and as a [...] "fearless and effective prosecutor." [...] She stayed a typical length of time in the post and had a common reaction to the job: [...] "After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life." ...|$|E
