40|$|Abstract: This survey {{investigated}} {{the willingness to}} <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> an improved water quality and reliability in Chobe ward in Maun. On average, 54 % of the households are <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality. It is therefore apparent that Chobe Ward, Maun residents in general regard water as an economic good as they are <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> its provision. Those with a higher income were <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> an improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand for an improved environmental quality increases with income. The older the person the more they are <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality and reliability. Larger families are not <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> an improved provision of water services. Also, educated people are lesser <b>willing</b> to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality and reliability...|$|R

Medium-rich households have the highest mean MWTP for grazing compared to poor and rich households.

25|$|As {{with all}} HMOs—no matter {{whether a person}} is on Medicare or not—persons who enroll in a Medicare Advantage HMO cannot use certain {{specialist}} physicians or out-of-network providers without prior authorization from the HMO, except in emergencies. In almost all Medicare Advantage plans—HMO or otherwise—the beneficiary must choose a primary care physician (PCP) who will provide the referrals and the beneficiary must confirm that the plan authorizes the visit to which the beneficiary was referred by the PCP. As with all HMOs, {{this can be a}} problem {{for people who want to}} use out of network specialists or who are hospitalized and are forced to use out-of-network doctors while in the hospital. Enrolling in a Medicare Advantage PPO, if available, can help solve this dilemma, because many Medicare Advantage PPO plans permit a subscriber to use any physician or hospital without prior authorization, but at a somewhat higher expense. By law, however, if a patient's in-network physician orders tests or procedures or refers a patient to a specialist that are not available or provided by any in-network facility or specialist's office, the Medicare Advantage plan <b>will</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the patient's procedures or services at an out-of-network location and charge in-network cost-sharing to the patient, so long as the necessary services are normally covered by the plan (the beneficiary should still make sure he or she has authorization however).|$|E
