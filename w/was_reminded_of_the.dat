Journalists in the United States were reporting on {{the invasion}} within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting {{at his home in}} Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly troubling to Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and {{would not be able to}} hold back the invasion on its own. He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict.|$|E

Marie was found guilty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the nearby town of Tulle.|$|E

While living there, he learns about South American and Caribbean spiritualism, and meets Agliè, an elderly man who implies {{that he is the}} mystical Comte de Saint-Germain. Agliè has a {{seemingly}} infinite supply of knowledge about things concerning the Occult. While in Brazil, Casaubon receives a letter from Belbo about attending a meeting of occultists. At the meeting Belbo <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colonel's conspiracy theory by the words of a young woman who was apparently in a trance. Casaubon and Amparo also attend an occult event in Brazil, an Umbanda rite. During the ritual Amparo falls into a trance herself, an experience she finds deeply disturbing and embarrassing, as she is Marxist by ideology and as such disbelieves and shuns spiritual and religious experiences. Her relationship with Casaubon falls apart, and he returns to Italy.|$|E

[...] In his view, the dishonorable people were the rumormongers, {{in part because he}} <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacks that had been made, {{particularly}} in the 1828 election, against his wife, Rachel Jackson, over the circumstances of their marriage. Jackson also believed that John Calhoun fanned the flames of the controversy as a way to gain political leverage for a growing anti-Jackson coalition. Duff Green, a Calhoun protégé and editor of the United States Telegraph, accused Eaton of secretly working to have pro-Calhoun cabinet members Samuel D. Ingham (Treasury) and John Branch (Navy) removed from their positions.|$|E

500|$|The area {{underneath}} the London Eye where the Doctor and Rose confront the Nestene Consciousness was filmed in an unused paper mill in Grangetown, Cardiff. It underwent steam cleaning {{because there were}} such high health and safety concerns. They were only permitted to film for three days, which required {{that some of the}} sequence be cut: originally, there was to be another Auton Mickey involved. Special effects producer Mike Tucker <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun when reading the scene in which the Nestene's lair is blown up, and sought to display it as a major effect. The production team built a one-sixth scale model of the warehouse where the explosions were filmed. Tucker did a model explosion for the destruction of Henrik's as well, although that was only for the roof; the rest was done by CGI. The production team considered doing the explosion practically, but that would have been too expensive. In the original script, Rose's first experience of seeing the TARDIS interior was shared with the audience. Director Keith Boak, however, wanted her to exit and run around the TARDIS before entering again, at which point the interior would be revealed to the audience. This change was eventually embraced by the executive producers. Davies remarked that he originally wanted to take Rose and the audience inside the TARDIS in all one shot, but this was not a feasible with the budget. This effect would later be accomplished in the 2012 Christmas special, [...] "The Snowmen".|$|E
500|$|Initially {{only the}} Public Ledger {{reported}} on the case, but once it became known that noblemen had taken an interest and visited the ghost at Mr Bray's house on 14January, the story {{began to appear in}} other newspapers. [...] The St. James's Chronicle and the London Chronicle printed reports from 16–19 January (the latter the more sceptical of the two), and Lloyd's Evening Post from 18–20 January. [...] The story spread across London and by the middle of January the crowds gathered outside the property were such that Cock Lane was rendered impassable. [...] Parsons charged visitors an entrance fee to [...] "talk" [...] with the ghost, which, it was reported, did not disappoint. [...] After receiving several requests to intercede, Samuel Fludyer, Lord Mayor of London, was on 23January approached by Alderman Gosling, John Moore and Parsons. [...] They told him of their experiences but Fludyer <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> then recent case of fraudster Elizabeth Canning and refused to have Kent or Parsons arrested (on charges of murder and conspiracy respectively). [...] Instead, against a backdrop of hysteria caused in part by the newspapers' relentless reporting of the case, he ordered that Elizabeth be tested at Aldrich's house. [...] Meanwhile, Elizabeth was again the subject of study, in two séances held 23–24January. [...] Parsons accepted the Lord Mayor's decision, but asked that [...] "some persons connected with the girl might be permitted to be there, to divert her in the day-time". [...] This was refused, as were two similar requests, Aldrich and Penn insisting that they would accept only [...] "any person or persons, of strict character and reputation, who are housekeepers". [...] Aldrich and Penn's account of their negotiations with Parsons clearly perturbed the clerk, as he defended his actions in the Public Ledger. [...] This prompted Aldrich and Penn to issue a pointed retort in Lloyd's Evening Post: [...] "We are greatly puzzled to find Mr. Parsons asserting that he hath been always willing to deliver up the child, when he refused a gentleman on Wednesday evening the 20th inst.

And perhaps it was the simplicity of composition, entirely devoid of flourishes or decoration — classical, in a word — that made me appreciate all the more pleasure of savoring the very spirit of Vigo's work, almost violent, certainly tormented, feverish, brimming with ideas and truculent fantasy, with virulent, even demonic and yet constantly human romanticism." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aśvajit's brief statement, {{known as}} the Ye Dharma Hetu stanza, has {{traditionally}} {{been described as the}} essence of the Buddhist teaching, and is the most inscribed verse throughout the Buddhist world. It can be found in all Buddhist schools, is engraved in many materials, can be found on many Buddha statues and stūpas (structures with relics), and is used in their consecration rituals. According to Indologist Oldenberg and translator Thanissaro Bhikkhu, the verses were recommended in one of Emperor Asoka's edicts as subject of study and reflection. The role of the stanza is not completely understood by scholars. Apart from the complex nature of the statement, it has also been noted it has not anywhere been attributed to the Buddha in this form, which indicates it was Aśvajit's own summary or paraphrasing. Indologist T.W. Rhys Davids believed the brief poem may have made a special impression on Maudgalyāyana and Sariputta, because of the emphasis on causation typical for Buddhism. Philosopher Paul Carus explained that the stanza was a bold and iconoclastic response to Brahmanic traditions, as it [...] "repudiates miracles of supernatural interference by unreservedly recognising the law of cause and effect as irrefragable", [...] whereas Japanese Zen teacher Suzuki <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experience that is beyond the intellect, [...] "in which one idea follows another in sequence finally to terminate in conclusion or judgment".|$|E
