[...] Poe then provides a narrative example where Dupin explains how he knew the narrator <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> actor Chantilly. Dupin then applies his method to the solving of this crime.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2015, {{the song}} [...] "Help Is Coming" [...] from the Afterglow album, was {{released}} as a download and limited edition 7" [...] single {{to raise money}} for the charity Save the Children. The B-side, [...] "Anthem", was a previously unreleased track that was initially recorded in 1995, with the final vocal added in 2015. [...] The money will be used to provide shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene for refugees in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq. Neil Finn said of [...] "Help Is Coming"..."It was always a song about refugees, even if at the time I <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> immigrants setting off on ships from Europe to America, looking for a better life for their families. There is such a huge scale and urgency to the current refugee crises that barely a day goes by without some crushing image or news account to confront us. We can't be silent any more." ...|$|E
2500|$|The music {{came from}} Brian Wilson's first {{psychedelic}} experience. He was quoted saying in 1986, [...] " [...] something I'm {{very proud of}} in a sense because it represents the Beach Boys really greatest record production we’ve ever made. It goes back to 1965 when I was sitting in my apartment, wondering {{how to write a}} song about girls, because I love girls. I mean, everybody loves girls." [...] He added in 2007, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> music from cowboy movies. And I sat down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an hour. I got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came pretty fast after that." [...] Inspiration came from the rhythm of [...] "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". In 2015, he explained: [...] "'California Girls' had that beat — it's called a shuffle beat — and that's definitely a Bach influence." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{the second}} single {{released}} from the album. It was the first song that she and Naughty Boy had worked together on and she {{pointed out that the}} song {{has nothing to do with}} her father. It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while trying to get into the music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how that one thing you can keep returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song she <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>The</b> Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the people on that show, and that they are desperate enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E

60|$|Marilla, {{walking home}} one late April evening from an Aid meeting, {{realized}} that the winter was over and gone with the thrill of delight that spring never fails {{to bring to the}} oldest and saddest {{as well as to the}} youngest and merriest. Marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings. She probably imagined that she <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Aids and their missionary box and the new carpet for the vestry room, but under these reflections was a harmonious consciousness of red fields smoking into pale-purply mists in the declining sun, of long, sharp-pointed fir shadows falling over the meadow beyond the brook, of still, crimson-budded maples around a mirrorlike wood pool, of a wakening in the world and a stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod. The spring was abroad in the land and Marilla's sober, middle-aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep, primal gladness.|$|E

60|$|Mike went. Mr Waller {{was still}} sitting staring out across the aisle. There was {{something}} more than a little gruesome in the sight of him. He wore a crushed, beaten look, as if all the life and fight had gone out of him. A customer came to the desk to cash a cheque. The cashier shovelled the money to him under the bars with the air of one whose mind is elsewhere. Mike could guess what he was feeling, and what he <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>The</b> fact that the snub-nosed Edward was, without exception, the most repulsive small boy he had ever met in this world, where repulsive small boys crowd and jostle one another, did not interfere with his appreciation of the cashier's state of mind. Mike's was essentially a sympathetic character. He had the gift of intuitive understanding, where people of whom he was fond were concerned. It was this which drew to him those who had intelligence enough to see beyond his sometimes rather forbidding manner, and to realize that his blunt speech was largely due to shyness. In spite of his prejudice against Edward, he could put himself into Mr Waller's place, and see the thing from his point of view.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't trouble you," [...] said Sir Richmond, [...] "with any long {{discourse}} on the ways of getting fuel in this country. But land as you know is owned in patches and stretches that were determined {{in the first place}} chiefly by agricultural necessities. When it was divided up among its present owners nobody <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> minerals beneath. But the lawyers settled long ago that the landowner owned his land right down to the centre of the earth. So we have the superficial landlord as coal owner trying to work his coal according to the superficial divisions, quite irrespective of the lie of the coal underneath. Each man goes for the coal under his own land in his own fashion. You get three shafts where one would suffice and none of them in the best possible place. You get the coal coming out of this point when it would be far more convenient to bring it out at that--miles away. You get boundary walls of coal between the estates, abandoned, left in the ground for ever. And each coal owner sells his coal in his own pettifogging manner... But you know of these things. You know too how we trail the coal all over the country, spoiling it as we trail it, until at last we get it into the silly coal scuttles beside the silly, wasteful, airpoisoning, fog-creating fireplace.|$|E
