5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E
5|$|Several {{films have}} been remade or {{influenced}} by Tiga Dara. A remake, Tiga Dara Mencari Cinta (Three Maidens Seek Love), {{was directed by}} Djun Saptohadi and released in 1980. This comedy starred Ingrid Fernandez, Nana Riwayatie, and Winny Aditya Dewi as three sisters <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> their father and face the trials and tribulations of dating. Eight years later, when Teguh Karya was directing Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta (Lover Left by the Train, 1989), he insisted that {{the cast and crew}} watch Tiga Dara in an attempt to transcend it. In Tempo, the writer Putu Wijaya later described Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta as seemingly trying to recapture the family and musical dynamics of Ismail's story. In 2004 a remake of Tiga Dara, to be directed by Rudi Soedjarwo and involve Dian Sastrowardoyo, Siti Nurhaliza, and Krisdayanti, was announced, though this production has not been realized.|$|E
25|$|Research has {{generated}} evidence that second-hand smoke causes {{the same problems}} as direct smoking, including lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and lung ailments such as emphysema, bronchitis, and asthma. Specifically, meta-analyses show that lifelong non-smokers with partners who smoke in the home have a 20–30% greater risk of lung cancer than non-smokers <b>who</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> non-smokers. Non-smokers exposed to cigarette smoke in the workplace have an increased lung cancer risk of 16–19%.|$|E
