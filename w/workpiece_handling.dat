50|$|The {{quality of}} a weld depends, besides the weld {{parameters}} which are important for the welding process (e.g. voltage, current, wire feed and weld speed) also mainly from the type of input of process energy and of the used filler material. The positioning of the torch exerts a direct influence on the material flow. The heat input for the melting of the component edges and the steady heat flow are, furthermore, directly connected with the torch guidance and exert substantical influence on the weld quality and on the resulting residual stresses.In fully mechanised and automated shielded gas welding, the inaccuracies of torch guidance, <b>workpiece</b> <b>handling,</b> groove preparation and thermal distortion are adding to the variations of the edge position and edge geometry. In fully mechanised welding, the information which {{is required for the}} weld quality is detected via sensors. Sensors are applied for checking the position of the component (detection of weld start and end of weld), for joint tracking and for the adaptation of the process parameters to changes of the joints/grooves. It is possible to use the sensors online (together/at the same time with the welding process) or offline (in a separate working step before welding). Sensors are mainly used in online joint tracking.|$|E

An actuator (3) is located between a robot hand (1) of the kinematic chain and the tool or object. A sensor (5) i. e. complementary MOS camera, is used to detect a relative movement between the object and tool or the robot hand. A deviation of an actual movement path of the tool, the object or the robot hand to a target movement path is counteracted by maintaining the tool or the object with the actuator.

40|$|For {{purposes}} of this document, metalworking fluids (MWFs) are fluids used during machining and grinding to prolong the lift of the tool, carry away debris, and protect the surfaces of work pieces. These fluids reduce friction between the currint tool and the work surface, reduce wear and galling, protect surface characteristics, reduce surface adhesion or welding and carry away generated heat. Workers can be exposed to MWFs by inhaling aerosols (mists) and by skin contact with the fluid. Skin contact occurs by dipping the hands into the fluid, splashes, or <b>handling</b> <b>workpieces</b> coated with the fluids. The amount of mist generated (and the resulting level of exposure) depends on many factors: the type of MWF and its application process; the MWF temperature, the specific machining or grinding operation; the presence of splash guarding; {{and the effectiveness of}} the ventilation system in capturing and removing the mist. Substantial scientific evidence indicates that workers currently exposed to MWF aerosols have an increased risk of respiratory [lung] and skin diseases. These health effects vary based on the type of MWF, route of exposure, concentration, and length of exposure. To reduce the potential health risks associated with occupational exposures to metalworking fluids (MWFs), NIOSH recommends an exposure limit (REL) for MWF aerosol of penetrates below the larnyx in the respiratory system) as a time-weighted average (TWA) concentration for up to 10 hours per day during a 40 -hour work week. Because the limited availability of thoracic samplers, measurement of total particulate mass is an acceptable substitute (see footnote 1 for details). The REL for total particulate mass is 0. 5 mg/m 1. The REL of 0. 4 mg/m 3 is based on four major considerations: the adverse respiratory health effects of MWF exposure; the selection of an index for measuring MWF aerosol exposure; the universal applicability of the REL to all types of MWFs; and, the technological feasibility of the REL. NIOSH also recommends {{the development and implementation of}} occupational safety and health programs, engineering controls, fluid management and medical monitoring to reduce MWF exposures. These recommendations are intended to prevent or greatly reduce respiratory disorders causally associated with MWF exposure. Whenever possible, reduce MWF aerosol levels below 0. 4 mg/m 3 (thoracic particulate mass) because some workers have developed work-related asthma or hypersensitivity pneumonitis at MWF exposures below the NIOSH recommended exposure level. It is also important to limit exposure levels based on the association between some past MWF exposures and various cancers and because the minimization of exposures by skin contact helps prevent allergic and irritant skin disorders.

40|$|Of {{the many}} {{machining}} processes used in manufacturing to cut metals and non-metals, laser cutting offers unique advantages {{in terms of}} cut quality, speed, absence of tool wear and minimal or no clamping of parts. In industry, the lasers used for cutting are CO 2 (carbon dioxide) and Nd:YAG (Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminium Garnet) lasers each with their own characteristic output properties such as wavelength, power) mode of operation and beam quality. These properties, together with the optical and thermophysical properties of workpiece material and <b>workpiece</b> <b>handling</b> system, control and determine the cutting performance of any material. Presented in this paper are laser, materials and system properties, and parameters influencing the cutting of metals in particular. The operation of the CO 2 and Nd:YAG lasers and their dominant features is also discussed. The cutting mechanism is {{described in terms of}} the energy balance within the workpiece. This is then used to show the difficulties with cutting thick (> 10 mm) steel plate with a laser, leading into a number of novel laser methods explored for the cutting of thick plates.

The task comprises mateial system (resist/substrate) and structure profile (binary and 3 D multilevel or analogue) related specified etching process development. Included is the characterisation by AFM and SEM of the transferred structure profiles, the roughness and the optimisation of the former and the minimisation of the latter respectively by process parameter variation. This developmental work does also include process related modification of the hardware used (e. g. ion beam sources, <b>workpiece</b> <b>handling,</b> etc.). Results obtained are - eight level binary structures transferred by RIBE into quartz, - progress in etch process simulation program development and testing (two materials), - estimation of process parameters for the RIBE 3 D analogue pattern transfer into quartz, - 3 D analogue structure transfer into quartz and Si respectively but at {{this time with a}} low level of profile control.

40|$|When steel drills, crankshafts, or {{gear wheels}} are hardened, the frames which hold the {{workpieces}} {{are subject to}} high thermal stress. They have to withstand temperatures of up to 1300 deg C and changes in temperature of up to 300 degrees per second. Even special highquality heat-resistant steels age rapidly under those conditions. But now a material used in aerospace applications could help bring about a drastic reduction in the high process costs of heat treatment. Carbon-fibre-reinforced carbon (CFRC) is twenty times stronger than steel at 1 000 deg C. Unlike metals, its strength increases at higher temperatures. However, the great advantage of the new material is its low weight. "CFRC frames are {{at least five times}} lighter than conventional steel frames. As a result, the net capacity of the workpiece holders and batch loaders can often be increased by up to 100 per cent"(explains Jörg Demmel, an engineer at the Fraunhofer Technology Development Group (TEG) in Stuttgart. That reduce s the costs per part considerably, because better use is made of the heat-treatment furnaces and the energy consumption is then lower. Another advantage is that CFRC hardly expands on heating. Whereas a steel part changes its length by about 15 mm per metre when heated from 20 degree to 1000 degree, CFRC does not change its size or shape noticable. "The frames remain distortion-free, even under large changes in temperature" says Demmel; "That makes it much easier to automate the <b>workpiece</b> <b>handling</b> of the heat treatment". Altogether, the process costs can be reduced by up to 50 per cent by using CFRC workpiece holders. In collaboration with the Fraunhofer Institute for the Mechanics of Materials (IWM), the TEG has now optimized the CFRC constructions and successfully employed them in several industrial applications. The scientists are now engaged in automating the process...|$|E
