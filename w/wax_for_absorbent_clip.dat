40|$|AbstractStudies {{have been}} {{conducted}} to find new <b>absorbents</b> <b>for</b> post-combustion CO 2 capture. To overcome the ILs’ limits and meanwhile take their advantages, the mixed amine+IL+H 2 O solutions as CO 2 capture absorbent were investigated in a CO 2 absorption/desorption loop setup. It was found that {{with an increase in}} IL concentration, the viscosity of the mixed solution rose while the energy required <b>for</b> <b>absorbent</b> regeneration decreased. In addition, no IL loss was detected and the amine loss per ton of captured CO 2 was considerably lower than that of aqueous amine solution. The viscosity of the best candidate of 30 wt% MEA+ 40 wt% [bmim][BF 4]+ 30 wt% H 2 O is close to the value of aqueous amine solution, indicating that the ionic liquid disadvantage of high viscosity can be overcome <b>for</b> <b>absorbent</b> delivery of CO 2 capture...|$|R

50|$|The primary reasons <b>for</b> <b>waxing</b> are {{to prevent}} water loss (making {{up for the}} removal in washing of the natural waxes in fruits that have them, {{particularly}} citrus but also, for example, apples) and thus retard shrinkage and spoilage, and to improve appearance. Dyes may be added to further enhance appearance, and sometimes fungicides. Fruits were waxed to cause fermentation {{as early as the}} 12th or the 13th century; commercial producers began waxing citrus to extend shelf life in the 1920s and 1930s. Aesthetics - consumer preference for shiny fruit - has since become the main reason. In addition to fruit, some vegetables can usefully be waxed, such as cassava; vegetables commonly waxed include cucumbers, swedes or rutabagas and green tomatoes. A distinction may be made between storage <b>wax,</b> pack-out <b>wax</b> (<b>for</b> immediate sale) and high-shine <b>wax</b> (<b>for</b> optimum attractiveness).|$|R

500|$|Skis {{designed}} for classic technique, both {{in track and}} in virgin snow, rely on a traction zone, called the [...] "grip zone" [...] or [...] "kick zone", underfoot. This comes either from a) texture, designed to slide forward but not backwards, that {{is built into the}} grip zone of waxless skis, or from applied devices, e.g. climbing skins, or b) from grip waxes. Grip waxes are classified according to their hardness: harder <b>waxes</b> are <b>for</b> colder and newer snow. An incorrect choice of grip <b>wax</b> <b>for</b> the snow conditions encountered may cause ski slippage (<b>wax</b> too hard <b>for</b> the conditions) or snow sticking to the grip zone (<b>wax</b> too soft <b>for</b> the conditions). Grip waxes generate grip by interacting with snow crystals, which vary with temperature, age and compaction. Hard grip waxes don't work well for snow which has metamorphosed to having coarse grains, whether icy or wet. In these conditions, skiers opt for a stickier substance, called klister.|$|R
