5|$|On 1 April 2010 Steorn {{opened an}} online {{development}} community, called the Steorn Knowledge Development Base (SKDB), which they said <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> their technology. Access was available only under licence on payment of a fee.|$|E
5|$|Planet Nine is a {{hypothetical}} large {{planet in the}} far outer Solar System, the gravitational effects of which <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the improbable orbital configuration {{of a group of}} trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) that orbit mostly beyond the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, {{the church}} could be {{identified}} with San Salvatore de Bordonia; a bordone was the staff borne by pilgrims coming to St. Peter's. These would have left their staffs in San Giacomo before entering Saint Peter, exactly as they did after completing the Way of St. James, and this fact <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> also the late dedication to Saint James.|$|E
6000|$|But {{what could}} she do? Had it been {{possible}} {{that she should be}} an hour alone with Lady Mason, she <b>would</b> have <b>explained</b> all this to her,--or if not all, <b>would</b> have <b>explained</b> much of it. But now, with no minutes to spare, how could she make this understood? [...] "But all that will not come to-day, will it, sir?" ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>would</b> not <b>explain</b> himself, but {{remained}} obstinately seated {{on his bed}} all the time I remained with him.|$|R
60|$|The vicar {{gave this}} explanation, {{much in the}} way a pedagogue <b>would</b> have <b>explained</b> the matter to a class.|$|R
5|$|Einstein {{concluded}} that each wave of frequency f {{is associated with}} a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck's constant. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Iazyges did not move west in their entirety, and that some of them stayed along the Sea of Azov, which <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the occasional surname of , however if this is true, the Iazyges that remained along the Sea of Azov are never mentioned again.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{right before}} Riddler and Two-face team up {{featured}} a little conversation with Dick and Bruce {{in the gym}} of the manor. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> why Dick suddenly has martial arts training. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
50|$|Torre <b>would</b> later <b>explain</b> the {{comments}} as being jestful {{and in good}} humor by Torre and Larry Bowa with Rodriguez.|$|R
30|$|H 3 Factors such as surface experience, age {{and surface}} {{properties}} <b>would</b> significantly <b>explain</b> players’ perceived links between playing surfaces and injury.|$|R
50|$|Outside the {{football}} world Ole Fritsen was a primary school teacher, which <b>would</b> probably <b>explain</b> his flair {{for working with}} young players.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} {{paintings}} on {{the north and south}} walls depicting the Camoys family. Camoys was the lord of the manor and it appears he had the church built primarily for his family. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the unusual detail in the paintings. They were intended as rich decoration rather than simply for educating an illiterate congregation.|$|E
5|$|This {{meant that}} his pyramid {{was out of}} the {{alignment}} formed by the preceding ones, limited its size and constrained the layout of his mortuary complex. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> why, despite having enjoyed one of the longest reigns of the Fifth Dynasty, Nyuserre's pyramid was smaller than that of his father and closer in size to that of his grandfather Sahure.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1910s, quantum {{mechanics}} expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr {{was able to}} show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.|$|E
50|$|In a deleted scene, Kramer {{revealed}} that he had fed Farfel turkish taffy, which <b>would</b> have <b>explained</b> the dog's erratic behaviour and frequent barking.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know why}} he danced; but if I had known {{you were going to}} be so silent, I <b>would</b> have <b>explained</b> the mistake myself.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Well, {{you know}} more about guns than I do," [...] he said. [...] "But that <b>would</b> {{certainly}} <b>explain</b> the strange antics of the government." [...] (p. 65) ...|$|R
5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A new type of privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain {{the small size of}} subsequent building.|$|E
5|$|An {{argument}} has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox. This case is supported {{only by the}} Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik, a late 15th-century chronicle, mentioning Narimantas as half-brother to Algirdas. Other historians support this claim by arguing this <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> Gediminas' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son, Jaunutis, as his succession would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first-born son of Gediminas and a second wife.|$|E
5|$|Mercury's orbit, however, did {{not match}} that {{predicted}} by Newton's Law of Gravitation. Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) that <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the discrepancies; however no such planet could be found. When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) {{he turned his attention}} to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy. This was the first time that Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be inexact.|$|E
50|$|Clauses or {{sentences}} linked, as in We came, {{but they}} wouldnt let us in. They wouldnt let us in, nor <b>would</b> they <b>explain</b> {{what we had}} done wrong.|$|R
60|$|Angry {{with himself}} for his embarrassment, {{and for the}} rising colour on his cheek, Arthur <b>would</b> have <b>explained</b> himself, but the lady, with {{feminine}} tact, did not permit him.|$|R
30|$|The {{proportions}} of failed genotyping {{seem to be}} relatively high. These phenomena, however, <b>would</b> be <b>explained</b> by buffy condition (i.e., lowered concentration, insufficient amount of sample, or DNA degradation over time).|$|R
5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which a room full of girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is {{distinguished}} from other Oryzomys species by its short rostrum, {{the form of}} its incisive foramina, the absence of sphenopalatine vacuities, and the near absence of a subsquamosal fenestra. Within the species, the Colombian specimen differs from the Venezuelan animals in being larger in some measurements, but having smaller teeth, and in having oddly shaped wear facets of the incisors. The Colombian animal was probably kept in captivity for some time after it was caught, which <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> its large size and odd wear facets. There are no substantial differences between mainland O.gorgasi and material from Curaçao.|$|E
5|$|Since Lucas refocused {{the film}} on Anakin, {{he had to}} {{sacrifice}} certain extraneous plot points relating to Attack of the Clones. Lucas had previously promised fans that he <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the mystery behind the erasure of the planet Kamino from the Jedi Archives. However, Lucas abandoned this plot thread in order to {{devote more time to}} Anakin's story, leaving the matter unresolved on film. As a compromise, Lucas permitted author James Luceno to explain the mystery of Kamino's erasure and the origins of the Clone army in his expanded universe novel Labyrinth of Evil.|$|E
5000|$|A line {{removed from}} the final novel <b>would</b> have <b>explained</b> that the Tzun cloned the Master during McIntee's's novel First Frontier, {{explaining}} the contradictory stories featuring the Master set after Survival.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{features}} Sebastian in solo {{performance at}} an outdoor venue that Sebastian has identified as being in Woodstock, New York. Sebastian <b>would</b> subsequently <b>explain</b> that the performance was hastily arranged: ...|$|R
3000|$|... − in {{the human}} {{vasculature}} [26] and could be activated by LDL {{and high levels of}} free fatty acid [27, 28]. Thus, this <b>would</b> help <b>explain</b> the reduced endothelial function in obesity.|$|R
5|$|While {{no studies}} have {{established}} {{whether or not}} these ants contain alarm pheromones, its relative Myrmecia gulosa is capable of inducing territorial alarm using pheromones. If proven, this <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> their ability to attack en masse. Foraging workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the subfamily Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. It is unknown whether jack jumper ants contribute to pollination.|$|E
5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E
5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This <b>would</b> <b>explain</b> his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106. At that time the anti-Archbishop Berthold von Moosburg was installed in Salzburg. Conrad came to Salzburg accompanied by his brothers, the counts Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers may well have been servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate. Pope Paschal II consecrated him as bishop on 21 October 1106 and gave him the pallium.|$|E
60|$|First, {{the object}} of Lee's recent {{movement}} against Meade; his destruction of the Alexandria and Orange Railroad, and subsequent withdrawal without more motive, not otherwise apparent, <b>would</b> be <b>explained</b> by this hypothesis.|$|R
5000|$|Attorney Ellis says to Amanda, [...] "I know there're aliens out there. At least, I'm {{pretty sure}} there're aliens out there. I mean, how else <b>would</b> you <b>explain</b> Andy Kaufman or Jim Carrey?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "morphing" [...] of {{the author}} from Xu Wei to Wang Shizhen <b>would</b> be <b>explained</b> by the {{practice}} of attributing [...] "a popular work of literature to some well-known writer of the period".|$|R
