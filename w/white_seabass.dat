5000|$|<b>White</b> <b>seabass</b> are fished {{primarily}} with live bait in relatively shallow water, {{but they will}} also take a fast-trolled spoon, artificial squid or bone jig. Live squid {{appear to be the}} best bait for a <b>white</b> <b>seabass,</b> but large anchovies and medium-size sardines are also good. At times, large <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> will bite only on fairly large, live Pacific mackerel. The young of this species are exceptionally vulnerable to sport anglers for two reasons: The first is that as juveniles they inhabit shallow nearshore areas, bays, and estuaries, and the second is that they are not easily recognized as <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> by the average angler. Commonly, these young fish are mistakenly called [...] "sea trout" [...] because of their sleek profile and vertical bars or [...] "parr marks". To add to the confusion, these bars fade as the fish grows.|$|E

50|$|The {{body of the}} <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> is elongate, and {{somewhat}} compressed. The head is pointed and slightly compressed. The mouth is large, with a row of small teeth in the roof; the lower jaw slightly projects. The color is bluish to gray above, with dark speckling, becoming silver below. The young have several dark vertical bars. The <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> {{is closely related to}} the California corbina, but is the only California member of the croaker family to exceed 20 pounds in weight. The largest recorded specimen was over 5 feet, 93.1 pounds. They are most easily separated from other croakers by the presence of a ridge running the length of the belly.CThe diet of <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> includes fishes, especially anchovies and sardines, and squid. At times, large fish are found which have eaten only Pacific mackerel. At the minimum legal length of 28 inches, the average <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> is about 5 years of age, weighs about 7.5 pounds and has been sexually mature for at least one spawning season.|$|E

50|$|Commercial {{fishing for}} totoaba {{began in the}} 1920s. The catch reached 2,000 metric tons in 1943, but had fallen to only 50 tons in 1975, when Mexico {{protected}} the totoaba and banned the fishery. Anecdotal evidence suggests that totoaba were very abundant {{prior to the start}} of the commercial fishery, but there is no hard evidence of natural population size. Recent studies indicate that the totoaba population has stabilized at a low level, perhaps a bit bigger than when the commercial fishery was banned in 1975. Totoaba are still caught, as by-catch in fishing for other finned fish and for shrimp, and in illegal fishing for totoaba directly. Some totoaba are illegally exported to the United States, often misidentified as <b>white</b> <b>seabass.</b> The government of Baja California has authorized commercial raising of totoaba in fish farms.|$|E
5000|$|California sheephead are fished by anglers and spearfishers for food, and {{are caught}} {{live for the}} {{aquarium}} trade. The recreational and commercial catch of sheephead in 1999 was estimated at over 132,000 fish. [...] Mainly juveniles are included in important commercial trap fishery, with juveniles and smaller adults dominating the hook and line and recreational fishery. In 2009, fishing vessels generated $333,801 in revenue from sheephead, much of that due to the lucrative live fish industry in Asian markets. [...] California sheephead are economically valuable as keystone predators on purple sea urchins and red sea urchins, keeping them from overgrazing kelp forests. Thus, where they are present, sheephead contribute to the growth and biodiversity of kelp forests, and the corresponding increase in populations of other commercially valuable fish species that are dependent on kelp habitat, such as kelp bass and <b>white</b> <b>seabass.</b>|$|E
50|$|According to Pierfishing.com {{the sandy}} beach area yields the normal surf species; barred surfperch, croakers, small rays and {{guitarfish}} (shovelnose shark). The pier is especially {{known for its}} magnificent barred surfperch fishing. At times, anglers catch hundreds of them {{within an hour of}} time, using mainly small jigs and sandcrabs. The area around the pilings yield pileperch, walleye surfperch, silver surfperch, and other common pier species. Mid-pier, casting away from the pier, yields small tom cod (white croaker) and herring (queenfish), jacksmelt, yellowfin croaker and an occasional halibut. Action {{at the end of the}} pier is improved by the surrounding artificial reef which is located about 65 ft from the end. Fish at the deepest water end include bonito, Pacific mackerel, jack mackerel, barracuda, an occasional <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> or even yellowtail, and reef visitors like kelp bass, sand bass and sculpin (scorpionfish). The resident species in Santa Monica Bay may be dangerous to eat, but those that migrate in and out of the bay are considered safe to eat. A variety of baits are utilized.|$|E
40|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Ocean Resource Enhancement Hatchery Program (OREHP), <b>white</b> <b>seabass,</b> Atractoscion nobilis, have been collected at seven stations along the Southern California coast along with three stations at Catalina Island. Using overnight gill nets and hook and line techniques, a sample of approximately 3600 fish was amassed from 1995 to the present. Each fish caught was weighed and measured for both total and standard lengths prior to {{the removal of the}} sagittal otoliths. These otoliths are being analyzed to determine their age. When combined with the length and weight database the growth of the <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> can then be characterized and recruitment patterns for <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> will be described...|$|E
40|$|Spawning periodicities of <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> (Atractoscion nobilis) were {{evaluated}} by observing spawning behavior, by collecting eggs, and monitoring recognizable sounds produced during the release of gametes. A total of 297 spawning events were documented from 15 male and 47 female <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> contained within the seminatural confines of a 526 -m 3 net pen located in Catalina Harbor, Santa Catalina Island, California. Consistent spawning occurred from March through July 2001 − 03, and peaked in May at a photoperiod of 14 hours. Most spawning occurred within the 2 -hour period following sunset or from 19 : 00 − 20 : 00 hours Pacific Standard Time. <b>White</b> <b>seabass</b> spawned at every phase of the lunar cycle; but an increase in successive spawning events followed the new moon. Most spawning occurred in water temperatures from 15 to 18 °C, {{and there was no}} apparent correlation with tidal cycles. Seasonal and diel spawning periods were directly correlated with increases in the rate, intensity, and variety of <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> sounds; this correlation may indicate that sounds function to enhance reproductive success. These findings can be extended to further develop seasonal fishery regulations and to better comprehend the role of sound in the reproduction of sound-producing fishes...|$|E

40|$|Studies of {{the impact}} of El Niño periods on marine species have usually focused on negative, highly visible eVects, e. g., {{decreasing}} growth rates or increasing mortality due to a decline in primary productivity in typically nutrient rich upwelling zones; but positive effects related to elevated water temperature are also known. This study examined how the growth rate of juvenile <b>white</b> <b>seabass,</b> Atractoscion nobilis, responded to changes in ocean temperature in an El Niño period (1997 – 1998) in the northern portion of the Southern California Bight, USA. Growth rates of juvenile <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> during their first 4 years of life were estimated as the slopes of linear relationships between body mass and age (from otoliths) of 800 fish collected at 11 stations throughout the bight. Growth rates differed significantly among cohorts hatched in 1996 – 2001. Specifically, <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> that hatched in 1996 and 1997 grew significantly faster than those that hatched in 1998, 1999, and 2001. These differences in growth rates of cohorts appeared to be driven by variation in sea-surface temperature (SST). Growth rates averaged over the first three or 4 years of life were signiWcantly positively corre- lated to average daily SST during the first 1 – 4 years of life. Increased growth of juvenile <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> during the warm El Niño period likely provided a number of benefits to this warm-temperate species. This study demonstrated that some species will benefit from these warm-water periods despite reduced system-wide primary production...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 16 - 25) During warm climate events, {{growth rates}} can increase in fish, {{suggesting that they}} benefit from the increase in sea surface temperature. Experienced around the world, climate events such as El Ni??o Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation can greatly influence {{the growth of a}} species. Previous studies have shown that species of fish can either thrive or dramatically decline during these shifts between warm and cool phases. Proper management of fisheries requires information regarding the interaction between a species and its environment. <b>White</b> <b>seabass</b> (Atractoscion nobilis) is a prominent commercial and recreational fishery species in Southern California. Largely attributed to overfishing, by 1982 the population had dramatically declined and both fisheries collapsed. Recent studies have shown signs that the native population is in recovery and may benefit from an El Ni??o event through increased growth rates. I addressed the question, ???do environmental conditions cause variation in year-class strength in <b>white</b> <b>seabass????</b> This study determined the population structure of <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> over a 12 -year period (1997 - 2008) and revealed that year-class strength was the greatest in 1996 and 1997. Reports of commercial landings for the species have shown a steady increase following the strong 1997 El Ni??o event, suggesting a relationship between year-class strength and commercial landings on a ten-year lag. Although year-class strength was greatest around the El Ni??o event, it was not significantly correlated with sea surface temperature or any climate index. Year-class strength estimation is an informative tool in assessing population structure of a managed species over time. The information provided in my study can inform fisheries, update management approaches, and help ensure the persistence of <b>white</b> <b>seabass</b> as the marine environment continues to change...|$|E
