5|$|Nouakchott <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny,</b> {{fortified}} {{fishing village}} (ksar) in pre-colonial times and under French rule. As Mauritania prepared for independence, it lacked a capital {{city and the}} area of present-day Nouakchott was chosen by Moktar Ould Daddah and his advisors. Ould Daddah desired for the new capital to be a symbol of modernity and national unity which ruled out existing cities or towns in the interior. The village {{was selected as the}} capital city for its central location between Saint-Louis, Senegal, the city from which the colony of Mauritania was governed, and Nouadhibou. Its location also meant that it avoided the sensitive issue of whether the capital was built in an area dominated by the Arab-descended Moors or Black Africans.|$|E
5|$|Plaman Mapu <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> Malaysian village {{only half}} a mile behind {{the western part of}} the border between Sarawak and Kalimantan. There the British had {{established}} a base for 'B' Company of the Parachute Regiment. Apart from the two 3-inch mortars stationed there, the place had little strategic value beyond being a lookout point for the British to detect Indonesian raids over the border. By the low standards of the makeshift British jungle bases, it was fairly well defended, equipped with aforementioned mortars, an interconnected trench network, and a command bunker, with supporting artillery weapons within range of the base to supply cover. The defenders of the base, by contrast, were wholly unprepared for combat. The undermanned 'B' Company had recently been supplied with a platoon of inexperienced troopers who had pitiful experience in jungle warfare. Due to the intensity of recent fighting, the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Ted Eberhardie, had only been able to spare a few of the new men for a training course in such combat at Singapore, but one of those was Sergeant Major John Williams, who would play a crucial role in the coming battle.|$|E

25|$|Developmental {{engagement}} between Denmark and Somalia {{dates back}} to 1980. Over the following 17 years, Denmark contributed 532 million DKK to Somalia, 63% of which constituted development funds and 37% humanitarian aid. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> {{fraction of the total}} development funding that Somalia received during the period as a Western ally. From 1984 to 1986, Somalia received $5.5 million USD in development funds from Denmark, representing 0.8% of foreign assistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{rumors of}} immoral conduct were widely {{published}} by the press without verification, and harmed morale. Investigations by the War Department and Edith Rogers uncovered nothing; and the incidence of disorderly and criminal conduct among the WAACs <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> fraction of that among the male military population, venereal disease was almost non-existent, and the pregnancy rate was far below civilian women. Despite this, the June 30, 1943 enlistment reached 60,000.|$|E
25|$|Subotica {{probably}} {{first became}} {{a settlement of}} note when people poured into it from nearby villages destroyed during the Tatar invasions of 1241–1242. However the settlement has surely been older. It has been established that people inhabited these territories even 3000 years ago. When Zabadka / Zabatka was first recorded in 1391, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> town in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Later, the city belonged to the Hunyadis, {{one of the most}} influential aristocratic families in the whole of Central Europe.|$|E

25|$|But just as French vignerons were {{recovering}} from oidium came a new mysterious ailment that caused decay or {{death in the}} grapevines. The cause <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> louse, known as phylloxera, imported from North America. This louse targets the rootstock of the vine. The solution to this epidemic also came from North America in the grafting of naturally resistant American rootstocks to the European vines. However, while the importing of this new North American plant material helped {{to stave off the}} phylloxera epidemic, it brought with it yet more problems-the fungal disease of downy mildew that first surfaced in 1878 and black rot that followed in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{the immense}} {{popularity}} of the victim there was exceptional outrage from the public, who were impatient for a conviction. In the absence of other suspects, George attracted police attention because many elements in his background seemed to point to his guilt, although the only actual evidence <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> speck of material {{that may or may}} not have been gunshot residue. He was convicted of murder, but his conviction was subsequently judged unsafe by the Court of Appeal and was quashed in 2007. After a retrial, he was acquitted on 1 August 2008, though his claims for compensation for wrongful imprisonment were dismissed.|$|E
25|$|When {{he arrived}} at Vologda, he was met at the station by a {{commercial}} agent in whose house he was to live. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> house and George felt {{in the way of}} his host who lived with his wife and four children. He found another house that belonged to a rich merchant and was well treated by the owner. He shared his exile with his brother Nicholas and with his cousin Dmitry Konstantinovich. They could move freely around town and visited each other frequently. On the morning of 14 July, two days before the murder of Nicholas II and his family, a car with four heavily armed men arrived and collected the Grand Dukes from their lodgings; they were arrested and interned in a small, walled village prison, where they could be more easily guarded. Rumors of the assassination of the tsar reached them while they were there. During these months George Mikhailovich frequently managed to smuggle letters to his wife, the last one dated 27 November 1918. His wife unsuccessfully tried to buy out his freedom and that of the other three Grand Dukes for fifty thousand pounds through the Danish minister in St Petersburg.|$|E

500|$|Billiards {{champion}} Tex Zimmerman (Cochran's {{partner in}} the 924 Club) and well known pool hustler Danny McGoorty {{had a hand in}} organizing the tour. In preparation, they played up Katsura's exoticness and her physical attractiveness. Tex Zimmerman's wife sewed tight-fitting kimonos for Katsura, slit up the side, which she wore during her exhibitions with high heels. Katsura <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> woman, weighing between 88 and 96pounds. and standing 5feet tall—just about the height of a standard cue stick. McGoorty later mused: [...] "Masako was cute! She was thirty-nine years old but she looked twenty-nine. She hopped around that table on her high heels, giving the fans a little smile, and everybody loved her." ...|$|E
500|$|Potter {{created a}} series of {{miniature}} letters for child fans between 1907 and 1912. [...] These letters were written as from her characters and intended {{to shed light on}} their doings outside their tales and to tell the recipient more about them. Each letter was folded to represent an envelope, and addressed to the child recipient. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> stamp in the corner drawn with a red crayon. They were sent to the children in a miniature post bag marked G.P.O. that Potter had made herself or in a toy tin mail box enamelled bright red. [...] "Some of the letters were very funny," [...] Potter wrote, [...] "The defect was that inquiries and answers were all mixed up." ...|$|E

500|$|Midge {{was sold}} [...] "pregnant" [...] with Nikki, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> baby inside Midge's {{magnetic}} removable womb. This {{led to some}} controversy with some consumers saying that the doll was inappropriate for children, or that it promoted teen pregnancy. Another cause for this controversy was that Midge did not initially have a wedding ring, but this was later fixed. She also was packaged without Alan. Customers complaining about the doll led to Wal-Mart pulling the Happy Family line off their shelves. [...] A new version of this Midge was produced for Wal-Mart, this time not pregnant and with a cardboard cut-out display of Alan and Ryan standing next to her inside the box. The Happy Family Line included everything from a talking house, a backyard swimming pool, neighborhood market, and playground.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair {{released}} {{only two}} official peripherals for the ZX81, a 16KB RAM pack (actually {{the same one}} previously released for the ZX80, but rebadged) and the ZX Printer, both of which plugged into the edge connector {{at the rear of}} the ZX81. They retailed at a launch price of £49.95 each but both had notable flaws. The RAM pack was top-heavy and was supported only by the edge connector. It had a habit of falling out of its socket at crucial points and crashing the ZX81, losing anything that the user had typed in. Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum, double-sided tape or Blu-Tack to cure what became known as the [...] "RAM pack wobble" [...] problem. The ZX Printer <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> spark printer that used two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium-coated paper to reveal the black underlay. It worked reasonably well at first but its output deteriorated rapidly after a time.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, {{the year}} before she died, Potter's {{thoughts}} returned to Kitty MacDonald when she wrote about a piece of crockery:Seventy eighty years ago it belonged to another old woman, old Katie MacDonald, the Highland washerwoman. She <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> body, brown as a berry, beady black eyes and much wrinkled, against an incongruously white frilled mutch. She wore a small plaid crossed over shawl pinned with a silver brooch, a bed jacket, and a full kilted petticoat. She dropped bob curtsies, but she was outspoken and very independent, proud and proper ... The joy of converse with old Katie was to draw her out {{to talk of the}} days when she was a wee bit lassie—herding the kine. The days when 'Boney' was a terror ... the old woman wouldn't dwell upon hard weather and storms; she spoke of the sunshine and clouds, and shadows, the heather bells, the ... "the broom of the Cowden Knowes", the sun and wind on the hills where she played, and knitted, and herded cattle and sheep. A bonny life it was, but it never came back ..." ...|$|E

The headlights were separate units mounted {{on the side of}} the car, though of such low output, they have been described as providing [...] "more of a glimmer than a beam". At the rear there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny,</b> single, centrally-mounted lamp.|$|E
2500|$|The XRON-I Rotorcycle or YRON-I Rotorcycle [...] (originally {{designated}} HOG) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny,</b> single-seat helicopter designed {{under contract}} for the U.S. Navy. in the mid-1950s. It later was designed for a United States Marine Corps requirement for a small personal helicopter that would fulfill a number of roles, including observation, liaison, small unit tactical maneuvers, and which could be dropped to downed airmen behind enemy lines to facilitate their escape.|$|E
2500|$|In spring 1902, NYC Parks {{destroyed}} {{two houses}} {{in the park and}} used the remaining wood to build free bathhouses, which were used by about 700 bathers per day during that summer. Around 1903, Hunter Island became a popular summer vacation destination. Due to overcrowding on Hunter Island, NYC Parks opened a campsite two years later at Rodman's Neck on the south tip of the island, with 100 bathhouses. Orchard Beach was extended by [...] that year, doubling capacity; it also gained a new [...] "comfort station". At the time, Orchard Beach <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> recreational area on the northeast tip of Rodman's Neck.|$|E
