40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to share {{findings}} from two studies. One study investigates how Minnesota school administrators are addressing cultural diversity and English Language Learners. Data was collected through an electronic survey sent to superintendents and principals. 326 surveys from a possible 998 were completed for a return rate of 32. 6 %. Respondents were asked to identify their leadership position and type of district (urban, suburban, rural, or other). Respondents were also asked their perception concerning (a) personal awareness of English Language Learners (ELL) and cultural diversity needs, (b) district efforts through finances and professional development to address ELL and cultural diversity issues, (c) awareness of higher education efforts to address cultural diversity issues, and (d) level of interest in attending training on ELL and cultural diversity. The second study focuses experiences and perceptions of school leaders of color. Data were collected through focus groups and individual interviews. Questions include (a) what challenges do people of color face in securing leadership positions; (b) what challenges do people of color face in their current position; (c) how important is it to have a person of color in a leadership position where the majority of students are students of color; (d) how can people of color be encouraged to seek school leadership positions; and (e) <b>what</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>would</b> you make regarding recruitment of people of color into administrative preparation programs? This paper shares their perspective on the importance of having a person of color in a leadership position. Results from the two studies indicate a need for Minnesota school leadership to reflect a more diverse student population and for school personnel to develop inclusive, multi-cultural environments. Recommendations for addressing the absence of school leaders of color include (a) school districts identifying people of color within thei...|$|E
40|$|The {{methodology}} {{and benefits of}} e-learning {{is well known for}} almost all teachers. The quality of free online learning systems is high. LMS systems are still rarely used, especially in public education as a blended form of traditional education. One of the main reasons might be that the importance of usage of e-learning system among the ICT skills is not properly emphasized in the teachers training programs. In university courses, the pure online methodology appear more rarely then we could expect in the 20 th century. In this paper we examine and give <b>suggestion</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be worth to add in teacher training to expanding the ICT knowledge with the e-learning technology and methodology. We show some examples about the possibilities how to introduce blended learning in secondary school and higher education and how to support project work by using online tools.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{excessive}} efforts {{have been made to}} increase the city’s attractiveness and its international positioning. Also studies on the so-called city destination branding are on the rise. Theorists, as Ramirez (2001), Marzano and Scott (2009), among many others, are discussing different aspects of this complex process. Many approaches and strategies are dealing with the positioning of urban environments and city destinations, trying to provide at least some partial answers about achieving this objective. With proper marketing and branding, cities can do a lot to attract tourists and visitors. For successful city marketing and branding and for the successful long-term positioning of the destination in general, it is necessary to involve the key stakeholders and collaborate with as many as possible {{despite the fact that the}} branding of a city destination (or any destination for that matter) is a complex process. It is significant that all the stakeholders, who are always carriers of different interests, are invited to collaborate in the planning of the tourism development and tourism development strategies, from the government, the private sector, schools etc. It is also important to involve the citizens, who can provide a valuable opinion about the environment they live in – what they like about their environment, <b>what</b> <b>suggestion</b> <b>would</b> they give to tourists about gastronomy, attractions, shops, events, etc. It is significant that citizens are proud of their urban environment, that they know their own environment, and that they have the motivation for the involvement in the process of improvement of their home environment (through projects, discussions, etc.). It is impossible to create attractive urban environments or cities if residents do not have a positive opinion about the place they live in. That is why it is essential for the education institutions at all levels, but especially for the institutions at the primary levels to educate children, toddlers, pupils, students, about the importance of urban environment development and create a positive learning environment, where children are able to develop as residents with a great understanding of the potential of the environment they live in. The paper explores the importance of raising awareness of the urban environment in primary schools from the theoretical, analytical and practical point of views. In the paper, we will examine whether primary schools in the city of Maribor, Slovenia educate children about their urban environment, if they are creating positive learning environments, where children can develop into proud citizens aware of the significance of the urban environment and its consequences for the quality of their lives. Further on, the curricula in chosen primary schools in Maribor is going to be analyzed. With the survey, we will try to identify the degree of children’s awareness of their surrounding urban environment, the information they receive about their environment, and their attitude towards it. And finally, what is most important, we will try to show the extreme significance of the learning environment and the curricula for raising the awareness of the environment and growing into responsible adults who will also act responsibly towards their urban environments...|$|R
