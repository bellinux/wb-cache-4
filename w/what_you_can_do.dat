In 1984, he {{developed}} the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire, a widely-used screening tool for seasonality.

Rosenthal later identified a form of reverse SAD which some experience in the summer season.|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for {{the size}} of the game's worlds. Jes Bickham of GamesRadar described Banjo-Tooie as a game that requires a massive time-investment on the player's part, saying that [...] "Keeping track of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> next, or where you can re-visit to get something new, requires either a photographic memory or copious note-taking". Similarly, GamePro remarked that the game is so large that players might lose their way and forget what they are supposed to do. GameSpot's Shane Satterfield praised the game's level design and progression for constantly requiring players to collect Jiggies. Despite the praise, Edge concluded that Rare should have innovated more instead of simply copying the formula of Super Mario 64. At the 2000 GameSpot Game of the Year awards, Banjo-Tooie was awarded Best Platform Game.|$|E

The strings in the song were arranged by Carl Bagge, and played by various cello and violin players. The song alongside [...] "Hang with Me" [...] {{were among the first}} songs to be recorded for the Body Talk series, and Robyn said that she saved them for a later release because [...] " [...] knew they would be singles, or could be singles, and [...] wanted them to get that chance." [...] Robyn described the song to The Macomb Daily as [...] "a love song ... about <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> in a club". In an interview with MTV News, she elaborated on the song's theme and message, saying, [...] "I think 'Indestructible' is a song that talks about what happens when you meet new people and fall in love, and how that can be scary and fun at the same time." ...|$|E

500|$|The rhythmic {{direction}} of the music was occasionally interrupted by densely layered percussive and electronic effects, including repeated whirring and grinding sounds. Cosey generated these sounds by running his guitar through a ring modulator and an EMS Synthi A. The latter device was an early synthesizer with knobs and buttons but no keyboard, making it useful for producing abstract noises rather than exact pitches and melodies. He used it to suggest a certain soundscape during each performance, [...] "whether we were in space, or underwater {{or a group of}} Africans playing—just different soundscapes". Onstage, he also had a table set up holding a mbira, claves, agogo bells, and several other hand percussion instruments, which he played or struck with a mallet to indicate a different break or stop. [...] "I would hit them just like they do at [...] fights!", Cosey recalled. His synthesizer sometimes interacted with the experimental sounds Mtume was able to generate from his drum machine, as during the [...] "Ife" [...] segment. Davis gave the instrument to Mtume after receiving it from Yamaha, the Japanese tour's sponsor, and told him [...] "see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with it." [...] Rather than use it to create rhythms, Mtume processed the drum machine through several different pedals and phase shifters such as the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, creating a sound he said was [...] "total tapestry".|$|E

[...] Leibowitz objected that the argument was [...] "an appeal to passion and prejudice" [...] and moved for a mistrial. Knight agreed that it was an appeal to passion, and Callahan overruled the motion. Knight continued, [...] "We all have a passion, all men in this court room to protect the womanhood in Alabama." [...] For his summation, solicitor Wade Wright reviewed the testimony and warned the jury, [...] "that this crime could have happened to any woman, even though she was riding in a parlor car, instead of box car." ...|$|E

President Kennedy in {{a speech at the}} White House on June 22, 1962, [...] "Remarks to Student Volunteers Participating in Operation Crossroads Africa", acknowledged that Operation Crossroads for Africa was the basis {{for the development of the}} Peace Corps. [...] "This group and this effort really were the progenitors of the Peace Corps and what this organization has been doing for a number of years led to the establishment of what I consider to be the most encouraging indication of the desire for service not only in this country but all around the world that we have seen in recent years". The Peace Corps website answered the question [...] "Who Inspired the Creation of the Peace Corps?", acknowledging that the Peace Corps were based on Operation Crossroads Africa founded by Rev.

2500|$|McCreight {{prevented}} a {{confrontation between the}} 7th Cavalry Regiment and aggrieved Ojibwe from Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. In 1885, a band of 100–150 of Chief Little Shell’s Ojibwe warriors left the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and came to Devils Lake on a Sunday morning before day break while the town was sleeping. The Ojibwe were in a serious dispute with the U.S. government and were angry because white settlers were breaking treaties, stealing Indian timber and killing Indian game. They came to Devils Lake to protest, determined to right a grievance and threatening the settlers. [...] McCreight was the “Indian Man” in Devils Lake, and his roommate doctor woke him before sunrise saying: [...] "Get up quick, the Indians are out there; they are holding a war-dance; they mean devilment and will burn the town; hurry, and see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with them!" [...] McCreight was sympathetic to Ojibwe grievances and understood their anger and frustration. He immediately went to the Ojibwe camp, parleyed with Little Shell and eventually persuaded the natives to return to Turtle Mountain. McCreight reported, “ It was all over before the town folks stirred about after their late Sunday morning breakfast; and over their own late breakfast, the doctor and the writer decided it best to say nothing, to avoid publicity, for it might interfere with business, and perhaps bring the wrath of General George Armstrong Custer's troops at the fort, against the suffering natives, and so the incident was closed and soon forgotten — forgotten except for the life-long humiliation at failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to intercede for and {{protect the rights of}} these abused natives.” ...|$|E
