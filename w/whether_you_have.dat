25|$|New {{digital signal}} {{processing}} functionalities such as Room Correction, Bass Management, Loudness Equalization and Speaker Fill have been introduced. Speaker Fill mixes 2-channel content to use all available speakers {{in a manner similar}} to Creative's CMSS. Bass Management can be used to redirect the subwoofer signal to the main speakers. If a channel is missing, a feature called Channel Phantoming allows the best use of the speakers that are there, by redirecting the sound of the missing channels through these speakers. <b>Whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a multi-channel or stereo sound system in your home theater or living room, Windows Vista also includes the ability to calibrate your speakers for your room. By placing a microphone where you plan to sit and then running a wizard that measures the room response, Windows Vista can automatically set the levels, delay and frequency balance for each channel accordingly for this position. For PCs equipped with stereo headphones, Vista adds the ability to have surround sound using a new feature called Headphone Virtualization, which uses technology based upon a Head-related transfer function.|$|E
500|$|Hillary Goldstein of IGN {{praised the}} comic book, {{saying that it}} [...] "is truly {{the cream of the}} crop when it comes to Vertigo books. Neil Gaiman's work on the series is {{considered}} legendary for a reason. This story, in its entirety, is every bit as good as Watchmen and of equal (if not greater) literary merit. Were I to list the 100 best single comic-book issues I have ever read, three would come from this collection. <b>Whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> read The Sandman before or are a first timer, this is the one book you need to buy this fall. The stories within are magnificent and the care taken in reproducing Gaiman's work is the same you'd expect for any great work of literature." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aviva Chomsky (daughter of famed {{academic}} Noam Chomsky) in the Providence Journal {{suggests that}} Harry Potter is a parable on immigration rights, noting that US [...] "immigration, citizenship and naturalization laws are based explicitly on {{discrimination on the}} basis of national origin. Where you were born, and what passport you carry, determine <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the right to come here, to visit, to work, or to live here." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Maybe" [...] is the album's seventh song, {{which was}} also written three years before the album was {{released}} and before she met {{all the people who}} worked on the album with her and herself and Paul Herman, who has previously worked with Dido and Jessie J wrote the track. The song is about confusion, {{and the fact that you}} don't know for sure when you break up with someone in a relationship if this person was not the love of your life and there is a question <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made the right decision.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} in Art Monthly in 2000 a critic {{described}} Starr's new exhibition in London The Bunny Lakes are Coming: [...] "Art {{is meant to}} be more sensitive than popular culture but doesn't always manage it. The Bunny Lakes are Coming is a melange of pop cultural melancholy and terror that is as sensitive as a fresh bruise. Starr's longstanding interest in the exploration of internality through the products of popular culture has been chided in the past. If returning home is a way of testing <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> moved one, Starr has not endeavoured to please. Her new work is as dark as her early work was light. Maybe her early work was too soft, now it's too soft to touch." ...|$|E

2500|$|Still embittered by the {{perceived}} betrayal, Paine tried to ruin Washington's reputation by {{calling him a}} treacherous man who was unworthy of his fame as a military and political hero. He sent a stinging letter to Washington, in which he described him as an incompetent commander and a vain and ungrateful person. Paine never received a reply, so he contacted his lifelong publisher, the anti-Federalist Benjamin Bache to publish this Letter to George Washington in 1796. In this scathing publication, Paine wrote: [...] "the world will be puzzled to decide whether you are an apostate or an impostor; <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> abandoned good principles or whether you ever had any." [...] He further wrote that {{without the aid of}} France, Washington could not have succeeded in the Revolution and had [...] "but little share in the glory of the final event." [...] He also commented on Washington's poor character, saying that Washington had no sympathetic feelings and was a hypocrite.|$|E

6000|$|... "By the bye, Milly," [...] he said, [...] "Morton {{was asking}} <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not a {{photograph}} of your father. There's one in the sitting-room, isn't there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is spilled {{all over}} the floor. I {{wondered}} <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> happened to tread in it. But you say you found no paint on your shoes this morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said my wife. [...] "I don't know <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> kept exact {{account of}} the time. It was a {{surprise}} to us, for we hadn't. He is out, you know." ...|$|R

60|$|Aur. [To LAU.] Now, Laura, you {{may take}} your choice betwixt the two Benito's, and {{consider}} <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> rather he should serenade {{you in the}} garden, or I in bed to-night.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{no fear of}} that, I think, Ruth. They {{never asked}} <b>you</b> <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> found anything; and though you {{certainly}} hid the truth, you did not absolutely give false evidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I ask you, Mr. Doolittle, in {{the face}} of this court, put ting it to your {{conscience}} and your knowledge of the law, <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> any right to enter that man’s dwelling?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt you}} are--with the result," [...] said Mrs. Jansenius, hardly. [...] "I wish to know <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{anything}} to complain of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{perfectly}} true. I {{only wanted}} to be clear as to <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> repeated to her what I told you the other night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ronnie," [...] she said, [...] "I don't know <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> met Surgeon-Major Thomson in France? Major Thomson, {{this is my}} nephew, Captain Granet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so," [...] she said, gravely. [...] "I shall {{certainly}} {{need something}} of the sort to correct the very unfavourable impression <b>you</b> <b>have</b> just been giving me. Now let us change the subject. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> not told me yet <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> any flirtations in India." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton smiled gravely. [...] "My dear, I {{want you}} as you are. How could it make a {{difference}} <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done right or wrong--and I shall still hold you blameless when I know everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah. I {{heard from}} Brander {{that she was}} shut up there, and I was {{wondering}} <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> run against her. He is very savage at what he calls her vagaries. Did she get through the starvation all right?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "So I thought, sir," [...] the man continued. [...] "A very {{inquisitive}} individual indeed I found him. He {{wanted to}} know <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> had any news yet as to any further appointment. He seemed to know quite well that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been at the Foreign Office this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|Bernard nodded. [...] "Well, I suppose your {{objects are}} {{sometimes}} good, {{as far as}} you see, though I doubt if you always see far enough. But I wondered <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone to Langrigg. It's possible Janet has made some plot for Jim's advantage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely impossible," [...] he answered. [...] "Besides, I shouldn't care {{to do it}} just now. It {{looks like}} running away. A week or so ago you were talking of taking a villa down the river. I {{wondered}} <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> thought any more of it." ...|$|R
