5|$|At 19:00, the German ships {{closed to}} attack. In {{the span of}} five minutes, the German cruisers' guns had seriously damaged Good Hope, which was {{destroyed}} by a magazine explosion. Monmouth attempted to escape to the south; she <b>was</b> <b>burning</b> furiously and her guns had fallen silent. Nürnberg closed to point-blank range of Monmouth and poured shells into her. Glasgow was forced to abandon Monmouth after 20:20, before fleeing south and meeting with Canopus. Monmouth eventually capsized and sank at 21:18. Over 1,600men {{were killed in the}} sinking of the two armored cruisers, including Admiral Craddock; German losses were negligible. However, the German ships had expended over 40% of their ammunition supply.|$|E
5|$|During {{the height}} of the typhoon at Cabras Island on Guam, a {{gasoline}} tank caught fire, believed to be from friction caused by extremely high winds running through its ventilation system. The tank exploded, sending its lid airborne and spreading the fire to other nearby tanks. The proximity of the tanks as well as low water pressure hampered firefighting efforts, and the fire was extinguished five days later; it resulted in three destroyed gasoline tanks with two more caught on fire. While the fire <b>was</b> <b>burning,</b> transportation of gasoline from the port to the rest of Guam was suspended resulting in a halt in gasoline sales for the general public.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{anonymously}} {{receives a}} tape cassette of Grissom's 911 call. He {{tries to take}} the case, only to learn that another FBI agent, Alex Krycek, has opened it first. Deciding to leave Krycek out of the loop, Mulder calls Scully (Gillian Anderson) and asks her to conduct Grissom's autopsy. Mulder then heads to Grissom's clinic in Stamford, Connecticut, where he is confronted by an angered Krycek. The two travel back to Quantico to see Scully, who says that Grissom's body {{showed no signs of}} a fire, but yet seems to have biologically believed it <b>was</b> <b>burning.</b>|$|E

5|$|The watchmen {{were quick}} to sound the alarm, but given the fire department's {{relatively}} primitive equipment, {{the fact that the}} streets of Vester Kvarter were too narrow for the fire pumps, the strange dispositions of those fighting the fire, and a series of unlucky events, the fight was nearly hopeless. The wind blew from the southwest that evening, carrying the fire along Lille Sankt Clemens Stræde, Store Sankt Clemens Stræde, Vombadstuestræde, Antiquitetsstræde and Hellig-Kors Stræde. By 9:00 p.m the main street of Vestergade <b>was</b> <b>burning</b> on both sides. From here the fire spread along Store Lars Bjørns Stræde, Lille Lars Bjørns Stræde and Studiestræde.|$|E
5|$|In late August, Seacole was on {{the route}} to Cathcart's Hill for the final assault on Sevastopol on 7 September 1855. French troops led the storming, but the British were beaten back. By dawn on Sunday 9 September, the city <b>was</b> <b>burning</b> out of control, {{and it was clear}} that it had fallen: the Russians retreated to fortifications {{to the north of the}} harbour. Later in the day, Seacole {{fulfilled}} a bet, and became the first British woman to enter Sevastopol after it fell. Having obtained a pass, she toured the broken town, bearing refreshments and visiting the crowded hospital by the docks, containing thousands of dead and dying Russians. Her foreign appearance led to her being stopped by French looters, but she was rescued by a passing officer. She looted some items from the city, including a church bell, an altar candle, and a three-metre (10ft) long painting of the Madonna.|$|E
5|$|The next day, 21 January 1944, Sayn-Wittgenstein, {{wireless}} operator Ostheimer {{and board}} mechanic Unteroffizier Kurt Matzuleit {{took off on}} a Zahme Sau (Tame Boar), a combination of ground controlled and airborne radar, night fighter intercept mission flying the Ju88R4+XM (Werknummer 750 467—factory number), which normally {{was assigned to the}} Technical Officer of NJG2. At 22:00 contact with the first of five Lancasters was established and shot down which was observed to explode at 22:05. Between 22:10 and 22:15 the second Lancaster was shot down. Observers reported the third Lancaster exploded at approximately 22:30, followed shortly by number four, which hit the ground at 22:40. During the fifth and final attack, the four-engined bomber <b>was</b> <b>burning</b> when their Ju 88 came under attack, presumably from British fighter escorts. In the attack, their left wing caught fire. Sayn-Wittgenstein ordered his crew to jump, and Ostheimer and Matzuleit parachuted to safety from the damaged aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Disused {{coal mines}} {{can also cause}} issues. Subsidence can occur above tunnels, causing damage to {{infrastructure}} or cropland. Coal mining can also cause long lasting fires, {{and it has been}} estimated that thousands of coal seam fires <b>are</b> <b>burning</b> at any given time. For example, there is a coal seam fire in Germany that has <b>been</b> <b>burning</b> since 1668, and <b>is</b> still <b>burning</b> in the 21st century.|$|R

The fire <b>is</b> <b>burning</b> near the community of Kennedy Meadows in the Sequoia National Forest, however it was not threatening any structures at this time.|$|R

25|$|The {{call to arms}} {{was given}} at a very {{critical}} period. The weather <b>was</b> <b>burning</b> hot. Crops were ripe and ready for harvesting. The journey was long and arduous. Many persons preferred to stay back. In spite of these obstacles and difficulties, an army of thirty thousand persons was raised. The army assembled at Al Jorf outside Medina. Muhammad remained at Medina {{for some time to}} attend to other affairs, and at Al Jorf Abu Bakr deputised for Muhammad and led the prayers.|$|E
25|$|The {{early life}} of Saint Martin {{was written by}} Sulpicius Severus, who knew him personally. It expresses the {{intimate}} closeness the 4th-century Christian felt with the Devil in all his disguises, and has many accounts of miracles. Some follow familiar conventions— casting out devils, raising the paralytic and the dead. Others are more unusual: turning back the flames from a house while Martin <b>was</b> <b>burning</b> down the Roman temple it adjoined; deflecting {{the path of a}} felled sacred pine; the healing power of a letter written from Martin.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Green {{estimated}} {{his loss}} at $100,000. The {{home and the}} furniture were insured for approximately $35,000. Mrs. Green lost her diamonds and jewellery valued at $10,000. Colonel Green had a large and valuable library {{as well as several}} paintings by Corot, Schreyer, and Sontag. One painting which was taken from his mother's home while it <b>was</b> <b>burning,</b> was particularly prized by Col. Green who valued it at $5,000. The mansion which contained thirty-five rooms, originally cost $63,000 and Col. Green had improved it considerably since he became its owner.|$|E
25|$|The B class {{locomotives}} featured {{an unusual}} design of firebox with two separate chambers, {{each with its}} own firedoor, divided by a water space that effectively acted as a thermic syphon, and joined at the tubeplate. The two fireboxes were designed to be worked separately, with one fire being built while the other <b>was</b> <b>burning,</b> and was designed to extract the maximum heat from the wood fuels the VR used in its early years. However, the last two locomotives, built in the 1880s, had a conventional single firebox.|$|E
25|$|On 25 January 1938 (during {{solar cycle}} 17), bright lights, an aurora borealis {{appeared}} over the northern hemisphere, including in places {{as far south}} as North Africa, Bermuda and California. It was the widest occurrence of the aurora since 1709 and people in Paris and elsewhere believed a great fire <b>was</b> <b>burning</b> and notified fire departments. Sister Lúcia indicated that it was the sign foretold and so apprised her superior and the bishop in letters the following day. Just over a month later, Hitler seized Austria and eight months later invaded Czechoslovakia.|$|E

25|$|There is {{controversy}} {{about whether there}} was sufficient time for more effective emergency evacuation. The main problem was {{that most of the}} personnel who had the authority to order evacuation had been killed when the first explosion destroyed the control room. This was a consequence of the platform design, which did not include blast walls. Another contributing factor was that the nearby connected platforms Tartan and Claymore continued to pump gas and oil to Piper Alpha until its pipeline ruptured in the heat in the second explosion. Their operations crews did not believe they had authority to shut off production, even though they could see that Piper Alpha <b>was</b> <b>burning.</b>|$|E
25|$|Seven people {{survived the}} impact, {{although}} they were all injured and in shock. One of the survivors assisted two others away from the wreck, which <b>was</b> <b>burning,</b> and they all rallied a distance away from the wreck. They stated to the press afterwards {{that they were all}} apathetic and in shock, and that none of them thought about the possibilities to search for help. Also, none of them knew where they were. They heard the search being carried out by helicopter and were therefore aware that they were being searched for. Two of the initial survivors later died, bringing the death toll to forty.|$|E
25|$|The small Seychelles Coast Guard {{patrol boat}} Topaz engaged in another battle with pirates {{five days later}} on 30 March. While patrolling just {{off the coast of}} Somalia, Topaz {{encountered}} a captured dhow. After warning shots were fired, the dhow seemed to ignore the patrol boat and its occupants eventually opened up with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire. The Seychellois then engaged and after shooting off 10,000 rounds of machine gun fire, the dhow <b>was</b> <b>burning</b> and eventually sank. Twenty-seven members of the dhow's crew were rescued and the Topaz was returning to base when she was attacked by a trawler and two skiffs. Again the Seychellois responded with counter battery and the trawler exploded. One of the skiffs was sunk as well. Pirate casualties are unknown and one member of the dhow's crew was wounded.|$|E
