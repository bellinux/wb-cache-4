40|$|The <b>WIMPzilla</b> {{hypothesis}} is that the dark matter is a super-weakly-interacting and super-heavy particle. Conventionally, the <b>WIMPzilla</b> abundance is set by gravitational particle production during or {{at the end of}} inflation. In this study we allow the <b>WIMPzilla</b> to interact directly with Standard Model fields through the Higgs portal, and we calculate the thermal production (freeze-in) of <b>WIMPzilla</b> dark matter from the annihilation of Higgs boson pairs in the plasma. The two particle-physics model parameters are the <b>WIMPzilla</b> mass and the Higgs-WIMPzilla coupling. The two cosmological parameters are the reheating temperature and the expansion rate of the universe at the end of inflation. We delineate the regions of parameters space where either gravitational or thermal production is dominant, and within those regions we identify the parameters that predict the observed dark matter relic abundance. Allowing for thermal production opens up the parameter space, even for Planck-suppressed Higgs-WIMPzilla interactions. Comment: 33 pages, 8 figures; v 2 - references added, matches PR...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} reasons to believe the present mass density of the {{universe}} is dominated by a weakly interacting massive particle (wimp), a fossil relic of the early universe. Theoretical ideas and experimental efforts have focused mostly on production and detection of thermal relics, with mass typically in the range a few GeV to a hundred GeV. Here, I will review scenarios for production of nonthermal dark matter. Since the masses of the nonthermal wimps are in the range 10 12 to 10 16 GeV, much larger than the mass of thermal wimpy wimps, they may be referred to as <b>wimpzillas.</b> In searches for dark matter it may be well to remember that “size does matter. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{particle}} production via preheating {{at the end}} of inflation in supersymmetric theories. The inflaton and matter scalars are now necessarily complex fields, and their relevant interactions are restricted by holomorphy. In general this leads to major changes both in the inflaton dynamics and in the efficiency of the preheating process. In addition, supersymmetric models generically contain multiple isolated vacua, raising the possibility of non-thermal production of dangerous topological defects. Because of these effects, the success of leptogenesis or <b>WIMPZILLA</b> production via preheating depends much more sensitively on the detailed parameters in the inflaton sector than previously thought. 1 Introduction. The inflationary paradigm [1] has been remarkably successful in explaining the observed large-scale features of the universe. Apart from its prediction of a flat universe with Ωtot = 1, inflation naturally produces primordial density fluctuations with a Harrison-Zeldovich power spectrum. These fluctuations in turn give rise to the angular patter...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} and phenomenology of particle-like states originating from D-branes whose spatial dimensions are all compactified. They are non-perturbative states in string theory and {{we refer to}} them as D-matter. In contrast to other non-perturbative objects such as 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles, D-matter states could have perturbative couplings among themselves and with ordinary matter. The lightest D-particle (LDP) could be stable because it is the lightest state carrying certain (integer or discrete) quantum numbers. Depending on the string scale, they could be cold dark matter candidates with properties similar to that of wimps or <b>wimpzillas.</b> The spectrum of excited states of D-matter exhibits an interesting pattern which could be distinguished from that of Kaluza-Klein modes, winding states, and string resonances. We speculate about possible signatures of D-matter from ultra-high energy cosmic rays and colliders. Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures, references adde...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a minimal and yet comprehensive framework with $CP$- and classical scale-symmetries, {{in order to}} simultaneously address the hierarchy problem, neutrino masses, dark matter, and inflation. One complex gauge singlet scalar and three flavors of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos {{are added to the}} standard model content, facilitating the see-saw mechanism, among others. An adimensional theory of gravity (Agravity) is employed, allowing for the trans-Planckian field excursions. The weak and Planck scales are induced by the Higgs portal and the scalar non-minimal couplings, respectively, once a Coleman-Weinberg dynamically-generated vacuum expectation value for the singlet scalar is obtained. All scales are free from any mutual quadratic destabilization. The $CP$-symmetry prevents a decay of the pseudoscalar singlet, rendering it a suitable <b>WIMPzilla</b> dark matter candidate with the correct observational relic abundance. Identifying the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of the (approximate) scale symmetry with the inflaton field, the model accommodates successful slow-roll inflation, compatible with the observational data. We reach the conclusion that a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone inflaton, within a classically scale-symmetric framework, yields lighter WIMPzillas. Comment: 26 pages, 11 figures, 1 table. Published version.

40|$|Motivated by gauge {{coupling}} unification {{and dark}} matter, we present an extension to the Standard Model where both are achieved by adding an extra new matter multiplet. Such considerations {{lead to a}} Grand Unified Theory with very heavy <b>WIMPzilla</b> dark matter, which has mass greater than ~ 10 ^ 7 GeV and must be produced before reheating ends. Naturally, we refer to this scenario as GUTzilla dark matter. Here we present a minimal GUTzilla model, adding a vector-like quark multiplet to the Standard Model. Proton decay constraints require the new multiplet to be both color and electroweak charged, which prompts us to include a new confining SU(3) gauge group that binds the multiplet into a neutral composite dark matter candidate. Current direct detection constraints are evaded due to the large dark matter mass; meanwhile, next-generation direct detection and proton decay experiments will probe much of the parameter space. The relic abundance {{is strongly dependent on}} the dynamics of the hidden confining sector, and we show that dark matter production during the epoch of reheating can give the right abundance.

40|$|We {{constrain}} mass, {{lifetime and}} contribution {{of a very}} slowly decaying Ultra Heavy Dark Matter (UHDM) by simulating the cosmological evolution of its remnants. Most of interactions which participate in energy dissipation {{are included in the}} numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. Cross-sections are calculated either analytically or by using PYTHIA Monte Carlo program. This paper describes in detail our simulation. To show the importance of the distribution of matter in constraining <b>WIMPZILLA</b> characteristics, we consider two extreme cases: a homogeneous universe, and a local halo with uniform distribution. We show that in a homogeneous universe, the decay of UHDM with a mass ∼ 10 ^ 15 GeV and a lifetime ∼ a few times τ_ 0 the age of the Universe, can not explain the flux of observed Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). This shows the importance of nearby sources, notably galactic halo. In a uniform clump with an over-density of ∼ 200 extended to 100 kpc or more, the lifetime must be ∼ 10 - 100 τ_ 0 or the contribution in the DM must be proportionally smaller. If the model developed by DIRBE group for estimating galactic IR underestimates the Galactic background or there is a significant galactic radio background, the lifetime can approach the lower limit of this range. We also compare our calculation with observed distribution of UHDM with relatively short lifetime...|$|E
40|$|Sources of isocurvature {{perturbations}} {{and large}} non-Gaussianities include field {{degrees of freedom}} whose vacuum expectation values are smaller than the expansion rate of inflation. The inhomogeneities in the energy density of such fields are quadratic in the fields to leading order in the inhomogeneity expansion. Although it is often assumed that such isocurvature perturbations and inflaton-driven curvature perturbations are uncorre- lated, this is not obvious from a direct computational point of view due to {{the form of the}} minimal gravitational interactions. We thus compute the irreducible gravitational contributions to the quadratic isocurvature-curvature cross-correlation. We find a small but non-decaying cross-correlation, which in principle serves as a consistency prediction of this large class of isocurvature perturbations. We apply our cross-correlation result to two dark matter isocurvature perturbation scenarios: QCD axions and <b>WIMPZILLAs.</b> On the technical side, we utilize a gravita- tional Ward identity in a novel manner to demonstrate the gauge invariance of the computation. Furthermore, the detailed computation is interpreted in terms of a soft-ζ theorem and a gravitational Ward identity. Finally, we also identify explicitly all the counterterms that are necessary for renormalizing the isocurvature perturbation composite operator in inflationary cosmological backgrounds.

The top-down and bottom-up scenarii are contrasted. We summarize the essential features underlying the top-down scenarii for EECR, namely, the lifetime and the mass imposed to the heavy relics whatever they be: topological and non-topological solitons, X-particles, cosmic defects, microscopic black-holes, fundamental strings. An unified formula for the quantum decay rate of all these objects was provided in hep-ph/ 0202249. The key point in the top-down scenarii is the necessity to adjust the lifetime of the heavy object {{to the age of}} the universe. The natural lifetimes of such heavy objects are, however, microscopic times associated to the GUT energy scale (sim 10 ^- 28 sec. or shorter); such heavy objects could have been abundantly formed by the end of inflation and it seems natural they decayed shortly after being formed. The arguments produced to fine tune the relics lifetime to {{the age of the universe}} are critically analyzed. The annihilation scenario (`Wimpzillas') is analyzed too. Top-down scenarii based on networks of topological defects are strongly disfavored at the light of the recent CMB anisotropy observations. We discuss the acceleration mechanisms of cosmic rays,their possible astrophysical sources and the main open physical problems and difficulties in the context of bottom-up scenarii, and we conclude by outlining the expectations from future observatories like EUSO and where the theoretical effort should be placed...|$|R
40|$|Since 1990 's the {{detection}} of extremely energetic air showers and precise astronomical measurements have proved that our knowledge about fundamental laws of Nature {{is far from being}} complete. These observations have found convincing evidences against two popular believes: The spectrum of Cosmic Rays would have a steep cutoff at energies around $ 10 ^{ 19 }eV$ (GZK cutoff) and the contravortial quantity called Cosmological Constant (dark energy) should be strictly zero. They have been important additions to the yet unsolved mystery of the nature of dark matter. For both phenomena many models have been suggested. The top-down model decay of a Superheavy Dark Matter(SDM), also called <b>WIMPZILLA</b> as the origin of the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) - {{is one of the most}} favorite candidates. Here we show that a meaningful constraints on the mass, lifetime and cosmological contribution of SDM is possible only if the energy dissipation of the remnants is precisely taken into account. We discuss the simulation of relevant processes and their evolution in the cosmological environment. We show that such a dark matter can be the dominant component of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) with a relatively short lifetime. Moreover, the equation of State of the Universe in this model fits the Supernova type Ia data better than a stable dark matter. If a small fraction of the mass of the SDM decays to an axion-like scalar field, its condensation can also explain the dark energy without need for extreme fine tuning of the parameters. Presumably, a meta-stable dark matter can explain 3 mysteries of Physics and Cosmology. Finally we review some of the particle physics and cosmological issues related to SDM and its associated quintessence field.
