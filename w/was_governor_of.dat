5|$|Atlanta was {{a rapidly}} growing city {{in the years before}} Piedmont Park. From 1860 to 1890, the {{population}} jumped from 9,554 to 65,533 residents. Those years saw the opening of many education institutions such as Morehouse College (1867), Clark College (1869), Spelman College (1881), Morris Brown College (1882), Georgia School of Technology (now known as the Georgia Institute of Technology) (1885), and Agnes Scott College (1890).

5|$|In November 1993, David Hale—the {{source of}} {{criminal}} allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy—alleged {{that while he}} <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for {{their role in the}} Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.|$|E
5|$|It was a {{long time}} after the Brooks–Baxter War that people of Arkansas allowed another Republican to become governor. The {{following}} 35 governors of Arkansas, ruling for a total of 90 years, were all Democrats, until Republican Winthrop Rockefeller became governor in 1966 defeating James D. Johnson. Winthrop became governor while his brother Nelson <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> New York, while the defeat of Johnson in Arkansas and William M. Rainach in Louisiana ended the once mighty hold of segregation over politics.|$|E

5|$|Mansur was {{dismissed}} in 1579 {{and replaced by}} his son Muhammad, who was imprisoned by the authorities in 1584 for alleged involvement in a looting raid against an Istanbul-bound caravan. He was restored to Keserwan in 1585 and was given tax collection authority over the rural districts of Tripoli Eyalet; this brought him into conflict with the Sayfa clan, the Assafs' erstwhile Turkmen clients, one of whose members, Yusuf Pasha Sayfa, <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> Tripoli. The Assaf realm dissipated in 1591 when Muhammad was killed while attempting to collect taxes from the Sayfas in Akkar. Afterward, Yusuf Pasha Sayfa married Muhammad's widow and inherited the Assaf realm.|$|E
5|$|Qutayba's role in {{the conquest}} and gradual Islamization of Central Asia was crucial, and in later times, a number of {{locations}} in Ferghana where his tomb was supposedly located (Narshakhi and Jamal Qarsh) were venerated by pilgrims. His descendants too continued to hold influential positions: his son Qatan served as governor of Bukhara, Salm, another son, governed Basra and Rayy, and his nephew Muslim <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> Balkh. His grandsons, especially the numerous sons of Salm, continued in high office under the Abbasids {{until well into the}} 9th century.|$|E
5|$|The Gospel of Luke {{says the}} census from Caesar Augustus took place when Quirinius <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> Syria. Tipler {{suggests}} {{this took place}} in AD 6, nine years {{after the death of}} Herod, and that the family of Jesus left Bethlehem shortly after the birth. Some scholars explain the apparent disparity as an error {{on the part of the}} author of the Gospel of Luke, concluding that he was more concerned with creating a symbolic narrative than a historical account, and was either unaware of, or indifferent to, the chronological difficulty.|$|E

5|$|Without {{appointing}} a crown prince, Aurangzeb died in 1707 when Mu'azzam <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> Kabul and his half-brothers (Muhammad Kam Bakhsh and Muhammad Azam Shah) {{were the}} governors of the Deccan and Gujarat respectively. All three sons intended to win the crown, and Kam Bakhsh began minting coins in his name. Azam prepared to march to Agra and declare himself successor, but was defeated by Mu'azzam at the Battle of Jajau in June 1707. Azam and his son, Ali Tabar, {{were killed in the}} battle. Mu'azzam ascended the Mughal throne at age 63 on 19 June 1707, with the title of Bahadur Shah I.|$|E
5|$|A few Gabrades also {{remained}} in the Pontus, where they entered {{the service of the}} Empire of Trebizond, established by the exiled Komnenoi shortly before the dissolution of the Byzantine Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204: most notably, {{a member of the family}} <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> Sinope during the brief period when it was reclaimed from the Turks by Trebizond (ca. 1254 or 1258/9 – 1265 or 1267/8). Other family members are mentioned as landholders, mostly in the bandon (province) of Matzouka, south of Trebizond: Andronikos Gavras, probably in the 13th century; a George Gabras ca. 1344/5; Kosmas, a military leader (polemarchos) in the bandon of Matzouka ca. 1378; and Theodore Gabras in Gemora in the early 15th century.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{the credit}} {{was given to}} Augustus for each {{subsequent}} Roman military victory after this time, {{because the majority of}} Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus' proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. Lucius Cornelius Balbus was the last man outside Augustus' family to receive this award, in 19BC. (Balbus was the nephew of Julius Caesar's great agent, who <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> Africa and conqueror of the Garamantes.) Tiberius, Augustus' eldest son by marriage to Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph—for victories in Germania in 7BC.|$|E
5|$|Hamdan was {{defeated}} in 895 and imprisoned with his relatives, but his son Husayn ibn Hamdan managed to secure the family's future. He raised troops for the Caliph among the Taghlib in exchange for tax remissions, and established a commanding influence in the Jazira by acting as a mediator between the Abbasid authorities and the Arab and Kurdish population. It was this strong local base which allowed the family to survive its often strained relationship with the central Abbasid government in Baghdad during the early 10th century. Husayn was a successful general, distinguishing himself against the Kharijites and the Tulunids, but was disgraced after supporting the failed usurpation of Ibn al-Mu'tazz in 908. His younger brother Ibrahim <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> Diyar Rabi'a (the province around Nasibin) in 919 and {{after his death in}} the next year he was succeeded by another brother, Dawud. Sayf al-Dawla's father Abdallah served as emir (governor) of Mosul in 905/6–913/4, was repeatedly disgraced and rehabilitated, until re-assuming control of Mosul in 925/6. Enjoying firm relations with the powerful Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, he later played {{a leading role in the}} short-lived usurpation of al-Qahir against al-Muqtadir in 929, and was killed during its suppression.|$|E
5|$|While the amir al-umara Ibn Ra'iq was {{in power}} in Baghdad (936–938) with al-Ikhshid's old friend al-Fadl ibn Ja'far ibn al-Furat as vizier, {{relations}} with Baghdad were good. Following Ibn Ra'iq's replacement by the Turk Bajkam, however, Ibn Ra'iq received a nomination by the caliph to the governorship of Syria and in 939 marched west to claim it from al-Ikhshid's forces. Ibn Ra'iq's appointment enraged al-Ikhshid, who sent an envoy to Baghdad to clarify the situation. There Bajkam informed him that the caliph might appoint whomever he chose, but that it ultimately did not matter: it was military strength that would determine who <b>was</b> <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> Syria and even of Egypt, not any appointment by a figurehead caliph. If either Ibn Ra'iq or al-Ikhshid emerged victorious from the conflict, caliphal confirmation would soon follow. Al-Ikhshid was even more infuriated by the reply, and reportedly for a time even threatened to give one of his daughters to the Fatimid caliph al-Qa'im and to have coins minted and the Friday prayer read in his name rather than the Abbasid caliph, until the Abbasids formally reconfirmed his position. The Fatimids themselves were preoccupied with the revolt of Abu Yazid and were unable to offer any assistance.|$|E
