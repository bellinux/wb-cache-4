5|$|Even {{when dealing}} with music, Euler’s {{approach}} is mainly mathematical. His <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> music are not particularly numerous (a few hundred pages, in his total production of about thirty thousand pages), but they reflect an early preoccupation and one that did not leave him throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Tetsuji Takechi {{was born}} Tetsuji Kawaguchi in Osaka on 10 December 1912 {{to a family}} headed by a wealthy industrialist. He studied {{economics}} at Kyoto National University and graduated in 1936. Takechi first became known for his criticism and theoretical <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> the theater. In 1939 he began publishing a journal, Stage Review in which he printed his <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> the theater. In the early 1940s, he began publishing collections of these writings in book form. When World War II came to an end, Takechi used his inheritance from his father to establish a theatrical troupe. Under his direction, the Takechi Kabuki, as the group was known, put Takechi's theatrical ideas into practise by giving innovative and popular performances of kabuki classics in Osaka from 1945 to 1955.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle's <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> biology, {{the first}} in the history of science, are {{scattered}} across several books, forming about a quarter of his writings that have survived. The main biology texts were the History of Animals, Generation of Animals, Movement of Animals, Progression of Animals, Parts of Animals, and On the Soul, as well as the lost drawings of The Anatomies which accompanied the History.|$|E
5|$|He {{received}} {{the education of}} a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying rhetoric and literature. In his biography in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, Suetonius attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as Homer or Virgil on appropriate occasions, and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation. Among his first published works were poetry, as well as <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> law and administration.|$|E

5|$|Irving's <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> Columbus are {{a mixture}} of history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on {{extensive}} research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works {{is the source of}} the durable myth that medieval Europeans believed the Earth was flat. (See Myth of the flat earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.|$|E

The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished {{during this period}} under such well known scholars as Madhava (c. 1340–1425) who made important contributions to Trigonometery and Calculus, and Nilakantha Somayaji (c. 1444–1545) who postulated on the orbitals of planets.|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of their debut album, Destiny's Child re-entered the studio quickly, {{bringing}} in a new lineup of producers, including Kevin [...] "She'kspere" [...] Briggs and Rodney Jerkins. Coming up with The <b>Writing's</b> <b>on</b> the Wall, they released it on July 27, 1999 and it eventually became their breakthrough album. The <b>Writing's</b> <b>on</b> the Wall peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and number two on R chart in early 2000. [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] was released in 1999 as the album's lead single and reached the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their first US number-one single. The <b>Writing's</b> <b>on</b> the Wall has been credited as Destiny's Child's breakthrough album, spurring their career and introducing them to a wider audience. The main key to the group's breakthrough was the album's third single, [...] "Say My Name", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks. The successful release of the singles bolstered the album's sales, eventually selling over eight million copies in the United States, gaining eight-time platinum certification by the RIAA. The <b>Writing's</b> <b>on</b> the Wall sold more than 11 million copies worldwide {{and was one of the}} top-selling albums of 2000.|$|R
5|$|Until {{his final}} years, Wagner's life was characterised by {{political}} exile, turbulent love affairs, poverty and repeated flight from his creditors. His controversial <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> music, drama and politics have attracted extensive comment, notably, {{since the late}} 20th century, where they express antisemitic sentiments. The effect of his ideas can be traced {{in many of the}} arts throughout the 20th century; his influence spread beyond composition into conducting, philosophy, literature, the visual arts and theatre.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for some}} 17 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of Lesbos and the marine life in the island's lagoon at Pyrrha. This study made him the earliest natural historian whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. His <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5|$|Busoni {{was born}} in Empoli, just south of Florence; {{he was the son}} of {{professional}} musicians. Initially trained by his father, he later studied at the Vienna Conservatory and then with Wilhelm Mayer and Carl Reinecke. In the ensuing years, after brief periods teaching in Helsinki, Boston, and Moscow, he devoted himself to composing, teaching, and touring as a virtuoso pianist in Europe and the United States. His <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> music were influential; they covered not only aesthetics but considerations of microtones and other innovative topics. He was based in Berlin from 1894 but spent much of World War I in Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to inscriptions, chronicles called Vamshavalis were written to provide historical details of dynasties. Writings in Sanskrit included poetry, grammar, lexicon, manuals, rhetoric, commentaries on older works, prose fiction and drama. In Kannada, <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> secular subjects became popular. Some well-known works are Chandombudhi, a prosody, and Karnataka Kadambari, a romance, both written by Nagavarma I, a lexicon called Rannakanda by Ranna (993), {{a book on}} medicine called Karnataka-Kalyanakaraka by Jagaddala Somanatha, the earliest writing on astrology called Jatakatilaka by Sridharacharya (1049), a writing on erotics called Madanakatilaka by Chandraraja, and an encyclopedia called Lokapakara by Chavundaraya II (1025).|$|E
5|$|Kanti (1108), {{known for}} her wit and humour, {{was one of the}} {{earliest}} female poets of the Kannada language and a contemporary of Nagachandra, with whom she indulged in debates and repartees. Rajaditya, a native of either Puvinabage or Raibhag (the modern Belgaum district), was in the Hoysala court during the days of King Veera BallalaI and King Vishnuvardhana. He wrote in easy verse on arithmetic and other mathematical topics and is credited with three of the earliest <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> mathematics in the Kannada language: Vyavaharaganita, Kshetraganita and Lilavati. Udayaditya, a Chola prince, authored a piece on rhetoric called Udayadityalankara (1150). It was based on Dandin's Sanskrit Kavyadarsa.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce {{appears in}} many medieval writings, {{especially}} as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned {{it in her}} <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses. In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces– head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine (or cos) lettuce. Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties were developed in Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.|$|E

50|$|The album debuted {{at number}} six on the US Billboard 200 chart on August 14, 1999, with first-week sales of 132,000 units, and later peaked at number five on May 6, 2000. It earned Destiny's Child six Grammy {{nominations}} for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals (twice), Best R&B Song (twice), Record of the Year, and Song of the Year. The <b>Writing's</b> <b>on</b> the Wall was certified 8× Platinum by the RIAA on November 6, 2001, and has sold over 6 {{million copies in}} the United States alone. Billboard magazine ranked The <b>Writing's</b> <b>on</b> the Wall at number 39 on the magazine's Top 200 Albums of the Decade.|$|R

5|$|The most {{significant}} evolutionary theory before Darwin's {{was that of}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck; based on the inheritance of acquired characteristics (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Thomas Malthus's <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> Jews, {{including}} Jewishness in Music, {{corresponded to}} some existing trends of thought in Germany during the 19th century; however, despite his very public views on these themes, {{throughout his life}} Wagner had Jewish friends, colleagues and supporters. There have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in Wagner's operas. The characters of Mime in the Ring, Sixtus Beckmesser in Die Meistersinger, and Klingsor in Parsifal are sometimes claimed as Jewish representations, though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operas. The topic of Wagner and the Jews is further complicated by allegations, {{which may have been}} credited by Wagner, that he himself was of Jewish ancestry, via his supposed father Geyer.|$|E
5|$|Wilde, having {{tired of}} journalism, had been busy setting out his {{aesthetic}} ideas more fully {{in a series}} of longer prose pieces which were published in the major literary-intellectual journals of the day. In January 1889, The Decay of Lying: A Dialogue appeared in The Nineteenth Century, and Pen, Pencil and Poison, a satirical biography of Thomas Griffiths Wainewright, in The Fortnightly Review, edited by Wilde's friend Frank Harris. Two of Wilde's four <b>writings</b> <b>on</b> aesthetics are dialogues: though Wilde had evolved professionally from lecturer to writer, he retained an oral tradition of sorts. Having always excelled as a wit and raconteur, he often composed by assembling phrases, bons mots and witticisms into a longer, cohesive work.|$|E
