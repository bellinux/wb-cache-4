40|$|In {{the present}} context of {{organizational}} {{changes and the}} inevitable conflicts coming with these changes, <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> are confronted with new challenges in negotiation. <b>Worker</b> <b>representatives</b> act as mediator in organizational conflicts between management and employees. New and complex issues and growing diversity in constituents can increase stress of <b>worker</b> <b>representatives.</b> On the basis of models of interpersonal conflict at work (e. g. Frone, 2000), we analyze the relation between frequency and severity of conflict with management and co-workers, and burnout. Thus, we hypothesize that: a.) frequency and intensity of conflict with management and with co-workers are positively related with burn out; b) This effect is stronger for conflict with co-workers (in-group), compared with conflict with management (out-group); c.) conflict with co-workers plays a moderator effect in the relation between conflict with management and burnout. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 719 Spanish <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> using multiple regression analysis. Results confirm our three main hypotheses and show that conflict with the constituency affects more strongly the perceived burnout by <b>worker</b> <b>representatives.</b> Based on organizational psychology and sociological theories we discuss different reasons that justify these results. Studying predictors from burnout in <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> contribute to promote the well-being {{in the practice of}} their role. We put into practice improvement strategies through knowledge transfer and action plans which can help to improve the role of <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> in the new industrial relations context. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Changing {{industrial}} relations are affecting {{the role of}} <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> around Europe. <b>Worker</b> <b>representatives</b> more and more are negotiating with management {{on behalf of the}} employees, and act as a mediator between management and their co-workers. This challenging position is still mostly occupied by men, with {{only a small percentage of}} <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> being female, although participation of women would contribute to more social innovations, according to Dean (2006). One reason might be, that female representatives act differently in negotiations, do get involved less in tough bargaining, and perceive less support in the organisation for this demanding role. Therefore we hypothesized: a.) 	Female representatives are more accommodating in conflicts with management, compared with men. b.) 	Accommodating behaviour is related with less perceived job resources (autonomy and social support), especially for women. In this study we approach different theoretical frameworks to analyze the differences in the behaviour of women in their position in the union and in their role as negotiators. We explore the experience of work by male and female <b>worker</b> <b>representatives,</b> focusing on the relation between the perceived job resources (autonomy and social support) and the behaviour in organizational conflicts. We focus on accommodating (giving in) behaviour, which we see as detrimental to their position and the holding of power inside the organizations. To investigate these issues we analyze a sample of 1938 shop stewards, both male and female, from four European countries (Spain, Belgium, Holland and Denmark). Using multiple regression for testing our hypotheses, we arrive at the conclusion that female representatives perceive autonomy and social support differently than male. This differentiation is only significant in countries where women posses less power positions (Spain and Belgium). Consequently, the conflict management behaviour of male and female is affected differently. We explore interventions to promote women in the role as <b>worker</b> <b>representatives,</b> as trade unions seem to be still male – dominated organisations. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Worker</b> <b>representatives</b> play a {{mediator}} role in organizational conflict; as {{they deal with}} conflicts with the management {{as well as with}} co-workers, however “conflict with coworkers” are defined by themselves as “conflict with his/her own family”. On the basis of Frone´s (2000) interpersonal conflict at work model, we analyze if conflict with management and with co-workers predict burnout. We add to his model the hypothesis that conflicts either with management (outsiders) or with co-workers (insiders) will predict personal psychological outcomes (i. e. burnout). Furthermore, we study how the two kinds of conflicts are positively correlated, due to the influence of the organizational climate and finally, the moderator effect of the conflict with co-workers in the relation between conflict with the management and the burnout as outcome. A sample of 719 Spanish <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> confirms our hypotheses. The findings of this study have important implications for training programs of <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> in organizational conflict management and well-being at work. Our final goal is to put into practice improvement strategies through knowledge transfer and action plans which are more efficient for society and can help to improve the new industrial relations from a social perspective. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|The tramways {{workers were}} {{initially}} seeking {{to end the}} new Condition of Services introduced by the Hong Kong Tramways. But the political elements eventually changed the focus to disputes between the management and unions with political background. In 1951, the Hong Kong government proposed {{that most of the}} workers' variable living allowance paid by their employers should be included as part of the basic wage. The Hong Kong Tramways then launched a new Condition of Services along with the new wage plan, stating that other than allowances, dismissal and retirement compensations would also be considered as part of the basic wage. Most of the workers were opposed to the new Condition of Services. The Hong Kong Tramway Workers' Union (HKTWU) even asked for mediation from the Labor Department with Hong Kong Tramways. The HKTWU, a member of the left-wing Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions. After they announced their intention to mediate with Hong Kong Tramways through the Labour department, left-wing organisations and unions actively showed support to them. Considering the political background of HKTWU, the Hong Kong Tramways refused to attend mediation with HKTWU. Instead, they held a meeting with <b>workers</b> <b>representatives,</b> given that workers could not claim to be representatives of the HKTWU. These meetings went on for several months, and Hong Kong Tramways at last agreed to change mandatory participation in the new Condition of Services to voluntary-based participation. The Tramway workers gained success in the negotiation with Hong Kong Tramways, but HKTWU then requested recognition from Hong Kong Tramways, which turned the dispute into political means. The Hong Kong Tramways recognised another non-political Tramway workers' union, but refused to recognise the HKTWU, which led to discontents among HKTWU members and other left-wing organisations and unions. The conflict became more intense after three tramway workers were dismissed on 20 April 1952. The HKTWU met with Hong Kong Tramways, asking to restore the three workers' position. Lots of workers gathered outside the Russell Street tram depot, waiting for the result of the meeting. The meeting continued for two days. Two of the three workers were eventually reinstated.|$|E

The pressure of <b>workers</b> <b>representatives</b> in establishments where unions are powerful is found to reduce the likelihood of flexible pay, while the effect of direct participation on its own is negligible. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{socioeconomic}} {{development of}} most European countries {{has been largely}} shaped by social dialogue, by negotiations between employers and <b>workers</b> <b>representatives.</b> To that respect, Belgium has played a pivotal role. The Belgian post-WW 2 institutions, aimed at fostering social dialogue, are often alluded to as a reference. In sixty years, these institutions have changed, along with the transformations of the economic, social and political context. We study here the dynamical movement that simultaneously transforms the social dialogue, on the one hand, and the historical context {{in which it is}} anchored, on the other. We contrast two thirty-year periods: the golden age, followed by an age of upheaval. The former is characterized by the setting up and the extension of a coherent model while the latter rather appears as a defensive withdrawal in a context of crisis and of socioeconomic upheaval. In the midst of the turmoil, the social partners uneasily seek for meaningful responses. ...|$|E

But in the eighties, the Government did not restrain itself any longer to a mere control function and started taking decisions regarding the financial management. Thus, despite an evident continuity of the model, {{the evolution of the}} last twenty years is characterized by an increasing state intervention which leads to structural reforms officializing a kind of triparty global management and quadriparty management in public health insurance.

40|$|This study {{examines}} two innovative {{efforts to provide}} union services to workers {{with the aid of}} low cost Internet communication: the AFL-CIO's Working America, a "community affiliate" that enrolled 2 million workers from 2004 to 2007 by canvassing them at their homes and over the Internet (www. workingamerica. org); and the UK'S Trade Union Congress's www. unionreps. org. uk, a discussion board for <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> to communicate about workplace issues. Working America demonstrates that workers without collective bargaining will join a union organization that communicates on-line and off-line and campaigns for worker interests in society. Unionreps. org shows that local <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> can form an on-line community that shares information to improve the services they give workers.

In this article {{attention is focused on}} worker participation related to occupational safety and health in the Netherlands. Worker participation can refer either to direct or indirect participation by the worker. Indirect participation involves employee representation, while direct participation relates to individual involvement in management’s decision-making processes. In the Framework Directive 89 / 391 /EEC two articles (art. 10 and 11) are explicitly dedicated to the involvement of workers in occupational safety and health issues. At the same time Directive 2002 / 14 /EC provides a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community. Both directives have been implemented in the Dutch legislation on occupational safety and health. This article describes the role of workers and <b>workers</b> <b>representatives</b> on three levels: national, sectoral and company level, with special attention to occupational safety and health issues.
