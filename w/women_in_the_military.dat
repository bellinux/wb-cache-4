5|$|The war {{affected}} Australia in many ways, although arguably not as greatly {{as it did}} {{the many}} European nations that were more directly involved. Economically the war {{had a number of}} significant impacts, although the Great Depression would later prove far more significant and Australian industry was not as greatly transformed as it would be following World War II. The political landscape was also transformed due to the rifts that resulted from the issue of conscription, while to a smaller extent {{the role of women in}} society also evolved as more women entered the workforce. Indeed, between 1914 and 1918 there had been a 13 per cent increase in the employment of women; however, this was mainly in areas were women were traditionally employed. Equally, although around 2,000 women were employed as nurses in the AIF, there was no great involvement of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> during the war.|$|E

2500|$|The anti-war {{sentiment}} by Asian Americans {{was fueled}} by the racial inequality that they faced in the United States. As historian Daryl Maeda notes, [...] "the antiwar movement articulated Asian Americans’ racial commonality with Vietnamese people in two distinctly gendered ways: identification based on the experiences of male soldiers and identification by women." [...] Asian American soldiers in the U.S. military were many times classified as being like the enemy. They were referred to as gooks and had a racialized identity in comparison to their non-Asian counterparts. There was also the hypersexualization of Vietnamese women which in turn affected how Asian American <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> were treated. [...] "In a Gidra article, , Evelyn Yoshimura noted that the U.S. military systematically portrayed Vietnamese women as prostitutes {{as a way of}} dehumanizing them." [...] Asian American groups realized in order to extinguish racism, they also had to address sexism as well. This in turn led to women’s leadership in the Asian American antiwar movement. Patsy Chan, a “Third World” activist, said at an antiwar rally in San Francisco, “We, as Third World women [...] our militant solidarity with our brothers and sisters from Indochina. We, as Third World people know of the struggle the Indochinese are waging against imperialism, because we share that common enemy in the United States.” [...] Some other notable figures were Grace Lee Boggs and Yuri Kochiyama. Both Boggs and Kochiyama were inspired by the civil rights movement of the 1960s and “a growing number of Asian Americans began to push forward a new era in radical Asian American politics.” ...|$|E
