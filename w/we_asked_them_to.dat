In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> because it dealt with disarmament.

5000|$|The name of {{the church}} is much {{reported}} and commented upon.

When we are cursed, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it; / when we are slandered, we answer kindly. We have become the scum of the earth, the garbage of the world—right up to this moment. [...] As described by Mike Sares to Bob Whitesel, [...] The name… resulted from the people we were reaching… <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> choose a name. Reese Roper from the band Five Iron Frenzy suggested Scum of the Earth. I was out and asked everyone to pray about it for a week. In the interim I called some mentors who told me not to do it. Next week we voted, and Scrum won. And I'm glad we did it. [...] It has elsewhere been reported that Sares initially expressed concern over possible controversy that could result from the name, but that he ultimately agreed with the group.|$|E

5000|$|The pogrom {{lasted for}} about seven days during which Central {{authorities}} {{did little to}} stop the violence - no state of emergency was declared in Baku.The police was not responding to the calls of the victims.Several eyewitnesses told Helsinki Watch/Memorial that they [...] "approached militiamen(police) on the street to report nearby attacks on Armenians, but the militiamen did nothing". Many testimonies confirm that the police deliberately did nothing {{to put an end to}} the pogrom and that everything was organised in advance as the pogrom makers knew exactly where the Armenian lived. Azaddin Gyulmamedov, a young Azerbaijani who attended the rally in Baku on the 13th and witnessed the outbreak of anti-Armenian violence, gave the following testimony:We went to see what was happening. We saw these guys in the streets. I don't know who they were -drug addicts, maybe. They had sticks and clubs, and lists of Armenians and where they lived. They wanted to break down the doors of Armenian apartments and chase them out. The police didn't do anything. They just stood and watched. Same with the soldiers, who had weapons. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> help.

30|$|For {{achieving}} the second goal, we applied a mixed-method approach to analyze if and how developers can effectively find design problems when reflecting upon stinky code. This study comprised both {{quantitative and qualitative}} analyses. For the quantitative analysis, we compared the precision of the developers with a baseline, i.e., situations where only single smells were given to them. As we want to assess if multiple smells can help developers to reveal more design problems than single smells, we divided the developers into two groups. In the first group, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> identify design problems through the analysis of stinky program locations. In the second group, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> identify design problems with the analysis of single smells. After that, we inverted the groups, and <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> repeat the identification of design problems in a second system. In each identification task, we used the group that identified design problems with single smells as the control group. Thus, we could use the control group to measure if the analysis of stinkier program locations can improve the precision of design problem identification.|$|E

What follows is a manifesto of how honors education can serve as a resistant force against the increasing encroachment of a wholly utilitarian concept of education. With the costs of higher education on the rise, the call to justify getting a college degree has been indissolubly linked to the ability to obtain a job once the student graduates. What has been lost along the way is the justification of getting an education for the sake of enriching one’s life and one’s community, a model of education that is increasingly available only to the privileged. The humanities have taken the brunt of criticism aimed at such a justification, but the jobs-based model that so preoccupies social discourse is a misguided objective that will eventually turn our work force into semiliterate specialists whose main task is to keep the economy moving...|$|R
