50|$|Waste {{disposal}} is {{the principal}} cause of water pollution {{in the state of}} Santa Catarina. Coal strip mining methods and the surface disposal of waste rock results in the contamination of surface and ground waters. The Tuburão, Urussanga, and Araranguá Rivers in the state of Santa Catarina comprise the state’s coal basin where there are 134 strip mine sites, 115 <b>waste</b> <b>deposit</b> areas, 77 sites with acidic pools, and hundreds of underground mines, and thus receive the majority of the waste generated. Coal drainage from each of these locations is responsible for high levels of water contamination. The resulting acidic streams affect local vegetation and prevent re-vegetation of affected areas.|$|E

Lake Le Bourget and Lake Paladru are situated at low elevations (respectively 231 m– 492 m) and Lake Blanc Huez is located at 2500 m altitude.

50|$|The west block {{consisted}} {{of housing and}} administrative quarters and isseparated into three different units consisting of multiple rooms of different sizes. In the rooms thought to be housing units they found hearths and domestic ceramics. Ceramics used for cooking were found which dated to the later part of the Twelfth Dynasty.

Inside this refuse they found a variety of pottery used for cooking and household practices as well as administrative seals and debris. The finding of these seals leads to the belief that this section of the temple must have been used to house the administrative employees who worked in the temple.

40|$|Ljubljana’s <b>waste</b> <b>deposit</b> is {{situated}} on rather thick formation of quaternary sediments {{on the northern}} margin of Ljubljansko Barje (Ljubljana Moor). The upper part of quaternary sediments consists of high compressive silty and clayey layers till the depth of aprox. 33 m. These layers are very heterogeneous and one can only find one continuous clayey gravel layer among them at the depth of 8 m and 4 m thick. Below these layers there is the Upper gravel aquifer and from the depth of 72 m there is the Lower gravel aquifer. The bottom of quaternary sediments is aprox. at 140 m depth. The consolidationof highly compressive upper layers and organic compounds from landfill leachate produce the evident impact by reducing conditions in the geological layers below the <b>waste</b> <b>deposit.</b> Though we can detect the reducing conditions also from natural environment in confined layers and rich organic matter content and also from other sources of contamination in the highly urbanized environment.

40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{the evaluation of}} the reclamation efficiencyon coal combustion <b>waste</b> <b>deposits</b> fertilized with composts and sewage sludge. Based on multiannual studies, the dynamics of changes in vegetation in the performed experiment have been shown. The firstphase of the experiment concerning the reclamation efficiencyof the employed fertilizers was carried out from 2006 to 2007. The second phase was carried out between 2011 and 2012. In order to show a broader spectrum of dynamics of changes in vegetation, the floristicobservation was repeated in 2013 and this paper is the presentation of its outcome. Based on the observation (2011 – 2013) and its results it was found that apart from plants cultivated in experimental containers also a self-sown florahas had a significantcontribution in shap-ing the vegetation cover. The results of floristic and ecological research have proven that composts and sewage sludge constitute a favorable environment for the development of spontaneous vegetation cover on coal combustion <b>waste</b> <b>deposits.</b> Based on {{the evaluation of the}} vegetation cover level in particular models it was shown that models with Complex composts (kC) and Radiowo ones (kRa) as well as the model with sewage sludge have pre-sented the highest reclamation efficienc.

40|$|Problem statement: Mining {{activities}} {{involve the}} removal of the vegetal cover and the soil&# 13; organic layer, causing a severe environmental impact. In Northeast Brazil, 40 % of the worlds crude&# 13; gypsum is found in a semiarid area, making this region responsible for 95 % of the gypsum demand in&# 13; the national market. Although economically important, this activity is harmful to the environment. &# 13; Studies of soil microbiological and biochemical attributes can help in the identification of the&# 13; limitations of impacted ecosystems, providing data to define strategies for sustainability of such&# 13; environments. Approach: To evaluate and compare the biological state of preserved and mining&# 13; degraded semiarid soils, a native preserved area and areas impacted by gypsum mining were selected&# 13; at the Araripina Experimental Station, located in the semiarid region of Pernambuco State, Northeast&# 13; Brazil. The four sampling areas included: (1) A native, preserved ï¿½caatingaï¿½ area with spine bearing&# 13; trees and shrubs and some characteristic xerophytic plants (AN); (2) An area surrounding the mine,&# 13; presenting the same type of vegetation although already degraded (AM); (3) A <b>waste</b> <b>deposit</b> area&# 13; (AR); (4) Interface area between the <b>waste</b> <b>deposit</b> and a mining degraded area (AI). Samples were&# 13; taken in each area (1000 m 2) during two periods: wet (December/ 2003, Rainfall = 28. 7 mm) and dry&# 13; (September/ 2004, Rainfall = 1. 3 mm). Results: Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis values, microbial&# 13; biomass C and basal respiration were higher in the preserved caatinga than in the impacted areas. &# 13; The gypsum mining activity reduced the concentration of easily extractable glomalin in relation to the&# 13; native caatinga area in both sampling periods. Higher deposits of total glomalin also occurred in the&# 13; native area, however, mainly during the wet period. Conclusion: The mining activity produced a&# 13; negative impact on the soil microbiota, reducing the total enzymatic activity. The microbial biomass&# 13; was significantly lower in the <b>waste</b> <b>deposit</b> area than in the native and interface areas. The results&# 13; indicated that the mining activity is harmful to the soil microbiota in this area and that glomalin can be&# 13; a useful indicator of soil disturbance...|$|E
