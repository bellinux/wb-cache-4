40|$|In {{the last}} few years, due to changes of consumers’ eating habits “quality wine” (“DOCG” – Designation of Origin Guaranteed, “DOC” – Designation of Origin, “IGT” – Typical Geographic Indication) demand has {{significantly}} changed. Wine, no longer considered only as an alcoholic drink, it now represents {{something that needs to}} satisfy the consumer’s desire of wellness and wellbeing. The evolution of wine sector, primarily related to consumer’s changes in eating habits and lifestyles, has also impacted some area of the supply chain as product distribution and sales. This growing business, characterized by having different types of distribution channels that cover demand of wine at different consumer level, requires the support of marketing teams able to communicate an international media message effective across cultures. Quality wine has now entered the area of social relationships where the emotional feeling is linked to the “the quality of drinking”. On other hands, it is also important that wine’s producers get complete information on the advantages and the critical issues/constraints of each different distribution channel, in order to easily meet consumers. Wine shops, extremely important distribution channel in the wine marketplace, have been always considered <b>by</b> experts <b>the</b> best sale channel and today they represent also as a trendy place where consumers can buy and drink wine outside home. This trend is also confirmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increasing presence in the market of the so called “wine bars”. These are places, popular among young people, where it’s possible to taste <b>wine</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> along with eating some food and listening music. Therefore on this scientific paper we want to analyze the role of wine shops for the distribution and sale of quality wine. The survey was restricted to the city of Palermo and it was used a two-stage sampling. We analyzed a sample extracted (at the second stage), from the Population of wine shops of the first stage (the extraction procedure was random, at the first stage and reasoned, at the second stage). The questionnaire was submitted to wine shops’ holders/managers and contained closed questions. Through the use of Cluster Analysis it has been possible to classify the wine shop in groups, with homogeneity in number of bottles purchased, cost of purchasing and the chosen brands highlighting marketing choices of wine shops managers/holders focused on of quality wine. In general we were able to know the homogeneity of wine shops that sell quality wines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Wine glass size can {{influence}} both perceptions of portion {{size and the}} amount poured, but its impact upon purchasing and consumption is unknown. This study aimed to {{examine the impact of}} wine glass size on wine sales for on-site consumption, keeping portion size constant. Methods In one establishment (with separate bar and restaurant areas) in Cambridge, England, wine glass size (Standard; Larger; Smaller) was changed over eight fortnightly periods. The bar and restaurant differ in <b>wine</b> sales <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> vs. <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bottle (93  % vs. 63  % <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> respectively). Results Daily wine volume purchased was 9. 4  % (95  % CI: 1. 9, 17. 5) higher when sold in larger compared to standard-sized glasses. This effect seemed principally driven <b>by</b> sales in <b>the</b> bar area (bar: 14. 4  % [3. 3, 26. 7]; restaurant: 8. 2  % [− 2. 5, 20. 1]). Findings were inconclusive as to whether sales were different with smaller vs. standard-sized <b>glasses.</b> Conclusions <b>The</b> size of <b>glasses</b> in which wine is sold, keeping the portion size constant, can affect consumption, with larger <b>glasses</b> increasing consumption. <b>The</b> hypothesised mechanisms for these differential effects need to be tested in a replication study. If replicated, policy implications could include considering glass size amongst alcohol licensing requirements. Trial registration ISRCTN registry: ISRCTN 12018175. Registered 12 th May 2015...|$|R
