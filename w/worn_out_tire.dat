40|$|Abstract- Due {{to overall}} development, new roads is being constructed, and the ever {{increasing}} population {{has raised the}} vehicular density from last few decades. The wear and tear of tires from these vehicles is undoubted. So {{a large number of}} scrap tires are being generated. A large number of waste and <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tires</b> are already in existence and with an annual generation rate of 15 - 20 % each year. These tires are discarded indiscriminately or stockpiled. The used tires pose a great threat to human health and environment, since they are non-biodegradable;the waste tire rubber has become a problem of disposal. This paper is intended to study the feasibility of the waste tire rubber as a blending material in bitumen, which is used for road construction. The Waste tire rubber appears to possess the potential to be partially added in bitumen, providing a recycling opportunity. If Waste or used tire rubber can be added in bitumen for improving the properties, and disposing off the tires, thus the environmental gains can be achieved...|$|R

This year also saw Hopkins involved in a turn 1 crash at the Japanese Grand Prix at Motegi, he was accused of causing this crash, and was suspended for one race. This suspension resulted in a DNS (did not start) at the Malaysian Grand Prix. Also noteworthy for the 2003 season was the crash in Italy where Kenny Roberts, Jr.'s GSV-R Suzuki suffered an engine management failure and the bike launched into Hopkins, putting both GSV-R's out of the race.

40|$|Application {{of scrap}} rubber and <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tires</b> in natural rubber {{compounds}} has been studied. The scrap rubber can, however, be recycled and compounded with natural rubber {{and thus can}} be generated as a rubber composite. In this work, recycled rubber particles (RRP) were prepared using pulverization process. Then, RRP was blended with natural rubber and silica compounds, and it was synthesized by two- roll mill and hydraulic press at specified operating conditions. The samples ranging from 0 to 40  phr of RRP loaded with silica were used as constant filler. The mechanical properties and morphological analysis were carried out. The results showed that tensile strength and elongation at break gradually decreased with increasing RRP loading in natural rubber and silica compounds. Tensile modulus went down at 10  phr of RRP and then showed an increasing trend. Hardness increased up to 30  phr of RRP and tear strength increased up to 20  phr of RRP. A comparative study was also carried out with virgin natural rubber vulcanizates. The incorporation of RRP and silica up to 20  phr in natural rubber did not lower the performance of rubber articles. Morphological studies revealed that better filler dispersion, interfacial adhesion, and cross link density could increase the tensile and tear strengths. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
40|$|BDX has 40 {{years of}} {{experience}} of recycling and reprocessing by-product and residues at SSAB (Swedish Steel AB) in Luleå. BDX would like to find {{other areas of the}} waste industry where their knowledge is useful and where BDX can develop new solutions. Finding new ways to reuse waste tires is one of those, both in terms of material reuse and energy recovery. The goal of this project has been to examine how <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tires</b> can be energy recovered within the geographical region and if it is economically feasible to optimize and improve the current fuel mix in waste fuel boilers by adding rubber from <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tires.</b> Initially, the waste market and its structure were investigated, what rules that are related to burning waste and what characteristics the current fuels have. A situation analysis of the collection and disposal of <b>tires</b> was carried <b>out</b> including how the existing waste facilities in Norrbotten and Västerbotten are operated and their attitude regarding burning tires. This was followed up by a technical analysis with index- and model calculations, to investigate if tires, with or without additional fuels, can have a positive influence on the boiler compared to only burning household and industrial waste from a combustion technical/chemical perspective. A tool for comparing the different mixtures during the index calculations was developed as well as ratios to analyze the model calculations. Finally the economical feasibility of the interesting mixtures was carried out to examine the possibility for BDX to enter this market of fuel delivery and treatment. The analysis of the index calculations compared to the model calculations shows {{that it is possible to}} analyze fuel mixes with the developed tool. However, the points for each mix does not correspond entirely to the results of the model calculations, this means that it should only be used to evaluate if the mix has a positive or negative effect compared to the reference mix. Today, there is no market in delivering a ready-to-burn fuel mix to the heating plants in the northern part of Sweden. There are no interested clients and the willingness to pay is low because it is not economically sustainable. BDX should therefore not enter this market yet, but wait until a change in the pricing of waste has been made and then look into this again. Used tires are a great additional fuel when burning waste because it reduces corrosion in the flue gas as well as sticky and corrosive melts. However, the high energy content of the tires result in a reduced amount of burned household and commercial waste, which leads to the fact that it is not economically viable to burn tires in order to reduce maintenance costs.

40|$|More than 273 million scrap {{tires are}} {{produced}} in India each year. In addition to this, more than 300 million tires are currently stockpiled throughout the country. These stockpiles are dangerous {{not only from}} potential environmental threat,but also from fire hazards and provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

40|$|Objectives: Fatigue is {{typically}} associated with MS, but recent studies {{suggest that it is}} also a problem for patients with stroke. While a direct comparison of fatigue in e. g. Stroke and MS is desirable, it is presently not easily possible because of different definitions and assessment tools used for the two conditions. In the present study we therefore assessed fatigue in Stroke and MS using a generic, not disease-specific instrument to allow transdiagnostic comparison. Method: 137 patients with MS and 102 patients with chronic stroke completed the SF- 36, a generic questionnaire assessing health related quality of life. Fatigue was measured through the vitality scale of the SF- 36. The vitality scale consists of two positive items (lot of energy, full of life) and two negative ones (<b>worn</b> <b>out,</b> <b>tired).</b> The two negative ones were scaled in reverse order. The vitality scale has been recommended as reciprocal index of fatigue. Results: Normalized vitality scores in MS (35. 3) and stroke (42. 1) were clearly lower than published reference values from the SF- 36 in age-matched healthy controls. The sum score of the vitality items was lower in MS than in stroke patients. This difference could not be explained by age, gender or the Physical Functioning Scale of the SF- 36. Both patient groups showed no positive correlation between fatigue and physical functioning. Fatigue – as determined with the vitality scale of the SF- 36 - correlated with the estimated working capacity in MS patients, but not in stroke patients. Conclusions: These findings confirm high fatigue in MS and stroke patients with higher values in MS. Fatigue has a higher impact on working capacity in MS than in stroke. Fatigue in both patient groups is not a direct consequent of physical functioning/impairment. Vitality score of the SF- 36 is a suitable transdiagnostic measure for the assessment of fatigue in stroke and MS...|$|R

40|$|Road traffic {{accidents}} are major causes of morbidity and mortality. It is projected that by 2020 {{they will be}} 3 rd leading cause of global disease burden. Less developed countries like Zambia account for about 85 % of the world’s road traffic fatalities and have had increasing trends. The situation is worse in urbanized cities, like Lusaka, characterized by high densities of both vehicle and human population. This is an epidemiological approach to road {{traffic accidents}} in Lusaka, Zambia focusing on trends, risk factors and counter-measures. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to examine the trends between 2008 and 2012; to identify factors contributing to risk-taking behavior which is associated with causes of road crashes; to investigate how socio-demographic characteristics influence risk taking behavior and to explore counter-measures that can be adopted by relevant authorities in reducing road traffic accidents. Identification of risk factors, data interpretation and discussion are based on knowledge drawn from the System Theory in road traffic accident causation, model for traffic accident causation, Risk Theory of accident causation and Geographical approach to road traffic accidents. The triangulation (quantitative and qualitative) approach which encompassed multiple methods of data collection included self-reporting questionnaire with 155 stratified and quota sampled respondents, semi-structured interviews with five key informants, register based statistics, video and media text analyses and simple personal observation. This study found that road traffic accident trends increased by about 4 % between 2008 and 2012. Pedestrians and passengers, as vulnerable road users, accounted for 82 % of total casualties and females had the most involvement in casualties as pedestrian and passengers while males were involved as drivers. This study has also found that road traffic accidents have multiple causation (risk) factors categorized as vehicle element factors: poor brake system, <b>worn</b> <b>out</b> <b>tires,</b> lack of protective devices (air bags and seat belts); human behavior factors: rule violation such as speeding, driving and drinking, non-use of seat belts(drivers and passenger), pedestrians crossing roads at undesignated point, bus drivers picking passengers at places other than bus stops; environmental factors: poor road design which has no pedestrians and cyclist lanes in most places, few or no road signs, lack of traffic calming system (speed limits, humps, narrow roads), general traffic mix of road users and traffic regulation and enforcement factors: weak or inadequate enforcement especially in training of drivers and issuance of driving license, checking vehicle fitness. Specific socio-demographic risk factors identified include being male, young(less than 29 years), being single (never married). Attitude towards rule violation, age and gender were found to be good predictors of drivers’ behavior (watchful and cautious driving, inattentive driving and drinking and driving and non-use of seat belts). Field work limitations include bureaucratic procedures in public institutions which led to delayed access to required data, manually kept OPD records at University Teaching Hospital took more time to sort required data. RTSA and Zambia police service data was based on reported accidents giving possibility of under reporting and non-reporting of some accidents. Self-reporting questionnaire had possibilities of respondents reporting good behavior and yet in reality they could violate traffic rules. To overcome these limitations, this study used multiple methods to explore information and to have a comprehensive picture of risk factors and road traffic accident situation in Lusaka...|$|R
