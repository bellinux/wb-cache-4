40|$|The Central American {{country of}} Belize offers a unique {{opportunity}} for our students {{to learn about the}} history, society, and culture of this former British colony, inhabited by descendants of former slaves, Mestizo migrants, and other ethnic and religious groups. Unlike much of Hispanic Latin America, Belize is a predominantly Afro-Caribbean, English-speaking country tucked between Mexico and Guatemala. A democracy, Belize has struggled to overcome persistent poverty, lack of resources, and an inability to develop a self-sustaining economy, as it has struggled to retain a richly blended population of approximately 200, 000 citizens. This proposal is to develop a Belize Study Tour, through which students will be exposed to the complex history, culture, and society of Belize, through an anthropological participant observation study tour format. I <b>will</b> <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> Belize <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with representatives from Belen University, San Ignacio, Belize, and to inspect possible sites, to develop a Study Tour educational plan and explore other education exchange opportunities...|$|R

6000|$|This {{latter was}} a sore clause to Friedrich, who had counted all along on seeing his dear {{faithful}} Wilhelmina, as he passed: therefore, as the Papa's Orders, dangerous penalty lying in them, cannot be literally disobeyed, the question rises, How see Wilhelmina and not Baireuth? Wilhelmina, weak {{as she is}} and unfit for <b>travelling,</b> <b>will</b> have <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> him in some neutral place, suitablest for both. After various shiftings, it has been settled between them that Berneck, a little town twelve miles from Baireuth on the Hof road, will do; and that Friday, probably early, will be the day. Wilhelmina, accordingly, {{is on the road}} that morning, early enough; Husband with her, and ceremonial attendants, in honor of such a Brother; morning is of sultry windless sort; day hotter and hotter;--at Berneck is no Crown-Prince, in the House appointed for him; hour after hour, Wilhelmina waits there in vain. The truth is, one of the smallest accidents has happened: the Generals [...] "lost a wheel at Gera yesterday;" [...] were left behind there with their smiths, have not yet appeared; and the insoluble question among Friedrich and the Margraves is, [...] "We dare not go on without them, then? We dare;--dare we?" [...] Question like to drive Friedrich mad, while the hours, at any rate, are slipping on! Here are three Letters of Friedrich, legible at last; which, with Wilhelmina's account from the other side, represent a small entirely human scene in this French-Austrian War,--nearly all of human we have found in the beggarly affair:-- ...|$|R
