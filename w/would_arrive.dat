5|$|A {{shortage}} of aircraft {{played a role}} in transporting the task force to France, which had to be divided into two large groups and a small glider group for the British. On D-Day the first large group would be transported to France by 394 aircraft and eighty gliders. A second group of 325 aircraft and 270 gliders <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> in the afternoon. The smaller British group consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade's glider forces <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> shortly after the first group in the morning. In total 9,099 troops, 221 vehicles and 213 artillery guns would be delivered to France during Operation Rugby.|$|E
5|$|The Romneys' first son, Taggart, {{was born}} in 1970 while they were {{undergraduates}} at BYU {{and living in a}} basement apartment. Ann subsequently gave birth to Matthew (1971) and Joshua (1975). Benjamin (1978) and Craig (1981) <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> later, after Romney had begun his career.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 2017, {{in honor}} of the show's 50th anniversary, Network Distributing {{announced}} that the complete series <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> on Blu-ray in the UK in 4 volume sets. Each release will feature the first 8 episodes of the series restored and remastered from the original 35mm negatives and the first volume will feature a scarlet-colored case.|$|E
5000|$|Super Dave <b>would</b> usually <b>arrive</b> at his stunt {{and tour}} {{segments}} in a vehicle, often with Donald or Fuji, to a waiting Mike Walden. He <b>would</b> sometimes <b>arrive</b> in unique vehicles including a personal hovercraft and an amphibious car.|$|R
50|$|Adele Pankhurst <b>would</b> later <b>arrive</b> in 1914.|$|R
25|$|The Europeans and Marshall <b>would</b> all <b>arrive</b> in America on {{a single}} steamship, the S.S. Pretoria.|$|R
5|$|The pier's {{primary role}} was ceremonial. It was the {{traditional}} landing place of successive governors, who <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> at Central {{on board the}} official Governor's Yacht which would dock at Queen's Pier. From the 1960s, governors would inspect a guard of honour at Edinburgh Place, followed by the swearing-in at City Hall.|$|E
5|$|Written by Alan Drury, {{the scripts}} were {{commissioned}} on 2 April 1979 for this four-part story. The story {{was set in}} the Victorian era and the entire action would take place in and around a vicarage. The vicar has recently died and fake spiritualists are exploiting the widow. The first episode would open with a seance during which the TARDIS <b>would</b> <b>arrive.</b> On 19 September 1979, the story was accepted subject to alterations.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the state}} of anarchy being {{experienced}} by the city, Belgrano's death was largely unnoticed. The only newspaper of the time to note his death was El Despertador Teofilantrópico, written by Francisco de Paula Castañeda, and there was no government representation at his funeral. Former students of his educative institutions <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> in the following days with obsequies, when the news started to be known. The following year the political context was less chaotic and Bernardino Rivadavia, who was minister by then, organised a massive state funeral.|$|E
2500|$|The king's knights {{recommended}} {{continuing the}} siege, since reinforcements <b>would</b> soon <b>arrive</b> from Seville and Toledo, ...|$|R
50|$|The Europeans and Marshall <b>would</b> all <b>arrive</b> in America on {{a single}} steamship, the S.S. Pretoria.|$|R
50|$|Not all {{of those}} {{enumerated}} <b>would</b> have <b>arrived</b> as post-war migrants, specific statistics as at 2006 are not available.|$|R
5|$|In May 1905, {{after two}} years of negotiations, American-Hawaiian signed a {{contract}} with the Tehuantepec National Railway of Mexico, abandoning the Straits of Magellan route in favor of the Tehuantepec Route. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico's narrowest point, on the railroad. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} in December 2011, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt announced that a Google-designed tablet computer <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> in six months. During the interview for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Schmidt stated that the software company would have strong competition against Apple, the designer of the iPad line of tablets. While he did not {{refer to it as}} such, the device was inferred {{to be part of the}} Google Nexus series of consumer devices using the Android operating system and built by a partnering original equipment manufacturer (OEM).|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the success, the Massachusetts {{provisional}} government agreed to organize an expedition on a larger scale against Quebec, the capital of New France, and gave its command to Phips. Originally intending to coordinate with a simultaneous overland attack on Montreal launched from Albany, New York, the expedition's departure was delayed in the vain hope that needed munitions <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> from England. The expedition, counting 34 ships and more than 2,000 soldiers, finally sailed on August 20. It was short on ammunition, had no pilots familiar with the Saint Lawrence River, and carried what {{would turn out to be}} inadequate provisions.|$|E
50|$|On November 19, 2014, it was {{announced}} that eight stores <b>would</b> be <b>arriving</b> at Ridge Hill including Starbucks and The Container Store.|$|R
60|$|A {{letter from}} Governor Dinwiddie announced, however, that Captain Mackay <b>would</b> soon <b>arrive</b> with an {{independent}} company {{of one hundred}} men, from South Carolina.|$|R
5000|$|Match not played. Nyva Vinnytsia {{informed}} the PFL that {{the club was}} having financial difficulties and <b>would</b> not <b>arrive</b> for the scheduled cup game against Tytan Armyansk.|$|R
5|$|Since in {{the limit}} the forces are {{parallel}} to SP and sp, {{if the same}} force acted on the body in Fig. 2 as in Fig. 1, the body <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> at y, since ry = RQ. The difference in horizontal speed {{does not affect the}} vertical distances. Newton refers to Corollary 2 of the Laws of Motion where the motion of the bodies is resolved into a component in the radial direction acted on by the whole force, and the other component transverse to it, acted on by no force.|$|E
5|$|The Raiders {{declined}} to allow New York reporters to watch practices, a courtesy Ewbank extended to Oakland pressmen. Raiders assistant coach (later head coach) John Madden {{was responsible for}} the exchange of game films with upcoming opponents; he sent the films to the Jets through Chicago so they <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> a day or two late, reasoning that Davis, not he, would be blamed for the delay. Ewbank blamed Davis for heavily watering the Coliseum field to slow the Jets' speedy receivers, a tactic the Oakland co-owner credited to Madden.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle on}} September 19 began when Burgoyne moved {{some of his}} troops {{in an attempt to}} flank the entrenched American {{position}} on Bemis Heights. Benedict Arnold anticipated the maneuver and placed significant forces in his way. Burgoyne did gain control of Freeman's Farm, but it came at the cost of significant casualties. Skirmishing continued in the days following the battle, while Burgoyne waited in the hope that reinforcements <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> from New York City. Patriot militia forces continued to arrive, meanwhile, swelling the size of the American army. Disputes within the American camp led Gates to strip Arnold of his command.|$|E
50|$|Police courts {{opened for}} business, {{with a few}} civilians charged with theft, even of German equipment. Newspapers which had been desperate for newsprint, {{continued}} printing as supplies <b>would</b> shortly <b>arrive.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{end result}} was that al-Ma'mun became the new Abbasid Caliph. Yet, he <b>would</b> not <b>arrive</b> in Baghdad until 819 due to the {{destruction}} and continued disturbances in the city.|$|R
6000|$|... "He knows little, {{but he told}} me {{that the}} Black Police <b>would</b> have <b>arrived</b> here before the people knew--had not someone in the Wind-Vane Offices learnt. He said a girl." ...|$|R
5|$|They {{performed}} the custom at Christmas time, and usually on Christmas Eve. The team <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> at people's houses {{where they would}} sing a song before being admitted entry. Once inside, the horse pranced and gnashed its jaw, while the Jockey attempted to mount it, and the Mollie swept the floor with their broom while chasing any girls present. Sometimes they would sing further songs and carols at this point. Upon being presented with payment, the team would leave to repeat the process at another house.|$|E
5|$|When Kentuckian began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for {{eastbound}} cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. Kentuckian sailed in this service {{but it is}} not clear from sources whether on the east or west side of North America.|$|E
5|$|When Pennsylvanian began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for {{eastbound}} cargo, and Coatzacoalcos for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature. Pennsylvanian sailed in this {{service on the}} west side of North America.|$|E
5000|$|Time Bus - {{a school}} bus that {{travelled}} through time before each school day. So the kids <b>would</b> always <b>arrive</b> at school {{on the back of}} a time travel adventure.|$|R
60|$|There {{was some}} hesitation. Then the porter {{appeared}} {{to reflect that}} a burglar <b>would</b> not <b>arrive</b> in a cab, and that a surreptitious lover would not ask for the schoolmistress.|$|R
60|$|She trembled {{that day}} as she {{appeared}} {{to go down to}} the wedding. She was to be a bridesmaid. Skrebensky <b>would</b> not <b>arrive</b> till afternoon. The wedding was at two o'clock.|$|R
5|$|By 1967, Ballard {{would not}} show up for {{recording}} dates, or <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> at shows too inebriated to perform. For some early 1967 shows, she was replaced by Marlene Barrow. Looking for a more permanent replacement, Gordy once again thought of Barbara Randolph, possibly believing that Randolph could be groomed as lead singer for the group once {{it was decided to}} take Ross solo. However, Ross did not receive Randolph well. In April 1967, Gordy then contacted Cindy Birdsong, a member of Patti LaBelle & the Blue Belles who superficially resembled Ballard, with plans to bring her in as Ballard's replacement. He made his plans clear to Ballard and her group mates at a mid-April meeting, and Birdsong was brought in to begin rehearsals. Gordy did not fire Ballard outright at that time, asking Ballard instead to quit on her own.|$|E
5|$|General Krueger was gravely {{concerned}} about {{the seriousness of the}} situation on Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for the movement {{of the rest of the}} 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs. Other units <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use them, and to permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E
5|$|However, Rodes beat Schurz to Oak Hill, so the XI Corps {{division}} {{was forced to}} take up positions in the broad plain north of the town, below and {{to the east of}} Oak Hill. They linked up with the I Corps reserve division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, whose two brigades had been sent forward by Doubleday when he heard about Ewell's arrival. Howard's defensive line was not a particularly strong one in the north. He was soon outnumbered (his XI Corps, still suffering the effects of their defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville, had only 8,700 effectives), and the terrain his men occupied in the north was poorly selected for defense. He held out some hope that reinforcements from Slocum's XII Corps <b>would</b> <b>arrive</b> up the Baltimore Pike in time to make a difference.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so obvious, Sey," [...] my {{brother-in-law}} observed, {{in a most}} aggrieved tone, [...] "that I should have thought any secretary worth his salt <b>would</b> have <b>arrived</b> at it instantly." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1940, homesteads {{were opened}} in the area. The first dirt road from Anchorage was {{constructed}} in 1951; pavement <b>would</b> not <b>arrive</b> until 1956 {{with the construction of}} the Kenai Spur Highway.|$|R
60|$|After careful {{examination}} of the scanty audience, he failed to discover her--thus far. She <b>would</b> certainly <b>arrive,</b> nevertheless. My money's worth for my money was a leading principle in Mrs. Gallilee's life.|$|R
