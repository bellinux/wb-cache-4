She says, “I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go.</b> It is our turn to make things happen. There was a time when things happened the way we in Ilmorog wanted them to happen. We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp.115–116). However, along their way, they are unjustly detained by Kimeria the businessman, who reveals that he is colluding with the MP, and who afterwards rapes Wanja.|$|E

2500|$|About {{three months}} after the release of Gods of Violence, Petrozza {{mentioned}} a follow-up album, saying, [...] "Maybe we should work with a different producer. Maybe <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to a different country to record the album. Maybe we should write a more metal or more full-on thrash metal. Whatever we feel, first and foremost, that is the most important thing. Time will tell."

We were completely in sync about which way <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> for each record". The band's [...] "non-rhythm-and-blues, whiter-than-white fusion of 1960s rock and post-punk was a repudiation of contemporary dance pop" [...] – the style popular in the early 1980s. The band purposely rejected synthesisers and dance music. They sometimes used Sergei Prokofiev's Montagues and Capulets as entrance music at live shows.|$|E

2500|$|Outside of cinema, Wong {{has been}} heavily {{influenced}} by literature. He has a particular affinity for Latin American writers, and the fragmentary nature of his films came primarily from the [...] "scrapbook structures" [...] of novels by Manuel Puig and Julio Cortázar, which he attempted to emulate. Haruki Murakami, particularly his novel Norwegian Wood, also provided inspiration, as did the writing of Liu Yichang. The television channel MTV was a further influence on Wong. He said in 1998, [...] "in the late eighties, {{when it was first}} shown in Hong Kong, we were all really impressed with the energy and the fragmented structure. It seemed like <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> in this direction." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 2007, Giuliani {{was more}} {{amenable}} to a flat tax, but still claimed difficulties in adopting one. [...] In an interview, he said: [...] "If {{we were doing}} income tax for the first time. In other words, if we were starting off new back {{at the beginning of}} the last century, then probably <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> with a – we probably should've gone with a flat tax, maybe two levels of tax, but really simple. Our economy has kind of grown up now on depreciation and deductions and industries have grown up around that and so I don't know exactly how much you can simplify it, but you sure have to make a stab at it." [...] Later that week, in accepting Forbes' endorsement of his own presidential candidacy, Giuliani said that [...] "a flat tax would make a lot of sense".|$|E

2500|$|Lowell {{continued}} to argue both in private correspondence {{and in public}} speeches that his rationale was {{the welfare of the}} Jewish students. [...] "It is the duty of Harvard," [...] he said, [...] "to receive just as many boys who have come, or whose parents have come, to his country without our background as it can effectively educate." [...] If higher Jewish enrollment provoked greater prejudice against them, he asked, [...] "How can we cause the Jews to feel and be regarded {{as an integral part of}} the student body?" [...] He also suggested that Harvard would not be facing this issue if other universities and colleges would admit Jews in similar numbers: [...] "If every college in the country would take a limited proportion of Jews, I suspect <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> a long way toward eliminating race feeling among the students." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dupri also {{demonstrated}} {{the possibility for}} a duet with Jackson and American singer Mariah Carey for the album. Carey commented in April 2006, [...] "He never {{talked to me about}} that, but if Jermaine has a concept, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> and write something. I love Janet. I’ve been a big fan of Janet since 'Con-tro-ol!'". Later, Dupri said that the closer he got to Jackson and Mariah's duet, the more he knew where it should be at, elaborating that he felt it was going to happen. [...] "It depends on how quick my mind moves. We’re mixing records for [...] We’re not done yet. When I did Usher's My Way album, the last record I created was 'You Make Me Wanna...'. I'm thinking I might go back in, and I might tamper with it. [...] We gotta try to figure it out", he commented. However, the duet never came to fruition.|$|E
2500|$|The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and American philanthropist Cleveland Dodge, head of {{the board}} of Robert College, wrote to Wilson asking him not to declare war on Bulgaria, saying that it would have no effect on the war, but would harm the work of American missionaries, {{educational}} institutions, and American citizens in Bulgaria and Turkey. Wilson agreed to reconsider his proposal. [...] In his final message to Congress delivered on December 4, Wilson called for a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, but said, [...] "The same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They too, are tools of Germany. But they are mere tools and do not yet stand in the direct path of our proposed actions. We shall go wherever the necessities of this war carry us, {{but it seems to me}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> only where immediate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others." [...] After holding hearings on the subject, Congress accepted Wilson's argument and declared war on Austria-Hungary, but not on Bulgaria or Turkey.|$|E

2500|$|In the Orthodox Church {{there are}} no [...] "categories" [...] of sin as found in the Christian West. In the pre-Vatican II Catholic catechism, sins were {{categorized}} as [...] "mortal" [...] and [...] "venial." [...] In this definition, a [...] "mortal" [...] sin was one which would prevent someone from entering heaven unless one confessed it before death... These categories do {{not exist in the}} Orthodox Church. Sin is sin. Concerning Confession, having a list of deadly sins could, in fact, become an obstacle to genuine repentance. For example, imagine that you commit a sin. You look on the list and do not find it listed. It would be very easy to take the attitude that, since it is not on a list of deadly sins, it is not too serious. Hence, you do not feel the need to seek God's forgiveness right away. A week passes and you have completely forgotten about what you had done. You never sought God's forgiveness; as a result, you did not receive it, either. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> to Confession when we sin—at the very least, we should ask God to forgive us daily in our personal prayers. We should not see Confession as a time to confess only those sins which may be found on a list.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2007, still {{campaigning for}} the Republican presidential nomination, Romney summed up his general {{position}} {{on gun control}} at that time as: [...] "we should check on the backgrounds {{of people who are}} trying to purchase guns. We also should keep weapons of unusual lethality from being on the street. And finally, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> after people who use guns in the commission of crimes or illegally, but we should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose." [...] He also said that, had it come before him as president, he would have signed a renewal of the federal assault weapons ban that had expired. The following month, during a presidential primary debate, he noted that the federal assault weapons ban that he would have signed as president had failed in Congress, and he insisted that he would not support any new gun control legislation: [...] "I do not believe we need new legislation. I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons. I instead believe that we have laws in place that if they're implemented and enforced, will provide the protection and the safety of the American people." ...|$|E
2500|$|John S. Carlile of transmontane Alleghany County, like Willey an Unconditional Unionist, {{stressed}} that western Virginians {{were committed to}} slavery as “essential to American liberty.” But he would not run away from devotion to the Union. “This government that we {{are called upon to}} destroy has never brought us anything but good. No injury has it ever inflicted on us. No act has every been put upon the statute book of our common country, interfering with the institution of slavery in any shape, manner or form, that was not put there by and with the consent of the slave-holding States of this Union…” If Virginia joined the Confederacy, the North would no longer be bound by the Constitution to stand by slavery and slave-holding states, and it would join with England, France and Spain to extinguish slavery everywhere. Thomas Jefferson's grandson, George Wythe Randolph, now a Richmond lawyer, made a secessionist speech, observing that although the Republicans had captured the United States Government “in strict accordance with Constitutional forms”, it was merely sectional. “The Government, then…is constitutionally revolutionized, and requires a counter-revolution to restore it.” But “Let [...] go with us into a Southern Confederacy, and receive protection from Northern industry, and they will be what they ought to be—the manufacturers and miners of a great [...] nation.” <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>go</b> into the Confederacy, “we are told it will bring war.
