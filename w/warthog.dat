5|$|In the 1970s, heat-seeking {{missiles}} were developed {{that had a}} range greater than the visual acuity of pilots. Aircraft camouflage now had two major threats {{that it was not}} able to fully defeat—radar and infrared detection. Camouflage accordingly became less important. However, by the 1980s, aircraft such as the ground attack A-10 Thunderbolt (<b>Warthog)</b> were painted in camouflage schemes that included both disruptive ground coloration and automimicry (deceptive self-imitation), {{in the form of a}} false canopy on the underside.|$|E

5000|$|Common <b>warthogs</b> are not territorial, {{but instead}} occupy a home range. [...] Common <b>warthogs</b> live in groups called {{sounders}}. Females live in sounders with their young {{and with other}} females. Females tend {{to stay in their}} natal groups, while males leave, but stay within the home range. Subadult males associate in bachelor groups, but live alone when they become adults. Adult males only join sounders with estrous females. <b>Warthogs</b> have two facial glands: the tusk gland and the sebaceous gland. Common <b>warthogs</b> of both sexes begin to mark around six to seven months old. Males tend to mark more than females. They mark sleeping and feeding areas and waterholes. Common <b>warthogs</b> use tusk marking for courtship, for antagonistic behaviors, and to establish status.|$|R
50|$|The viruses in {{this family}} infect {{domestic}} pigs and their relatives. The natural hosts are <b>warthogs</b> (Phacochoerus africanus), bush pigs (Potamochoerus porcus), and argasid ticks (Ornithodoros species). Young <b>warthogs</b> when infected develop a high viraemia and are infectious to ticks. Older <b>warthogs</b> are generally immune to infection. The virus can replicate within the ticks. Transstadial, transovarial and sexual spread within the ticks occurs.|$|R
25|$|Other mammals of BMNP {{include the}} endemic Menelik’s bushbuck, Bohor reedbuck, klipspringer, grey duiker, <b>warthog,</b> African golden wolf, spotted hyena, serval, colobus monkey, lion, leopard, and African wild dog.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} parks {{are also part of}} the wetlands of Tanzania. The wild animals tend to be closer to the wetlands, particularly the water loving species such as the hippopotamus, waterbuck, common <b>warthog,</b> elephant, crocodile, sitatunga as well as water birds such as flamingoes and ducks.|$|E
50|$|Desert <b>warthogs</b> were {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} {{the virus that causes}} African swine fever. It was found that the <b>warthogs</b> showed no external signs of the infection but that they remained infective to domestic pigs for at least 33 days, this being the date on which the experiment terminated. To reduce the risk of their animals being infected with this disease, farmers used to shoot desert <b>warthogs.</b> It is now realised that the disease is actually transmitted by the tick Ornithodoros moubata, and that elimination of <b>warthogs</b> {{in order to try to}} protect domestic swine serves no useful purpose.|$|R

50|$|The team {{initially}} {{retained the}} Spirits name after becoming the Cincinnati Reds A-level affiliate in 1993, winning the Carolina League championship {{in that same}} year. After the 1994 season, the club decided to change its name and sponsored a contest through the local newspaper, the Winston-Salem Journal, {{to come up with}} a new name. The winning entry, the <b>Warthogs,</b> became the official team name in 1995. In addition to being alliterative, it also referred to the somewhat-celebrated acquisition of some <b>warthogs</b> at the state zoo around that time. As the <b>Warthogs,</b> they were the league champion in 2003.|$|R
25|$|The African wolf's life centres {{around a}} home burrow, which usually {{consists}} of an abandoned and modified aardvark or <b>warthog</b> earth. The interior structure of this burrow is poorly understood, though it is thought to consist of a single central chamber with 2–3 escape routes. The home burrow can be located in both secluded areas or surprisingly near the dens of other predators.|$|E
25|$|A pig is any of {{the animals}} in the genus Sus, within the even-toed {{ungulate}} family Suidae. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the <b>warthog.</b> Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles play an {{important}} role in the Halo games, and so vehicles were also given a long development stage. The UNSC's vehicles were designed by Marcus Lehto, Eric Arroyo, and Eddie Smith, and were designed to be functional and utilitarian. Their use of wheels also led many players to feel that they were more fun to drive. The addition of the Mongoose ATV made headlines, after being cut from Halo 2. The original <b>Warthog</b> was considered a fan favorite.|$|E

Several of the plains like Chikufwe are home to common reedbuck, buffalo, sable antelope and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, which are often encountered in the dry season. A small population of plains zebra occurs in the park. Roan antelope, defassa waterbuck and Sharpe's grysbok occur but are rare and seldom seen, whereas <b>warthog</b> numbers are increasing and they are commonly sighted. Yellow-backed Duiker and Moloney’s monkey, which are poached elsewhere, have also got a steady increase in {{the population in the}} park.|$|E
