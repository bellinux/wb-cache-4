Should it be Hemp? No, that was too slow, uncertain, painful. Morphine? Too many antidotes — too much commonness, ostentation in that. Daturin? I {{did not like to}} ask how much of that was certain...|$|E
2500|$|In a Stylist magazine, Duffy said of {{becoming}} poet laureate, [...] "There's no requirement. I do get {{asked to do}} things and so far I've been happy to do them." [...] She also spoke about being appointed to the role by Queen Elizabeth II, saying, [...] "She's lovely! I met her before I became poet laureate but when I was appointed I had an 'audience' with her which meant <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone,</b> at the palace, for the first time. We chatted about poetry. Her mother was friends with Ted Hughes whose poetry I admire a lot. We spoke about his influence on me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nasya Nenova {{attempted}} suicide. She {{testified that}} she confessed and attempted suicide {{because she was}} afraid she would be tortured again. She was interrogated alongside Ashraf and told the court they were beaten {{and that there was}} no interpreter. She did not confess to having illegal sexual relations with him. She, along with Vulcheva, are the only nurses who admitted knowing Ashraf by sight beforehand, but she said she had never spoken with him. She denied having attempted suicide out of guilt for what she had done. In court she stated that [...] "I am not guilty on any of the counts. My conscience is clear." [...] and [...] "We had protection from no-one, we had no doctor. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone</b> there with those men who did everything they wanted to do". She said she attempted to retract her confession on 17 July 1999, but that a Colonel Juma came and threatened to renew the torture if she persisted.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Come, come! Tush, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone,</b> {{and out of}} everybody's {{sight and}} hearing. Do you think to frighten me with these tricks of virtue?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At last <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone.</b> My Elinor, {{you do not}} {{yet know}} all my happiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He has told me so himself." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{stopped and}} looked at one another the moment <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone</b> again.|$|E
60|$|The Major, {{as soon as}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone,</b> turned upon me his impassive countenance.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone.</b> She gave me her fingers, which I {{raised to}} my lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was called--Look here, {{this subject}} wants {{a lot of}} talking over. Suppose we wait till <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone</b> and have lots of time before us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} has become of them. I think I went down before you did. However, here <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone.</b> Now I <b>am</b> going to begin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{soon as you}} are gone. As soon as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone</b> together. I will;--and then I {{will follow}} you to London. Now shall we not say, Good-bye?" ...|$|R
60|$|After dinner, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone,</b> Lettie {{sat at the}} table, nervously {{fingering}} her ring.|$|E
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone,</b> {{the cause}} of it, which already I suspected, at last transpired.|$|E
60|$|Hugh and I {{looked into}} each other's eyes, wondering, {{and then we}} knew that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I said so, and I'm going to--when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone.</b> The future Mrs. Dick Rover deserves it," [...] {{he went on}} boldly, but in a {{very low}} voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "But when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone</b> together, as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now, let me {{hear you}} call me Mary. That's my Christian name, and I should like to hear you speak it. Will you remember?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fortunately <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone</b> at dinner, today. Therefore do {{you come}} down, {{a quarter of an}} hour before the usual hour, and we will get the matter {{formally}} settled." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{asked the}} Doctor, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone,</b> {{what made him}} tell her not to go upstairs in a hurry.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly, next day, {{as soon as}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone</b> {{together}} I put {{the question}} to her, although not without a nervous qualm.|$|E
60|$|I neither {{looked at}} Oscar, nor spoke to him, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone</b> again. He {{was the first}} who broke the silence.|$|E

50|$|Usually, {{according}} to Suryodarmo, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in {{the condition that}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone</b> and <b>we</b> just see nature. Through moving we can reintegrate parts of our self and {{become a part of}} our environment.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must wait}} for {{explanations}} until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone,</b> Lucy. And now I think the train begins to slacken, {{and it is}} the next station at which we get out." ...|$|R
60|$|The others {{naturally}} {{took this}} for a dismissal, {{and she was not}} long in coming to her point when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|E
60|$|But when {{at length}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone</b> together, I gained a certain reassurance. His manner was not severe. He hesitated {{a little before}} beginning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mephistopheles," [...] she whispered. [...] "He is {{absolutely}} weird to-night. If he sat {{and looked at}} me and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone</b> I should shriek." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone</b> once more," [...] remarked William Pepper, looking {{round the}} table; {{but no one}} was ready to engage him in talk, and the meal ended in silence.|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone</b> and <b>we</b> {{must rely}} only {{on our own}} strength—both for the {{protection}} of the front and for the establishment of order in the country. —Aram Manukian, March 1918 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait till <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone,</b> and I'll {{tell you}} why this is done; in the {{meantime}} not a word or a sign. You will approve when {{we have had a}} talk together." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{after a while}} did the silent, {{handsome}} women--to fetch our meal, I understood {{one of them to}} say, and {{at length}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now, for <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone,</b> Bes twisted himself about, {{rolling his}} eyes and {{laughing}} {{as he used to}} do before he became Karoon of Ethiopia.|$|E
60|$|On the contrary, they'd be {{convinced}} that when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>alone</b> I beat you. Besides, I couldn't honestly say that you kept in the background.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing. Or I {{will tell}} you when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>alone,</b> Mrs. Trevor," [...] said Mrs. Brinkley, with burlesque sympathy. [...] "We oughtn't to have a scene {{on both sides of}} the foot-lights." ...|$|R
