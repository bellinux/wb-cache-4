500|$|Another pivotal romantic {{relationship}} {{for the character}} occurred when Chloe began dating her best friend Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). The decision to develop the friendship into a romance was debated by the writers, as it was Hendrickson and Rikaart who approached the writers wanting to work together. Due to their real-life friendship, Rikaart said of the storyline turn, [...] "The level of comfort is so easy, certainly for portraying the friendship part of the Kevin/Chloe relationship, that is a no-brainer. [...] So it was like, <b>when</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> {{to have to start}} acting?" [...] The relationship is plagued with constant issues, such as interference from Kevin's mentally unstable ex-wife Jana Hawkes (Emily O'Brien), and mob princess Angelina Veneziano's (Diana DeGarmo) intense crush on Kevin (which leads to a brief marriage, with Angelina's mob father threatening to kill Kevin if he doesn't wed his daughter). Angelina leaves town and Chloe and Kevin finally marry. In 2013, Kevin and Chloe have financial troubles which Kevin thinks can be solved through criminal acts; Hendrickson said, [...] "Money is usually a common issue between couples. They’re kind of battling through this struggle. He’s trying to do his best {{to take care of the}} family and morally, it just doesn’t sit well with her. Especially with what he’s been through in the past." [...] Rikaart told On-Air On-Soaps that he and Hendrickson have discussed wanting the characters to break up, [...] "We always say, 'We have done this. We have played this. [...] Now let’s play breaking up.' That will be different." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 7 July, İhsanoğlu {{stated that}} he would not base his {{campaign}} on election rallies, stating, [...] "how right is it to force people outside under the heat in this holy month of Ramadan? <b>When</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to hold the rallies, before sahur or after iftar? We are visiting our provinces and districts, meeting local leaders and visiting our people." [...] He also expressed his wish to hold a live televised debate with Erdoğan. Following the conclusion of Ramadan, İhsanoğlu held his first election rally in Hatay on 2 August, reiterating his support for state secularism. İhsanoğlu's campaign slogan is [...] "Ekmek için Ekmeleddin" [...] (Ekmeleddin for bread), other slogans which will be used for the campaign include [...] "Ekmeleddin to cultivate love, to cultivate prosperity and for bread." [...] "Ekmek" [...] means [...] "to cultivate" [...] at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Colts {{made the}} playoffs for three {{straight}} years from 1975 to 1977, there had still been no progress made on a new park for the team. Robert Irsay first spoke with Phoenix, Arizona in 1976 and then Indianapolis, Indiana in 1977 {{about the possibility of}} relocating his team to one of those cities. In 1976, he acknowledged publicly that he had received an [...] "attractive offer" [...] to move the franchise to Phoenix, Arizona. Then, in 1977, he said, [...] "I like Baltimore and want to stay there, but <b>when</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>going</b> to find out something about our stadium? I'm getting offers from towns like Indianapolis to build me a new stadium and give me other inducements to move there. I dont want to but I'd like to see some action in Baltimore." [...] In 1979, Hoffberger sold the Orioles to Washington D.C. attorney Edward Bennett Williams, who declared 1980 to be a trial year for the fans of Baltimore. He then went on to explain his concerns with Memorial Stadium, saying it had [...] "inadequate parking and inadequate access and egress. Frankly, I don't know if those problems will ever be solvable at that location." [...] Irsay began shopping the Colts around in earnest, talking first to officials from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, Memphis, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida where he visited the Gator Bowl packed with 50,000 cheering fans trying to convince him that Jacksonville would be the best home for the Colts. That same year Irsay presented Maryland's Governor Harry Hughes with a request for $25 million in renovation to the 64,124 seat Memorial Stadium. Irsay's request for $25 million in improvements was decreased to $23 million by the Maryland legislature. The plan added more seats (but none of the revenue-generating skyboxes), improving the plumbing and would have given both teams better office space. The plan's approval was contingent on both the Colts and Baltimore Orioles signing long term leases. The Orioles challenged the requested football improvements and refused to sign anything more than a one-year lease. Irsay also refused to sign long term. As a result, the funds and improvements never came.|$|E

[...] Concerning the character of Blackout, Bell stated that [...] "He’s the antagonist, in the same way we’ve used other Marvel characters as antagonists in the episodes. At the same time, we’re dealing with the fall-out of what happened with S.H.I.E.L.D., and the viewers finding out about Ward and what’s going on over there, so there’s a lot going on. Emotionally, he’s perfect. Here’s a character who absorbs light, and one of the things he says to Audrey - which is the title of the episode - he refers to her as “the only light in the darkness.” And his obsession with the cellist is a beautiful metaphor, I think, for who Coulson is to her, who she is to Coulson, who S.H.I.E.L.D. is to the world…and the idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. falling apart, and Hydra coming out and darkness speaking, the idea of having Blackout as an antagonist seemed perfect." ...|$|E
