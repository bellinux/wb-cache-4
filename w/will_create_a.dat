5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure.

Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E

5|$|Abdali Urban Regeneration Project in Abdali {{district}} {{will host}} a mall, a boulevard along with several hotels, commercial and residential towers. Valued at more than US $5 billion, the Abdali project <b>will</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new visible centre for Amman and act as the major business district for the city. The first phase contains about ten towers, five of which are under construction {{to be completed by}} 2016. Abdali is being developed as a smart city centre that enables the deliverance of state-of-the-art technologies to every home, office and outlet, while offering district energy solutions and central gas systems to guarantee a safe and friendly environment in addition to the large savings in energy cost. Across 30,000 square meters of land, a central dynamic park is the main feature of phase II which will serve as a focal theme for mainly residential, office, hotel and retail developments over 800,000 square meters.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion <b>will</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{officials}} announced their long-term plan {{to prevent further}} traffic jams. They <b>will</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> series of loops and overpasses allowing traffic to go directly from southbound Route32 to the Thruway and remove some traffic lights {{in front of the}} mall. The changes were expected to be complete by 2011, as part of improvements to convert the Route17 expressway into I-86. However, in 2009 they were postponed due to funding constraints. Work was slated to begin in 2013, but just before it could start Governor Andrew Cuomo redirected the money to repair projects elsewhere in the state. The project was put on indefinite hold in 2014 until it could be funded.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{the section}} of the Kolsås Line in Bærum closed due to {{disagreements}} between the two counties of Oslo and Akershus on how much Akershus should pay to purchase services from Oslo Sporveier. After a year of replacement buses, the line was reopened, only to be closed again in 2006 for an upgrade to metro standard. Disagreements between the two counties means the upgrade will be done separately on {{the two sides of the}} municipal boundary, with the Oslo side opening first. By 2010, the upgraded part had reached Bjørnsletta station in Oslo. In 2003, the Ring Line opened from Ullevål Stadion station on the Sognsvann Line to Storo station. The line <b>will</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> loop, which will connect to neighbourhoods such as Nydalen and Bjerke north of the city centre. In July 2004, construction caused a tunnel to collapse on the Grorud Line—the system's busiest—forcing a shutdown of this line until December and creating havoc on the overloaded replacement buses. The ring was completed onwards to Carl Berners plass on the Grorud Line via Sinsen in 2006. In 2007, the system started taking delivery of the new MX3000 trains, which replaced all the old stock. By 2010, all T1000, T1300 and T2000 trains had been retired. In 2010, the Holmenkollen Line reopened with metro standard, after it had been closed for renovation for a year.|$|E
