5|$|In 2003 the BBC {{announced}} {{the return of}} Doctor Who, {{as a series of}} webcasts to air on bbc.com. Richard E. Grant was announced as the Ninth Doctor. A webcast, written by Paul Cornell, entitled Scream of the Shalka was completed, and aired on bbc.com. This was followed by an online short story entitled The Feast of the Stone. Work was already well underway on the third webcast, entitled Blood of the Robots. This was to be written by Simon Clark. However, before production began, it was announced that Doctor Who would be returning to television, with Russell T. Davies as Producer. Blood of the Robots was never made. Blood of the Robots synopsis:- A blend of adventure, drama and humour. The Doctor arrives to find a <b>world</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> intelligent, sensitive robots that have been abandoned by their human owners, who are too squeamish to 'kill' them when they're obsolete. Now ruthless salvage squads are hunting the robots in order to make room for human settlers forced to migrate from their dangerously over-crowded home planet.|$|E
5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. Excited by the strangers, the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a <b>world</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> anachronistic high-technology, interspersed in a pre-industrialized, agrarian culture.|$|E

25|$|The novels show several {{competing}} religions, {{in imitation}} of religion's centrality to the Middle Ages, and to suit the author's perception {{of himself as a}} lapsed Catholic with atheist or agnostic habits. To evade the difficulty of inventing religions, George R. R. Martin based the series' major religions on real religious systems. The fictional history of Westeros shows how each religion evolved. Each of the religions reflects its culture's temperament. When questioned, Martin regards any (real or fictional) religion's claim to truth with suspicion, and is not satisfied by the idea that a benevolent God allows for a <b>world</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> suffering.|$|E
25|$|According to tradition, Buddhism was {{introduced}} in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by Indian missionaries {{under the guidance of}} Thera Mahinda, the son of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka. Prior to the expansion of Buddhism, the indigenous population of Sri Lanka lived in an animistic <b>world</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> superstition. The assimilation and conversion of the various pre-Buddhist beliefs was a slow process. In order to gain a foothold among the rural population, Buddhism needed to assimilate the various categories of spirits and other supernatural beliefs. The earliest monastic complex was the Mahāvihāra at Anurādhapura founded by Devānampiyatissa and presented to Mahinda Thera. The Mahāvihāra became the centre of the orthodox Theravāda doctrine and its supreme position remained unchallenged until the foundation of the Abhayagiri Vihāra around BC 89 by Vaţţagāmaņĩ.|$|E
25|$|After Madotsuki {{falls to}} sleep, {{she begins to}} dream. The player is then {{presented}} with a dream world which resembles the same room Madotsuki lives in. In the dream world, the player is able to leave the room, which {{will lead to a}} nexus of 12 doors, with each leading to a different world, including a colorful neon maze, a forest, a world littered with numerical symbols, and a <b>world</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> body parts, among others. These 12 worlds, in turn, connect to a number of other worlds, forming a large and expansive area for the player to explore. The purpose of the game is for the player to navigate the main character's dream worlds to obtain 24 objects, known as effects. The player can attempt to interact with objects, although few will provide any response. The player can choose to wake from the dream world at any time, by causing Madotsuki to pinch her cheek and awaken. This behavior ensures that the player has {{a way out of the}} dream world at all times.|$|E

[...] Three prominent modes of design emerged from 1985–2005 and could be seen in the exhibition: Geometric Minimal design, Biomorphic design and Neo-Pop design.
