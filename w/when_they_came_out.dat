The pigs, kept in the canvas bags, were made to squeal {{in order to attract}} the wolves. Hunters would wait at a {{distance}} to shoot the wolves <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> after the pig. Once the wolves arrived, the hunters would either shoot them or retrieve the pig and canvas bag. In the latter case, they took off down the road, luring the wolves behind. The wolves would be led to a palisade, where they would be trapped and shot.|$|E

25|$|When Francis Farquhar, {{the first}} {{commanding}} officer {{was killed in}} action at St Eloi on March 20, 1915, he was replaced by Lt Col H. Buller, another British regular who had served with him of {{the staff of the}} Governor General before the war. On May, 8 the stout defence of Bellewaerde Ridge during the Battle of Frezenberg established the reputation of the Patricias but at tremendous cost. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the line they had lost 500 men in three days. The tattered remains were commanded by a lieutenant, all other officers having been killed or wounded. The PPCLI served for a year with the 80th Brigade before joining the new 7th Brigade within the 3rd Canadian Division on December 22, 1915. In 1916 the regiment fought major battles at Mount Sorrel and on the Somme. It was not until October 1916 that the first Canadian, Lt Col Agar Adamson, was appointed to command the regiment. In 1917 as part of the Canadian Corps, the regiment took part in the Battle of Vimy Ridge on April 9, 1917, and Passchendaele later the same year. In 1918 the regiment fought at the Battle of Amiens, Jigsaw Wood, and the Battle of the Canal du Nord as part of the great battles of the Hundred Days that ended the war. The 4th Company, PPCLI, entered Mons with other Canadian troops early on November 11, 1918, before the armistice took effect at 11 AM.|$|E
500|$|Landing was {{originally}} planned on the [...] Runway 31. Difficulties in controlling the aircraft made lining up almost impossible. While dumping {{some of the}} excess fuel, the plane executed a series of mostly right-hand turns (it was easier to turn the plane in this direction) {{with the intention of}} lining up with Runway 31. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> they were instead lined up with the shorter (6,888ft) and closed Runway 22, and had little capacity to maneuver. Fire trucks had been placed on Runway 22, anticipating a landing on nearby Runway 31, so all the vehicles were quickly moved out of the way before the plane touched down. Runway 22 had been permanently closed a year earlier in 1988.|$|E
