5|$|Shakshuka, a North-African (Tunisian) dish of eggs poached in a spicy tomato sauce, is a {{national}} favorite, especially in the winter. It is traditionally served up in a cast iron pan with bread to mop up the sauce. Some variations of the dish are cooked <b>with</b> <b>liberal</b> use of ingredients such as eggplant, chili peppers, hot paprika, spinach, feta cheese or safed cheese.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Women's Suffrage Society {{was formed}} with the {{intention}} of fulfilling a number of goals. It hoped to educate women on why they {{should have the right to}} vote and convince men of the same. It had links <b>with</b> <b>Liberal</b> MPs and intended to use these to pressure the government to allow women's suffrage. In addition, the society tried to drum up support for their cause by holding small scale events, often with speakers at the Yamen Cafe in Liverpool's Bond Street. The events would also include poetry, singing or performances of acting or ballet by the Blue Bird Theatre Company.|$|E
5|$|Overtime, {{traditional}} Calvinism played {{less of a}} role {{in shaping}} the church's doctrines and practices—it was influenced by Arminianism and revivalism early in the 19th century, liberal theology late in the 19th century, and neo-orthodoxy by the mid-20th century. The theological tensions within the denomination were played out in the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s, a conflict that {{led to the development of}} Christian fundamentalism and has historical importance to modern American Evangelicalism. Conservatives dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>liberal</b> trends left to form the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition. The public was angry over the inability of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett and his Conservative (or Tory) government {{to deal with the}} Depression, and the Liberals were considered likely to return to office at the next election, due by 1935. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting <b>with</b> <b>Liberal</b> Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men were impressed with each other, but each felt the other should make the next move. According to Lambert in his diary, Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he to run in the new riding of Port Arthur.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous election cycle aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up <b>with</b> <b>liberal</b> Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the Duke of Braganza mounted cannons, dug trenches, tended the wounded, ate {{among the}} rank and file and fought under heavy fire as men next to him were shot or blown to pieces. His cause was nearly lost until he took the risky step of {{dividing}} his forces and sending a portion to launch an amphibious attack on southern Portugal. The Algarve region fell to the expedition, which then marched north straight for Lisbon, which capitulated on 24 July. Pedro proceeded to subdue the remainder of the country, but just when the conflict looked to be winding down to a conclusion, his Spanish uncle Don Carlos, who was attempting to seize the crown of his niece Doña IsabelII, intervened. In this wider conflict that engulfed the entire Iberian Peninsula, the First Carlist War, the Duke of Braganza allied <b>with</b> <b>liberal</b> Spanish armies loyal to IsabelII and defeated both MiguelI and Carlos. A peace accord was reached on 26 May 1834.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the spread}} of such ideas was {{forbidden}} in the Spanish territories, as was the sale of related books or their unauthorized possession. Spain instituted those bans when it declared war on France after the execution of LouisXVI and retained them after the peace treaty of 1796. News {{of the events of}} 1789 and copies of the publications of the French Revolution spread around Spain despite efforts to keep them at bay. Many enlightened criollos came into contact <b>with</b> <b>liberal</b> authors and their works during their university studies, either in Europe or at the University of Chuquisaca (modern Sucre). Books from the United States found their way into the Spanish colonies through Caracas, owing to the proximity of Venezuela to the United States and the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor's {{circuit court}} rulings {{led to her}} being {{considered}} a political centrist by the ABA Journal and other sources and organizations. Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone <b>with</b> <b>liberal</b> inclinations. In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues. Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints. A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role. Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose. Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.|$|E
5|$|The Duke's {{allowance}} was {{supplemented by}} government favours and illegal currency trading. The City of Paris provided the Duke with a house at 4 Route du Champ d'Entraînement, on the Neuilly-sur-Seine {{side of the}} Bois de Boulogne, for a nominal rent. The French government exempted him from paying income tax, and the couple were able to buy goods duty-free through the British embassy and the military commissary. In 1951, the Duke produced a ghost-written memoir, A King's Story, in which he expressed disagreement <b>with</b> <b>liberal</b> politics. The royalties from the book added to their income. Nine years later, he penned a relatively unknown book, A Family Album, chiefly about the fashion and habits {{of the royal family}} throughout his life, from the time of Queen Victoria to that of his grandfather and father, and his own tastes.|$|E
50|$|The {{contemporary}} realist view generally agrees <b>with</b> <b>liberals</b> in viewing {{international trade}} as a win-win phenomenon where firms {{should be allowed}} to collaborate or compete depending on market forces. The chief point of contention <b>with</b> <b>liberals</b> is that realists assert national interests can be served best by protecting new industries from foreign competition with high tariffs until they’ve built up the capability to compete on the world market. One of the earliest formal expressions of this view was found in Alexander Hamilton’s ‘Report on Manufacturers’ which he wrote for the U.S. government in 1791.|$|R
