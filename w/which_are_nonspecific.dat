50|$|Knowles's {{research}} {{was on the}} boundary of chemistry and biochemistry, and concerned the rate and specificity of enzyme catalysis {{and the evolution of}} protein function. As an enzymologist Knowles studied alpha chymotrypsin and pepsin, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>nonspecific</b> proteases, meaning they accept a broad range of substrates. He researched what made these enzymes nonspecific and how they increased the rate of reactions.He then began studying glycolytic enzyme trioposephosphate isomerase (TIM). He looked at its ability to interconvert a single substrate and a single product. He found that there was an enediol intermediate produced in the reactions that allowed solvent protons to enter the reaction from the middle instead of only from the substrates or products. He also then researched and found the energy of these intermediates and transition states, which allowed him to study the reaction energetics. He worked with John Albery to study hydrogen isotopes as well while studying TIM. From his research, Knowles was able to make a free energy profile of reaction with TIM in 1976. His profile showed that the transition states of the reaction were all of comparable energy, which then indicated that the enzyme-bound intermediates were all of comparable free energy.|$|E
40|$|Induction {{of stress}} {{metabolites}} in the suspension cultured cells of eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) was examined. When autoclaved RNase A or nigeran, both of <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>nonspecific</b> phytoalexin elicitors in bean cells, {{were added to}} the cell culture of eggplant, greatly enhanced levels of three compounds were observed. One of them was cis-pentadeca- 6 -ene- 1, 3 -diyne- 5, 15 -diol, a novel diacetylenic compound. This compound has considerable fungitoxic activity. Also identified was falcarindiol, another fungitoxic diacetylenic compound previously reported as one of the phytoalexins in infected tomato fruits and leaves. Elicited compounds preferentially accumulated in the culture medium rather than in the cells and decreased to original levels during prolonged culturing. The elicitation of these compounds was closely correlated with cellular damage in terms of the decrease of growth rate and was inhibited by 10 micromolar cycloheximide...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Intracranial hypotension, {{especially}} spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), {{is a well}} 2 ̆ 014 recognized entity {{associated with}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, and has being recognized better in resent years, while still woefully inadequate. An increasing number of factors including iatrogenic factors are realized to involve in development and progression of intracranial hypotension. The diagnosis remains difficult due to the various clinical manifestations, some of <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>nonspecific</b> and easily to be neglected. Multiple imaging tests are optional in CSF leakage identification while clinicians are still confronted with difficulties when making selection resulting from superiorities and disadvantages of different imaging tests. Treatments for intracranial hypotension are multifarious but evidence is anecdotal.

With all four virus types, a significantly greater MMI response was noted when peritoneal exudate cells were exposed to the homologous sensitizing antigen as compared to that obtained with the three heterologous antigens. Studies with adenovirus type 1 indicate that sensitizing doses between 70 and 150 μg of viral protein per guinea pig gave the optimal MMI response.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: MR {{findings}} {{reported in}} conjunction with spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) include cord swelling, increased T 2 signal within the spinal cord, and parenchymal enhancement, each of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>nonspecific.</b> Enlarged vessels on the cord surface, the most specific MR finding, is noted in only half of SDAVF patients. Nevertheless, we have frequently observed MR peripheral hypointensity of the spinal cord in SDAVF on T 2 -weighted images, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> not characteristic of nonvascular or nonhemorrhagic causes of my-elopathy and <b>which</b> has not <b>been</b> described in association with SDAVF. We hypothesized that peripheral cord hypointensity might reliably suggest the diagnosis of SDAVF or other causes of venous hypertensive myelopathy. METHODS: We reviewed the MR findings in 11 consecutive cases of angiographically con-firmed symptomatic SDAVF and in four cases of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula with spinal drainage, a lesion that also causes spinal cord deficits mediated by venous hypertensive myelopathy.

40|$|Peritonitis is {{a common}} and {{life-threatening}} complication of acute peritoneal dialysis (PD). Diagnosis requires the presence of clinical signs of peritonitis <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>nonspecific</b> and laboratory investigations [total leukocyte count (TLC), Gram-stain, and culture of PD effluent fluid] which are time-consuming and not available at the bedside. In this study, we evaluated the use of leukocyte esterase reagent strip (LERS) as a bedside test to diagnose peritonitis in patients undergoing acute PD. Patients who underwent acute PD were monitored for {{signs and symptoms of}} peritonitis. PD effluent fluid analysis included TLC, absolute neutrophil count, Gram-stain, and culture for the diagnosis of peritonitis. LERS (Multistix 10 SG) was simultaneously dipped in PD effluent fluid and read at two minutes. Reading of + was considered as indicative of peritonitis. Twenty-one out of 166 (12. 6 %) patients undergoing acute PD developed peritonitis. LERS detected peritonitis in 20 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (NPV) of LERS were 95. 2 %, 95. 2 %, 74. 1 %, and 99. 3 %, respectively.

We present here an 84 -year-old male admitted to the dermatovenereology department with a slowly growing purplish-red asymptomatic plaque, 2 x 2 cm in diameter which was diagnosed as lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the skin upon histopathologic examination. The tumor was excised and metastasis was not detected. Local recurrence was not observed in a one-year follow-up period. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the skin should also be considered in the clinical differential diagnosis of slowly growing solitary nodules and infiltrated plaques.

However, strains {{that are}} host-specific avian pathogens are often avirulent in mammals, and those <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>nonspecific</b> are commensal in poultry. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether host specificity was exhibited by bacterial abilities to invade epithelial cells or resist leukocyte killing. In this study, leukocytes isolated from humans and chickens were used to kill Salmonella in vitro. Both Salmonella pullorum, an avian-specific serotype, and Salmonella typhimurium, a broad-host-range serotype, were sensitive to killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes isolated from both species. Both serotypes replicated in cells of the MQ-NCSU avian-macrophage cell line. In contrast, S. pullorum was noninvasive for cultured epithelial Henle 407, chick kidney, chick ovary, and budgerigar abdominal tumor cells. In the bird challenge, however, S. typhimurium rapidly caused inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, but S. pullorum preferentially targeted the bursa of Fabricius prior to eliciting intestinal inflammation. Salmonella serotypes which cause typhoid fever in mice have been shown to target the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Observations from this study show that S. pullorum initiated a route of infection in chicks comparable to the route it takes in cases of enteric fever...|$|E

40|$|Aspergillus fumigatus grows well at {{neutral and}} acidic pH {{in a medium}} {{containing}} protein as the sole nitrogen source by secreting two different sets of proteases. Neutral pH favors the secretion of neutral and alkaline endoproteases, leucine aminopeptidases (Laps) <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>nonspecific</b> monoaminopeptidases, and an X-prolyl dipeptidase (DppIV). Acidic pH environment promotes the secretion of an aspartic endoprotease of pepsin family (Pep 1) and tripeptidyl-peptidases of the sedolisin family (SedB and SedD). A novel prolyl peptidase, AfuS 28, {{was found to be}} secreted in both alkaline and acidic conditions. In previous studies, Laps were shown to degrade peptides from their N-terminus until an X-Pro sequence acts as a stop signal. X-Pro sequences can be then removed by DppIV, which allows Laps access to the following residues. We have shown that at acidic pH Seds degrade large peptides from their N-terminus into tripeptides until Pro in P 1 or P' 1 position acts as a stop for these exopeptidases. However, X-X-Pro and X-X-X-Pro sequences can be removed by AfuS 28 thus allowing Seds further sequential proteolysis. In conclusion, both alkaline and acidic sets of proteases contain exoprotease activity capable of cleaving after proline residues that cannot be removed during sequential digestion by nonspecific exopeptidases...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the degree of exposure and biological effects of manganese was studied {{in a group of}} 369 workers employed in the production of ferroalloys. Two other groups of workers, from an electrode plant and from an aluminium rolling mill, served as controls. Mean manganese concentrations at work places where ferroalloys were produced varied from 0 - 301 to 20 - 442 mg/m 3. The exposure level of the two control groups was from 2 to 30 microgram/m 3 and from 0 - 05 to 0 - 07 microgram/m 3, in the electrode plant and rolling mill respectively. Sixty-two (16 - 8 %) manganese alloy workers showed some signs of neurological impairment.

40|$|Human {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) infiltrate solid tumors, {{but this}} infiltration occurs in favorable and unfavorable disease prognoses. The statistical inference is that tumor-infiltrating DCs (TIDCs) play no conclusive role in predicting disease progression. This is remarkable because DCs are highly specialized antigen-presenting cells linking innate and adaptive immunity. DCs either boost {{the immune system}} (enhancing immunity) or dampen it (leading to tolerance). This dual effect explains the dual outcomes of cancer progression. The reverse functional characteristics of DCs depend on their maturation status. This review elaborates on the markers used to detect DCs in tumors. In many cases, the identification of DCs in human cancers relies on staining for S- 100 and CD 1 a. These two markers are mainly expressed by Langerhans cells, which are one of several functionally different DC subsets. The activation status of DCs {{is based on the}} expression of CD 83, DC-SIGN, and DC-LAMP, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>nonspecific</b> markers of DC maturation. The detection of TIDCs has not kept pace with the increased knowledge about the identification of DC subsets and their maturation status. Therefore, it is difficult to draw a conclusion about the performance of DCs in tumors. We suggest a novel selection of markers to distinguish human DC subsets and maturation states. The use of these biomarkers will be of pivotal importance to scrutinize the prognostic significance of TIDCs...|$|E

40|$|Beginning with Gee's 7 {{mention of}} atrophy of glandular crypts in 1888, many {{investigators}} of idiopathic sprue {{agreed that the}} {{significant changes in the}} small bowel at autopsy consisted of mucosal and villous atrophy, edema, and chronic mucosal inflammation and ulceration. Later, these observations were dismissed by Thaysene as due to post-mortem autolysis. According to Suarez et al., ' Koppisch subsequently described shortened, clubbed, and blunted villi in 8 of 16 autopsied cases of sprue, and Adlersberg and Schein ' found bizarre villous shapes or clubbing in 2 of 10 autopsied cases. It remained for small bowel biopsy to settle the question of post-mortem artefact, however. Studies of the histological appearance of biopsy specimens of small intestinal mucosa have been concerned mainly with changes occurring in the jejunum in patients with sprue, both tropical and nontropical, and with celiac disease. The changes described range from blunting, mushrooming, and reduction in the size of villi to almost total flattening of the villous surface area.

Materials and Methods: The sample for the present study comprised a total of 20 healthy controls, 20 OSMF patients. About 5 ml of blood and 2 ml of saliva were collected. Quantitative analysis of serum and salivary IgG, IgA was done by turbidometric immunoassay. TSP and Hb were estimated by Biuret and cyanmethemoglobin methods, respectively. Results: Serum and salivary IgA and IgG levels were statistically significantly increased (P < 0. 001) in OSMF patients when compared to controls. Also serum and salivary IgG and IgA levels showed significantly increased (P < 0. 01) in all the three staging of OSMF when compared to control group. Hb levels and TSP levels were significantly decreased (P < 0. 001) in OSMF patients when compared to controls. One-way ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and unpaired t -test were used for statistical analysis. Conclusion: The elevated levels of IgG and IgA are also in favor of polygammapathy, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>nonspecific</b> and nondiagnostic objective reflections of an underlying disease. Decreased TSP is a result of host response and Hb, acts as an indicator of nutritional status plays an important role. It is also observed from the present study that the severity of OSMF was directly proportional to the estimated elevated levels of the major IgG and IgA.

40|$|History {{of present}} illness: A 28 -year-old male {{presents}} to emergency department with a chief complaint of dysuria {{over the past}} seven days associated with a new penile lesion over the same period. He reports sexual activity with “many men and women” without condom use. His review of system is otherwise negative. Significant findings: Physical examination revealed a non-tender, erythematous lesion on the glans penis, two similar adjacent satellite lesions, as well as tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. No penile discharge was noted. Discussion: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by Treponema pallidum. The early stage of the infection consists of three phases – primary syphilis, secondary syphilis and early latent syphilis. The late stage occurs amongst untreated patients, leading to asymptomatic chronic latent disease. 2 The feared complication of latent disease is progression to tertiary syphilis, which may occur decades later and includes major cutaneous, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neurological complications. 1 Primary syphilis infection manifests as a chancre, a localized, typically painless skin lesion at the site of inoculation. The classic lesion forms a 1 - 2 -centimeter ulcer with a raised, indurated margin commonly with associated moderate regional lymphadenopathy. Chancres are self-limited and heal within six weeks without treatment. 2, 5 Diagnosis can be made with nontreponemal tests (<b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>nonspecific)</b> and treponemal tests (which are more complex and expensive, but specific). Nontreponemal tests include the rapid plasma regain (RPR) and venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL). The treponemal test of choice is the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS). Darkfield microscopy in combination with direct fluorescent antibody testing can be used to identify the organism. 1, 5 The preferred treatment for early syphilis is a single dose of 2. 4 million units of intramuscular penicillin G. 1, 3, 4 Our patient was given this treatment, along with empiric coverage for gonorrhea and chlamydia co-infection with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.

40|$|Physiologically {{realistic}} peptidoglycan (PG) fragments, {{derived from}} Neisseria gonorrhoeae, were shown previously to dose-dependently suppress food consumption and body weight gain in rats following single intraperitoneal injections. The present study, examining {{the effects of}} repeated daily injection of PG, provides additional support to our underlying hypothesis, i. e., that soluble PG fragments contribute {{to the loss of}} appetite commonly associated with bacterial infections. An initial intraperitoneal injection of purified, soluble, macromolecular, extensively O-acetylated PG fragments (S-O-PG) (240 micrograms/kg of body weight) decreased overnight food consumption in male Lewis rats (150 g) by approximately 35 % relative to animals receiving diluent alone (P < 0. 05). However, subsequent daily injections of S-O-PG resulted in progressively smaller effects on food consumption until, by the fourth day, rats were completely nonresponsive (tolerant) to S-O-PG-induced hypophagia. Rats that developed tolerance to the effects of S-O-PG on appetite were also tolerant to three other known hypophagic agents, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), muramyl dipeptide, and interleukin- 1, when challenged one day after establishment of S-O-PG tolerance. Similarly, rats developed tolerance to repeated injections of muramyl dipeptide or LPS and were cross-tolerant to S-O-PG when challenged 1 day later. However, 30 days after establishment of S-O-PG tolerance, rats remained nonresponsive to S-O-PG but regained full responsiveness to LPS-mediated hypophagia. Thus, at least two mechanisms of tolerance to S-O-PG hypophagia exist: an early tolerance <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>nonspecific</b> and a late tolerance <b>which</b> <b>is</b> specific for S-O-PG. Late, but not early, tolerance to S-O-PG-mediated suppression of appetite was associated with an increase in specific anti-PG antibody activity as measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay...|$|R

40|$|Early parasite-based {{diagnosis}} of malaria prior to treatment {{is critical for}} rational drug use, optimal outcome of febrile illness, patient adherence, prevention of parasite drug resistance, and reduced costs of health services. However, most primary health care (PHC) facilities in sub-Saharan Africa have no laboratory support and malaria diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and signs, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>nonspecific.</b> This results in over-{{diagnosis of}} malaria, overuse of antimalarial drugs, and failure to identify and treat other causes of fever appropriately. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is the most widely adopted artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Africa. However, there is still limited data on its efficacy, effectiveness and safety during extended follow-up and after repeated treatment. Importantly, the effectiveness when used in the home management of malaria (HMM) strategy needs to be assessed. The main aim of this thesis {{is to improve the}} quality of malaria case management in government health facilities and specifically to assess the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of AL in under-five children with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Tanzania. In a diagnostic intervention study, antimalarial drug prescriptions were significantly reduced in microscopy-based diagnosis arm (61 %) compared to clinical algorithm arm (95 %) and no training arm (100 %) (both p < 0. 001). Of the patients with positive blood smears, 99 % were prescribed antimalarial drugs and so were 11 % of children with negative readings. Those with positive blood smear readings were less likely to be prescribed antibiotics than those with negative results (relative risk = 0. 66, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 55, 0. 72). However, the training did not improve accuracy of microscopy at PHC level when compared to the reference level. In a randomized study on the efficacy of AL and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, including methodological objectives regarding the use of PCR-corrected cure rates in antimalarial drug trials, PCR analysis from blood samples collected on consecutive days both at study inclusion and parasite recurrence during follow-up improved identification of recrudescences by about 20 % compared with the WHO recommended standard single-day blood sampling protocol. In a randomized trial of supervised versus unsupervised AL intake, the PCR-corrected cure rates were similarly high in both groups, i. e. 98 % versus 96 % by day 56 after initial treatment, and 93 % versus 98 % by day 42 after retreatment, respectively, despite that the median blood lumefantrine concentrations on day 7 were significantly higher in the supervised compared with the unsupervised group (after initial treatment [304 versus 194 ng/mL; p< 001] and after retreatment [253 versus 164 ng/mL; p= 001]). Both regimens were safe and well tolerated after both initial and retreatment. In a single arm effectiveness study of unsupervised AL intake in the context of HMM, the PCR-corrected cure rate by day 42 was 93 %. In conclusion, microscopy-based diagnosis of malaria at PHC facilities reduced prescription of antimalarial drugs and appeared to improve appropriate management of non-malaria fevers. Interpretation of PCR-corrected cure rates in high endemic areas is influenced by methodological aspects such as theblood sampling protocol. AL was highly efficacious and safe for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. The high effectiveness of AL provides evidence for scaling-up its use within the HMM strategy in Tanzania...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} role of {{pulmonary}} alveolar macrophages (PAMs) in phagocytizing Pasteurella hemolytica, we developed an in vitro cultivation method for preparing them. This procedure provided an adherent monolayer of PAMs <b>which</b> <b>were</b> <b>nonspecific</b> esterase-positive and phagocytized latex beads. The phagocytosis and fate of P. hemolytica (biotype A, serotype 1) by PAMs in suspension were studied. The kinetics of phagocytosis were determined by quantitatively measuring the uptake of 24 -h [3 H]thymidine-labeled bacteria by the PAMs {{in the presence of}} opsonins. Results showed that the uptake of P. hemolytica was enhanced in the presence of normal serum or antiserum. A total of 90 % of the bacteria were phagocytized in the presence of normal adult bovine serum, and up to 95 % were phagocytized in the presence of an antiserum. These studies also showed that normal serum, but not fetal calf serum, contained heat-stable natural antibodies which readily initiated the opsonization of P. hemolytica. The heat-labile complement system was also involved in the opsonization. The fate of P. hemolytica inside the PAMs was investigated by transmission electron microscopy and by the viable plate count method. Approximately 90 % of the normal serum- or antiserum-opsonized P. hemolytica were phagocytized by PAMs at a bacteria/PAM ratio of 20 : 1 and were completely degraded after 60 min of exposure. Prolonged incubation of this mixture of bacteria and PAMs resulted in cytotoxic changes and destruction of PAMs. At a low bacteria/PAM ratio (10 : 1 or less), there was phagocytosis and killing of bacteria but no cytotoxic changes on the PAMs. The exact mechanism which initiated this phenomenon was not demonstrated. Perhaps toxic substance(s) released by the excess unphagocytized bacteria caused the cytotoxic changes to the PAMs...|$|R
40|$|Shaken baby syndrome” {{in child}} abuse cases is a {{challenge}} for pediatrician and forensic experts, often a diagnosis of exclusion, with overwhelming moral and legal implications. Diagnosis is based on: subdural bleeding, rupture of retinal vessels, traumatic diffuse axonal injury with diffuse brain encephalopathy {{in the absence of}} external traumatic injuries and anamnesis data of an accidentally head injury. Microscopic findings in diffuse axonal injuries were initially considered as a specific traumatic effect due to unrestricted movement and accelerated rotation of the head. Immunohistochemistry of beta amyloid protein precursor is gold standard method for identifying pathological diffuse axonal lesions, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> however <b>nonspecific</b> in brain trauma. In the diagnosis of this syndrome pediatricians and forensic examiners must take into account the particularities of each case, avoiding scientific speculation, to intuit controversies and always be familiar with the differential diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} MRI {{findings in}} {{a large group of}} patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Methods: Idiopathic generalized epilepsies were diagnosed according to clinical and EEG criteria following International League Against Epilepsy recommendations. MRI was performed in a 2. 0 T scanner using a previously established epilepsy protocol. Images were reviewed, and any abnormality was reported. Patients were divided in those with and without MRI abnormalities. Comparisons were made between these groups concerning age, age at seizure onset, subsyndrome, EEG findings, and seizure control. Results: Of the 134 MRIs evaluated, 33 (24 %) showed abnormalities, most of <b>which</b> (88 %) <b>were</b> <b>nonspecific.</b> There <b>were</b> eight main abnormalities: arachnoid cyst, diffuse cortical atrophy, basal ganglia abnormalities (signal alterations and prominent perivascular spaces), ventricular abnormalities (uni- or bilateral increased volume of the lateral ventricles), white matter abnormalities (increased T 2 signal in the frontal lobes), reduced hippocampal volume, focal gyral abnormality, and area of gliosis in the frontal lobe. Comparisons between the groups showed a higher proportion of EEG focalities in patients with abnormal MRI, <b>which</b> <b>were</b> in most part concordant with the location of the MRI abnormalities. Conclusions: Twenty-four percent of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies had MRI abnormalities. However, the majority of these abnormalities <b>were</b> <b>nonspecific...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cerebritis is an {{infection}} {{of the brain that}} normally leads to the formation of an abscess within the brain itself. It is the inflammation of the cerebrum, a structure within the brain, which performs a number of important functions, including most of the things which people associate with being human, such as memory and speech. It is also defined as a purulent nonencapsulated parenchymal infection of brain <b>which</b> <b>is</b> characterized by <b>nonspecific</b> features on CT (ill-defined low density area with peripheral enhancement) and cannot reliably be distinguished from neoplasms.|$|R
40|$|Background : The {{possibility}} {{exists that}} cocaine {{use in the}} absence of frank clinical presentation of acute cardiac events may be associated with subclinical injury including the release of myoglobin <b>which</b> <b>is</b> a <b>nonspecific</b> marker for cardiac and skeletal muscle damage. Objectives : This investigation examined urine specimens for potential differences be tween cocaine use and the expression of myoglobin (a marker associated with cardiovascular damage, inflammation and oxidative stress). Methods : 40 urine specimens were assayed for cocaine metabolites, creatinine, total protein (BSA) and myoglobin using ELISA and colorimetry. Results : We observed significant differences between male control and male cocaine positive urines for myoglobin. Interestingly, there was no statistically significant difference in females between control and cocaine positive urines. Conclusion : Differences in the urinary expression of myoglobin may be important in evaluating the gender based effects of cocaine use and may have potential clinical applications <b>which</b> may <b>be</b> related to gender differences in signs and symptoms of cocaine toxicity. </div...|$|R
30|$|The acute {{respiratory}} distress syndrome (ARDS) is {{a condition}} with the acute onset of noncardiac respiratory failure that develops {{in response to a}} series of insults to the alveolar-capillary barrier [1]. The current mainstay therapy for ARDS is largely supportive [2, 3]. This has been shown to reduce mortality by limiting further iatrogenic injury to the already injured lungs. However, the mortality rate of ARDS is still unacceptably high [4]. ARDS is largely caused by the local alveolar and circulating “cytokine storm” that happens with bacterial/virus infection, burn/trauma and some possible iatrogenic factors, such as high-volume ventilation [5]. This has encouraged the development of several specific targeted pharmacologic therapy directed against single key pathogenic mediators. However, most clinical trials have proven no benefit to disease outcome and were stopped early for futility [6]. Investigators shifted their interests into the extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) modality, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> a <b>nonspecific,</b> broad-spectrum method to blunt the “cytokine storm” by immediately clearing a series of circulating and resident mediators [7].|$|R
25|$|Severe {{alcoholic}} hepatitis has a poor prognosis and is notoriously difficult to treat. Without any treatment, 20-50% of patients may die within a month, but evidence shows treatment may extend life beyond one month (i.e., reduce short-term mortality). Available treatment options include pentoxifylline (PTX), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> a <b>nonspecific</b> TNF inhibitor, corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone (CS), corticosteroids with N-acetylcysteine (CS with NAC), and corticosteroids with pentoxifylline (CS with PTX). Data suggest that CS alone or CS with NAC {{are most effective}} at reducing short-term mortality. Unfortunately, corticosteroids are contraindicated in some patients, such as those who have active gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, kidney failure, or pancreatitis. In these cases PTX may be considered {{on a case by}} case basis in lieu of CS; some evidence shows PTX is better than no treatment at all and may be comparable to CS while other data show no evidence of benefit over placebo. Unfortunately, there are currently no drug treatments that decrease these patients’ risk of dying in the longer term, at 3–12 months and beyond.|$|R
40|$|Hypogonadism is {{a common}} {{condition}} which occurs more frequently in older men. It is characterized by low testosterone (T) and is associated with symptoms <b>which</b> <b>are</b> often <b>nonspecific.</b> A key symptom is low libido, {{but it can also}} be associated with erectile dysfunction, reduced muscle mass and strength, increased body fat, reduced bone mineral density and osteoporosis, reduced vitality, and depressed mood. Hypogonadism is linked with a variety of comorbid conditions including erectile dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis. However, the condition is often underdiagnosed. T supplementation in hypogonadism is associated with a range of benefits including improved sexual function, increased lean body mass and/or reduced fat mass, and improved bone mineral density. A variety of T supplementation formulations are available. Although there is no evidence of increased risk of initiating prostate cancer with T supplementation, it is contraindicated in men with prostate cancer. It is important that primary care physicians are aware of both the signs and symptoms of hypogonadism, the monitoring and testing that is required and the merits and advantages of the various T preparations to ensure optimal management of the condition with a treatment approach that best suits patients' needs...|$|R
