In January 1941, sea trials began on the new corvette HMCS Cobalt. She was fitted with ordinary light projectors—neither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed—on temporary supports {{on one side of}} the hull; brightness was controlled manually. The trial <b>was</b> <b>sufficiently</b> promising for a better prototype to be developed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper solves merger {{formation}} {{problem in}} Cournot oligopolies by a cooperative and computational approach. In three-firm linear oligopolies, monopoly will be formed (or be stable) if its merging cost <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> low and cost differentials <b>are</b> <b>sufficiently</b> large. When monopoly is unprofitable {{due to high}} merging costs, a profitable two-member merger will be formed if its efficient member receives a sufficiently large share of the merger’s gain and cost differentials <b>are</b> <b>sufficiently</b> small. In n-firm linear oligopolies, monopoly will be formed if number of firms and merging costs both <b>are</b> <b>sufficiently</b> small and cost differentials <b>are</b> <b>sufficiently</b> large...|$|R

40|$|A general {{model of}} non-cooperating agents {{exploiting}} a renewable resource is considered. Assuming that the resource <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> productive we prove that {{there exists a}} continuum of Markov-perfect Nash equilibria (MPNE). Although these equilibria lead to over-exploitation one can approximate the efficient solution by MPNE both in the state space and the payoff space. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for maximal exploitation of the resource to qualify as a MPNE. This condition is satisfied if there <b>are</b> <b>sufficiently</b> many players, or if the players <b>are</b> <b>sufficiently</b> impatient, or if the capacity of each player <b>is</b> <b>sufficiently</b> high. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence <b>was</b> <b>sufficiently</b> impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|Aestheticism <b>was</b> <b>sufficiently</b> {{in vogue}} to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, {{simultaneously}} priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and disembarking the following day. Originally planned to last four months, it continued {{for almost a year}} due to the commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design.|$|E
5|$|Around 0000UTC on September25, the {{disturbance}} <b>was</b> <b>sufficiently</b> organized to be declared a tropical depression. Shortly after, the NHC issued their first advisory {{on the system}} as it intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Kyle. The {{center of the storm}} was slightly elongated but moderate wind shear continued to impact the circulation. Kyle track northward in response to an area of high pressure east of Bermuda and an area of low pressure along the eastern United States. The sheared structure of the storm led to problems with recording the intensity of the storm throughout the day. Hurricane Hunters continuously flew into the storm to record information; however, their estimates were considered too high as the storm was disorganized.|$|E
