25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer</b> failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E
5000|$|The act of {{restarting}} a <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer</b> {{is commonly}} referred to as [...] "kicking the dog" [...] or other similar terms; this is typically done by writing to a watchdog control port. Alternatively, in microcontrollers that have an integrated <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer,</b> the watchdog is sometimes kicked by executing a special machine language instruction. An example of this is the CLRWDT (clear <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer)</b> instruction found in the instruction set of some PIC microcontrollers.|$|E
50|$|Watchdog Timers are {{devices that}} are often {{implemented}} with special hardware in high availability systems. These devices are set to automatically interrupt, reset or power cycle an Entity after {{a certain period of}} time if it is not programmatically reset first. The purpose of a <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer</b> device is to provide a fault-detection mechanism. The HPI <b>Watchdog</b> <b>Timer</b> Management Instrument is designed to interface with this sort of hardware mechanism. It is modeled very closely on the IPMI <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Watchdog</b> <b>timers</b> {{may have}} either fixed or {{programmable}} time intervals. Some <b>watchdog</b> <b>timers</b> allow the time interval to be programmed by selecting from among a few selectable, discrete values. In others, the interval can {{be programmed to}} arbitrary values. Typically, watchdog time intervals range from ten milliseconds to a minute or more. In a multistage <b>watchdog,</b> each <b>timer</b> may have its own, unique time interval.|$|R

50|$|Single node systems use a {{comparable}} mechanism called a <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer.</b> A <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer</b> will reset the node if the node {{does not tell}} the watchdog circuit that it is operating well.

5000|$|A <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer</b> {{will perform}} a hard reset {{of a system}} unless some {{sequence}} is performed that generally indicates the system is alive, such as a write operation from an onboard processor. During normal operation, software schedules a write to the <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer</b> at regular intervals to prevent the timer from running out. If radiation causes the processor to operate incorrectly, it is unlikely the software will work correctly enough to clear the <b>watchdog</b> <b>timer.</b> The watchdog eventually times out and forces a hard reset to the system. This is considered a last resort to other methods of radiation hardening.|$|E

50|$|In {{embedded}} systems and control systems, <b>watchdog</b> <b>timers</b> {{are often used}} to activate fail-safe circuitry.
