He had threatened a flight attendant with an air gun. He demanded to talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke and {{a press conference to}} make a political statement. His demands were not met, and he surrendered while the plane <b>was</b> <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> Oslo. This was the first hijacking in Norway.|$|E

25|$|The {{group of}} {{refugees}} arrived in Novorossiysk on 17 January. They lived in their railway car, which <b>was</b> <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> the station. By February, {{it became obvious}} that the Whites had lost the civil war. General Wrangel warned them that the situation was beyond hope and they decided to leave. They departed on the Italian liner Semiramisa bound for Venice on 3 March 1920. Grand Duke Andrei and his mother were the last Romanovs to leave Russia for exile.|$|E
25|$|Two {{fighter jets}} escorted Flight 63 to Logan Airport. The plane <b>was</b> <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle of}} the runway, and Reid was arrested on the ground {{while the rest of the}} {{passengers}} were bussed to the main terminal. Authorities later found over 280grams (10oz) of plastic explosives TATP and PETN hidden in the hollowed soles of Reid's black shoes, enough to blow a substantial hole in the aircraft. He was later convicted, and sentenced to 3 life terms plus 110 years without parole. He is currently incarcerated at Supermax prison ADX Florence.|$|E
25|$|Although {{aware that}} he was a {{potential}} IRA assassination target, Gow declined to take anything more than routine security precautions. Unlike most British MPs of that era, he left his telephone number and home address in the local telephone directory. In the early hours of 30 July 1990, a bomb was planted under Gow's Austin Montego car, which <b>was</b> <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> the driveway of his house in Hankham, near Pevensey in East Sussex. The 4½-lb Semtex bomb detonated at 08:39 as Gow reversed out of his driveway, leaving him with severe wounds to his lower body. He died ten minutes later.|$|E

25|$|At 6:00am, {{one of the}} assassins, Hamdi Quran, went to {{the dining}} room of the hotel to make sure that Minister Ze'evi would indeed be there in {{accordance}} with his routine schedule. At 06:20am Ze'evi and his wife Yael went down {{to the dining room}} of the hotel. When Quran noticed the minister was in a dining hall, he immediately went back to the room where the assassins were staying and updated his associates. As a result, two assailants headed towards their vehicle, which <b>was</b> <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> the hotel's basement parking lot, to fetch their pistols which were modified with silencers. In order not to raise suspicion, the two assailants returned separately back to their room through the staircase instead of the elevator.|$|E
25|$|The {{main concern}} was the energy level for Spirit. To {{increase}} the amount of light hitting the solar panels, the rover <b>was</b> <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> the northern part of Home Plate on as steep a slope as possible. It was expected that the level of dust cover on the solar panels would increase by 70 percent and that a slope of 30 degrees would be necessary to survive the winter. In February, a tilt of 29.9 degrees was achieved. Extra energy was available at times, and a high definition panorama named Bonestell was produced. At other times there was only enough solar energy to recharge the batteries, communication with Earth was minimized and all unnecessary instruments were switched off. At winter solstice the energy production declined to 235 watt hours per sol.|$|E

After the assassination of Admiral Carrero Blanco the Spanish royal family thought it ought to acquire more bullet-proof cars, although one car was shipped to England, where it <b>was</b> <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> Chobham for almost a year as nobody knew how to do the work needed to upgrade it. The second contract (worth over £1/2 million) allowed Mardas to set up new security companies: Alcom Devices Ltd, and Night Vision Systems Ltd (under the collective name of [...] "Project Alcom") in St Albans Mews off Edgware Road, London, to provide a sophisticated communications system for Juan Carlos, so he could be in constant contact with his security services. Mardas employed Arthur Johnson (known as Johnny Johnson), a former Ministry of Defence official.|$|E

2500|$|Bordesoulle's {{horsemen}} began pressing back Bistrom's troops. In {{the early}} afternoon, Napoleon reached the battlefield. Since the infantry under Ney and Friant {{had not yet}} arrived, the French emperor instructed Bordesoulle and Defrance to withdraw a little and ordered the cannons to cease fire. The lack of serious action satisfied Saint-Priest that {{he had nothing to}} worry about. The Russian commander gave no orders to move the corps wagon train which <b>was</b> <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> Reims. He believed his defenses were manned in sufficient strength. By 4:00 pm Ney and Friant were on hand. With evening only two hours away, Napoleon ordered an immediate attack.|$|E
2500|$|In 1929, in {{collaboration}} with Flemming Lassen, he won a Danish Architect's Association competition for designing the [...] "House of the Future" [...] which was built full scale at the subsequent exhibition in Copenhagen's Forum. It was a spiral-shaped, flat-roofed house in glass and concrete, incorporating a private garage, a boathouse and a helicopter pad. Other striking features were windows that rolled down like car windows, a conveyor tube for the mail and a kitchen stocked with ready-made meals. A Dodge Cabriolet Coupé <b>was</b> <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> the garage, there was a Chris Craft in the boathouse and an Autogyro on the roof.

2500|$|The Merlin 61 was {{phased out}} early in 1943 {{in favour of}} the Merlin 63 and 63A. The new engine had {{increased}} power resulting from engine improvements and engine limitations of +18lbf/(sq in) and 3,000 rpm (5 minute combat). During {{the second half of}} 1943, production of the Merlin 63 powered F Mk IX was discontinued in favour of the Merlin 66 powered LF Mk IX. Early production Spitfire IXs suffered from vapour locks in the fuel lines resulting from fuel evaporating if the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> direct sunlight. As a result of this the gun-camera was moved from the port wingroot to the starboard wingroot and a fuel cooler, fed by a small round air-intake was fitted in its place. This fuel cooler was also fitted to early PR Mk XIs ...|$|E
