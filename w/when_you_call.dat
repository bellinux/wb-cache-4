500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you tell me you need me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E

In reference to this, one of Dial-A-Song's many slogans over the years was the tongue-in-cheek [...] "Always Busy, Often Broken". The number (718)-387-6962, was a local Brooklyn number and was charged accordingly, but the band advertised it with the line: [...] "Free <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>call</b> from work".|$|E

2500|$|During one of {{the many}} festivals that would take place in the city, the people would gather in their temple and place offerings of food before their idols.

Can they help you or hurt you?" [...] The people would reply, [...] "It is the way of our forefathers." [...] Ibrahim declared [...] "I am sick of your gods! Truly I am their enemy." [...] After several years, Ibrahim became a young man. He still could not believe that his people were worshipping the statues. He laughed whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them. He started feeling angry towards his people, who could not realize that these are only stones that could neither benefit nor harm them.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dearest Jane! {{who could}} have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate {{them as much as}} possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find {{occasions}} for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.

6000|$|Ans. Deep reproof! {{but why did}} you not shew me my evil in thus calling it, when {{opposed to}} the substance, and the thing signified? Is it the substance, is it the thing signified?
