500|$|United States of America v. Progressive, Inc., Erwin Knoll, Samuel Day, Jr., and Howard Morland, 467 F. Supp. 990 (W.D. <b>Wis.</b> 1979), was {{a lawsuit}} brought against The Progressive {{magazine}} by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) in 1979. A temporary injunction was granted against The Progressive {{to prevent the}} publication of an article by activist Howard Morland that purported to reveal the [...] "secret" [...] of the hydrogen bomb. Though the information had been compiled from publicly available sources, the DOE claimed that it fell under the [...] "born secret" [...] clause of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.|$|E
500|$|According to {{an article}} which {{appeared}} in the June 29, 1913 edition of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "Kelly pool was invented by Kelly Mulvaney". The quote is attributed in the article to Hugh E. Keough, a well-known Chicago sportswriter of 31 years. Further information is provided in a November 10, 1916 Indianapolis Star obituary for one Calistus Mulvaney, who is listed as having died the preceding day. The obituary, entitled [...] "Originated 'Kelly Pool, states that: [...] "...for thirty five years [...] was identified with Kelly pool in the loop district... He was widely known as the father of 'Kelly pool' and better known as Kelly Mulvaney than Calistus. He was born at Fox Lake <b>Wis</b> sixty-five years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Lawyers for The Progressive filed {{a motion}} to vacate the {{decision}} {{on the grounds that}} the information contained in Morland's article was already in the public domain. The basis for this claim was two reports from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory UCRL-4725, [...] "Weapons Development During June 1956", and UCRL-5280, [...] "Weapons Development During June 1958", which contained detailed information on thermonuclear weapon design. One of them, UCRL-4725, gave details about Bassoon, a three-stage thermonuclear device tested during Operation Redwing in 1956. It was found on the shelves of the Los Alamos library by Dmitri Rotow, a researcher for the American Civil Liberties Union. According to the government, the reports had been inadvertently declassified. On June 15, in 486 F. Supp. 5 (W.D. <b>Wis.</b> 1979), Warren therefore denied the motion on the grounds that such an error did not place the documents in the public domain. The appellants, in [...] 610 F. 2d 819 (7th Cir. 1979), immediately appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, claiming that the two documents had been on the shelves for a considerable period of time. The government now advanced the argument that [...] "technical data" [...] was not protected by the First Amendment. The motions for an expedited review were denied because the magazine's lawyers had waived that right—something Morland and The Progressive editors discovered only from the court. The preliminary injunction therefore remained in effect for six months.|$|E
