5|$|The {{level of}} <b>wing</b> <b>sweep,</b> {{the angle of}} the wings in {{relation}} to the fuselage, can be altered in flight at the pilot's control. The variable wing can adopt any sweep angle between 25 degrees and 67 degrees, with a corresponding speed range for each angle; some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing-sweep system to reduce pilot workload. When the wings are swept back, the exposed wing area is lowered and drag is significantly decreased, which is conducive to performing high-speed low-level flight. The weapons pylons pivot with {{the angle of the}} variable-sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions.|$|E

5000|$|Joined wing: a tandem layout {{in which}} the front low <b>wing</b> <b>sweeps</b> back and/or the rear high <b>wing</b> <b>sweeps</b> {{forwards}} such that they join {{at or near the}} tips to form a continuous surface in a hollow diamond or triangle shape. The Ligeti Stratos is a rare example.|$|R
5000|$|Oblique wing: one <b>wing</b> <b>sweeps</b> {{forward and}} the other back. The NASA AD-1 had a full-span wing {{structure}} with variable sweep.|$|R
5000|$|Swept back (aka [...] "swept wing"): The <b>wing</b> <b>sweeps</b> {{rearwards}} {{from the}} root to the tip. In early tailless examples, {{such as the}} Dunne aircraft, this allowed the outer wing section {{to act like a}} conventional empennage (tail) to provide aerodynamic stability. At transonic speeds swept wings have lower drag, but can handle badly in or near a stall and require high stiffness to avoid aeroelasticity at high speeds. Common on high-subsonic and early supersonic designs e.g. the Hawker Hunter.|$|R
25|$|Before {{evaluating}} the final <b>wing</b> <b>sweep</b> configuration of 69°, a Martin-Baker ejection seat was fitted {{for the first}} time and the Rolls-Royce Derwent engine was changed for a Bristol Orpheus of greater thrust. The first flight, with the final sweep setting of 69° was made by Denis Tayler on 18 October 1960 at RAE Bedford; this was, at the time, the greatest degree of wing-sweep in the world.|$|E
25|$|The Tornado F3 {{made its}} maiden flight on 20November1985. Enhancements over the F2 {{included}} RB.199 Mk 104 engines, which were optimised for high-altitude use with longer afterburner nozzles, {{the capacity to}} carry four underwing Sidewinder missiles rather than two, and automatic <b>wing</b> <b>sweep</b> control. The F3's primary armament when it was introduced into service was the short-range Sidewinder and the medium-range Skyflash missiles, a British design based on the American AIM-7 Sparrow.|$|E
25|$|Yakovlev Yak-50 was {{an early}} {{experimental}} turbojet interceptor aircraft designed in 1948 by the Yakovlev OKB in the USSR. The aircraft was essentially a stretched version of the Yakovlev Yak-30 (1948), with a more powerful engine and greater <b>wing</b> <b>sweep.</b> The Yak-50 is perhaps most significant as the first Yakovlev aircraft equipped with velosipednoye (bicycle) landing gear, a trademark of later Yakovlev designs. The Yak-50 designation was later reused for a propeller-driven aerobatic and trainer aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|M-wing: {{the inner}} <b>wing</b> section <b>sweeps</b> forward, {{and the outer}} section sweeps backwards. Allows the wing to be highly swept while minimising the {{undesirable}} effects of aeroelastic bending. Periodically studied, but never used on an aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Ar 234 V16:Intended to {{be fitted}} with an {{experimental}} crescent <b>wing</b> with <b>sweep</b> back lessening towards the tips, evolved by Rüdiger Kosin and Walther Lehmann. The wing was constructed but was destroyed {{before it could}} be fitted.|$|R
25|$|The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Short Brothers and Harland Ltd of Belfast on 2 August 1950. The machine was designed to allow three different <b>wing</b> <b>sweep</b> angles (50°, 60° and 69°). The sweep adjustment of the wings was made when the aircraft was on the ground. Two different tail plane positions (a) low on the rear fuselage and (b) {{on top of the}} fin, were also tested. This requirement was met by the construction of two entirely different rear fuselages and tail units.|$|E
25|$|Citation Longitude (Model 700) - The {{project was}} {{announced}} in May 2012. It was perceived as the follow-on development to the now-canceled Citation Columbus. Its fuselage cross-section (83.25 inch circular section) is from the Citation Latitude. Cessna projected that first delivery would occur in late 2017. The aircraft will have a T-tail empennage, area-rule fuselage contouring, and 28.6° <b>wing</b> <b>sweep.</b> Powered by two Honeywell HTF7700L turbofan engines, rated at 7,550 lb (33.58 kN) thrust. The wings will incorporate moderate winglets. Construction will be aluminum for both wing and fuselage.|$|E
25|$|In January 1951, North American Aviation {{delivered}} an unsolicited {{proposal for}} a supersonic day fighter to the United States Air Force. Named Sabre 45 because of its 45° <b>wing</b> <b>sweep,</b> it represented an evolution of the F-86 Sabre. The mockup was inspected on 7 July 1951, and after over a hundred modifications, the new aircraft was accepted as the F-100 on 30 November 1951. Extensive use of titanium throughout the aircraft was notable. On 3 January 1952, the USAF ordered two prototypes followed by 23 F-100As in February and an additional 250 F-100As in August.|$|E

40|$|The pitch, yaw, {{and roll}} damping, {{as well as}} the oscillatory {{stability}} in pitch and in yaw, were measured for two canard wing configurations with <b>wing</b> <b>sweeps</b> of 44 deg and 60 deg. Tests were made at free stream Mach numbers of 0. 3, 0. 4, and 0. 7 and for angles of attack from about - 4 deg to 20 deg. The effects of various components such as the canard, nose strakes, wings, vertical tail, and horizontal tail were determined. The basic canard wing, vertical tail configurations generally had positive damping in pitch, yaw, and roll. The effect of the canard was generally beneficial except for its tendency to decrease the oscillatory directional stability...|$|R

25|$|The F-111 was an {{all-weather}} attack aircraft, {{capable of}} low-level penetration of enemy defenses to deliver ordnance on the target. The F-111 featured variable-geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with side-by-side seating. The cockpit {{was part of}} an escape crew capsule. The <b>wing</b> <b>sweep</b> varied between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The wing included leading edge slats and double slotted flaps over its full length. The airframe was made up mostly of aluminium alloys with steel, titanium and other materials used in places. The fuselage was made of a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb structure panels for skin.|$|E
25|$|The Tornado F2 was {{the initial}} {{version of the}} Tornado ADV in Royal Air Force service, with 18 being built. It first flew on 5March1984 and was powered by the same RB.199 Mk 103 engines used by the IDS Tornado, capable of four <b>wing</b> <b>sweep</b> settings, and fitted to carry only two underwing Sidewinder missiles. Serious {{problems}} were discovered with the Foxhunter radar, which meant that the aircraft were delivered with concrete and lead ballast installed in the nose as an interim measure until they could be fitted with the radar sets. The ballast was nicknamed Blue Circle, which was a play on the Rainbow Codes nomenclature, and a British brand of cement called Blue Circle.|$|E
25|$|The F-111B was an {{all-weather}} {{interceptor aircraft}} intended to defend U.S. Navy carrier battle groups against bombers and anti-ship missiles. The F-111 features variable geometry wings, an internal weapons bay and a cockpit with {{side by side}} seating. The cockpit {{is part of an}} escape crew capsule. The <b>wing</b> <b>sweep</b> varies between 16 degrees and 72.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). The airframe consisted mostly of aluminum alloys with steel, titanium and other materials also used. The fuselage is a semi-monocoque structure with stiffened panels and honeycomb sandwich panels for skin. The F-111B was powered by two Pratt & Whitney TF30 afterburning turbofan engines and included the AN/AWG-9 radar system for controlling the AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles. Poor visibility over the nose made the aircraft more difficult to handle for carrier operations.|$|E

40|$|For a {{significant}} portion of the wingbeat cycle in insect-like flapping, the <b>wing</b> <b>sweeps</b> at more or less constant speed and angle of attack. The aerodynamics associated with this phase of insect-like wing kinematics are investigated by making 2 D- 2 C particle image velocimetry measurements on a rotating wing immersed in a tank of seeded water. In an attempt to capture flow features pertaining to many insects and future flapping-wing micro air vehicles, the experiments are carried out at two Reynolds numbers— 500 and 15000 —and various techniques, including vortex identification schemes, are used to analyse the results. The behaviour of the leading-edge vortex, especially in terms of its spanwise propagation, is studied here. Results show that, despite its unsteady nature, the structure of the leading-edge vortex is essentially stable once fully developed. I...|$|R

500|$|While superficially {{similar to}} the later F-117, the Have Blue prototypes were smaller aircraft, about one quarter {{the weight of the}} F-117, with a <b>wing</b> <b>sweep</b> of 72.5° and inward-canted {{vertical}} tails (inverse V-tail). Radar-absorbent material (RAM), developed in a Lockheed laboratory, were applied to the aircraft's flat surfaces – for the windscreen, special coatings were applied to give them metallic characteristics. The aircraft's gross weight of 9,200–12,500lb (4,173–5,669kg) enabled the aircraft to use the landing gear from the Northrop F-5 fighter. The aircraft's powerplants were two [...] General Electric J85-GE-4As of the T-2C Buckeye. Because stealth took precedence above all else, the aircraft was inherently unstable. As a result, a quadruple redundant fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system was integrated into the aircraft to give it normal flying characteristics. The flight control system was borrowed from the F-16. The overwing engine inlet was covered by a low-RCS grid; during takeoffs, when more air is needed, blow-in doors were constructed at the upper fuselage to admit additional airflow.|$|E

40|$|The {{enhanced}} aerodynamic {{performance of}} insects results from an interaction of three distinct yet interactive mechanisms: delayed stall, rotational circulation, and wake capture. Delayed stall functions during the translational {{portions of the}} stroke, when the <b>wings</b> <b>sweep</b> through {{the air with a}} large angle of attack. In contrast, rotational circulation and wake capture generate aerodynamic forces during stroke reversals, when the wings rapidly rotate and change direction. In addition to contributing to the lift required to keep an insect aloft, these two rotational mechanisms provide a potent means by which the animal can modulate the direction and magnitude of flight forces during steering maneuvers. A comprehensive theory incorporating both translational and rotational mechanisms may explain the diverse patterns of wing motion displayed by different species of insects. Insects were the first animals to evolve active flight and remain unsurpassed in many aspects of aerodynamic performance and maneuverability...|$|R
