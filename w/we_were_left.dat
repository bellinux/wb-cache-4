500|$|Although Fischer {{had ended}} his formal {{education}} at age 16, {{dropping out of}} Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals.

Daniel Martin gave the episode a positive review on The Guardian guardian.co.uk, {{saying that it}} [...] "can lay credible claim to being the greatest episode of Doctor Who there has ever been". He went on to declare: [...] "It's just ridiculously good— so much that there's scarcely any point in picking out moments because there was an iconic sequence every couple of seconds." [...] In particular he praised Father Octavian's death scene, noting how [...] "despair creeps over Matt Smith's face as he realises {{he is going to}} have to leave him to die; Octavian's final speech weeps with honour and elegance". IGN's Matt Wales gave the episode a 10 out of 10 rating, saying it was [...] "packed with huge, iconic moments" [...] and stated, [...] "by the end of it, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> with more questions than answers and a far better sense of Moffat's meticulous planning".|$|E

500|$|Roger Holland of PopMatters {{praised the}} episode. He {{wrote that the}} finale [...] "took us {{all the way back}} to the heart of Veronica Mars". Although he also commented on the lack of closure in [...] "The Bitch Is Back", he still {{believed}} that the finale highlighted some of the main themes of the series. [...] "The final scenes of Veronica Mars offered no sense of closure. Rather, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> with the sense [...] we'd been denied a genuinely thrilling fourth season". The TV Addict lauded the episode for returning to the tone and themes of the first season, calling it [...] "the perfect mix of mystery, excitement, romance and snappy one-liners". The publication also praised Bell and Colantoni's performances. Jesse Hastenger of PopMatters graded the episode an 8 out of 10. Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote expressed dissatisfaction with The CW for cancelling the series, but she praised the episode as a standalone installment: [...] "As for the final two episodes themselves, they would have been magnificent season finales. It was classic Veronica Mars. Drama, comedy, inside jokes [...] and callbacks to yesteryear." [...] On his blog, Cultural Learnings, critic Myles McNutt said that Colantoni should have been nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for his performance in the episode, saying that [...] "this final sacrifice is Colantoni's strongest character arc all season and is the proper episode selection for the actor." [...] On a ranking of all 64 Veronica Mars episodes, BuzzFeed ranked the episode 54th, declaring that it was [...] "extremely disappointing" [...] and [...] "pretty dull".|$|E

Crawford added that she is [...] "really hoping Mercedes is found out soon before Riley says his vows. Little Bobby needs a stable mother, not mental Mercy". Stephen of the Daily Mail later questioned whether Mercedes will [...] "bag Riley before she gets her bus pass at 60?" [...] She added that Mercedes accusation that Mitzeee has kidnapped Bobby [...] "is relative small fry" [...] in comparison to her other recent misdemeanours. Morgan of All About Soap said that [...] "the end of tonight’s episode was the moment fans had been patiently waited for – evil Mercedes was being carted off down the cop shop". She added that Riley [...] "come perilously close to pushing Mercedes over that rooftop, but that wouldn’t have been a bad thing, right?" [...] Following Mercedes' trial, Crawford opined that she could not [...] "quite believe she managed it, but she was cleared of all charges – will the mixed-up McQueen ever get her comeuppance? We’ll give Mercy her dues: she gave an outstanding performance in court – even <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> wondering if Riley had actually abused her – so a non-the-wiser jury had no chance against the wily woman". She added that [...] "someone needs to stand up to merciless Mercy". Stephen felt that Myra deciding whether to give Mercedes another chance would be difficult as she would have to [...] "manage {{to keep up with the}} many personalities the show has given the girl?

500|$|Tomb Raider was {{critically}} acclaimed. In a 'world exclusive' review, GamesMaster magazine {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} 90%, {{as well as the}} [...] "GamesMaster Gold award" [...] (awarded to games that manage a score of 90% or above). The editor regarded the quality of the visuals, the length and depth of the gameplay, and the [...] "spectacular" [...] last third of the game as the highlights. The summary said [...] "sitting back exhausted <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> with just one question dribbling forth from our gaping jaws. How on earth are they going to top this in the sequel? Because of one thing there can be no doubt. Lara is back." [...] IGN's Keza MacDonald also spoke extremely positively, stating that they felt the game was [...] "exciting" [...] and [...] "beautifully presented", included [...] "great characterization" [...] and [...] "more depth than you would expect". They gave the game an overall score of 9.1 out of 10, the highest score they have given a game in the series since 1996's Tomb Raider, describing it as [...] "amazing" [...] and concluding that the game [...] "did justice" [...] to both the character and franchise. Ryan Taljonick of GamesRadar lauded the location's setting and environment, and expressed that [...] "not one area ever feels like a rehash of another". Taljonick also felt that the game had great pacing, and that it is [...] "unrivaled by any other game in the genre". Furthermore, the reviewer considered Lara's character development as [...] "an integral part" [...] of the whole game's experience, and concluded that Tomb Raider [...] "is a fantastic game and an excellent origin story for one of gaming's original treasure seekers". Australian TV show Good Game praised the game: it was rated 10/10 by both hosts, becoming the eighth game in the show's seven-year run to do so. Giant Bomb gave the game four stars out of five, stating that [...] "Tomb Raiders tone is somewhat at odds with its action, but the reborn Lara Croft seems primed for a successful new adventuring career".|$|E

[...] The oscillators were built for the group by Richard Durrett. Electronic devices were also used live and on the album to process other instruments and Moskowitz's voice.

Others who flew for the loyalists included: Bert Acosta, Gordon Berry, and Frederic Ives Lord. When he returned he was questioned by Chief Assistant United States Attorney, John F. Dailey on January 15, 1937 in New York. Eddie's lawyer was Colonel Lewis Landes. On January 20, 1937, Eddie, Bert, and Gordon flew to Washington, D.C. and had to testify again.

2500|$|Match referee Chris Broad {{was also}} {{critical}} of the security provided. He stated {{that he and his}} colleagues were left like 'sitting ducks' in the trailing minivan during the attack. He also accused the security personnel of fleeing the scene. He questioned why the Pakistan team which usually travelled with the Sri Lankan team was delayed by seven minutes that day and avoided being attacked. Javed Miandad was critical of Broad's comments and demanded that International Cricket Council ban him for life. Pakistan Cricket Board lodged a formal complaint against Chris Broad with the International Cricket Council on 9 March 2009. Ijaz Butt, the head of Pakistan Cricket Board accused Broad of lying. Umpire Simon Taufel also said that the umpire's minibus was abandoned while the players' bus was moved to the ground to evacuate the players. [...] Slamming the security entourage for abandoning them and inability of the police to arrest the attackers Simon said,"You tell me why no one was caught. You tell me why. Supposedly 25 armed commandos were in our convoy, and when the team bus got going again, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>left</b> on our own." [...] Co-umpire Steve Davis said [...] "he felt let down" [...] by the security. International Cricket Council umpires performance manager for East Asia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Peter Manuel told Dawn [...] that the minivan carrying the umpires was basically abandoned by the security personnel. 'It was unbelievable. Bullets were raining on us and not a shot was fired in our defense by the Pakistan security officials,' the outraged Manuel said. Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss backed the comments made by Simon Taufel, Chris Broad and Steve Davis criticising the security. Intikhab Alab, Pakistan cricket team's coach, asked Chris Broad to apologise to his country and team due to the remarks he made against Pakistani police security. [...] English cricketer Dominic Cork who was commentating in Pakistan on the series and who himself was caught in the attack later criticised the security and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt.|$|E
