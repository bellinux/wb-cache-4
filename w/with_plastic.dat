5|$|Some of this retreat has {{resulted}} in efforts {{to slow down the}} loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the Stubai and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered <b>with</b> <b>plastic.</b> In Switzerland plastic sheeting is also used to reduce the melt of glacial ice used as ski slopes. While covering glaciers <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> sheeting may prove advantageous to ski resorts on a small scale, this practice is not expected to be economically practical on a much larger scale.|$|E
5|$|Later, Scully {{comes to}} see Doggett in the hospital. Scully informs him that Bianco and Melnick are <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> surgeons, {{the boy is}} with social services, and no {{criminal}} charges will be pressed against Karras since the electrical charge of the third rail destroyed the proof of the medusas in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Many {{obstacles}} were in {{the course}} rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life. Popular elements of the obstacle course included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an oversized hamster wheel; Pick It, a giant human nose with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a playground slide with ice cream; and Gum Drop, a gigantic gumball machine replica filled <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> balls into which contestants would leap.|$|E
50|$|The P9RC is the {{slightly}} {{modified version of}} the P9R. There are 3 notable differences: the guide rod assembly, the bottom part of the barrel (on which the tilting barrel locking system works) and the grips. Earlier P9Rs had wooden grips, later ones came <b>with</b> <b>plastics</b> as well, while P9RCs were made <b>with</b> <b>plastics</b> only.|$|R

50|$|Barclay ceased {{trading in}} 1971 {{due to an}} {{inability}} to compete <b>with</b> <b>plastics</b> and the rapidly changing market (e.g. Mattel Hot Wheels), not because of lead issues, {{which has been a}} popular misconception (Fendelman and Rosson 2009).|$|R
5|$|The house stood empty {{until the}} Manhattan Project support {{personnel}} arrived in early 1945. The northeast room (the master bedroom) was designated the assembly room. Workbenches and tables were installed. To keep dust and sand out of instruments and tools, {{the windows were}} covered <b>with</b> <b>plastic.</b> Tape was used to fasten {{the edges of the}} plastic and to seal doors and cracks in the walls.|$|E
5|$|With {{contamination}} of the Excedrin at the source having been ruled out, investigators began to focus their investigation on the end-users of the product. The FBI began an investigation into possible product tampering having {{been the source of}} the poison. At the time, Excedrin was packaged in plastic bottles with the mouth of the bottle sealed with foil and the lid secured to the bottle <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> wrap.|$|E
5|$|After filming, {{parts of}} the {{interior}} sets of the So'na ships were added using CGI. Stage 15 on the Paramount lot {{was used for the}} climactic scene between Picard and Ru'afo. Because of the dangers of the four-story scaffolding-like set, the actors were attached by safety cables at all times. Paramount's B tankwhich was used to represent San Francisco Bay in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Homewas used to shoot footage of Picard, Data and Anij at the Ba'ku lake. For a scene in which Data walks along a lake-bed, the actor's tricorder prop was covered <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> to make it watertight.|$|E

5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
5|$|Much {{floating}} plastic trash {{does not}} biodegrade, instead disintegrating {{over time and}} eventually breaking down to the molecular level. Rigid plastics may float for years. In {{the center of the}} Pacific gyre, there is a permanent floating accumulation of mostly plastic waste and there is a similar garbage patch in the Atlantic. Foraging sea birds such as the albatross and petrel may mistake debris for food and accumulate indigestible plastic in their digestive systems. Turtles and whales have been found <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> bags and fishing line in their stomachs. Microplastics may sink, threatening filter feeders on the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Only 160 {{men out of}} the 600 {{members of}} the 9th Battalion tasked with {{eliminating}} the enemy battery at Merville arrived at the rendezvous point. Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, {{in charge of the}} operation, decided to proceed regardless, as the emplacement had to be destroyed by 06:00 to prevent it firing on the invasion fleet and the troops arriving on Sword Beach. In the Battle of Merville Gun Battery, Allied forces disabled the guns <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> explosives at a cost of 75 casualties. The emplacement was found to contain 75mm guns rather than the expected 150mm heavy coastal artillery. Otway's remaining force withdrew with the assistance of a few members of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion.|$|E

5|$|She {{wanted the}} {{production}} and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of gender construction). According to Babbit, the germaphobic character of Mary Brown represents AIDS paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> flowers, fake sky and PVC outfits. The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink picket fence were filmed in Palmdale, California.|$|E
5|$|The character's focal storyline {{involved}} {{a romantic relationship}} <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane). She sustained life-threatening injuries after an aviation accident, in the eighth-season finale, which ultimately ended in her death. The character's death resulted in mixed critical feedback and the reason given for the departure was Leigh's desire {{to spend more time}} with her family. Rhimes has characterized Lexie as being a dork, as well as having issues with saying how she feels. Leigh has been moderately well received by critics, and was among the cast to receive a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{increased to}} about 20,000 as Serb refugees {{from other parts}} of Croatia and Bosnia were relocated by RSK authorities. They initially lived without water or electricity, in damaged buildings patched up <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> sheeting and wooden boards. Residents scavenged the ruins for fragments of glass that they could stick back together to make windows for themselves. The main sources of income were war profiteering and smuggling, though some were able to find jobs in eastern Slavonia's revived oil industry. Reconstruction was greatly delayed by economic sanctions and lack of international aid.|$|E
30|$|As {{a general}} precaution, all {{material}} {{that came into}} contact with the samples was pre-rinsed three times with ultra-clean acetone (puriss.p.a., Sigma-Aldrich 00570).

Using the lander's camera, he establishes rudimentary communication with Earth, first <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> bin lids, and then using hexadecimals. NASA instructs Watney to partially modify the rover's code to link with Pathfinder so they can communicate via text. Watney becomes angry when he learns that the crew has not been told of his survival (and openly expresses it), and Sanders reluctantly lets Henderson finally inform them.|$|E
5|$|Arguments rumbled on {{and there}} were endless delays. Early {{versions}} of the sticky bomb were prone to leaks as well as breakage in transport. There were understandable concerns over the explosive charge: pure nitroglycerin is notoriously susceptible to the slightest knock, but the mixture developed by ICI proved to be very safe even if it should get into the hinges of the storage boxes. By December 1940, fewer than 66,000 had been produced {{and the rate of}} production was disappointing at five to ten thousand per week. Further, it was suggested that the original order of one million be reduced to 200,000. Minor improvements to the design were made, of which the most significant was to replace the glass flask <b>with</b> <b>plastic.</b> Finally, after passing all the required tests, the sticky bomb – now the No 74 Grenade Mk II – was accepted by the Ordnance Board; it was put into full-scale production and it became a service issue.|$|E
5|$|Callie Torres is {{introduced}} as an orthopedic surgery resident with {{a crush on}} intern George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). The two start a relationship and Torres moves into Meredith's house (Meredith and Izzie Stevens lived there as well). Uneased at the way their relationship is progressing, O'Malley confronts her, which results in her moving into a hotel. In {{the aftermath of the}} breakup, she meets and has a one-night stand <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> surgeon Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), who becomes her friend. Torres and O'Malley subsequently reconcile, and the two marry in Las Vegas {{on the spur of the}} moment. Confused, O'Malley confides to fellow intern Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), about his relationship woes over alcohol, leading to a drunken sexual encounter between the two. Torres remains unaware of his sexual encounter, but becomes increasingly suspicious, and announces her desire to conceive a child. Shortly thereafter, however, she discovers that O'Malley has been unfaithful, ending their marriage. Though her personal life is troubled, Torres thrives professionally when she is appointed as the hospital's Chief Resident. However, she soon begins struggling to cope in the role, and is demoted soon thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Doakes {{tries to}} {{question}} Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, {{who says that}} Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines {{what it would be like}} if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E
5|$|For the Meteora shoots, a Greek bishop {{was paid}} to allow filming in the monasteries, but the uninformed Eastern Orthodox monks were mostly {{critical}} of production rolling in their installations. After a trial in the Greek Supreme Court, {{it was decided that}} the monks' only property were the interiors – the exteriors and surrounding landscapes were from the local government. In protest, the monks remained shut inside the monasteries during the shooting, and tried to sabotage production as much as possible, hanging their washing out of their windows and covering the principal monastery <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> bunting and flags to spoil the shots, and placing oil drums to prevent the film crew from landing helicopters. The production team solved the problem with back lighting, matte paintings, and building both a similar scenographic monastery on a nearby unoccupied rock, and a monastery set in Pinewood.|$|E
5|$|Gallimimus are {{featured}} in a stampede scene where {{one of them is}} devoured by the Tyrannosaurus. The Gallimimus was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the T. rex. Its design was based on ostriches, and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd rather than individual animals. As reference for the dinosaurs' run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> pipes standing in as the tree that the Gallimimus jump over. The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump. Horse squeals became the Gallimimus sounds.|$|E
