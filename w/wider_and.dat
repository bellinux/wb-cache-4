In 1981 {{the population of}} the town was 57,731 and in 1991 {{the population of the}} town was 64,219. Shrewsbury is Shropshire's second largest town, after Telford.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, in that they too enabled skirts to spread even <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> more fully.|$|E
5|$|In August 1964, as {{a result}} of the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, in which U.S. naval vessels claimed to have been {{attacked}} by North Vietnamese patrol boats, President Johnson ordered retaliatory air strikes (Operation Pierce Arrow) launched against the north. This did not, however, satisfy the military chiefs, who demanded a <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> more aggressive campaign.|$|E
50|$|In, for example, a {{group of}} images that all have an aspect ratio of 16:9, one image might be 16 inches <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 9 inches high, another 16 centimeters <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 9 centimeters high, and a third might be 8 yards <b>wide</b> <b>and</b> 4.5 yards high.|$|R

5|$|In Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams {{the band}} experimented with {{different}} instruments and drew influences from a <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> more varied range of styles. The album mixes experimental instrumentation with elements both symphonic and electronic, {{and the music}} introduces a minimalist approach full of ethereal sonics. The record carries the concept album format of This Is War and expands the spectrum to revolve around the themes after which it is named.|$|E
5|$|The overall shell {{morphology}} of L.gigas is {{not solely}} {{determined by the}} animal's genes; environmental conditions such as location, diet, temperature and depth, and biological interactions such as predation, can greatly affect it. Juvenile conches develop heavier shells when exposed to predators. Conches also develop <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> thicker shells with fewer but longer spines in deeper water.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} {{dimensions}} of the proboscis have evolved to give different species a <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> therefore more advantageous diet. There is an allometric scaling relationship between body mass of Lepidoptera and length of proboscis from which an interesting adaptive departure is the unusually long-tongued sphinx moth Xanthopan morganii praedicta. Charles Darwin predicted the existence and proboscis length of this moth before its discovery based on {{his knowledge of the}} long-spurred Madagascan star orchid Angraecum sesquipedale.|$|E

5|$|The synagogue {{occupied}} {{the greater part}} of the plot, facing west. It receded from the street regulation-line in accordance with the rule then still enforced in Austria–Hungary, prohibiting non-Catholic places of worship from having a public entrance from the street. The synagogue had a <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> slightly higher central nave and two narrower naves; unlike Förster's synagogue in Vienna, it did not have a basilical plan.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{delay of}} {{several weeks before}} the report was {{distributed}} widely enough to gain the attention of governments. Mass transports of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz began on 15 May 1944 {{at a rate of}} 12,000 people a day. Most went straight to the gas chambers. Vrba argued until {{the end of his life}} that the deportees would have refused to board the trains had the report been distributed <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> publicized sooner, a position generally not accepted by Holocaust historians.|$|E
5|$|Due to the April 2007 Nor'easter, the Rainbow Lake Bridge in Pittsgrove Township {{was washed}} {{out and the}} New Jersey Department of Transportation had {{to replace it with}} a new bridge. This closure led to detours for traffic {{traveling}} between Vineland and Bridgeton. The new Rainbow Lake Bridge was opened in November 2007. The bridge spanning the Maurice River, which connects Vineland and Pittsgrove Township, was closed in July 2007 for planned repairs. This bridge replacement, which was completed in December 2007, cost $5 million and provided a <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> higher crossing of the river.|$|E
50|$|The Saint Lawrence Seaway was {{preceded by}} a number of other canals. In 1871, locks on the Saint Lawrence allowed transit of vessels 186 ft long, 44 ft <b>wide,</b> <b>and</b> 9 ft deep. The First Welland Canal, {{constructed}} from 1824-1829, had a minimum lock size of 110 ft long, 22 ft <b>wide,</b> <b>and</b> 8 ft deep, but it was generally too small to allow passage of larger ocean-going ships.

5|$|Scientists have {{suggested}} that the unique skull shape of Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids indicate different predatory habits than other theropods. Whereas most theropods were characterized by long, low skulls of narrow width, abelisaurid skulls were taller and <b>wider,</b> <b>and</b> often shorter in length as well. The narrow skulls of other theropods were well equipped to withstand the vertical stress of a powerful bite, but not as good at withstanding torsion (twisting). In comparison to modern mammalian predators, most theropods may have used a strategy similar in some ways to that of long- and narrow-snouted canids, with the delivery of many bites weakening the prey animal.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} of the loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is only apparent in adults. Adult males have longer tails and claws than females. The males' plastrons are shorter than the females', presumably to accommodate the males' larger tails. The carapaces of males are <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> less domed than the females', and males typically have wider heads than females. The sex of juveniles and subadults cannot be determined through external anatomy, but can be observed through dissection, laparoscopy (an operation performed on the abdomen), histological examination (cell anatomy), and radioimmunological assays (immune study dealing with radiolabeling).|$|E
5|$|The Keppel {{passageway}} {{was used}} by Asian and early European sailors and traders {{for hundreds of years}} to sail past Singapore. Between 1405 and 1433, Zheng He made seven voyages to more than 30 countries, travelling in fleets of up to 300 ships to the South Pacific, Indian Ocean, Persian Gulf and Africa. The admiral travelled on the order of the Chinese Emperor to establish trade relations with countries west of China. He is believed to have sailed through the waters off Labrador Park, though whether he landed in Singapore is uncertain. In the 17th century, the passageway was abandoned in favour of the <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> more open Main Straits, that lies south of Pulau Satamu, where Raffles Lighthouse stands today.|$|E

5|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10/5 {{carried the}} 2 cm FlaK 38 whose mount was <b>wider,</b> <b>and</b> lighter, {{than that of}} the Flak 30, and the {{platform}} was enlarged to accommodate it from 1942. Vehicle width increased to , but the height returned to that of the normal vehicle. Initially, vehicles modified with the wider platform for the Flak 38 did not have a special designation, but they were given one sometime in 1943. The earliest known use is 1 September 1943, but the older name lingered until 1 December 1944. The Luftwaffe ordered 293 sets of armor plate (Behelfspanzerung) for its vehicles in 1943. These plates covered the radiator, windshield and both sides of the driver's compartment and were fitted to both versions.|$|E
5|$|The {{criticism}} {{against the}} artistic freedom of giving a personal {{interpretation of a}} distant historic event, could have been directed at many other historic paintings of the 19th century. The criticism against Midvinterblot {{would be in the}} same vein during the following years. Larsson retorted that he would happily delegate the task to a younger talent—but he made a second version in oil (№ 237) in which he made the temple <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> where he added an executioner in the centre. The sets of characters were more closely assembled and the frieze-like quality was enhanced.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of Jupiter is {{the cavity}} {{created in the}} solar wind by the planet's magnetic field. Extending up to seven million kilometers in the Sun's direction and almost to the orbit of Saturn in the opposite direction, Jupiter's magnetosphere is {{the largest and most}} powerful of any planetary magnetosphere in the Solar System, and by volume the largest known continuous structure in the Solar System after the heliosphere. <b>Wider</b> <b>and</b> flatter than the Earth's magnetosphere, Jupiter's is stronger by an order of magnitude, while its magnetic moment is roughly 18,000 times larger. The existence of Jupiter's magnetic field was first inferred from observations of radio emissions {{at the end of the}} 1950s and was directly observed by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft in 1973.|$|E
50|$|It is {{believed}} that the castle, on Castle Hill, was a motte, encircled by a <b>wide</b> ditch <b>and</b> outer rampart, except on the north where a landslip has destroyed it.

5|$|The unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely {{follows the}} styling of the {{original}} aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> deeper due to the widescreen display. The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option {{is available in the}} 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed. The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button. The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures. When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad. The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} Canis {{dentition}} {{shows that in}} comparison with the modern gray wolf and the Pleistocene LaBrea wolf, the Beringian wolf possessed large carnassial teeth and a short, broad palate relative to the size of its skull. The row length of the Beringian wolf's premolars was longer, the P4 premolar (the upper carnassial) longer and <b>wider,</b> <b>and</b> the M1, M2, and m1 (the lower carnassial) molars longer than those found in the other two types of wolves. The Beringian wolf's short, broad rostrum increased the force of a bite made with the canine teeth while strengthening the skull against the stresses caused by struggling prey. Today, the relatively deep jaws {{similar to those of the}} Beringian wolf can be found in the bone-cracking spotted hyena and in those canids that are adapted for taking large prey. Beringian wolves possessed a craniodental morphology that was more specialized than modern gray wolves and Rancho LaBrea wolves for capturing, dismembering, and consuming the bones of very large megaherbivores, having evolved this way due to the presence of megafauna. Their stronger jaws and teeth indicate a hypercarnivorous lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the harbour is Watchet station. This {{is now an}} {{intermediate}} stop on the West Somerset Railway, a largely steam-operated heritage railway that links Bishops Lydeard, near Taunton, with Minehead. The station was first opened on 31 March 1862 when the West Somerset Railway was opened from Norton Junction. The station was built as a terminus, {{as part of the}} commercial aim of the WSR was to provide a <b>wider</b> <b>and</b> cheaper distribution route for goods from the then major port of Watchet. On 16 July 1874 the line was extended westwards by the Minehead Railway Company, with an industrial railway siding provided at the same time into the Wansbrough Paper Mill. The GWR undertook many projects to increase the capacity of the line in the 1930s. Nationalisation in 1948 saw the GWR become the Western Region of British Railways. Freight traffic was withdrawn on 6 July 1964 and passenger trains on 4 January 1971. The station was reopened by the new West Somerset Railway on 28 August 1976.|$|E
