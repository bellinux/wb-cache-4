5|$|Dining hall {{protocol}} was a scripted process, including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move {{into and out}} of the hall at any given time, who sat where, where to place hands, and when to start eating. Prisoners would be awakened at 6:30, and sent to breakfast at 6:55. A breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board, dated 21 March 1963. The breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals, steamed <b>whole</b> <b>wheat,</b> a scrambled egg, milk, stewed fruit, toast, bread, and butter. Lunch was served in the dining hall at 11:20, followed by a 30-minute rest in the cell, before returning to work until 16:15. Dinner was served at 16:25 and the prisoners would then retire to their cells at 16:50 to be locked in for the night. Inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within 20 minutes, provided they left no waste; waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Epidemiological studies {{associate}} {{consumption of}} whole grain foods, including breads, with reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, {{few studies have}} compared <b>wheat</b> <b>whole</b> grains with <b>wheat</b> refined grains. Methods This study investigated effects of 6 -week consumption of <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> sourdough bread in comparison to white bread on fasting serum lipids in normoglycemic/normoinsulinemic (NGI; n = 14) and hyperglycemic/hyperinsulinemic (HGI; n = 14) adults. The influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, 3 within the APOE gene (E 2, E 3, E 4) and 2 within the hepatic lipase gene promoter (LIPC - 514 C>T, LIPC - 250 G>A) were considered. Results At baseline, HGI participants had significantly higher body weight, waist circumference, body fat, and fasted glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), glucagon, triacylglycerols (TAG) and TAG:HDL-cholesterol, compared to NGI participants; however, none of these in addition to {{none of the other}} serum lipids, differed between bread treatments, within either participant group. For participants with the APOE E 3 /E 3 genotype, LDL-cholesterol (P = 0. 02) increased in the NGI group (n = 7), and TAG (P = 0. 03) and TAG:HDL-cholesterol (P = 0. 04) increased in the HGI group (n = 10), following consumption of <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> sourdough compared to white bread. Conclusions In summary, 6 -week consumption of <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> sourdough bread did not significantly modulate serum lipids in NGI or HGI adults; however, it significantly increased LDL-cholesterol, TAG and TAG:HDL-cholesterol in participants with the APOE E 3 /E 3 genotype.

40|$|Alkylresorcinols (ARs) {{were first}} {{proposed}} as potential biomarkers of wholegrain {{wheat and rye}} intake a decade ago.

This review briefly summarises work on the bioactivities of AR and focuses on aspects related to their use as biomarkers of <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> and rye intake.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A diet rich {{in whole}} grain cereals is {{suggested}} {{to protect against}} type 2 diabetes and facilitate body weight regulation. However, {{little is known about}} the impact of different cereals and the underlying mechanisms. The objective of this study was to compare the long-term metabolic effects of diets supplemented with <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> or <b>whole</b> grain rye in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse. METHODS: Mice were fed the whole grain supplements in a low-fat background diet for 22 wk. Oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed during the study and in vitro insulin secretion assays were performed at the end of the study. Body weight, energy intake, body fat content, and plasma parameters were measured during the study. RESULTS: A dietary supplement of whole grain rye suppressed body weight gain and resulted in significantly decreased adiposity, plasma leptin, total plasma cholesterol, and triacylglycerols compared with a supplement of <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat.</b> Also, a slight improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in the rye group compared with the wheat group. The decreases in body weight and adiposity were observed in the absence of differences in energy intake. CONCLUSION: Long-term administration of whole grain rye evokes a different metabolic profile compared with <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse, the primary difference being that whole grain rye reduces body weight and adiposity compared with <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat.</b> In addition, <b>whole</b> grain rye slightly improves insulin sensitivity and lowers total plasma cholesterol...|$|R

25|$|Dietary fiber is a {{carbohydrate}} that is incompletely {{absorbed in}} humans {{and in some}} animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans {{do not have the}} required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in <b>whole</b> <b>wheat</b> flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis;– the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digest along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.|$|E

Sensory evaluation compared two test variations to a control cookie that contained all-purpose flour and no Fibersol®- 2. One cookie variation contained the Fibersol®- 2 addition and 50 percent of the all-purpose flour (50 / 50 +F) substituted with <b>whole</b> white <b>wheat</b> flour. The other cookie variation contained the Fibersol®- 2 addition and 100 percent of the all-purpose flour (WWW+F) substituted with <b>whole</b> white <b>wheat</b> flour. Fifty-two untrained judges participated in evaluating cookies based on moistness, tenderness, flavor intensity, difference, and preference. Analysis of variance conducted on sensory characteristics indicated a significant difference in tenderness, discrimination, and overall preference. Post hoc analysis (using Fisher’s least signiﬁcant difference method) indicated that the 100 percent <b>whole</b> white <b>wheat</b> variation was not signiﬁcantly different from the control for moistness or flavor intensity. The 50 percent <b>whole</b> white <b>wheat</b> variation was significantly different than the control for moistness and flavor intensity.

40|$|Alkylresorcinols (AR) are {{phenolic}} lipids {{present in}} the outer parts of rye and wheat grain kernels. Total AR concentration and the ratio of two AR homologs, C 17 : 0 /C 21 : 0, in plasma have been evaluated and used as biomarkers of whole grain rye and wheat intake. The AR C 17 : 0 /C 21 : 0 ratio is 1. 0 in rye and 0. 1 in common wheat and reflects the relative intake of whole grain rye. However, due to the short half-life (4 - 5 h) of AR in plasma, more long-term biomarkers are needed. This thesis investigated whether AR in adipose tissue {{could be used as}} long-term biomarkers of <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> and rye intake, and whether these biomarkers, in parallel with whole grain intakes determined by dietary assessment, were associated with blood lipid profiles and breast cancer incidence in two Nordic populations. A sensitive, high-throughput GC-MS method for quantification of AR concentrations in adipose tissue biopsies was developed, evaluated, and applied. The AR concentrations in adipose tissue were evaluated as long-term biomarkers by correlating them to whole grain intake, measured precisely by repeated food records during a 12 -week intervention, and to long-term <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> and rye intake estimated with food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) in observational studies. Intake was found to be modestly to well correlated with total AR concentrations in adipose tissue, with sex being an important determinant. The performance of AR in adipose tissue as biomarkers of <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> and rye appeared comparable to that of AR in plasma, and therefore they were further tested in relation to blood lipid profiles and incidence of breast cancer in two observational studies. Overall, total <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> and rye, reflected by biomarkers or dietary assessment, were not associated with blood lipids or breast cancer incidence in the populations studied. However, AR C 17 : 0 /C 21 : 0 ratio in adipose tissue was inversely associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in blood and positively associated with the risk of developing ER+ breast cancer among women. These findings suggest that <b>whole</b> grain <b>wheat</b> and rye may have different effects on the endpoints studied but need to be confirmed in other population.
