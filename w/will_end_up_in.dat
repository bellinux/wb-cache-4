25|$|Process variations: With MOSFETs {{becoming}} smaller, {{the number}} of atoms in the silicon that produce many of the transistor's properties is becoming fewer, {{with the result that}} control of dopant numbers and placement is more erratic. During chip manufacturing, random process variations affect all transistor dimensions: length, width, junction depths, oxide thickness etc., and become a greater percentage of overall transistor size as the transistor shrinks. The transistor characteristics become less certain, more statistical. The random nature of manufacture means we do not know which particular example MOSFETs actually <b>will</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a particular instance of the circuit. This uncertainty forces a less optimal design because the design must work for a great variety of possible component MOSFETs.

500|$|In {{the first}} of three segments, the Simpsons visit Morocco (which Homer {{mistakes}} for Monaco). Homer purchases a severed monkey's hand that will grant four wishes, despite the vendor's warning that the wisher will experience grave misfortune. Back in Springfield, the family argues in how to use the wishes. Despite Marge's warning to heed the advice of the vendor in not using any of them, Maggie is granted that first wish: a new pacifier. Next, Bart wishes for the Simpsons to be rich and famous. His wish is granted, but the people immediately tire of the family's annoying antics, cheesy merchandise and celebrity treatment. Horrified by these wasteful wishes, Lisa wishes for world peace and Homer is furious. While all countries declare peace and destroy their weapons, the aliens Kang and Kodos realize the human race is [...] "ripe for the plucking" [...] and, armed with only a slingshot and a club, enslave the Earth. At the house, Homer blames Lisa and deems her own wishes to be selfish. She defends herself, claiming that Bart and Maggie's own wishes were also selfish as well and felt that hers was the only selfless one. Soon, Marge catches the people who are angry with the Simpsons and calls for a temporary truce in the family. Determined to make a wish that could not be twisted, she begs Homer {{to do the right thing}} and use the last wish to get rid of the aliens. Much to her dismay, Homer refuses and demands a turkey sandwich, but the turkey turns out to be a little too dry. With all the wishes used up, he goes to throw out the paw, but his neighbor Ned asks about it. Hoping to see Flanders suffer, Homer gladly hands the paw over. Ned's first wish is to [...] "Get rid of those awful aliens," [...] which is accomplished when Moe chases after Kodos with a board with a nail sticking out of it, then brings the aliens back to the flying saucer. Kodos laments their failed invasion, but Kang assures him that humanity is doomed: [...] they <b>will</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> an arms race creating increasingly larger boards and larger nails, which will ultimately [...] "cause the human race to create a board with a nail in it so big to doom mankind." [...] Everyone celebrates and after Flanders wishes to [...] "spruce up the ol' homestead," [...] his house is converted into an opulent castle, making Homer envious.

2500|$|Plaut and Shallice have {{hypothesized}} that {{units in the}} brain interact {{in such a way}} that semantic features form stable attractors in the space of all possible representations of words. [...] These unit interactions correspond to particular attractor patterns, and if the particular attractor pattern is activated, the network remains in that pattern. [...] However, they hypothesize that when the pattern is distorted, there is a pull on the pattern, and it gravitates toward the correct pattern, almost as if this semantic space is filled with basins, where if one point on the pattern falls to the edge of the basin, it will still gravitate toward the middle. [...] If you lesion this area, the neurons die and the basins change their shape. [...] When this happens, you may now have the same distorted starting pattern that <b>will</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a neighboring basin, which is a semantically related area, but not the correct one, and this would account for deep dyslexic patients to incorrectly identify [...] "river" [...] as [...] "ocean". [...] Lesions that occur early in the network change the basins that send different semantic words to different areas of the network, whereas if they occur later, the words will be much closer semantically.
