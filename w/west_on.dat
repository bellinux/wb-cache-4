5|$|In 1929, {{this version}} of M-64 was renumbered M-9. In 1934, M-9 {{traveled}} on Pioneer Road in Hillsdale County, from the Ohio border before turning <b>west</b> <b>on</b> Burt Road, north on Clark Road, <b>west</b> <b>on</b> Montgomery Road then north onto Hillsdale Road. During this time a loop was planned to continue north {{from the corner of}} Pioneer and Burt Roads to Montgomery Road where it turned west and met back up with M-9 at Clark Road. This short loop was designated M-158, however later in the year the routing of M-9 was shifted onto the M-158 alignment, eliminating that route. By the middle of 1936, the highway was extended northward to end in Lansing. The M-9 designation was replaced with M-99 in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In Traverse City, M-22 {{originally}} {{started at}} Front and Union streets going <b>west</b> <b>on</b> Front to Elmwood, turning north onto Elmwood, then <b>west</b> <b>on</b> Bay Street to Greilickville. It was relocated onto the newly built Grand View Parkway in 1952, from Greilickville to Division Street (relocated US31). In 2002, {{the route of}} M-22 from the Benzie–Leelanau county line northward to Northport and then south to Traverse City was designated {{as part of a}} Michigan Heritage Route along with M-109 and M-204 as the Leelanau Scenic Heritage Route; this moniker was renamed Pure Michigan Byway at the end of 2014. The remainder of the highway was designated as a separate byway in October 2016.|$|E

5|$|A {{new plan}} was {{put forward by}} West Sussex County Council in 1961. This {{proposed}} new neighbourhoods at Broadfield and Bewbush, both of which extended outside the administrative area of the then Urban District Council. Detailed plans were made for Broadfield in the late 1960s; by the early 1970s building work had begun. Further expansion at Bewbush was begun in 1974, although development there was slow. The two neighbourhoods were both larger than the original nine: together, their proposed population was 23,000. Work also {{took place in the}} area now known as Ifield <b>West</b> <b>on</b> the western fringes of the town.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Confederates would march on Gettysburg from the <b>west</b> <b>on</b> {{the morning of}} July 1, Buford laid out his {{defenses}} on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge. These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Buford understood that if the Confederates could gain control of these heights, Meade's army would have difficulty dislodging them.|$|E

5|$|As Soviet troops {{approached}} Auschwitz in January 1945, most of {{its population}} was sent <b>west</b> <b>on</b> a death march. The prisoners remaining at the camp were liberated on 27 January 1945, a day now commemorated as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the following decades, survivors, such as Primo Levi, Viktor Frankl, and Elie Wiesel, wrote memoirs of their experiences in Auschwitz, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947, Poland founded the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum {{on the site of}} Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979, it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.|$|E
5|$|As {{the system}} {{continued}} to move <b>west</b> <b>on</b> October 9, it strengthened into a hurricane, {{and while it}} began to curve toward the west-northwest, further strengthening occurred, as it intensified into a Category 2 hurricane.

The system quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled west-northwestward on October 11, later passing over the Gulf of Honduras. It later struck Belize on October 13 as a strong Category 1 hurricane on October 13, tracking north-northwestward.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route32, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena. It entered Massena {{on what is}} now NY420 and followed Main Street and Maple Street through the village. West of Massena, the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River Road to a junction east of Waddington, where Route32 continued <b>west</b> <b>on</b> modern NY37 to Waddington. When state highways in New York were first posted in 1924, the portion of Route32 between Waddington and Massena became part of NY3, a highway extending across {{the width of the}} state.|$|E

By 1954, US-50 was moved south to an alignment through central Utah, the old routing mostly replaced by US-50 Alternate (US-50A). However, US-50A was placed in Salt Lake City on 2100 South west of State Street, replacing the SR-201 designation.|$|E

The initial routing of NY63 was significantly different from its modern alignment; in fact, the only portion of modern NY63 that still follows its original alignment is the section between Hampton Corners and Pavilion. South of Mount Morris, the route followed what is now NY408 to Dalton and continued south on Old State Road and <b>west</b> <b>on</b> Allegany County's CR16 to NY19 west of the village of Angelica. NY63 overlapped NY19 south to Belvidere, where NY63 turned onto modern CR20. It continued <b>west</b> <b>on</b> CR20 and NY446 through Cuba to a junction with NY16 in Hinsdale, where it ended.
