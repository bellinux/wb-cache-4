If Pristina is {{compared with other}} municipalities, {{it can be seen}} that Pristina differs much more. While in Pristina the average waste disposal is 332 kg/year per person, in other municipalities this average is 95 kg/year per person. [...] The problem relies in the disposal of this waste is done in (field-waste) municipal surface. Those <b>waste</b> <b>disposals</b> have not filled the minimum standard requirements for waste. They are settled near habitats and rivers, which most of time end up polluting the rivers also, especially underground waters and wells. Oftentimes those <b>waste</b> <b>disposals</b> are burned from nature, as well as from people. During summer they smell badly because most of waste is not even covered with grit. Some disposals in Pristina have been closed, with the aim to reduce those negative effects in the nature; however, still most of them remain uncovered. Pristina regional waste disposal collects waste from Prishtinë, Obiliq, Lipjan, Fushë Kosovë and Drenas(Gllogoc). The size of this disposal is approximately 40 hectares, it has a lide span of 15 years, and its total capacity is 3,500,000 m while its monthly capacity is 6000 tons. The status of this disposal is miserable, with a very bad smell causing many health implications to people.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} current and {{historical}} <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> practices {{on the environment and}} human health of Indigenous people in First Nations communities has yet to be adequately addressed. Solid <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> has been identified as a major environmental threat to First Nations Communities. A community-based participatory research project (CBPR) was initiated by the Saskatoon Tribal Council Health and Family Services Incorporated to investigate concerns related to <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> in three Saskatchewan First Nations Communities. Utilizing a qualitative approach, we aimed to gain an understanding of past and present <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> practices and to identify any human and environmental health concerns related to these practices. One to one interviews and sharing circles were conducted with Elders. Elders were asked to share their perspectives on past and present <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> practices and to comment on the possible impacts these practices may have on the environment and community health. Historically <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> practices were similar among communities. The homeowner generated small volumes of waste, was exclusively responsible for disposal and utilized a backyard pit. Overtime <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> evolved to weekly pick-up of un-segregated garbage with <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> and open trash burning in a community dump site. Dump site locations and open trash burning were identified as significant health issues related to <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> practices in these communities. This research raises issues of inequity in the management of waste in First Nations Communities. It highlights the need for long-term sustainable funding to support community-based <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> and management strategies and the development of First Nations centered and delivered educational programs to encourage the adoption and implementation of waste reduction, reutilization and recycling activities in these communities...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Thailand, Tarad Thai {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} and {{significant}} agricultural markets. Therefore, the problems from fresh <b>waste</b> <b>disposals</b> in this area are recognized as one of environmental significant concerns. In order to manage this problem, the conversion of those possible agricultural <b>waste</b> <b>disposals</b> to biochar soil amendments is studied. In this work, some parts of agricultural fruits waste are durian peel, mangosteen rind, corncob and banana peel. In addition, waste from fresh shrimp, shrimp shell, is also studied. Those previous waste materials are processed by viapyrolysis method to form biochar. The studies of chemical compositions, such as major and some minor nutrition, are analyzed using the Kjeldahl technique, UV-Visible spectrophotometer and Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometer. The heat of combustion and some chemical properties are also studied. The biochar derived from corncob, per gram, dominates the highest value of the heat of combustion (75. 151 Kcal). In addition, the study of biocharuses as soil amendments is studied via the growth of swamp morning glory. By comparing the data from typical soil and biochar soil amendments by t-test, it is found that the growing length and number of leafs shows tcal>tcrt which means that, for example, the use of the biochar soil amendments from agricultural market waste and shrimp shell as materials to grow the swamp morning glory displays the significance by comparing to typical soil...|$|E
