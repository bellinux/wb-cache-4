5|$|During Spring Training {{before the}} 2017 season, the final {{guaranteed}} year on Molina's contract, the Cardinals began {{to negotiate a}} contract extension that would attempt to keep Molina in St. Louis {{for the remainder of}} his career. He agreed to a three-year contract extension for a reported $60 million, making him the highest-paid catcher in baseball. He wasn't interested in exercising his 2018 mutual option, which would have been worth $15 million. The extension assures Molina of remaining in St. Louis through 2020, and increases the chances that he <b>will</b> <b>finish</b> his career having played for just one organization, the one that drafted him. This distinction of having Molina retire as a Cardinal is something that carried weight for both parties throughout the negotiations.|$|E

25|$|The Kindle Paperwhite (1st generation) was {{announced}} on September 6, 2012, and released on October 1. It has a 6in, 212PPI E Ink Pearl display (758×1024 resolution) with four built-in LEDs {{to illuminate the}} screen. It was available in Wi-Fi ($120 ad-supported, $140 no ads) and Wi-Fi + 3G ($180 ad-supported, $200 no ads) models, with the ad-supported options only intended to {{be available in the}} United States. The light {{is one of the main}} features of the Paperwhite and it has a manually adjusted light level. The 3G access restrictions are the same as the Kindle Touch, and usage of the 3G data is limited to 50 MB per month and only on Amazon and Wikipedia's websites; additional data may be purchased. Battery life is advertised as up to eight weeks of reading with half an hour per day with wireless off and constant light usage; this usage equals 28 hours. The official leather cover for the Paperwhite uses the hall effect sensor in the device that detects when the cover is closed/opened to turn the screen off/on respectively. This device was the first Kindle to track one's reading speed to estimate when one <b>will</b> <b>finish</b> a chapter or book; this feature was later included with updates to the other Kindles and Kindle Fire tablets. The Kindle Paperwhite lacks physical buttons for page turning and does not perform auto-hyphenation. Except for the lock screen/power button at its bottom, it relies solely on the touchscreen interface. In November 2012, Amazon released the 5.3.0 update that allowed users to turn off recommended content on the home screen in Grid View (allowing two rows of user content) and included general bug fixes. In March 2014, the Paperwhite 5.4.4 update was released that added Goodreads integration, Kindle FreeTime to restrict usage for children, Cloud Collections for organization and Page Flip for scanning content without losing your place, which closely matched the Paperwhite 2's software features.|$|E

25|$|The {{preparation}} for the next season for Žalgiris began during the 2016 LKL finals, with Žalgiris signing point guard Léo Westermann to replace the departing Jerome Randle. After the season, Pocius, Hanlan, Vougioukas, and long time Žalgiris players Siim-Sander Vene and Kaspars Vecvagars, all left the team, while Žalgiris choose to retain the services of Seibutis and Motum. Žalgiris also re-signed Edgaras Ulanovas. One of {{the main stories of}} the off-season became the situation of head coach Jasikevičius, who was pursued by FC Barcelona Bàsquet to become their new head coach, but in the end decided to remain with Žalgiris. During the entire previous season, the main problem for the team was the lack of a good shooter – to fix the problem, Žalgiris signed Kevin Pangos, and to replace Vougioukas at center, Žalgiris took Augusto Lima from Real Madrid on loan. Žalgiris also signed the returning Artūras Milaknis to a 3-year deal. Isaiah Hartenstein, a very talented prospect from Germany, who was signed during the previous season, is also scheduled to make his debut in the upcoming season. In August, Žalgiris signed Antanas Kavaliauskas, the captain of Lietuvos Rytas, in a rather controversial decision, as Kavaliauskas had previously promised to never play for Žalgiris, with Kavaliauskas apologizing to fans soon after the signing was announced. With the signing of Kavaliauskas, the formation of the team was complete. In February, Žalgiris won the first title of the 2017 season, winning the King Mindaugas Cup by defeating BC Neptūnas in the first round 81:58, BC Vytautas in the semi-finals 76:55, and BC Lietkabelis in the finals 84:63, while rival and 2016 champion Lietuvos rytas was eliminated in the first round. Edgaras Ulanovas won the tournament MVP. In the Euroleague, Žalgiris exceeded all expectations – many pre-season experts believed that Žalgiris <b>will</b> <b>finish</b> in last place, which motivated the team. Under leadership of coach Jasikevičius, Žalgiris finished in 10th place, just 2 games out of the playoffs, with wins over teams like PBC CSKA Moscow, the defending champion, playoff teams like Saski Baskonia, Anadolu Efes S.K. and Panathinaikos B.C., and beating and actually finishing ahead of FC Barcelona Bàsquet and Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C., with a 14–16 record. Players like Brock Motum, Léo Westermann, Edgaras Ulanovas and Lukas Lekavičius blossomed and shined, and team captain Paulius Jankūnas played one of his best seasons of his career, leading the team in scoring and rebounding. The LKL became a formality, as Žalgiris easily finished in 1st place with just a few losses, and easily crushed and swept long tome rival Lietuvos rytas. In the LKL playoffs, Žalgiris beat BC Dzūkija in the quaterfinals 3:0, beat BC Neptūnas 3:1 in the semi-finals, and faced BC Lietkabelis in the finals, as Lietkabelis beat Rytas in the semi-final. The only team to give Žalgiris some trouble in the regular season, Lietkabelis fought hard, but a win in Game 2 would be the only win of the series – Žalgiris won the series 4:1, their 7th consecutive LKL championship and finished a very good season. The 2016–2017 season is considered {{as one of the best}} in modern Žalgiris history.|$|E

500|$|The 2011–12 {{season was}} the first under a {{four-year}} contract extension signed during the previous campaign.

[...] A durable player, St. Louis held the NHL's third longest [...] "ironman" [...] streak among active players, having played every game since 2005. The streak came to an end at 499 consecutive games played in early December 2011 when he was struck in the face by a shot from teammate Dominic Moore during practice. Despite suffering facial and sinus fractures, he missed only five games due to the injury. The 36-year-old St. Louis finished the season with 74 points in 77 games.|$|E

Walsingham wrote an account of the mercy shown by the bishop to Litster during his execution: [...] "After hearing his confession and absolving him by virtue of his office, he followed him to the gallows, showing, although he had overcome him, a deed of kindness and piety, for he supported his head lest it should be bruised by the ground when he was being drawn to the hanging".|$|E
