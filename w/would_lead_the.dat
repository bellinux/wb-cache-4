5|$|As {{was common}} {{practice}} with upper-class {{children of the}} time, Edward and his younger siblings were brought up by nannies rather than directly by their parents. One of Edward's early nannies often abused him by pinching him before he was due to be presented to his parents. His subsequent crying and wailing <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Duke and Duchess to send him and the nanny away. The nanny was discharged after her mistreatment of the children was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Disagreement {{over who}} <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> 10,000 Chetnik exiles in Italy {{escalated}} into a feud between Jevđević, Đujić and General Miodrag Damjanović in mid-1947. Damjanović {{had been appointed}} by Mihailović in March 1945 to lead the Chetniks into northwestern Italy. Jevđević and Đujić refused to accept this and claimed that they were Mihailović's only successors as leaders of the Chetnik movement.|$|E
5|$|During the postgame celebration, ABC {{commentator}} Jack Arute asked Dennis Franchione {{whether he}} would return to the team the following year. Coach Franchione responded by asking the announcer to let the players enjoy their victory. At the beginning of the subsequent press conference, Coach Franchione announced his resignation, effective immediately. Shortly thereafter, Texas A announced defensive coordinator Gary Darnell <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Aggies in their bowl game.|$|E

5|$|Following a short illness, on {{the night}} of 14–15 June 1341 the emperor Andronikos III died at the {{relatively}} early age of 45, possibly due to chronic malaria. His nine-year-old son John (John V) was the obvious successor, but he had not been officially proclaimed or crowned as co-emperor. This left a legal vacuum, and raised the question of who <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Empire's government.|$|E
5|$|Millen succeeded Symon {{as leader}} of the Free Traders in the Senate in 1907, and {{following}} the Fusion with the Protectionists in 1909 became Leader of the Government in the Senate and Vice-President of the Executive Council under Prime Minister Alfred Deakin; he <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> various conservative parties in the Senate continuously until his death.|$|E
5|$|On 27 January 1991, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met in Basra {{with the}} two Iraqi army corps commanders who <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> operation, and Major General Salah Mahmoud told him that Khafji would be his by 30 January. During his return trip to Baghdad, Saddam Hussein's convoy was {{attacked}} by Coalition aircraft; the Iraqi leader escaped unscathed.|$|E

50|$|At the Siege of Lakhnauti, {{formerly}} sacked by the Odia armies in 1242, Tamar Khan's forces was repelled. In 1247 Tamar Khan {{died of a}} fever {{upon which}} North Bengal was reconquered by the Odia general, Paramardi Dev. Tamar Khan's death <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> to <b>the</b> appointment of lkhtiyar-ud-Din Yuzbak as Governor of Bengal, which <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> to <b>the</b> rebellion of Tughan Khan in 1272 CE.|$|R

5|$|Smith and Dyrholm both {{attempted}} {{to capitalize on}} the party's election win, proclaiming that Albertans wanted change and that each of them <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Wildrose Alliance to a victory in the next general election. The party experienced a considerable growth heading into the leadership election, announcing it had 11,670 members at the beginning of October, compared to 1,800 in June. Smith was elected the new leader at the convention held in Edmonton on October 17.|$|E

This would be Oliver's fourth and final premiership with Port Adelaide.|$|E
5|$|Uruguay, Brazil and the Argentine {{provinces of}} Entre Rios and Corrientes joined in an {{offensive}} Alliance against Rosas on 29 May 1851. The {{text of the}} treaty declared that the objective was to protect Uruguayan independence, pacify its territory, and expel Oribe's forces. Urquiza would command the Argentine forces and Eugenio Garzón <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Colorado Uruguayans, with both receiving financial and military aid from the Empire of Brazil.|$|E

5|$|After a {{short period}} of {{occupation}} duty, the 44th Infantry Division returned to the United States in July 1945 where it began training for deployment to the Pacific Theater. As part of Operation Coronet it was intended that Dean <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> division during the planned invasion of Honshū, but the war came to an end before this took place and the operation was subsequently cancelled. Dean then oversaw the drawdown of the division until he was relieved of command on November 1, 1945. The 44th Infantry Division was disbanded {{by the end of that}} month.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} declining health, Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982 and was quickly succeeded in his post as General Secretary by Yuri Andropov. Andropov only held {{the office of}} General Secretary for {{less than two years}} until his 1984 death. Brezhnev had fostered a cult of personality, {{although}} not nearly to the same degree as Stalin. Mikhail Gorbachev, who <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> USSR from 1985 to 1991, denounced his legacy and drove the process of liberalisation of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{primarily}} at Langley Field, Virginia, Olds virtually made daily {{contact with the}} small group of officers who <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> US Army Air Forces in World War II (one neighbor was Major Carl Spaatz, destined to become the first Chief of Staff of the USAF), and as a result was imbued with an unusually strong dedication to the air service, and conversely, with a low tolerance for officers who did not exhibit the same. On November 10, 1925, his father appeared as a witness on behalf of Billy Mitchell during Mitchell's court-martial in Washington, D.C.. He brought three-year-old Robin with him to court, dressed in an Air Service uniform, and posed with him for newspaper photographers before testifying.|$|E

50|$|In November 2008 the Milton Keynes Partnership, Chiltern Railways and the {{consortium}} formally {{agreed to take}} their proposals forward together.

5|$|Sanger appealed her 1917 {{conviction}} {{and won a}} mixed victory in 1918 in a unanimous decision by the New York Court of Appeals written by Judge Frederick E. Crane. The court's opinion upheld her conviction, but indicated that the courts {{would be willing to}} permit contraception if prescribed by doctors.Engelman, pp. 101–103. This decision was only applicable within New York, where it opened the door for birth control clinics, under physician supervision, to be established. Sanger herself did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity, wrongly expecting that the medical profession <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> way; instead she focused on writing and lecturing.|$|E
5|$|The Rockets {{won only}} 15 games in their debut {{season as a}} {{franchise}} in 1967. In the 1968 NBA draft, the Rockets, picking first overall, selected power forward Elvin Hayes, who <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> team to its first playoff appearance in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record until the 1976–77 season, when they traded for center Moses Malone. Malone {{went on to win}} the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award twice and led Houston to the conference finals in his first year with the team. He also led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981 where they were defeated in six games by the Boston Celtics, led by Larry Bird and future Rockets coach Kevin McHale.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{accession}} Chamberlain considered {{calling a}} general election, but with {{three and a}} half years remaining of the then current Parliament's term he decided to wait. At age 68, he was the second-eldest person in the 20th century (behind Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman) to become Prime Minister for the first time, and was widely seen as a caretaker who <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> Conservative Party until the next election, and then step down in favour of a younger man, with Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden a likely candidate. From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position.|$|E

5|$|After subduing {{the cities}} around the capital, Thomas {{resolved}} to attack Constantinople from three sides, perhaps hoping his assault would impress its inhabitants or lead to defections. His deputies Anastasius and Gregory Pterotos would attack the Theodosian land and sea walls, respectively, while he <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> main attack against the less formidable defenses protecting Blachernae. All of Thomas's forces were amply supplied with siege engines and catapults, and his fleet fielded quantities of Greek fire in addition to large shipborne catapults. Each of Thomas's attacks failed: the defenders' artillery proved superior and kept Thomas's engines away from the land walls, while adverse winds hindered the fleet from taking any meaningful action. Deciding that operations {{in the midst of}} winter were hazardous and unlikely to succeed, Thomas suspended all further attacks until spring and withdrew his army to winter quarters.|$|E
5|$|Auchinleck {{planned for}} XXX Corps (under Lieutenant-General Willoughby Norrie), {{containing}} the British armour, to advance around the undefended southern Axis flank, south of Sidi Omar, before moving towards Tobruk and engaging the German and Italian armoured units in battle. Once the Axis armour was defeated, the British force would attack towards Tobruk aiming to capture Sidi Rezegh, while the garrison broke out aiming to capture Ed Duda, cutting the enemy lines of communication. On 18November, the Eighth Army began the offensive. Rommel, believing {{the attack was}} an attempt to hinder his own plans to assault Tobruk, did little to counter the British offensive. This led to the capture of Sidi Rezegh and the suggestion that the 70th Division should begin its attack on 21November, before the Axis armour had been defeated. The plan to break out of Tobruk had been well rehearsed; the 2nd Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, 2nd Black Watch, 2nd King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) and 2nd Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> attack with tanks of the 32nd Army Tank Brigade in close support.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{speculation}} that he <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>the</b> team, as Bradman had made himself unavailable due to concerns over fitness {{and his ability}} to play at his pre-war world-leading standards, the Australian Board of Control appointed Bill Brown as captain and O'Reilly as Brown's deputy. In the Board's ballot for the leadership positions, Hassett received only one of the 13 votes, although it was enough to make him the third on-tour selector. One motive speculated for his being overlooked was that he had rested himself from the match against Victoria because he was tired of the long periods in the military away from his family and decided instead to spend the time in Melbourne with his wife and young daughter; this supposedly drew the ire of the Victorian Cricket Association.|$|E
