25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E
500|$|That's {{really hard}} {{because you have}} to gauge the weather each time {{you have to make a}} decision. As for <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> I can't comment. I don't have that information. But in general, our people take great care in making {{decisions}} based on the information that they have at the time. Premier Shawn Graham said [...] "I just want to extend sympathies to the affected families. This is a tragic situation for the community of Bathurst and our province." [...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy. The Pope assures all concerned of his prayers for those who died and for their families." ...|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E

O., who has been {{specially}} mentioned for bravery and who very nearly got the Victoria Cross, comes here with the halo of a brilliant escape from the Germans, wounded, a young man of good family and connections, and apparently as keen as mustard to get back again in the fighting line. Good Heavens! The most careful sailor in the world might just drop a hint to that sort of man. <b>What</b> nearly <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> may <b>happen</b> a dozen times within the next week. Even our great secret, General," [...] Thomson continued, dropping his voice a little, [...] "even that might come to his ears." ...|$|R

I made a comment about Danyl {{changing}} the lyrics of his song. It {{was meant to be}} a humorous moment about the fact he has an opportunity to have fun with his song. An openly bisexual singing a song that is lyrically a 'girl's song'. Danyl and I were joking about the very same thing in rehearsals on Friday, so it carried on to the show. I'd like to apologise to anyone that was offended by my comments, it was never my intention. I spoke to Danyl straight after the show <b>last</b> <b>night</b> and he wasn't offended or upset by my comments, and knew exactly what I was saying." ...|$|R

50|$|After elimination, Pocahontas and Sassy still despise each other. The next day, Real, Chance, and {{the girls}} depart to Miami and settle into a hotel. That night, Real had dinner with his three girls and said that one girl will be {{eliminated}} that next day. Real then took out applications and the audition tapes of each girl {{to see what they}} were like before coming to the show. He first saw Sassy's tape and found she was the same person who came to the show. Then he checked Doll's tape and found she was attracted to bad boys like Chance. The next day, Pocahontas felt nervous about <b>what</b> <b>happen</b> <b>last</b> <b>night.</b> Later, both Real and Chance met the girls on the dock. Chance tells Mamacita that she would go on a yacht with him, while Hot Wings will have her date later, going back to the limo. Real then became his early elimination, choosing Sassy to stay and have her date later with Real, leaving Doll and Pocahontas as his bottom two. He ultimately eliminated Pocahontas. This shocks her dearly, letting Doll on the yacht and waterskiing with Mamacita and Chance. That night, Real and Chance had dates with Doll and Mamacita, shortly after bring them back to their rooms for their night caps. The next day, Real and Chance took Sassy and Hot Wings to Gator Park to see some crocodiles and alligators. Hot Wings decides to step in the water to prove to Chance that she is adventurous also. That night, Sassy and Hot Wings have dates with Real and Chance. During Real's date, Sassy pulls out a notebook full of questions to ask Real, which surprised him but felt that she is interested in him. Hot Wings accidentally said that she loved him. Real and Chance took the girls back to their rooms for their night caps. The next day would be the day Real and Chance would their girls each to be with. During their final elimination, Real picked Doll to be with. Chance had a difficult decision, but Hot Wings said she felt in love in with him and Chance decides to take Hot Wing over Mamacita.|$|R

I thought, looking at you just now in your clothes on the bed, one might for the moment be deceived into {{thinking}} there was a slight--quite the slightest improvement. There was not quite that'--she hovered for the right word--'that tenseness. Whether or not, whether you desired any such change or didn't, I should have supposed in any case {{it would have been}} better to act as far as possible like any ordinary person. You were certainly in an extraordinarily sound sleep. I was almost alarmed; until I remembered that it was a little after two when I looked up from reading aloud to keep myself awake and discovered that you had only just come home. I had no fire. You know how easily late hours bring on my headaches; a little thought might possibly have suggested that I should be anxious to hear. But no; it seems I cannot profit by experience, Arthur. And even now you have not answered surely a very natural question. You do not recollect, perhaps, exactly <b>what</b> did <b>happen</b> <b>last</b> <b>night?</b> Did you go in the direction even of Widderstone?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let me {{tell you}} about Nutty first. I said that he had always been anxious that I should marry you. Something <b>happened</b> <b>last</b> <b>night</b> to {{increase}} his anxiety. I have often wondered how he managed to get enough money to enable him to spend three days in New York, and <b>last</b> <b>night</b> he told me. He came in just after I had got back to the house after leaving you and that girl, and he was very scared. It seems that when the letter from the London lawyer came telling him that he had been left a hundred dollars, he got the idea of raising money on the strength of it. You know Nutty by this time, so you won't be surprised at the way he went about it. He borrowed a hundred dollars from the man at the chemist's on the security of that letter, and then--I suppose it seemed so easy that it struck him as a pity to let the opportunity slip--he did the same thing with four other tradesmen. Nutty's so odd that I don't know even now whether it ever occurred to him that he was obtaining money under false pretences; but the poor tradesmen hadn't any doubt about it at all. They compared notes and found <b>what</b> had <b>happened,</b> and <b>last</b> <b>night,</b> while we were in the woods, one of them came here and called Nutty a good many names and threatened him with imprisonment.|$|R

5000|$|The Dahmers {{had been}} {{sleeping}} in shifts after receiving numerous death threats throughout the year. The Dahmers had a shotgun by their nightstand in case they heard gunshots and always had the curtains drawn tight at night {{to make it harder}} for night riders to see into their home. On January 10, 1966, the Dahmer home was attacked by the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The family woke to the sound of a shotgun being discharged and the sound of gas jugs being thrown through the windows. As Ellie went to grab the children, the house erupted into fire. Dahmer returned fire from inside the house to try and distract the Klansmen while he helped hand Betty down to Ellie. He was able to leave his burning home but was severely burned from the waist up; Betty also had severe burns on her arms. The Dahmers' home, grocery store, and car were all destroyed in the fire. He was taken to the hospital and died due to his lungs being severely burned and smoke inhalation. Before he died, Dahmer had told a local newspaper reporter: [...] "I've been active in trying to get people to register to vote. People who don't vote are deadbeats on the state. I figure a man needs to do his own thinking. <b>What</b> <b>happened</b> to us <b>last</b> <b>night</b> can <b>happen</b> to anyone, white or black.

There are men, and very great investigators, who would say that your daughter's trances and all phenomena connected therewith were pathologic, explainable on the grounds of some obscure neural derangement. I do not say this is the case, but I do say that if she persists in these practices she will lose control of her mental faculties. I have had a consultation to-day with Dr. Tolman, a man who makes a specialty of such cases, and when I had laid the whole matter before him, he and Dr. Weissmann both advised the immediate stopping of these trances." ...|$|E
