Although Minas Geraes had been further refitted from 1939 to 1943, {{the ship was}} still too old and in too poor a condition for any {{active role in the}} Second World War; instead, the dreadnought was anchored as a floating battery in the port of Salvador {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E

It was reported that Lê Duẩn did not lead the party delegates of the 5th National Congress to the Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum because of his deteriorating health. Lê Duẩn looked both feeble and old; he had problems reading his report to the Congress.|$|E

Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E

His museum, which by that time contained about 10,000 specimens, was taken over by his daughter and grandson.

Nobody could get anything right, we <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day." [...] The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's [...] "unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse." [...] The album featured the singles [...] "Never Say Die" [...] and [...] "Hard Road", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK. The band also made their second appearance on Top of the Pops, performing [...] "Never Say Die". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US.|$|E

Earl said, [...] "In [...] {{it was more like}} an aircraft carrier, now it’s an aircraft carrier with the addition of battle ship-sized guns. We <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the carriers [...] We were on the decks; we were flying next to them. We had a lot of close ups and different angles. And we didn’t just have one; we had three. On top of that, we had to destroy them all." [...] This CGI environment was also used in close ups. Earl said, [...] "The challenge was to get in all of the detail to make it feel like it is a real, working ship. We created details down to the railings and all the human-scale stuff. ... For the shots in which we were destroying them, we had to have the internals as well – the hallways, the storage areas." [...] Many of the shots of Washington, D.C. were digitally created due to numerous flight restrictions in the city which necessitated that locations be recreated by computer. However, aerial footage of the city was filmed and used for live action plate photography for shots involving the Triskelion, which is located on Theodore Roosevelt Island on the Potomac River.|$|E
500|$|Through {{his work}} Clark became {{acquainted with the}} {{partners}} of the Philip Hill, Higginson, Erlanders merchant bank (later known as Hill Samuel), {{one of the two}} largest in the country. The three men <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> [...] tall, [...] "frightfully clever" [...] and looking for a fourth partner. [...] Clark, a tall man himself, fitted their apparent criteria and in 1961 accepted the fourth partnership at the bank; he retired from his partnership at Slaughter and May on 30 September 1961. At Hill Samuel he headed the issues and mergers department and advised on some of the largest company mergers in British history. Clark handled the General Electric Company plc's takeovers of Associated Electrical Industries and English Electric under Arnold Weinstock, and the expansions of Racal, Beecham Group and Courtaulds. He also worked to win the firm business abroad. In 1967 he acted for the Astor family in the sale of The Times newspaper to Lord Thomson of Fleet. With the parties deadlocked and the final price disputed by £50,000, Clark successfully reached an agreement by flipping a coin. [...] He correctly called the fall and won the Astors the additional £50,000. [...] Clark kept the half-crown he had used as a memento and had it mounted on a silver stand. Clark helped to draft the 1968 City Takeover Code that remains in force and regulates how takeovers are carried out in British companies. He chaired the National Film Finance Corporation from 1969 to 1976 and sat on a committee to represent Rolls-Royce's creditors during the nationalisation process. Clark worked with Robert Maxwell when he attempted to purchase the News of the World in 1969. [...] Maxwell was beaten by his rival, Rupert Murdoch (whom Clark sued for libel {{during the course of the}} bid), but became friends with Clark and retained him as banker to his British Printing Corporation.|$|E

2500|$|Tammany Hall {{took the}} new system in its stride, as it pushed a new city charter through the Tammany-controlled {{legislature}} in 1870.

[...] "Boss" [...] Tweed. These same men, with slight variations, were also the Board of Supervisors, the Board of Audit, and the Board of Street Openings, creating vast new opportunities for graft and corruption. Tweed himself {{was the head of}} the Department of Public Works, and controlled when and where the grid would be activated. The pace of the expansion of the grid picked up tremendously, but so did the money going into Tweed's pockets, as Tweed invested in land and then increased its value by opening streets in the areas he had invested in. [...] Tweed's investments <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the city, but especially on the East Side. [...] Tweed was eventually tried and jailed, but in his wake he left a city whose development had pushed ahead of its previous sluggish pace, as well as a city raked with debt, since rather than raise taxes for the public works he ordered, the city borrowed money on a massive scale, doubling its debt load in just two years, from $36 million in January 1869 to $73 million.|$|E

[...] The Herald Sun contributors, Cameron Adams, Mike Cahill, and Cyclone Wehner, awarded the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, commending Anderson's production skills and said [...] "Anderson’s lush fingerprints <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> her Abbey Road orchestral hits album a few years back and he was clearly the man for this Christmas album."

However, he criticized Minogue's [...] "lack of magic", and concluded [...] "that's not to say an album of disco or EDM-infused holiday songs wouldn't have been predictable in its own way, but for a once fearlessly progressive pop star, the otherwise lovingly executed and heartwarming Kylie Christmas feels like a bit of a missed opportunity to innovate a well-worn genre." ...|$|E
