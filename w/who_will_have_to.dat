The jurors pronounce on the fact, and the Judges apply the Law. The Emperor may suspend them for complaints against them, preceding a hearing of the same Judges, necessary information, and hearing the Council of State. All judges and bailiffs are responsible for possible abuses of power, and such as other crimes and illegal practices, can move a popular action against them that may end up disqualifying them from exercising law.|$|E
25|$|The draft {{acquisition}} goal is {{the description}} of the global goal that is to be achieved by starting procurement. It is inspired by the business needs or business strategy. It is similar, though simpler, to the concept of the project brief in PRINCE2. It is the first draft of the acquisition goal, containing at least a (short) problem definition and a (short) goal definition. The draft acquisition goal is meant to give the main reasons and the main goals to those people <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make the decision to actually start of the acquisition or not. It may thus also encapsulate items like a cost-benefit analysis, stakes & stakeholders and other items that will be further refined during the actual Acquisition Initiation.|$|E

The Praan Government, which is still centered in the Sargasso Nebula, goes through certain Gender Cycles, or Seasons. In a Masculine Cycle, all Praan subjects will report to a central King, <b>who</b> <b>will</b> then <b>have</b> up <b>to</b> a thousand Queens. In a Feminine Cycle, {{there will be a}} Central Queen <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> up <b>to</b> a thousand Kings. The end of a Cycle occurs only when one gender is able to dominate the other through conflict.|$|R
2500|$|The lake also {{supports}} a strong sport fishery. While commercial fishing declined, sport fishing has remained. The deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing {{is in the}} Canadian side of the lake. As a result, a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings and fishermen are advised to have their passport. If their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake, upon returning to the American shore, passengers will have to [...] "drive to a local government reporting station and pose for pictures" [...] to Customs officers by videophone. There are cumbersome rules for fishing boat operators as well, <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fax passenger personal information to a government agency an hour before leaving; officers will be watching and doing spot checks from patrol boats and government aircraft". Authorities in 2008 from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission have tried stocking the lake with brown trout {{in an effort to}} build what's called a put-grow-and-take fishery. There was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the American side, from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in Ohio alone, during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined, and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake. In 1984, Ohio sold 27,000 nonresident fishing permits, and sport fishing was described as big business. In 1992, there were accounts of fishermen catching 8, 10, and 12 pound walleyes, and that the [...] "runt of a five-man daily limit of 25 walleye might be a nuisance of 5 pounds." [...] It is possible to fish off piers in winter for a fish called the burbot, also known by pseudonyms such as eelpout, mudblow, lawyer fish, cusk, or freshwater cod which looks [...] "ugly" [...] but tastes great; the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of [...] "Erie's glacial relics." ...|$|E
