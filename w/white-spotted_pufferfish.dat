50|$|Torquigener albomaculosus, or the <b>white-spotted</b> <b>pufferfish,</b> is {{the twentieth}} {{discovered}} {{species of the}} genus Torquigener. The species was discovered in the ocean waters around the Ryukyu Islands in Japan off the south coast of Amami Oshima Island. Observed depths of the species range between 10 to(-) 27 m. The fish's head and body are colored brown with white spots at the back. Its abdomen is silvery-white with white spots.|$|E
50|$|The {{males are}} known for {{creating}} circular-shaped nests in the sand, measuring 2 m in diameter. Such nest designs were noticed since 1995, but their creation remained a mystery until the species' discovery. The nests are created to attract mates through the nest's impressive design and ability to gather fine sand particles, both of which influence a female's mate choice. Males never reuse a nest. As of 2014, the <b>white-spotted</b> <b>pufferfish</b> {{is thought to be}} the only species of pufferfish that create the shapes.|$|E
