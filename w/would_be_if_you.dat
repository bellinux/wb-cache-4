25|$|I {{have often}} {{sat back and}} thought just how nice it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could relive your life based on the {{experience}} gained. For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions I {{have tried to do}} this , I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity.|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{said that}} the nucleus of their idea for Orange Man came as a {{reaction}} to cause and effect advertising, and that he and the team decided to focus on word of mouth as their media, which w{{as a reaction to}} Coca-Cola's big budget dominance in soft drink advertising. He told Channel 4 in 2000 that the advertisement was [...] "meant to be taking the mickey out of other ads that were on the television at the time", comparing it to coffee advertisements where [...] "they have a drink and go 'oh, whoopy' and flowers bloom," [...] noting that Orange Man decided to [...] "express this in an really OTT fashion". The idea for the advertisement originally started out as a joke, with Robinson recalling [...] "We said how brilliant it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had a drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened." [...] The idea to use commentators in the advert were taken from another idea they had for another advert, but they decided to mash the two ideas together, a [...] "cardinal sin in adland." [...] One commentary considered the advertisement to be a [...] "riff on the sort of sports commentary Andy Gray with his video tapes and ranty shouting at the time." ...|$|E
