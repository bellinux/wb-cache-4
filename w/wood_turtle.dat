5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> shares with only the bog turtle. It and the bog turtle have a similar genetic makeup, which is marginally {{different from that of the}} spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle,</b> including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E
5|$|In the past, <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> {{populations were}} forced south by {{extending}} glaciers. Remains from the Rancholabrean period (300,000 to 11,000 years ago) {{have been found}} in states such as Georgia and Tennessee, both of which are well south of their current range. After the receding of the ice, <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> colonies were able to re-inhabit their customary northern range (areas like New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).|$|E
5|$|The eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's turtle {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle,</b> both Blanding's turtle and the eastern box turtle have hinged plastrons {{that allow them to}} completely close their shells. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling the wood turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and saltwater marshes. The bog turtle and spotted turtle are also similar, but neither of these has the specific sculptured surface found on the carapaces of the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the western}} {{portion of its}} range, <b>wood</b> <b>turtles</b> are more aquatic. In the east, <b>wood</b> <b>turtles</b> are decidedly more terrestrial, {{especially}} during the summer. During this time, they {{can be found in}} wooded areas with wide open canopies. However, even here, they are never far from water and will enter it every few days.|$|R
5|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> takes a {{long time}} to reach sexual maturity, has a low {{fecundity}} (ability to reproduce), but has a high adult survival rate. However, the high survival rates are not true of juveniles or hatchlings. Although males establish hierarchies, they are not territorial. The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> becomes sexually mature between 14 and 18 years of age. Mating activity among wood turtles peaks in the spring and again in the fall, although it is known to mate throughout the portion of the year they are active. However, it has been observed mating in December. In one rare instance, a female <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> hybridized with a male Blanding's turtle.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle,</b> {{throughout}} {{the first years}} of its life, is a rapid grower. Five years after hatching, it already measures , at age 16, it is a full , depending on gender. The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> can be expected to live for 40 years in the wild, with captives living up to 58 years.|$|E
5|$|For proper {{protection}} of the wood turtle,in-depth land surveys of its habitat to establish population numbers are needed. One emerging solution to the highway mortality problem, which primarily affects nesting females, is the construction of under-road channels. These tunnels allow the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> to pass under the road, a solution that helps prevent accidental deaths. Brochures and other media that warn people to avoid keeping the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> as a pet are currently being distributed. Next, leaving nests undisturbed, especially common nesting sites and populations, is the best solution to enable the wood turtle's survival.|$|E

50|$|The spotted turtle's range {{overlaps}} that of {{many other}} turtles. It can often {{be found in the}} same wetlands as <b>wood</b> <b>turtles,</b> bog turtles, snapping turtles, painted turtles, Blanding's turtles, eastern box turtles, common musk turtles, and eastern mud turtles.|$|R
5|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> {{belongs to}} the family Emydidae. The {{specific}} name, insculpta, refers to the rough, sculptured surface of the carapace. This turtle species inhabits aquatic and terrestrial areas of North America, primarily the northeast of the United States and parts of Canada. <b>Wood</b> <b>turtle</b> populations are under high conservation concerns due to human interference of natural habitats. Habitat destruction and fragmentation can negatively impact the ability for wood turtles to search for suitable mates and build high quality nests.|$|E
5|$|During warmer weather, the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> {{stays in}} the water for a larger {{percentage}} of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (and the late fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves in the thick mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|Many {{different}} {{animals are}} predators of or otherwise {{pose a threat}} to the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle.</b> They include snapping turtles, porcupines, raccoons, otters, foxes, and cats. All of these species destroy unhatched eggs and prey upon hatchlings and juveniles. Several animals that often target <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> eggs are the common raven and coyote, which may completely destroy the nests they encounter. Evidence of predatory attacks (wounds to the skin and such) are common on individuals, but the northern populations tend to display more scarring than the southern ones. In addition to these threats, wood turtles also suffer from leech infestations.|$|E

5|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{omnivorous}} and {{is capable}} of eating on land or in water. On an average day, a <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> will move , a decidedly long distance for a turtle. Many other animals that live in its habitat {{pose a threat to}} it. Raccoons are over-abundant in many places and are a direct threat to all life stages of this species. Inadvertently, humans cause a large number of deaths through habitat destruction, road traffic, farming accidents, and illegal collection. When unharmed, it can live for up to 40 years in the wild and 58 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank higher on the social {{hierarchy}} often created by <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males will sometimes try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is a direct relationship between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E
5|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> is omnivorous, feeding {{mainly on}} plant matter and animals both {{on land and}} in water. It eats prey such as beetles, millipedes, and slugs. Also, wood turtles consume {{specific}} fungi (Amanita muscaria and Leccinum arcolatum), mosses, grasses, various insects, and also carrion. On occasion, {{it can be seen}} stomping the ground with alternating hits of the left and right front feet. This behavior is thought to imitate the sound of falling rain, sometimes causing earthworms to rise to the surface where they quickly become easy prey. When hunting, the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> pokes its head into such areas as dead and decaying logs, the bottoms of bushes, and in other vegetation. In the water, it exhibits similar behavior, searching algae beds and cavities along the sides of the stream or river.|$|E
5000|$|Glyptemys turtles {{are small}} to medium in size: the bog turtle males grow to be 9.4 cm and females 8.9 cm while <b>wood</b> <b>turtles</b> of either gender reach 14 to 20 cm in length. [...] Bog turtles weigh 110 g and <b>wood</b> <b>turtles</b> average 1 kg at maturity. [...] The bog can be {{recognized}} by small, bright blotches {{on each side of}} its neck [...] and the wood by its dark gray to black head and bright orange coloration on its ventral surfaces.|$|R
50|$|There {{were many}} types of snakes and turtles that lived in the area before the office complex was built. Garter snakes, brown snakes, ringneck snakes, water snakes, and milk snakes {{inhabited}} the area. Turtles included snapping <b>turtles,</b> box <b>turtles,</b> <b>wood</b> <b>turtles,</b> spotted turtles, musk and mud turtles.|$|R

5|$|Despite many {{sightings}} and {{a seemingly}} large and diverse distribution, <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> numbers are in decline. A {{large number of}} deaths caused by humans result from: habitat destruction, farming accidents, and road traffic. Also, it is commonly collected illegally for the international pet trade. These combined threats have caused many areas where they live to enact laws protecting it. Despite legislation, enforcement of the laws and education of the public regarding the species are minimal.|$|E
5|$|It {{spends a}} great deal of time in or near the water of wide rivers, preferring shallow, clear streams with {{compacted}} and sandy bottoms. The <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> can also be found in forests and grasslands, but will rarely be seen more than several hundred meters from flowing water. It is diurnal and is not overtly territorial. It spends the winter in hibernation and the hottest parts of the summer in estivation.|$|E
5|$|The {{densities of}} <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> populations {{have also been}} studied. In the {{northern}} portion of its range (Quebec and other areas of Canada), populations are fairly dilute, containing an average of 0.44 individuals per , while in the south, over the same area, the densities varied largely from 6 to 90 turtles. In addition to this, {{it has been found}} that colonies often have more females than males.|$|E
50|$|Painted <b>wood</b> <b>turtles</b> {{can grow}} {{to a maximum}} length of 20 cm. It has a {{dome-shaped}} carapace and the plastron has a continuous ventral line. It has red stripes on its body and it has webbed feet.|$|R
50|$|The center {{contains}} {{a variety of}} habitats including wetlands, forests, and more than 55 acre of restored and original prairie. The center contains some specimens of the endangered dwarf trout lily. There is also a population of <b>wood</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Painted <b>wood</b> <b>turtles</b> are oviparous. Females lay 3-5 eggs at a time. Eggs at low {{temperatures}} can be dormant early stages, and can sleep {{for some time}} at {{low temperatures}}, when the temperature returns to normal incubation can proceed.|$|R
5|$|The genus {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The bog turtle and the <b>wood</b> <b>turtle,</b> Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the genus Clemmys, which also included spotted turtles (C.guttata) and western pond turtles (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles are closely related, but neither is directly related to spotted turtles, hence the separation of the genus Glyptemys.|$|E
5|$|Specific mating {{courtship}} occurs {{more often}} in the Fall months and usually during the afternoon hours from 11:00 to 13:00 when many of the turtles {{are out in the}} population feeding. Mating is based on a male competitive hierarchy where a few higher ranked males gain the majority of mates in the population. Male wood turtles fight to gain access to female mates. These fights involve aggressive behaviors such as biting or chasing one another, and the males defend themselves by retreating their heads into their hard shells. The higher ranked winning males in the hierarchy system have a greater number of offspring than the lower ranked male individuals, increasing the dominant male's fitness. Female wood turtles mate with multiple males and are able to store sperm from multiple mates. Although the mechanism of sperm storage is unknown for the <b>Wood</b> <b>Turtle</b> species, other turtle species have internal compartments that can store viable sperm for years. Multiple mating ensures fertilization of all the female's eggs and often results in multiple paternity of a clutch, which is a common phenomenon exhibited by many marine and freshwater turtles. Multiple paternity patterns have been made evident in <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> populations by DNA fingerprinting. DNA fingerprinting of turtles involves using an oligonucleotide probe to produce gender specific markers, ultimately providing multi-locus DNA markers.|$|E
5|$|The Pine Bush is {{also home}} to 30 of the 44 species of {{amphibians}} and reptiles that are indigenous to Albany County. Seven of these species are generally not seen so far north in the state of New York. Three species of salamander, the Jefferson salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonium), blue-spotted salamander (Ambystoma laterale), and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), are state-listed special concern animals. Two species of turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) and <b>wood</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys insculpta), are also special concern animals. About 45 species of birds breed in the Albany Pine Bush (according to the 1985 New York State Breeding Bird Atlas) and are fairly common species for the area. About 32 species of common small mammals have been found in and adjacent to the Pine Bush.|$|E
