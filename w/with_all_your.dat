Bach had enlarged on the [...] "dualism of love of God and brotherly love" [...] already in his monumental cantata in 14 movements, , {{at the beginning of his}} first cycle. In order to show the law's universality, Bach introduces Martin Luther's chorale [...] "" [...] (These are the holy ten commandments), referring to the commandments of the Old Testament, as a foundation of the movement's structure. The tune is played in a strict canon, the most rigid musical law as one more symbol. The canon is performed [...] by the trumpet in the highest range, and the continuo, representing the lowest range. The tempo of the trumpet is twice as fast as the tempo of the continuo, therefore the trumpet has time to repeat first single lines and finally the complete melody of the chorale. The trumpet enters ten times, to symbolize once more the completeness of the law. The voices, representing the law of the New Testament, engage in imitation of a theme which is derived from the chorale tune and first played by the instruments.

As with political films, comedy softened {{with the election of}} FDR and the optimism of the New Deal.

In Employee's Entrance, a woman enters the office of a scoundrel boss who remarks, [...] "Oh, it's you — I didn't recognize you <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>your</b> clothes on."

[...] A sinfonia in E minor for these two instruments is reminiscent both of Bach's compositions for the court in Köthen and of a French overture, marked [...] "adagio", then [...] "vivace". Bach used the music of this movement later in his organ trio, BWV 528. Gardiner calls the movement [...] "in effect a sonata da chiesa". The tenor aria illustrates the [...] "masochistic" [...] "Hate me, then, hate me <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>your</b> might, o hostile race!" [...] by a first dissonant entry on an ostinato bass line full of chromatic, leaps and interrupting rests.

Interspersed between are computerized musical sounds and the chorus, which has a coo-ing accompanied with the main vocals, like Michael Jackson, and was described by Kevin Harley from The Independent as [...] "sleek Eurodisco". [...] "Artpop"s lyrics have been deduced to be a statement about [...] "the subjectivity of art". It begins with the singer uttering the lines [...] "Come to me <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>your</b> subtext of fantasy", the line being an indicative of enigma around her, according to The Huffington Post. Gaga explained the lyrics were a metaphor about love with the chorus line [...] "We could belong together, Artpop". She believed that if her fans and herself could be together, that would probably mean a bonding for art and pop too. On the contrary, Jim Farber from New York Daily News believed that the love relationship was sidelined for that between art and pop with the lyrics.|$|E

Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, [...] "When the kids perform, the movie sings, but their fictionalized personal stories are melodramatic drivel." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The film is cut at such a frenzied pitch that it's often possible to believe (mistakenly) that something significant is going on." [...] Variety magazine wrote, [...] "The great strength {{of the film is}} in the school scenes – when it wanders away from the scholastic side as it does with increasing frequency as the overlong feature moves along, it loses dramatic intensity and slows the pace." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four writing, [...] "Fame is a genuine treasure, moving and entertaining, a movie that understands being a teen-ager as well as Breaking Away did, but studies its characters in a completely different milieu." [...] William Gallagher, in his review for the BBC, wrote, [...] "Alan Parker manages to make this a fairly horrible story even while it remains entertaining.
