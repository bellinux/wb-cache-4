40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} focused {{to the effects}} of plastic working on the fatigue {{strength}} of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy with notch. In general, the fatigue strength of plastic <b>worked</b> <b>specimen</b> is higher than that of non-worked one. However, the potential of hardening ability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy is very limited. Accordingly, the effect of work hardening on fatigue strength about this material is very small. In addition, the surface of the worked part becomes rougher with increasing plastic deformed value and the fatigue cracks initiate at this part. Consequently, the fatigue limit of the plastic <b>worked</b> <b>specimen</b> is lower than that of the non-plastic-worked one...|$|E
40|$|MAE of a dilute Fe-N {{system in}} the range of 200 - 480 K was {{investigated}} by measuring the disaccommodation of its initial susceptibility at various temperature T with or without preceding demagnetization of specimen. The results suggest that magnetic relaxation spectrum {{in the range of}} 350 - 480 K is induced by the metastable Fe 8 N phase transformation. It is composed of a structural relaxation induced by pinning and depinning of the domain walls through precipitation and resolution of Fe 8 N and a thermal-activated relaxation due to N atoms close to the precipitates. A single cold work magnetic peak was observed at ~ 430 K from a cold <b>worked</b> <b>specimen...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Grain {{refinement}} {{and crystal}} orientation of magnesium alloy AZ 31 under torsion extrusion with a square-hole die are investigated. The optimum temperature and {{ratio of the}} die rotation speed to the extrusion speed were clarified, resulting in uniformly distributed fine grains with sizes in the range 1 - 2 µm over the entire {{cross section of the}} <b>worked</b> <b>specimen.</b> The crystal orientation of the specimen was determined by electron backscatter diffraction and compared with that of a conventionally extruded specimen. In the case of torsion extrusion, a very strong texture was observed along the extrusion axis, especially in the center region of the cross section. In contrast, the direction of many grains in the conventionally extruded specimen tended to be perpendicular to the extrusion axis...|$|E

The {{degree of}} hardening after heat treatment was greater for the initially cold <b>worked</b> <b>specimens</b> {{than for the}} initially quenched specimens. Dark field images of initially cold <b>worked</b> <b>specimens</b> after heat treatment showed smaller ordered regions than the initially quenched specimens. This suggests that smaller, more numerous ordered regions impede dislocations {{to a greater degree}} than larger ordered regions in this alloy.

40|$|The {{restriction}} of the θ:θ diffractometers to tilt angles less than 40 °, when measuring residual stress, {{can be overcome}} by rotating the specimen through an offset angle and recalibrating the zero points of the Ω and θ scales. The effectiveness of this offset is examined by measuring the residual stress in a PVD film of TiN deposited on a stainless steel substrate. An anticipated error associated with backlash in the gear as the detector, or X-ray tube, is traversed beyond the 90 ° vertical position, is shown to be insignificant.

40|$|Internal {{friction}} of Fe-Cr-Mn alloys {{have close}} relations with chemical compositions, constituent phases and cold work degree. In Fe-Cr-Mn alloys, phases are composed from γ,ε and α depending on chemical compositions. In solution annealed specimens, internal friction was higher when a phase was included. This {{suggests that a}} phase behaves as ferromagnetic phase and also introduces fresh dislocation surrounding it. In cold <b>worked</b> <b>specimens,</b> internal friction increases dependent on cold work degree and it was became highest when αphase is maximum. This result suggests that the stacking fault energy is minimum in this case, and the extended half dislocations are more mobile than other cases. In cold <b>worked</b> <b>specimens</b> the contribution of α phase was negligible. This alloy has damping capacity higher than 1 %, with high strength (more than 1000 MPa) and high corrosion resistance...|$|R

Crack growth rates were obtained from experiment. Fractography of specimens was performed. Genetic Algorithm (GA) was employed for prediction of residual stress value in weldments using the crack growth rates obtained from experiments. The results show that, by using the measured crack growth rates and GA model, residual stresses can be estimated with a good approximation. 1...|$|R

It is important to measure the elastic moduli of thick composites for two reasons: (1) design data on stiffness, and (2) prediction of feasible wave paths for ultrasonic waves for NDE.

40|$|The {{expression}} of apparent diffusivity of hydrogen in a generalized trap model of "two energy level" has been obtained {{on the basis}} of an assumption of a system of low occupation probability of hydrogen on normal lattice and trap sites. A good point of the derived apparent diffusivity of hydrogen compared with the conventional expression is as follows: (i) The traps have not only the characteristic trap density and depth but also the trap "width". (ii) The peculiar trapping and release rates are taken into consideration in the sites involved. (iii) It is taken into account that the characteristic diffusivity within the traps as well as the dimension of trap, and those of normal lattice site can affect the total diffusion flux.
