5000|$|Garrison Keillor commented in {{a review}} of the book: [...] "Golden Age of American Song has been saluted and high-faluted in books and wept over repeatedly, but “The House That George Built” is a big rich stew of an homage that makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Gershwin and Berlin and Porter and Arlen all over again ... Sheed's jazzy prose is a joy to read. It goes catapulting along, digressing like mad, never pedantic, a little frantic, which is just right: the jazz song, like all true art, is a flight from depression, indifference, the cold blank stare, the earnest clammy touch.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Michael G. Nastos states [...] "Nothing {{on the album}} screams as a standout, but there's an even-keeled consonance that is very enjoyable, and lingers {{to the point where}} <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> again and again. That {{enduring}} quality makes this recording special, and set the bar high for what Adderley would produce through a long and fruitful career as a jazz master. This album is the seed for that field of flowers". The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave the album a three star rating saying [...] "the confidence and bro is already in place and seemingly unstoppable".|$|R

5000|$|Keyboardist Franny Griffiths {{defended the}} album's lack of dance tracks, {{which had been}} {{somewhat}} of a tradition on previous Space releases: [...] "For me it's better. People might say why's there no dance tracks or maybe there's no Yorkie tracks, but I think when <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> back <b>to</b> it you'll see why them things aren't on it because its more consistent, even though it's all our different ideas, it's at a better blend, it runs better and <b>you</b> can <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> each track after each other no problem. You're not jumping from one track <b>to</b> another, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it from start to finish." ...|$|R

It could be the single best record I own...A sugar high {{is nothing compared to}} what I felt <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> this treasure.

For the rest of us, {{there are plenty of}} other TV shows out there."
