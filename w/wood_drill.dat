A local tavern owner would construct a game board out of <b>wood,</b> <b>drill</b> small holes in it, and fill each hole with a small paper ticket or gamepiece.

If the gamepiece contained a winning number, the patron won the prize.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{goal of this}} studywas to {{investigate}} if the preparation of implantation site affects bone formation inside tissue engineering scaffolds. For this purpose, two different drilling techniques were {{used to create a}} hole in distal femurs of rats before the insertion of a bone scaffold: amanually drivenwood drill bit and an electrically drivenmetal drill bit. The size and the position of the hole were identical for the two cases. The bone volume, bonemineral density, and callus formationwere assessed noninvasively usingmicro-CT tomography at several time points after implantation. The formation of bone and soft tissue inside scaffold were evaluated by histology. The bone structure around the holes made by the two techniques was compared ex vivo. The long-term study of bone formation showed that when a <b>wood</b> <b>drill</b> bit was used, the bone formation is accelerated by 3 weeks compared towhen ametal drill bit was used. The ex vivo studies suggest that this result is due to the drilling methods differentially affecting the structure of the bone surrounding the generated defects...|$|E

25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist drill bit shears {{the edges of}} the hole cleanly. <b>Wood</b> <b>drilled</b> across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The lip and spur drill bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|R

The ha may also vary in style; for example, tengu-geta {{have only a}} single centered [...] "tooth". There are also less common geta with three teeth. Merchants use(d) very high geta (two long teeth) to keep the feet well above the seafood scraps on the floor. The teeth are usually not separate, instead, the geta is carved from one block of wood. The tengu tooth is, however, strengthened by a special attachment. The teeth of any geta may have harder <b>wood</b> <b>drilled</b> into the bottom to avoid splitting, and the soles of the teeth may have rubber soles glued onto them.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the use of}} {{domestic}} and commercial woods of the Caspian Sea forest fringes and evaluation of their durability against marine destructive factors were investigated. The samples of elm (Zelkova carpinifolia), oak (Quercus castanifolia), beech (Fagus orientalis), Maple (Acer insgin), Alder (Alnus subcordata) and horn beech (Carpinus betulus) species were impregnated with CCA (Chrome-Cupper-Arsenic). Treated and untreated (natural as a control) woods have been established for 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in Amir-abad beach of Behsharhre under fishing environment. The results of observations showed that in this beach, the staining fungi and balanus were able to attack control woods or live on them. With increasing woods maintaining in the sea, their presence became longer. The numerical results of samples weight loss showed that durability of control wood samples after one year made less than 5 % in weight losses of elm, maple, alder and horn beech. However, control samples of oak and beech had no weight losses. The treated samples not only had no weight reduction, the absorbed salts made their weight increase.

5000|$|The canoes were {{typically}} {{made out of}} planks split from redwood (Sequoioideae) or pine driftwood washed up on the shore. This driftwood was usually chosen because it was available and usually knot free and easy to work with. Some of these driftwood logs were selected, cut to length, split, shaped and then their split out planks [...] "sewn" [...] {{together to form a}} canoe. The side planks and canoe bottom were split out of straight knot free logs utilizing whalebone and antler Wedges driven by rock mallets. The planks were then shaped, trimmed and leveled using flint and seashell tools and shark hide sandpaper. Where planks needed to be connected holes were bored in the planks using <b>wood</b> <b>drills</b> tipped with chert or bone. These drilled planks were then connected by [...] "sewing" [...] split and shaped knot free planks together on their ends to get the necessary length. They {{were typically}} fastened together with red milkweed (tok) fiber cords. After the planks had been shaped and sewn together for length they were carefully shaped, bent and mounted six to eight planks vertically to form the canoe's sides around a large split bottom plank that formed the bottom of the canoe. Over 20 pieces of shaped wood are used to make a typical tomol. Once the planks were bent, fitted and lashed together the heart of dry tule rush was forced into the cracks between the planks {{on the outside of the}} canoe hull to act as caulking. All seams between planks, plank ends and holes for cords or thongs were then caulked with 'yop', a mixture of hard tar and pine pitch melted and then boiled. In many respects their boat construction technique mirrored that utilized for making small wooden boats around the world. The lack of metal tools and fasteners forced them to use stone age tools and materials.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} manor, never fortified, {{was built}} in 1680. Its successive owners continued to enlarge the area to develop the castle. In 1712, Joseph Charpentier, Lord of Brandelong and MÃ©liers, bought Boisgibault. The family obtained {{the right to have}} a chapel in Boisgibault in 1756. His son, Jacques Charpentier de Boisgibault (1721-1794), was Senior Judge and PrÃ©sident of Court of Aids with Malesherbes and an advisor to King Louis XV, and later died in the French Revolution. The two wings of the castle have most likely been added in the 18th century. During the French Revolution, the castle and its backyard were sold. In 1829, the chÃ¢teau was acquired by the Marquis de Gasville who made of Boisgibault one of the finest hunting property in Sologne by extending the walls of the park by more than a kilometer fence.

50|$|Spindle speed becomes {{important}} {{in the operation of}} routers, spindle moulders or shapers, and drills. Older and smaller routers often rotate at a fixed spindle speed, usually between 20,000 and 25,000 rpm. While these speeds are fine for small router bits, using larger bits, say more than 1 in or 25 millimeters in diameter, can be dangerous and can lead to chatter. Larger routers now have variable speeds and larger bits require slower speed. <b>Drilling</b> <b>wood</b> generally uses higher spindle speeds than metal, and the speed is not as critical. However, larger diameter drill bits do require slower speeds to avoid burning.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} similar heat {{treatments}} â€” Westwood, {{developed in the}} United States; Retiwood, developed in France; Thermowood, developed in Finland by VTT; and Platowood, developed in The Netherlands. These processes autoclave the treated wood, subjecting it to pressure and heat, along with nitrogen or water vapour to control drying in a staged treatment process ranging from 24 to 48 hours at temperatures of 180 Â°C to 230 Â°C depending on timber species. These processes increase the durability, dimensional stability and hardness of the treated wood {{by at least one}} class; however, the treated wood is darkened in colour, and there are changes in certain mechanical characteristics: Specifically, the modulus of elasticity is increased to 10%, and the modulus of rupture is diminished by 5% to 20%; thus, the treated <b>wood</b> requires <b>drilling</b> for nailing to avoid splitting the wood.
