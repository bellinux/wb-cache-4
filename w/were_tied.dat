5|$|In 31, Sejanus {{held the}} consulship with Tiberius , and began his play for power in earnest.

Livilla was later implicated in this plot, and was revealed to have been Sejanus's lover for a number of years.|$|E

The Hokies bounced back from the close contest in their second game of the season—against the Duke Blue Devils—as Tech raced to a 45–0 victory.
