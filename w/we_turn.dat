And when <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> to the Chronicle itself the fact seems to be pretty well borne out by what the author himself says in the record of that year.|$|E
5|$|A social {{rational}} for the Hindu {{concept of}} rebirth in Hell {{is evident in}} the metric work of the Manusmrti: a written discourse focused on the “law of the social classes”. A large portion of it is designed to help people of the Hindu faith understand evil deeds (pätaka) and their karmic consequences in various hellish rebirths. The Manusmrti, however, does not go into explicit detail of each hell. For this <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> to the Bhagavata Purana. The Manusmrti lists multiple levels of hell in which a person can be reborn into. The punishments in each of these consecutive hells is directly related the crimes (pätaka) of the current life and how these deeds will effect the next reincarnation during the cycle of Saṃsāra This concept provides structure to society in which crimes have exacting consequences. An opposite social facet to these hellish rebirths is the precise way in which a person can redeem oneself from a particular crime through a series of vows (such as fasting, water purification rituals, chanting, and even sacrifices). These vows must take place during the same life cycle that the crimes were committed in. These religious lessons assist the societal structure by defining approved and unapproved social behavior.|$|E

25|$|This form {{suggests}} {{that if we can}} find a function ψ whose gradient is given by P, then the integral A is given by the difference of ψ at the endpoints of the interval of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary can be related {{to the study of the}} level surfaces of ψ. In order to find such a function, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.|$|E
500|$|The {{announcement}} of Kills' second studio album {{was made with}} the release of a music video for its first promotional single [...] "Controversy" [...] in mid-September 2012. During an interview with Glamour, Kills explained that it served as an introductory track to the album [...] "because it's a verbal collage of things we see on a daily basis that <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> a blind eye to, especially in the Internet age, where you can literally see anything and everything instantly. (...) We all laugh and joke when it's someone else's suffering." [...] The album's first single, [...] "Problem", was digitally released by Interscope in mid-March 2013, followed in June by its music video. In the same month, [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was chosen as Troubles second single. It received mostly positive reviews from music critics.|$|E
500|$|Many assertions {{about the}} year 2012 form part of Mayanism, a non-codified {{collection}} of New Age beliefs about ancient Maya wisdom and spirituality. The term is distinct from [...] "Mayanist," [...] {{used to refer to}} an academic scholar of the Maya. Archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni says that while the idea of [...] "balancing the cosmos" [...] was prominent in ancient Maya literature, the 2012 phenomenon did not draw from those traditions. Instead, it was bound up with American concepts such as the New Age movement, millenarianism, and the belief in secret knowledge from distant times and places. Themes found in 2012 literature included [...] "suspicion towards mainstream Western culture", the idea of spiritual evolution, and the possibility of leading the world into the New Age by individual example or by a group's joined consciousness. The general intent of this literature was not to warn of impending doom but [...] "to foster counter-cultural sympathies and eventually socio-political and 'spiritual' activism." [...] Aveni, who has studied New Age and search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) communities, describes 2012 narratives as the product of a [...] "disconnected" [...] society: [...] "Unable to find spiritual answers to life's big questions within ourselves, <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> outward to imagined entities that lie far off in space or time—entities that just might be in possession of superior knowledge." ...|$|E

2500|$|The U.S. {{government}} intervenes less actively {{to force}} down {{prices in the}} United States than in other countries. Stanford economist Victor Fuchs wrote in 2014: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> the question around and ask why healthcare costs so much less in other high-income countries, the answer nearly always points to a larger, stronger role for government. Governments usually eliminate much of the high administrative costs of insurance, obtain lower prices for inputs, and influence the mix of healthcare outputs by arranging for large supplies of primary-care physicians and hospital beds while keeping tight control {{on the number of}} specialist physicians and expensive technology. In the United States, the political system creates many “choke points” for diverse interest groups to block or modify government’s role in these areas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{object is}} a [...] "mirror of all others."

This attention, however, does not operate by clarifying what is already seen, but by constructing a new Gestalt oriented toward a particular object. Because our bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate, we encounter meaningful things in a unified though ever open-ended world.|$|E
2500|$|The backstory {{of one of}} the {{surviving}} epistles, directed to Constantine I, recounts how the fame of Saint Anthony spread abroad and reached Emperor Constantine.
