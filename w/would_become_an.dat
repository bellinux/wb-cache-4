As a student at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai, she took part in amateur plays. After graduation, she briefly worked as a model and then as a television presenter.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, the NSW state {{government}} announced that, {{with the approval}} of the Japanese government and the submariners' families, divers would be allowed to observe the M-24 wreck {{for a short period of}} time. Divers would enter a ballot for places on controlled dives run on several days. If successful, opening the site <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> annual event to commemorate the attack.|$|E
5|$|The Elton John and George Michael concerts both {{attracted}} {{crowds of}} over 20,000 people. Andrew Cullen, {{the director of}} sales and marketing for the Carrow Road ground, told BBC Radio Norfolk prior to the George Michael performance that he hoped such concerts <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> annual summer event for the venue, if big enough star names could be attracted.|$|E

5|$|The aerial {{game was}} also {{developed}} within the Sheffield game. While causing much amusement when the side visited London in 1866, the header <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> {{important feature of}} the national game. This {{was linked to the}} abolition of the fair catch in the same year that prevented all use of the hands by outfield players.|$|E
5|$|From 1947 to 1960 {{the country}} {{seems to have}} been divided into three major {{military}} regions: Cluj, Bacău, and Bucharest in the west, east, and south, respectively. In wartime the land forces in each military region <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> army corps with their headquarters in Cluj-Napoca, Iaşi, and Bucharest. Armies seem to have succeeded military regions in 1960, and three armies seem to have become four in 1980. What is known is that on 01.07.1947 Fourth Army became 3rd Military Region, based in Cluj. The 3rd Military Region became the 3rd Army on 30 April 1960, and the 4th Army on 5 April 1980.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the nonprofit}} {{organization}} Friends of the High Line {{was formed by}} Joshua David and Robert Hammond, residents of the neighborhood that the line ran through. They advocated for the line's preservation and reuse as public open space, so that it <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> elevated park or greenway, similar to the Promenade Plantée in Paris. The organization was initially formed as a small community group to advocate for the High Line’s preservation and transformation {{at a time when}} the historic structure was under the threat of demolition during Rudy Giuliani’s second mayoral term.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, WSTC {{hired him}} for the night shift, {{delivering}} the eleven o'clock newscast and conducting station breaks around network shows such as The Lone Ranger. Other members of the staff included Scott Vincent (who <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> staff announcer for ABC), Jerry Damon (who <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> staff announcer for NBC), and Dee Caruso (who <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> TV writer and producer for Get Smart, The Monkees, and The Smothers Brothers Show).|$|R

5|$|On June 28, the Lakers {{decided that}} they would not make Morris the $1.2 million {{qualifying}} offer prior to the July 1 deadline that would have been necessary to make him a restricted free agent. Although the team expressed interest in re-signing Morris at a lower priced contract and having him represent the team again in the summer league, he <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> unrestricted free agent at the deadline because the qualifying offer was not made.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for a new}} two-tier {{stand to}} the north and east were {{presented}} next. The plans had called for 24,500 sitting places in the new and south stands, and 5,500 standing places in the west stand. However, in 1989, the plans were modified, as the FIFA made new rules, requiring that only seating places could be used for international qualification matches from 1992. It was thereby decided that Ullevaal <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> all-seater.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth was {{a son of}} the Æthelmær the Stout and a {{grandson}} of Æthelweard the Historian, who was a great-great-grandson of Æthelred I. In {{the view of the}} historian Frank Barlow, Æthelnoth was probably the uncle of Godwin of Wessex. He was baptised by Dunstan, and a story was told at Glastonbury Abbey that as the infant was baptised, his hand made a motion much like that an archbishop makes when blessing. From this motion, Dunstan is said to have prophesied that Æthelnoth <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> archbishop.|$|E

5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on September1 about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde. With {{a burst of}} convection near its center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston six hours later and reached peak winds of 40mph (65km/h). Despite initial projections that Gaston <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> increasingly strong hurricane over the central Atlantic, exceptionally dry air began to wrap in the storm after peak. It weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on September2 and further degenerated into a remnant low by 18:00UTC that day. The system nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone the following day as shallow convection wrapped into the center, but the increased organization was transient and it ultimately remained a remnant low until dissipating southeast on the Dominican Republic on September8. The remnants of Gaston produced sporadic rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.03in (76.9mm) in Naguabo.|$|E
5|$|Applewood Farm {{has served}} as a farm for over a century, with an 1850 census {{reporting}} it produced butter, cheese, rye, Indian corn, oats, wool, Irish potatoes and hay. Three apple orchards planted by Russell Gallup <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> important part of Applewood Farms and owe its name to those orchards. After Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s, the farm produced fresh fruits and vegetables and poultry, eggs and dairy products. In 1994, the Applewood Farm reported having 700 trees tapped for maple syrup production and showed visitors the process of producing the syrup. Applewood Farms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under criteria A for the Gallup family history that {{played an important role in}} the local history and under criteria C as an architecturally important example of a late colonial center chimney house.|$|E
5|$|Bache {{supported}} {{himself as}} an organist at the English Church, where the chaplain had previously known Bache's brother Edward. As {{his reputation as a}} performer grew, he also came into demand as a teacher. These two activities guaranteed financial security. He also became acquainted with several young gifted musicians, including fellow Liszt pupil Giovanni Sgambati and violinist Ettore Pinelli. During this time, Bache began exploring the two-piano repertoire, especially the arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poem Les préludes and Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy, which he performed with Sgambati in concert. The two-piano arrangements of Liszt's symphonic poems <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> important feature of Bache's concert series once he returned to England. He was also active in chamber music—the works he performed during this time include Chopin's cello sonata, the David-Pinelli Violin Variations, Mendelssohn's D minor piano trio, a piano trio by Anton Rubinstein and a Schumann violin sonata arranged for viola.|$|E
25|$|Outside of cricket Phillips was by {{profession}} {{a mining}} engineer. He married Dorothea Mary Land in 1912, {{with the couple}} having two sons; their eldest son, Joseph Anthony Moore Phillips, <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> lieutenant colonel in the British Army and <b>would</b> later <b>become</b> the Deputy Lieutenant of the now defunct county of Humberside, while their youngest son, Peter William Garside Phillips <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> major in the army. Both <b>would</b> <b>become</b> highly decorated officers. Peter's son, Mark Phillips, <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> successful Olympic gold-medal-winning horseman for Great Britain, and would marry Anne, Princess Royal, with whom he would have two children, Peter Phillips and Zara Phillips. He died at Oldbury Grange in Nuneaton, Warwickshire on 15 January 1951.|$|R

5|$|British {{policy-makers}} regarded Portugal as {{a traditional}} friend—the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance dated back to 1386, and both countries were in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the European Free Trade Association—but the combined strength of the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby in the United Nations forced the British to peel back {{their support for the}} pluricontinental Estado Novo ("New State") during the early 1960s. Portugal's Colonial War, starting in Angola in 1961, pitted it against a number of guerrilla factions in its African territories, most of which subscribed to communist political thinking. Britain opposed communist encroachment into southern Africa, but knew it <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> international pariah if it publicly opposed general consensus at the UN, which roundly condemned colonialism in all forms and supported communist-backed insurgencies across the region, regarding them as racial liberation movements. It therefore attempted an awkward balancing act whereby it would appear to oppose Portugal without meaningfully doing so.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood next {{turned his}} {{attention}} towards Breezy (1973), a film about love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl. During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time, an actress who would play major roles in six of his films {{over the next ten}} years and <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> important figure in his life. Kay Lenz got the part of Breezy because Locke, at age 29, was considered too old. The film, shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley, came in $1million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule. Breezy was not a major critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{the band}} contributed {{a cover of}} the Underdog theme song to be {{included}} on the tribute album , produced by Ralph Sall for MCA. Later that year, Haynes's side project, P, issued an eponymous LP on Capitol, while Coffey's Trance Syndicate label released the first Butthole Surfers compilation album. Titled The Hole Truth... and Nothing Butt, it was mostly live tracks recorded at different venues from 1985 to 1991. In December, Butthole Surfers initiated what <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> extended legal battle with Touch and Go. At first they were seeking to increase their profits from the albums released by the label, because the label chose a strategy of non-promotion. The case quickly became a fight for all ownership rights that dragged {{on for more than}} three years.|$|E

5|$|Starting in March, Braathens SAFE {{took over}} KLM's routes from Stavanger to Amsterdam, {{and started a}} new route from Trondheim to Amsterdam. From 26 March 1998, Braathens SAFE moved its flights to London from Gatwick to London Stansted Airport. At the same time, it {{announced}} {{that the number of}} daily services from Oslo to London would increase from one to three, following the opening of Gardermoen. In addition, KLM-partner AirUK <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> agent for Braathens SAFE, and the company hoped that 40% of the sales on the route would be sold in the United Kingdom. The agreement also involved a codesharing agreement with AirUK, including some onwards flights from London, notably the route to Dublin. At the same time, Braathens SAFE announced that the airline would start selling more discounted tickets on the London-flights, to compete with Ryanair's new route from Stanstad to Sandefjord Airport, Torp.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{authorities}} apparently appreciated Vizzini, {{because he}} had opposed the Fascists and yielded substantial political power on the island. As far as Vizzini was concerned, he liked to boast about his excellent contacts with the Americans, and underlined {{their support for the}} separatist movement. Vizzini <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> important player {{in the midst of the}} separatist crisis later on. The Americans seem to have treated Vizzini as the Mafia’s overall boss. The OSS relied on the Mafia, and in particular on Vizzini, for its intelligence. His codename was ‘Bull Frog’ in secret communications. For a while, the chief of the OSS Palermo office, Joseph Russo, met him and other Mafia bosses ‘at least once a month’.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan {{was educated}} privately, and {{remained}} at home until {{the outbreak of}} the First World War in 1914, after which she served in a Red Cross hospital and for the Women's Land Army in Breconshire and Radnorshire. Her work brought her into contact with women living on the local farms, and <b>would</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> influence on her writing. At {{the end of the war}} she left home for London, and whilst attending a writing course at Bedford College met the novelist Charles Langbridge Morgan. They married on 6 June 1923 and afterwards spent nine years in a flat in Chelsea. In December 1924, Vaughan gave birth to the couple's first child, Elizabeth Shirley.|$|E
