25|$|In Latin America, chicha {{is still}} widely {{produced}} {{by women and}} consumed daily by adults and children, as it typically has a low alcohol content.

Peruvian <b>women</b> <b>make</b> their version of chicha using the same method, but with corn. In Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, among Amazonian Indians, chicha, made from corn, or algarroba beer made from carob seed, as well as beer produced from mixing corn or manioc with apples, melons, papaya, pears, pumpkin, quince, strawberries and sweet potatoes are brewed by women.

25|$|The {{proportion}} of women tertiary graduates reflects these trends, with high percentages of women in science in Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines (around 60%) and a low of 10% in Cambodia. <b>Women</b> <b>make</b> {{up the majority of}} graduates in health sciences, from 60% in Laos to 81% in Myanmar – Viet Nam being an exception at 42%. Women graduates are on a par with men in agriculture but less present in engineering: Viet Nam (31%), the Philippines (30%) and Malaysia (39%); here, the exception is Myanmar, at 65%. In the Republic of Korea, <b>women</b> <b>make</b> up about 40% of graduates in science and agriculture and 71% of graduates in health sciences but only 18% of female researchers overall. This represents a loss in the investment made in educating girls and women up through tertiary education, a result of traditionalviews of women’s role in society and in the home. Kim and Moon (2011) remark on the tendency of Korean women to withdraw from the labour force to take care of children and assume family responsibilities, calling it a ‘domestic brain drain’.|$|E
