25|$|In {{the early}} days of gaming, the idea of love and romance was used {{as little more than a}} plot point to urge the hero to {{complete}} the set of tasks put before him. Mario, hero of the Super Mario series of games, has Princess Peach to rescue from the main villain. Link and Princess Zelda from The Legend of Zelda series made gamers <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> two were not romantically together while rooting for the couple. Double Dragon features the protagonist Billy Lee, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend (Maria) from his evil twin brother (Jimmy), leader of a sinister street gang. This era of game-playing was not well known for equal opportunity in gender roles.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{the drought}} theory <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} and central lowland cities were abandoned {{and the northern}} cities like Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and Coba continued to thrive. One critic argued that Chichen Itza revamped its political, military, religious, and economic institutions away from powerful lords or kings. Inhabitants of the northern Yucatán also had access to seafood, which might have explained the survival of Chichen Itza and Mayapan, cities away from the coast but within reach of coastal food supplies. Critics of the drought theory also point to current weather patterns: much heavier rainfall in the southern lowlands compared to the lighter amount of rain in the northern Yucatán. Drought theory supporters state that the entire regional climate changed, including the amount of rainfall, so that modern rainfall patterns are not indicative of rainfall from 800 to 900. LSU archaeologist Heather McKillop found a significant rise in sea level along the coast nearest the southern Maya lowlands, coinciding {{with the end of}} the Classic period, and indicating climate change.|$|E
500|$|Elliot Huntley {{writes that}} the track {{provides}} a showcase for Harrison's [...] "melodic flair", {{as well as a}} reason to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> ex-Beatle did not record more songs in the country-music genre, since [...] "certainly he seems perfectly at home in these comfortable surroundings". Huntley speculates on the [...] "interesting" [...] possibility of a whole LP side of similar [...] "ersatz country and western" [...] tracks, as the Rolling Stones would do on their Exile on Main St. double album in 1972. Harrison biographer Joshua Greene describes the song as a celebration of [...] "love's victory over pain".|$|E
5000|$|Example: I <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> {{ball was}} getting bigger. Then it hit me.|$|R
60|$|Each {{second the}} vapor became denser, and he <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> miners did not {{perceive}} it.|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} pause. Mr. Carey <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> {{headmaster}} did not come. Presently Philip {{made an effort}} and spoke again.|$|R
500|$|Ponzi {{described}} the machine as [...] "light-hearted [...] [...] [...] active, distinctive—and fun". O'Donnell, who inspired the sculpture, {{called it a}} [...] "gentle spectacle" [...] and {{described the}} work as [...] "a cartoon contraption, an odd little thingamajig. It has bells and whistles and other mechanized wonders that confirm rain sometime after the downpour and proudly announce sunshine in the bright light of day." [...] In 1994, The Oregonian reported that O'Donnell regarded Weather Machine with a [...] "mixture of wonder and embarrassment" [...] and stated that he [...] " [...] think it's all that attractive". The publication's Vivian McInerny said of O'Donnell and the machine: [...] "Practical people may <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> square needs such a silly weather machine when a glance out the window works as well[...] [...] And these practical people may be the very ones who make the world go 'round. But it is the less practical people, the dreamers like O'Donnell, who make it worth going 'round." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Left & Right" [...] is a funky party jam {{featuring}} rappers Method Man and Redman, who exchange verses as D'Angelo {{sings the}} song's verses and chorus. Entertainment Weeklys Matt Diehl calls Method Man's and Redman's lyrics [...] "misogynistic", {{adding that it}} upsets Voodoos [...] "organically sensual vibe". The introspective track [...] "The Line" [...] has a downtempo, spiritual sound with lyrics about dealing with some unnamed adversity. According to one critic, it [...] "could be about his MIA status ('Will I hang or get left hangin?/Will I fall off or is it bangin?/I say it's up to God'), or about anyone facing doubters with a revolver loaded with talent and self-confidence ('I'm gonna {{put my finger on}} the trigger/I'm gonna pull it, and then we gon' see/What the deal/I'm for real')". Music critic Robert Christgau interpreted the lyrics to be [...] "unjudgmental, unsentimental ... in which a young black man lays out the reasons he's ready to die-leaving the listener to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> fuck he should have to think about it". Andy Peterson of The GW Hatchet viewed that the adversity is [...] "the price of fame" [...] or [...] "lamenting a lost lover".|$|E
500|$|Ferguson congratulated Arsenal {{on their}} win and {{said of the}} game: [...] "It was about {{trying to make sure}} {{everyone}} was fit for Wednesday. I think we have managed to do that. There are no new injuries so far. Hopefully by tomorrow morning it will be a definite." [...] He believed it was important to substitute Giggs and Keane early in the second half {{in order for them to}} recuperate in time for the Dinamo București game. Scholes, however, [...] "…needed a game, which is why I left him on that bit longer." [...] Ferguson felt Manchester United's preparations to the new season were hampered because of the injuries: [...] "It's got a lot to do with summer football. It's not down to the European Championship, but you do <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Copa América can't be at the same time. That harmony is never quite right, from Africa to America to Europe. Something should be done about that." [...] Giggs said Manchester United needed to take the positives out of the match and anticipated Arsenal as their main rivals in the league: [...] " [...] know what to do and how to handle the pressure when it comes around." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{half hour}} had passed, {{and they were}} <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> shore did not appear, when {{suddenly}} Dick uttered a warning cry.|$|R
60|$|Alvina {{got used}} to scenes like these. She <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> people stood it. But soon she {{realized}} that they loved it--particularly the women.|$|R
6000|$|Again I <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Basutos {{should look}} upon this {{particular}} spot as sacred, but thinking it wisest to ask no questions, I only answered-- ...|$|R
2500|$|Marketer Seth Godin {{has used}} the phrase [...] "Purple Cow" [...] for the concept of {{marketing}} a product as [...] "intrinsically different". The phrase has also been used for the marketing concept of choosing a name which [...] "makes your audience stop in their tracks and <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> title was chosen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] the Princess said. [...] "There are {{too many}} people about to talk of these things. I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Duke took Jeanne off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was afraid}} {{when he was}} ill; I <b>wonder</b> <b>why.</b> <b>The</b> fellow has no {{religious}} or moral code. But he drinks hard and perhaps he's superstitious." ...|$|E
30|$|There {{are several}} reasons for <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> {{cortical}} surface {{should be treated as}} a Euclidean plane, and not as a curved surface like the ones supporting non-Euclidean geometries.|$|R
5000|$|The song poses rhetorical {{question}}s, with Raymond <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> question [...] "I {{love you}} - {{do you love}} me too?" [...] is so powerful in the human experience.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} about the next life anyway, Matt?" [...] he asked a little later, while {{secretly}} he <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> other had not yet touched his coffee.|$|R
6000|$|... 'All right, we'll see. <b>Wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> beak doesn't come up. I can't {{sit here}} doing Livy all the evening. And yet if we stop he's bound to look in.' ...|$|E
60|$|THE ARCHBISHOP. I {{wonder you}} did not kill yourself. I often <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> poor in those evil old times did not kill themselves. They did not even kill other people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Thirlwell, looking hard at him. [...] "Then I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> canoe capsized. Were they drunk, or {{was there}} a quarrel? But perhaps you know and cannot tell!" ...|$|E
60|$|So I went to bed. The {{hotel was}} {{on the edge of}} a steep declivity. I <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> whole hills did not slide down, in some great natural catastrophe.|$|R
60|$|And {{leaning against}} the distempered wall of the draughty corridor, a queer smile on his face, Fiorsen <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> devil he was there, and what the devil she would say.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned to}} Freddie, {{who had come}} up at a gallop and was <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> deuce {{this sort of thing}} {{happened}} to him out of a city of six millions.|$|R
6000|$|In {{a little}} time she was better, and then she burst out {{laughing}} again. 'I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> man went on when he was so tired. What a stupid man he must be!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poppy Tyrell," [...] {{he said to}} himself, slowly. [...] "Poppy Tyrell! I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> skipper {{has never}} {{mentioned}} her. I wonder why she took his arm. I wonder whether she knows that he’s engaged to be married." ...|$|E
60|$|Two more shots, {{which caused}} him to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Abenakis were growing so active, and then he {{caught a glimpse of}} a faint spark in the thicket, which at first sight {{appeared}} to him like the glow from an Indian's pipe.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>the</b> Doctor laughed, <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> Captain {{had touched}} {{on such a}} theme, {{and said that he}} couldn't exactly say what he might or might not do if {{circumstances}} were altered.|$|R
60|$|But Mary Erskine did not answer. Mary Bell {{could hear}} the sound of the spinning-wheel in the house, and she <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> spinner could not hear her, when she called so loud.|$|R
60|$|In {{a trifle}} {{more than two}} hours he was at Waterville, <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> stores were not open, no matter how early it was, when such an {{important}} customer as himself came to town.|$|R
60|$|It {{will not}} {{surprise}} {{the reader to}} be told that Benjy felt hungry as well as tired after these achievements, and this induced him to look anxiously for Leo, and to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> smoke of Oblooria's cooking-lamp was not to be seen anywhere.|$|E
60|$|It did {{not occur}} to Ingleby to <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> fact that the {{policeman}} had attempted to drive him off the trail should cause her so much indignation, and when Hetty abruptly asked a question calculated to give a different trend to the subject Leger answered her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> burglar wanted mustard, too," [...] he went on, {{taking a}} mustard-pot from another pocket. [...] "A mustard plaster, I suppose.

50|$|He also <b>wonders</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> {{creator of}} the film wasted his time with this. He points that this creator could instead do {{something}} meaningful, like driving a truck, or do something constructive, like working in shoemaking.|$|R
60|$|The buyer {{looked at}} it for a moment doubtfully, and Philip surmised that he was <b>wondering</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> manager had engaged him. Philip knew that he had not noticed there was {{anything}} the matter with him.|$|R
60|$|Dorothy <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>the</b> animals {{living in}} Foxville did not wear just their own hairy skins, as wild foxes do; when she {{mentioned}} it to King Dox he said they clothed themselves because they were civilized.|$|R
