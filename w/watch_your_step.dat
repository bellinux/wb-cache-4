40|$|One of the {{promises}} behind self-quantification is {{to transform the}} ways in which we live our lives through the collection of numerical evidence about the body and its activity. Although this process may boost self-knowledge, everyday life involves a complex network of relationships with other bodies that exert a significant, sometimes determining, influence on how we act. This complexity is poorly captured by a purely quantitative perspective that is only concerned with individual behaviour. Digital self-quantification data&mdash;such as that generated by wearable activity trackers&mdash;opens new possibilities to transform current unhealthy social practices, like the ones related to sedentary lifestyles. In this work, I explore how interaction designers may design self-quantification systems which support transformative play. I do so by reframing self-quantification data as something to be modulated into perturbations to other human and non-human bodies that participate in existing social practices and establish new couplings between selves. By coupling quantified bodies, a new dynamic of co-evolution through embodied interactions is enabled, which, in turn, affects the elements that realise, perform and reproduce existing social practices. Taking a research-through-design approach, I have studied three designs in everyday contexts of use, drawing from different qualitative methods such as cultural probes, participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Each system puts forward different modulations of self-quantification data, enabling screen-based, tangible and embodied interactions. Firstly, I designed <b>Watch</b> <b>your</b> <b>Steps,</b> a shared, situated display of an individual&rsquo;s number of steps for a collocated group of co-workers. Secondly, I designed Dyna, a meeting table that self-adjusts its height based on a group&rsquo;s levels of activity. Finally, I designed Dataponics: Human&ndash;Vegetal Play, a system in which a quantified plant receives water and light according to someone&rsquo;s walking activity, then plays different music styles according to its moisture level. In these designs, self-quantification couplings were designed to enable play that transforms social practices while preserving players&rsquo; autonomy and individuality. I have also tried (sometimes without success) to avoid both coercion and prescribing limited courses of action. By applying these values, these designs enabled new forms of play which in some cases had transformative power. Based on analysis of these studies, I explore some of the implications of embracing play-inspired design values to enable social change, discussing insights and design tensions when designing self-quantification systems that go beyond the self and the numbers. I also speculate about the future of self-quantification, keeping a critical distance from current self-quantification systems. With this work, I aim to expand our understanding of the transformative possibilities of play in the context of self-quantification and the transformation of social practices...|$|R

[...] "Skipping" [...] is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start.

40|$|This {{paper has}} as {{objective}} {{to give some}} directions on how journalists can regain their ‘lost hero status’. News outlets {{have to deal with}} an audience that lost confident in the news media. This reduced confidence may be explained by a reduced quality of journalism, driven by increased economic pressure, cutbacks in news gathering, and a decreased editorial autonomy. A historical event which is still cited as iconic for the mythical status of journalism is the news coverage about the Watergate affair. More specifically, there are the countless references to the work of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, two journalists who worked for the Washington Post at that time. They received their status as celebrity journalists primarily due to the best seller they have written {{in the course of the}} events, All the president’s men, and even more to the movie with the same title, with Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford as the lead actors. Although the affair lasted from 1972 to 1974, so today forty years ago, it still appeals to the imagination of anyone who thinks of what good journalism ought to be (to give just one example: a movie poster of All the President’s Men sticks to the apartment walls of journalist Katrine Fønsmark in the successful Danish TV series Borgen). Understanding the way of how Woodward and Bernstein dealt with the events might help to ‘upgrade’ the status of journalists today. The research questions are: What lessons can be learned from the way Woodward and Bernstein covered the events forty years ago? Are these practices still useful today, and if not, why not? This would give us a clue whether or not current journalists would still be able to break a story as Watergate. The method consists of a critical reading of the book of the two journalists, a literature review and personal meetings with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein at the University of Texas Austin (that purchased and manages the archives of the two journalists). The paper is structured around ten statements on what a good journalists should do. Afterwards, all statements are refuted one by one. The erroneous statements are: 1. 	Journalists themselves are the greatest source of information (external nonprofessional sources are unreliable) 2. 	To find out the truth, the end justifies the means (and that goes beyond journalistic ethics) 3. 	If one threatens you with a lawsuit, you better <b>watch</b> <b>your</b> <b>steps</b> (you do not have a monopoly on the truth after all) 4. 	Base your story on interviews (and make sure you can quote your interviewees literally) 5. 	Press conferences provide all relevant information, and in addition, try to pick up information from expert sources (after all, they are organized to provide the press with information ready-to-use) 6. 	Postpone a story to a later moment in time makes no sense (your competitors will publish it anyway) 7. 	Make sure that if you bring a story you can also bring the wider picture (if you can’t do so, and the Why? Question remains unanswered, you better keep your mouth) 8. 	Partisan journalism cannot be objective (neutrality is preferred at any time) 9. 	A journalist operates in the shadows, like a fly on the wall (journalists that are in the spotlight make themselves suspicious) 10. 	Make sure that the sources you cite are verifiable (so that there is absolute transparency of sources) status: publishe...|$|R
