He was waiting for orders <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> came in for a commando operation to get Hambleton out. Norris was immediately dispatched to lead an operation to rescue Hambleton. He recruited five Vietnamese Sea Commando frogmen from the Lien Doc Nguoi Nhia (LDNN), Naval Advisory Detachment (NAD) in Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E

25|$|Hayes was a {{computer}} hobbyist, {{and felt that}} modems would be highly compelling to users of the new 8-bit computers that would soon be known as home computers. However, existing modems were simply too expensive and difficult to use or be practical for most users. What was needed was a single modem that could do it all; connect directly to the phone, answer incoming calls, dial numbers to initiate outgoing calls, and hang up <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> was complete.|$|E

25|$|This province, as a British colony, {{fought against}} the French during King George's War. The {{assembly}} was determined to control expenditures for this war and only weak support was given. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> came for New York to help raise an expeditionary force against Louisburg, the New York assembly refused to raise troops and only appropriated a token three thousand pounds. The assembly was opposed to a significant war effort because it would interrupt trade with Quebec and would result in higher taxes. The French raid on Saratoga in 1745 destroyed that settlement, killing and capturing {{more than one hundred}} people. After this attack the assembly was more generous and raised 1,600 men and forty thousand pounds.|$|E

25|$|Butler {{also worked}} {{to secure a}} {{leadership}} position should the militia be deployed. He first offered his services to Governor Andrew in March 1861. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> for militia finally arrived in April, Massachusetts was asked for only three regiments, but Butler managed to have the request expanded to include a brigadier general. He telegraphed Secretary of War Simon Cameron, with whom he was acquainted, suggesting that Cameron issue {{a request for a}} brigadier and general staff from Massachusetts, which soon afterward appeared on Governor Andrew's desk. He then used banking contacts to ensure that loans that would be needed to fund the militia operations would be conditioned on his appointment. Despite Andrew's desire to assign the brigadier position to Ebenezer Peirce, the bank insisted on Butler, and he was sent south to ensure the security of transportation routes to Washington. The nation's capital was threatened with isolation from free states because it was unclear whether Maryland, a slave state, would also secede.|$|E

Jordan attempts to dissuade him from going further over the phone. He responds [...] "It's already done" [...] and hangs up, leaving her distraught. The next day, Jordan sees a television report confirming that Leah has been murdered.

2500|$|In the huddle, the Giants were incredulous <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> came in. [...] "Don't {{give me the}} ball", begged fullback Larry Csonka, {{the former}} Dolphins star. Other players asked Pisarcik to change the play, but he demurred. Gibson had berated him for {{changing}} a play the week before and threatened to have him waived if he ever did so again. Gibson {{did not take the}} time to explain his decision to Pisarcik. As a result, the rest of the offense simply viewed Gibson's call as a power trip. Because he was a second-year starting quarterback who still had not totally proven himself, in the era before free agency, Pisarcik lacked the stature to prevail in this kind of dispute.|$|E
2500|$|Culshaw's [...] "Doctor" [...] has telephoned {{four of the}} [...] "real" [...] Doctors—Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy. This {{prompted}} the bemused (and apparently confused) McCoy to ask the classic question: [...] "Have you been in the pub?" [...] When Culshaw phoned Tom Baker himself and stated that he [...] "was the Doctor", Baker replied, [...] "But {{there must be some}} mistake...I'm the Doctor..." [...] Baker had previously worked with Culshaw and was aware of his impression but not <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> would come, if at all, so his reaction was genuine. On the other hand, McCoy has said that his reaction was faked, as he had been warned immediately before the call took place. (Although, in an unpublished interview with Andrew Lawston, McCoy instead claimed he had just assumed that it was Tom Baker until the producers called afterwards to request permission to use the recorded call) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{panel switch}} {{is an example}} of a power drive system, in that it used 1/16 {{horsepower}} motors to drive the selectors vertically to hunt for the desired connection, and back down again <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> was completed. In contrast, Strowger or crossbar systems used individual electromagnets for operation, and in their case the power available from an electromagnet limits the maximum size of the switch element it can move. [...] With Panel having no such restriction, its dimensions were determined solely by the needs of the switch, and the design of the exchange. The driving electric motor can be made as large as is necessary to move the switch elements. Thus, most calls required only about half as many stages as in earlier systems. Motors used on panel frames were capable of operating on alternating (AC) or direct current (DC), however they could only be started with DC. In the event of an AC power failure the motor would switch to its DC windings, and continue running until AC power was restored.|$|E

5000|$|The SPARC architecture, {{unlike most}} RISC architectures, {{is built on}} {{register}} windows. There are 24 accessible registers in each register window: 8 are the [...] "in" [...] registers (%i0-%i7), 8 are the [...] "local" [...] registers (%l0-%l7), and 8 are the [...] "out" [...] registers (%o0-%o7). The [...] "in" [...] registers are used to pass arguments to <b>the</b> function being <b>called,</b> and any additional arguments need to be pushed onto the stack. However, space is always allocated by <b>the</b> <b>called</b> function to handle a potential register window overflow, local variables, and returning a struct by value. To call a function, one places the arguments for the function to be <b>called</b> in <b>the</b> [...] "out" [...] registers; <b>when</b> <b>the</b> function is <b>called,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "out" [...] registers become the [...] "in" [...] registers and <b>the</b> <b>called</b> function accesses <b>the</b> arguments in its [...] "in" [...] registers. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>called</b> function completes, it places the return value in the first [...] "in" [...] register, which becomes the first [...] "out" [...] register <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>called</b> function returns.|$|R
2500|$|SIP, then Italy's {{national}} telephone company, was exceedingly inefficient {{on numerous}} occasions related with Moro's detainment. In particular, after the assault at via Fani, all the phone communications in the area were inoperative. Other cases included when, on 14 April, journalists of Rome's newspaper Il Messaggero were waiting for {{a phone call from}} the terrorists. The six phone lines in the newspaper's office had been connected to police central but, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> arrived, DIGOS reported that all of them had been cut, with the result that the caller could not be identified. On 15 March 1978, the day before the capture of Moro, SIP had been alerted. However, after Moro had been kidnapped, an inspection of the telephone lines in the area of via Fani showed that they were all out of order. This prevented any possible witness contact with the police before the ambush. The commander of DIGOS during the kidnapping days described SIP as [...] "totally un-cooperative", and stated that [...] "in no occasion did they find the origin of the kidnappers' calls", concluding by noting that Michele Principe, then general director of STET, the company owning SIP, was a member of P2.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of November 26, 1943, the Enterprise {{introduced}} the experiment in the co-operative control of Avengers and Hellcats for night fighting, when the three-plane team from the ship broke up {{a large group of}} land-based bombers attacking Task Group TG 50.2. O'Hare volunteered to lead this mission to conduct the first-ever Navy nighttime fighter attack from an aircraft carrier to intercept a large force of enemy torpedo bombers. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> came to man the fighters, Butch O'Hare was eating. He grabbed up part of his supper in his fist and started running for the ready room. He was dressed in loose marine coveralls. The night fighter unit consisting of 1 VT and 2 VF was catapulted between 17:58 and 18:01. The pilots for this flight were Butch O'Hare and Ensign Warren Andrew [...] "Andy" [...] Skon of VF-2 in F6Fs and the Squadron Commander of VT-6, LCDR John C. Phillips in a TBF1-C. The crew of the TBF torpedo plane consisted of LTJG Hazen B. Rand, a radar specialist and Alvin Kernan, A. B., AOM1/c. The 'Black Panthers', as the night fighters were dubbed, took off before dusk and flew out into the incoming mass of Japanese planes.|$|E
2500|$|Burton {{tried to}} steer a course {{down the middle}} of all the {{competing}} interests. Like a majority in the state, he was strongly sympathetic towards the South, and a strong opponent of abolition, but he opposed Delaware’s possible secession. A delegation led by Mississippi Judge Henry Dickinson came from the Confederacy to attempt to persuade the General Assembly to enact secession, but the suggestion was rejected, and Delaware remained firmly in the Union. Meanwhile factions of armed supporters of both sides gathered arms and trained. Burton asked the groups favoring the South to disarm, but later withdrew the request. At the same time he appointed adjutant general and DuPont company president, Henry du Pont, to lead the state militia. du Pont was more decisive, and saw that when additional arms were secured from the federal government, they were directed toward loyal militia, and that the all-important powder mills of his company were properly protected. Du Pont would end up supplying over half the gunpowder used by the Union armies. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> came for soldiers for the federal army, Burton again compromised by refusing to turn over the Delaware militia, or to pay for bounties, but did encourage enlistment. In fact, support for the Union was so strong that Delaware had a larger number of soldiers per size of population than any other state. This fact prompted U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to remark that “South of the Mason-Dixon line, noble little Delaware led off right from the first.” ...|$|E
