25|$|In 1997 former Tikkun editors accused Lerner of {{publishing}} pseudonymous {{letters to the}} editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory ("Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly <b>what</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us in the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say."), a few were critical ("Have you gone off your rocker?"). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors' names were pseudonyms.|$|E
25|$|The city still {{contains}} {{a number of}} mansions from the colonial era, most {{of which have been}} converted into a number of uses. One of these is the La Casa de la Zacatecana (The Zacatecana House) on Independencia 51, which has been restored as a museum to show <b>what</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these mansions were like. Associated with this house as well as others are stories about love, murder and retribution. Another of these houses is the La Casa de la Marquesa (Marquesa House), which was an opulent residence that now serves as a hotel. The courtyard is in the Mudéjar or Spanish Moorish style, with Moorish arches and pattered walls. This area serves as the hotel's lobby.|$|E
25|$|The {{crisis in}} health and welfare {{services}} in our nation today highlights for NASW <b>what</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us have been stressing for a long time: inherent in the responsibility for leadership in social welfare is responsibility for professional action. They are not disparate aspects of social work but merely two faces {{of the same coin}} to be spent on more and better services for the people who need our help. It is out of our belief in this broad definition of responsibility for social welfare that NASW is taking leadership in the efforts to reorder our nation's priorities and future direction, and is calling on social workers everywhere to do the same.|$|E

500|$|IGN staff rated [...] "The Moth" [...] as the 36th best {{episode in}} all of Lost, explaining, [...] "The moth of the episode's title appears both as a metaphorical and {{physical}} symbol of the struggle to find strength within yourself, as Locke explains to Charlie, and {{to take charge of}} your own life without relying on anyone else to do it for you." [...] In a review focusing solely on [...] "The Moth", Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9/10, writing that the episode [...] "does a great job of utilizing screen time for most the major characters on the show", and that [...] "Locke's analogy of 'The Moth' in comparison to Charlie's situation perfectly encapsulates <b>what</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the characters are going through on the island." [...] In a ranking of all of Losts episodes, Todd VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times placed [...] "The Moth" [...] at number 102, complimenting Monaghan and O'Quinn's acting, but criticizing the storyline for containing [...] "nonsensical drug abuse storytelling." [...] "The Moth", along with [...] "Pilot" [...] and [...] "House of the Rising Sun", won a PRISM Award for Charlie's drug storyline.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the band}} {{recorded}} numerous sides for Victor during this period, {{none of them}} showcases Beiderbecke's most famous solos. Much of Goldkette's money was made through these records, but they were subject—as Eddie King had well understood—to {{the forces of the}} commercial market. As a result, their sound was often [...] "sweeter" [...] than <b>what</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the hot jazz musicians would have preferred. In addition to their sessions with Goldkette, Beiderbecke and his friends recorded under their own names for the Okeh label. For instance, on February 4, 1927, Frank Trumbauer and His Orchestra recorded [...] "Trumbology", [...] "Clarinet Marmalade", and [...] "Singin' the Blues", all three of which featured some of Beiderbecke's best work. Again with Trumbauer, Beiderbecke re-recorded Carmichael's [...] "Riverboat Shuffle" [...] in May and delivered two of his best known solos a few days later on [...] "I'm Coming, Virginia" [...] and [...] "Way Down Yonder in New Orleans". Beiderbecke earned co-writing credit with Trumbauer on [...] "For No Reason at All in C", recorded under the name Tram, Bix and Eddie (in their Three Piece Band). Beiderbecke switched between cornet and piano on that number, and then in September played only piano for his recording of [...] "In A Mist". This was perhaps the most fruitful year of his short career.|$|E

2500|$|In 1886, George {{campaigned for}} mayor of New York City as the {{candidate}} of the United Labor Party, the short-lived political society of the Central Labor Union. [...] He polled second, more than the Republican candidate Theodore Roosevelt. The election was won by Tammany Hall candidate Abram Stevens Hewitt by <b>what</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> George's supporters believed was fraud. In the 1887 New York state elections, George came in a distant third in the election for Secretary of State of New York. The United Labor Party was soon weakened by internal divisions: the management was essentially Georgist, but as a party of organized labor it also included some Marxist members {{who did not want}} to distinguish between land and capital, many Catholic members who were discouraged by the excommunication of Father Edward McGlynn, and many who disagreed with George's free trade policy. George had particular trouble with Terrence V. Powderly, president of the Knights of Labor, a key member of the United Labor coalition. While initially friendly with Powderly, George vigorously opposed the tariff policies which Powderly and many other labor leaders thought vital to the protection of American workers. George's strident criticism of the tariff set him against Powderly and others in the labor movement.|$|E
2500|$|May's public reticence {{during the}} {{referendum}} campaign resulted in tensions with David Cameron and his pro-EU team. Following the referendum and her election as party leader, May signalled {{that she would}} support full withdrawal from the EU and prioritise immigration controls over remaining within the single market, leading some to contrast this with her earlier remarks on the earlier economic arguments. She later {{went on to say}} before the 2017 UK general election that she would be willing to leave the EU without a deal, saying that [...] "no deal is better than a bad deal. We {{have to be prepared to}} walk out". The Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, said it was [...] "disappointing that Theresa May lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of Brexit. More disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge, she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self-harm on the UK economy by pulling Britain out of the single market." [...] Phil Wilson for the 'Open Britain' group said, [...] "It's good to know that privately Theresa May thinks <b>what</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us have been saying publicly for a long time, leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy. Now she is prime minister, Theresa May is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns, starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government's negotiating position." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly stated [...] "The triumphant 'Moment 4 Life,' {{along with}} the album’s two lead singles, all {{showcase}} her knack for melody while boasting lyrics chronicling her struggles–be they professional or intimate ones of love and hurt. All of which are way more poignant than raps about how dope she is." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the song a negative review commenting on Minaj's tone, stating [...] "she sounds bored rigid, which rather makes you wonder where showing off one's musical versatility ends and cravenly softening your sound for the marketplace begins." [...] Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork commented on the songs status on the album and how Minaj was out-shined by its collaborator, stating [...] "Minaj is upstaged by Drake and Kanye West on [...] "Moment 4 Life" [...] and [...] "Blazin'", respectively, but these tracks—plus the Rihanna collaboration [...] "Fly" [...] and the solo ballad [...] "Save Me"—are {{the best examples of}} what Pink Friday is rather than <b>what</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> us wanted it to be." [...] Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine gave the song a negative review on Minaj's part of the song and on the album as a whole, stating [...] "Minaj's deranged wildness could potentially provide a foil for Drake, cutting into his tendency to work slowly and calmly on [...] "Moment 4 Life." [...] Instead, Minaj backs off from an early round of forcefulness, letting Drake dictate the pace of the song. It's this seeming lack of confidence, contradictory to the poise she shows elsewhere, which identifies the problems with Pink Friday, an often wobbly first effort that shows enormous promise." ...|$|E
