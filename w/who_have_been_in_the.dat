25|$|The choir {{consists}} of approximately 45 unchanged and 35 changed voices. The changed voices are, as a rule, former trebles and altos <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> choir {{for at least}} a year. The singers dedicate a considerable amount of their free time to the choir: in addition to rehearsals, there are church services, concerts, concert tours, radio and television appearances as well as CD recordings. A choir camp takes place each year for the purpose of learning repertoire.|$|E
25|$|The lack {{of celebrity}} was symbolised in earlier series by the {{presence}} of a minor, and often somewhat cult, celebrity, locked up in a cage in the dungeon of the Bungalow. In later series, the celebrity would sit in the attic. In both cases they would say nothing and often do nothing. Some people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cage or the attic included Vince Earl, Sarah Greene, John Kettley, Hugo Myatt (as Treguard from Knightmare), Su Pollard, Bodger and Badger, and Peter Simon.|$|E
50|$|Another AGA study <b>was</b> used <b>in</b> {{assessing}} the cultural adaption of Filipinos <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. Navy. Three groups of Filipinos {{were compared to}} similarly composed groups of Americans: those who were newly recruited to the U.S. Navy, those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Navy between 1 and 10 years, and those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Navy from 11 to 25 years. The results indicated that cultural adaptation occurred most in domains such as “Work” and “Service.” Cultural adaptation occurred least in domains such as “Family,” “Friends,” “Society,” “Interpersonal Relations,” and “Religion.” These domains are most influenced by tradition and early socialization. This study also revealed that cultural adaption is also a function {{of time spent in}} the host environment. The change from the first group (new recruits) to the second group (those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Navy 1-10 years) is faster than the change from the second group to the third group (those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Navy 11-25 years).|$|R

50|$|Even {{though it}} was a big victory for DMK and allies, Congress fared poorly in the state {{compared}} to DMK, where cabinet minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> power in Mayiladuturai constituency for 10 years, was defeated and P. Chidambaram, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> power in Sivaganga constituency, for past 25 years, lost according to the first counting, and won during the recount, barely winning his constituency.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, an {{estimated}} 14 {{million people live}} in families in which the head of household or the spouse is in the United States without authorization. Illegal immigrants arriving recently before 2012 tend to be better educated than those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country a decade or more. A quarter of all immigrants who have arrived in recently before 2012 have at least some college education. Nonetheless, illegal immigrants as a group {{tend to be less}} educated than other sections of the U.S. population: 49 percent haven't completed high school, compared with 9 percent of native-born Americans and 25 percent of legal immigrants.|$|E
25|$|Immigrant {{status in}} the United States is a {{predictor}} for breastfeeding adherence. In particular, the Hispanic paradox {{plays a role in}} the high breastfeeding rates observed among Hispanic/Latina women in the United States. Breastfeeding initiation rates among this population are higher for less acculturated immigrants; Hispanic women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States for longer are less likely to breastfeed. This disparity does not depend on age, income level, or education level; more acculturated Hispanics are likely to cite the same reasons for bottle-feeding as native-born white women do. In many cases, the connection that Hispanic women feel to their culture and its values can strongly influence their decision regarding breastfeeding.|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Ernest W. Howard of the Women's Patriotic Committee on National Defense castigated the {{slackness}} of Congress for not {{picking up}} on the bill's perceived dangers: [...] "Those of us <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study and research work of the United Nations, {{we feel that we}} are experts in this ... you as Senators with all the many commitments and the many requirements, are not able to go into all these things." [...] John Kaspar, a White Citizens' Council organizer who had achieved notoriety for starting a race riot in Clinton, Tennessee, declared that [...] "almost one hundred percent of all psychiatric therapy is Jewish and about eighty percent of psychiatrists are Jewish ... one particular race is administering this particular thing." [...] He argued that Jews were nationalists of another country who were attempting to [...] "usurp American nationality".|$|E

500|$|All {{the costumes}} {{in the film}} were {{designed}} by Mona May, who had previously worked on Clueless, The Wedding Singer, and The Haunted Mansion. To create the costumes, May spent one year in pre-production working with animators and her costume department of 20 people, while she contracted with five outside costume shops in Los Angeles and New York City. She {{became involved in the}} project during the time when the animators are designing the faces and bodies of the characters as they had to [...] "translate the costumes from two-dimensional drawings to live-action human proportion". Her goal was to keep the designs [...] "Disneyesque to the core but bring a little bit of fashion in there and humor and make it something new". However, May admitted this was difficult [...] "because they're dealing with iconic Disney characters <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> psyche of the viewing audience for so long".|$|E
2500|$|Legal barriers. Access {{to medical}} care by low-income {{immigrant}} minorities can be hindered by legal barriers to public insurance programs. [...] For example, in the United States federal law bars states from providing Medicaid coverage to immigrants <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country fewer than five years. Another example could be when a non-English speaking person attends a clinic where the receptionist does not speak the person's language. This is mostly seen in Hispanic {{people who do not}} speak English.|$|E
