5|$|As long {{as winter}} food is available, both {{the male and}} female <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{territory}} throughout the year, although occupying different areas. Migrants are more gregarious, travelling in small flocks and feeding in loose groups in the wintering grounds. The flight of migrating birds comprises bursts of rapid wing beats interspersed with level or diving movement, and differs from both the normal fast agile flight of this species and the more dipping action of larger thrushes.|$|E
5|$|Magic in Vagrant Story {{is learned}} {{later in the}} game using Grimoires that are dropped by enemies. Once a Grimoire is used, the magic spell {{associated}} with the Grimoire <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> menu, and players only need to spend magic points (MP) to cast a learned spell. Magic spells {{can be used to}} attack, heal, create status effects, and manipulate Ashley's elemental and enemy affinities. Certain magic spells allow the player to affect multiple targets by using a small sphere positioned within the Battle Mode wire frame. Unlike physical attacks however, magic attacks cannot be chained.|$|E
5|$|Once {{secretory}} proteins are formed, the ER membrane separates {{them from}} the proteins that <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional ER. These vesicles in transit {{to another part of}} the cell are called transport vesicles. An alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of the ER are through lipid transfer proteins at regions called membrane contact sites where the ER becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi or lysosomes.|$|E

50|$|It {{is based}} on the Spanish / French Operación Triunfo / Star Academy format of Endemol, better known <b>in</b> English under <b>the</b> UK title Fame Academy; in Indian terms, it was {{essentially}} a mixture of Indian Idol and Big Brother TV series.

5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at {{between three and}} four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester. Once the female lays eggs she <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nest and continuously incubate them until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching. This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's axis of rotation, it <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E

25|$|In October 2015, Tesla {{announced}} {{the company is}} negotiating with the Chinese government on producing its electric cars domestically.

Elon Musk said production <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S., but if there is sufficient local demand for the Model 3 in China, a factory could be built in the country as soon as a year after the launch of the new model. Production in Europe will also depend on the region's demand for the Model 3.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of benzoic acid from phenylmagnesium bromide and dry ice. Benzoic acid is more soluble in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether, and when shaken with this organic solvent in a separatory funnel, will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aqueous layer, clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as liquid–liquid extraction, is an important technique in synthetic chemistry. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.|$|E

25|$|Specific yield (Sy) {{is also a}} ratio between 0 and 1 (Sy ≤ porosity) and {{indicates}} {{the amount of water}} released due to drainage from lowering the water table in an unconfined aquifer. The value for specific yield is less than the value for porosity because some water <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium even after drainage due to intermolecular forces. Often the porosity or effective porosity is used as an upper bound to the specific yield. Typically Sy is orders of magnitude larger than Ss.|$|E

However, Violet reveals that while she was born in Camelot, her father is from Connecticut, but fell into a portal to Camelot at one point; thus they <b>will</b> <b>remain</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Real World.

25|$|In the 2017 offseason, the Wild {{experienced}} significant roster turnover. Erik Haula {{was lost}} to the Vegas Golden Knights in the expansion draft (along with prospect Alex Tuch).

Minnesota native Matt Cullen was {{signed as a free}} agent, and returned to the Wild to shore up the fourth line (Cullen had previously played in Minnesota from 2010-2013).
