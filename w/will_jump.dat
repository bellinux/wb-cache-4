5|$|On a class trip to Springfield Gorge, Bart {{announces that}} on Saturday, he <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> the gorge on his skateboard. Lisa talks Bart into visiting the {{hospital}} to see Murdock, hoping that the daredevil will {{talk him out of}} the dangerous stunt. Unexpectedly, however, Murdock encourages Bart to continue on his legacy. Bart plans to do it against the wishes of Homer, who insists that it is too dangerous.|$|E
5|$|While some 19th-century {{experiments}} {{suggested that}} the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> out. Indeed, thermoregulation by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for frogs and other ectotherms.|$|E
5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for the}} inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of threats that arise gradually.|$|E

5|$|When eating snails, this rail will hammer at {{the shells}} to extract them. For berries, it <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> high {{to break off}} {{clusters}} of this fruit. After doing this, it will pick off the berries {{one by one and}} eat them. It uses its partially open bill to probe and move aside debris like leaf litter. It is generally wary and secretive, and selfish when mated. This manifests in warning its partner with threat displays to keep it at a distance. Even so, it has occasionally been seen to openly forage in short grass near thickets and in streams or muddy tracks.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E

A woman (Grace Kelly) is seen at a nearby law office, where {{she is about to}} sign the final papers for her divorce. Amid legal formalities, she watches the drama unfold. Moved by the tragic events, she decides to reconcile with her husband.|$|E
25|$|Pennies, healing potions, antidotes and, often, quest {{items and}} weapon {{upgrades}} {{can be found}} in chests throughout the game. Often, chests will simply open when Bilbo touches them, but sometimes, the chests are locked, and Bilbo must pick the lock. This involves a timed minigame in which the player must align a pointer or select a specific target. Some chests will have only one minigame to complete, but chests containing more important items will have more, up to a maximum of eight. If Bilbo misses the pointer/target, the timer <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> forward; if he hits a red pointer or target, the minigame will end immediately. Penalties for failing to open a chest include losing health points or being poisoned. If the player has a skeleton key, they can bypass the minigames and open the chest immediately.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{inspired}} by observing white children {{pretending to be}} ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a freedman and soldier {{who is now a}} captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and lynches him.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of lower}} incomes and the {{domination}} of the Sinclair Spectrum in the UK, almost all British C64 software used cassette tapes. Few cassette C64 programs were released in the US after 1983, and in North America the diskette was the principal method of software distribution. The cartridge slot on the C64 was also mainly a feature used in the computer's first two years {{on the market and}} became rapidly obsolete once the price and reliability of 1541 drives improved. A handful of PAL region games used bank switched cartridges to get around the 16k memory limit. C64 cartridges normally map into $8000 and depending on the ROM size may extend up to $BFFF, in which case they displace the BASIC ROM. A special ID string is checked for on power-up; if found, the kernel <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> to the starting address specified in the ID string. A few early C64 cartridges released in 1982, used the so-called MAX Mode, a leftover feature of the failed MAX Machine. These cartridges map into $F000 rather than $8000 and displace the kernel ROM. If MAX Mode is used, the programmer will have to provide his own code for handling system interrupts. Disk and tape software normally load at the start of BASIC memory ($801) and use a small BASIC stub (e.g. 10 SYS(2064)) to jump {{to the start of the}} program. Although no Commodore 8-bit machine except the C128 can automatically boot from a floppy disk, some software intentionally overwrites certain BASIC vectors in the process of loading so that execution begins automatically rather than requiring the user to type RUN at the BASIC prompt following loading.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{scientific}} sources {{report that}} the alleged phenomenon is not real. In 1995, Professor Douglas Melton, of the Harvard University Biology department, said, [...] "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. If {{you put it in}} cold water, it <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you." [...] Dr. George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the National Museum of Natural History, also rejected the suggestion, saying that [...] "If a frog had a means of getting out, it certainly would get out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure!" [...] he agreed. [...] "Still, it's {{quite likely}} that Webster <b>will</b> get <b>jumping</b> mad {{when he sees}} his fence, though it won't take him many days to split enough rails for a new one." ...|$|R
50|$|Horses <b>will</b> {{generally}} <b>jump</b> log fences quite well, as {{they look}} natural to the animal. It is best when designing and jumping such fences, however, to only ride over obstacles that have a larger log (rather than a thin, stick-like pole) as the horse <b>will</b> respect the <b>jump</b> and {{is more likely to}} jump it cleanly and boldly. Due to the risks, it is especially important to jump log fences in a forward manner with plenty of impulsion and good balance.|$|R
2500|$|VARIATION 1: The {{majority}} of the players have the additional task of memorizing number combinations prior to each jump, while two others (who are not asked to jump) must predict who will or <b>will</b> not <b>jump.</b> (Australia - Season 4) ...|$|R
500|$|Females {{reproduce}} {{once every}} two years. Infants are born with little hair and initially cling to their mother's belly. As they mature, they begin to ride on her back. Following weaning, riding on the back is only tolerated for short durations, particularly when the group is alerted {{to the presence of}} a predator. By one year of age, the juveniles are 70% of their full adult body weight. [...] Infant mortality is high in this species. [...] Upon reaching sexual maturity, males leave their natal group and transfer to neighboring social groups. Observations by researchers and reports from local people indicate that this species <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> to the ground and cross more than [...] of grassland to reach nearby forest patches. [...] This suggests that forest fragmentation may not completely isolate separated populations.|$|E
500|$|In February 2008, Kinsler {{signed a}} five-year deal worth $22 million guaranteed. It <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> to $32 million if the Rangers {{exercise}} their $10 million option for 2013. He received a raise to $500,000 in 2008, and a $1 million signing bonus. The contract went to $3 million in 2009 and $4 million in 2010, and {{will go to}} $6 million in 2011 and $7 million in 2012. If the Rangers choose not to exercise their $10 million option, Kinsler will receive a $500,000 buyout. If he is traded, both the buyout and the option year will increase by $500,000. If the option is exercised, the commitment will have been the largest the Rangers have ever made to a player whom they drafted and developed.

500|$|The episode's cold open {{was filmed}} {{in a water}} tank, using a replica P-51 Mustang plane which had been {{designed}} by the art director. Bowman also needed to direct {{a scene in which}} Gillian Anderson would react to a memory of playing with her sister as a child; the scene involved digitally compositing the children playing into Anderson's footage. Bowman asked Anderson to act towards a tree as though it were her sister, later telling her [...] "I'm going to tell everybody I can that you just did that great reaction to a tree". Bowman also reshot the episode's ending, as originally Duchovny and Lea were to walk past the camera and continue off-screen. Feeling this was not effective, he replaced this with a walking shot which continued straight towards and into the camera, noting that [...] "Nick <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> in front of a truck if he think it will make a scene better".|$|E

500|$|After the war, {{many former}} Nazis fled to South America, {{especially}} to Argentina, {{where they were}} welcomed by Juan Perón's regime. In the 1950s, former Dachau inmate Lothar Hermann discovered that Buenos Aires resident Ricardo Klement was in fact Adolf Eichmann, who had in 1948 obtained false identification and a landing permit for Argentina through an organization directed by Bishop Alois Hudal, an Austrian cleric with Nazi sympathies then residing in Italy. Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960 by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. At his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, he was found guilty {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging. Eichmann was quoted as having stated, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> into my grave laughing, because the fact that I have the death of five million Jews [...] on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction." [...] Franz Stangl, the commandant of Treblinka, also escaped to South America with the assistance of Hudal's network. He was deported to Germany in 1967 and was {{sentenced to life in prison}} in 1970. He died in 1971.|$|E
500|$|The {{complete}} Coleman material, in {{a collection}} edited by James Booth, was finally published in 2002. [...] Booth thought that the material would probably cause [...] "a huge amount of confusion and smoke because the politically correct brigade <b>will</b> <b>jump</b> on it". Anticipating the publication, Emma Hartley and Vanessa Thorpe in The Observer doubted the literary value of the works, citing [...] Motion's [...] view that the stories were [...] "little more than mild pornography" [...] which the mature poet would never have wished to see published. On publication, Booth's collection provoked a particularly hostile reaction from The Guardians critic Jenny Diski, whose review dismissed the Coleman writings as [...] "drivel" [...] and [...] "sad ramblings", unworthy of publication or critical attention, and not even valid pornography: [...] "Not a breast, not a clitoris is seen or mentioned." [...] Unlike serious pornographers, [...] "Larkin sketches a mere outline and then walks away with a snigger". Diski mocks Booth's reverential descriptions of the typescripts [...] "as though they were slivers of the True Cross", and concludes: [...] "Let this be a lesson, at least, to anyone who hasn't got around to chucking out the crap they wrote in their teens and early twenties." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{practice}} a program may not intentionally contain instructions {{to jump to}} a particular register.
