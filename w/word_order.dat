5|$|Quenya {{allows for}} a very {{flexible}} <b>word</b> <b>order</b> {{because it is an}} inflectional language like Latin. Nevertheless, it has <b>word</b> <b>order</b> rules. The usual syntax structure is subject-verb-object. The adjective can be placed before or after the noun that it modifies.|$|E
5|$|English <b>word</b> <b>order</b> {{has moved}} from the Germanic verb-second (V2) <b>word</b> <b>order</b> to being almost {{exclusively}} subject–verb–object (SVO). The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters {{of two or more}} verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as he had hoped to try to open it.|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free <b>word</b> <b>order,</b> to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO <b>word</b> <b>order</b> and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and <b>word</b> <b>order</b> for the expression of complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.|$|E

40|$|We present partial-tree linearization, a {{generalized}} <b>word</b> <b>ordering</b> (i. e. ordering {{a set of}} input words into a grammatical and fluent sentence) task for text-to-text applications. Recent studies of <b>word</b> <b>ordering</b> can be categorized into either abstract <b>word</b> <b>ordering</b> (no input syntax except for POS) or tree linearization (input words {{are associated with a}} full unordered syntax tree). Partial-tree linearization covers the whole spectrum of input between these two extremes. By allowing POS and dependency relations to be associated with any subset of input words, partial-tree linearization is more practical for a dependency-based NLG pipeline, such as transfer-based MT and abstractive text summarization. In addition, a partial-tree linearizer can also perform abstract <b>word</b> <b>ordering</b> and full-tree linearization. Our system achieves the best published results on standard PTB evaluations of these tasks. ...|$|R

5|$|Proto-Mayan {{is thought}} to have had a basic verb–object–subject <b>word</b> <b>order</b> with {{possibilities}} of switching to VSO in certain circumstances, such as complex sentences, sentences where object and subject were of equal animacy and when the subject was definite. Today Yucatecan, Tzotzil and Tojolab'al have a basic fixed VOS <b>word</b> <b>order.</b> Mamean, Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek and one dialect of Chuj have a fixed VSO one. Only Ch'orti' has a basic SVO <b>word</b> <b>order.</b> Other Mayan languages allow both VSO and VOS word orders.|$|E
5|$|Syntax {{refers to}} {{patterns}} for combining {{words and phrases}} to make clauses and sentences. Verbal and nominal inflectional morphology are central to Ottawa syntax, as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns {{to a greater extent}} than in English (which has few inflections, and relies mainly on <b>word</b> <b>order).</b> Preferred word orders in a simple transitive sentence are verb-initial, such as verb–object–subject (VOS) and VSO. While verb-final orders are avoided, all logically possible orders are attested. Ottawa <b>word</b> <b>order</b> displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English, and <b>word</b> <b>order</b> frequently reflects discourse-based distinctions such as topic and focus.|$|E
5|$|Tamil is a {{consistently}} head-final language. The verb {{comes at}} the end of the clause, with a typical <b>word</b> <b>order</b> of subject–object–verb (SOV). However, <b>word</b> <b>order</b> in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.|$|E

The seven parameters, `adverb and verb' and others, have a strong dependence on the `noun and adposition'. Japanese as well as Korean, Tamil and several other languages {{seem to have a}} stable structure of <b>word</b> <b>ordering</b> rules, as well as Thai and other languages which have the opposite <b>word</b> <b>ordering</b> rules to Japanese.

5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic <b>word</b> <b>order,</b> but like German, it utilizes verb-second <b>word</b> <b>order</b> in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial phrases and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E
5|$|Michel Launey {{argues that}} Classical Nahuatl had a verb-initial basic <b>word</b> <b>order</b> with {{extensive}} freedom for variation, {{which was then}} used to encode pragmatic functions such as focus and topicality. The same has been argued for some contemporary varieties.|$|E

5|$|ASL signs have {{a number}} of phonemic components, {{including}} movement of the face and torso as well as the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime, but iconicity does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL <b>word</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian was a {{synthetic}} language, {{but it became}} more analytic later on. Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes. There was a change from the older verb–subject–object <b>word</b> <b>order</b> to subject–verb–object. The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet. Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic.|$|E

30|$|Sociolinguistics {{studies have}} shown that age can play a {{significant}} role in modulating the use of alternative syntactic structures in a language. In addition, experimental studies have demonstrated that the processing of non-canonical <b>word</b> <b>orders</b> could be more challenging for older adults. As optional structures with non-canonical <b>word</b> <b>orders</b> in Chinese, SOV and OSV might be subject to age-related changes. However, little work has been done to investigate whether the use or perception of SOV and OSV could change with age. By comparing the acceptability in the younger adults and the older adults, we were able to detect the possible differences in their subjective perception of the well-formedness of these <b>word</b> <b>orders.</b>|$|R
5|$|Khmer is {{primarily}} an analytic, isolating language. There are no inflections, conjugations or case endings. Instead, particles and auxiliary words {{are used to}} indicate grammatical relationships. General <b>word</b> <b>order</b> is subject–verb–object, and modifiers follow the word they modify. Classifiers appear after numbers when used to count nouns, though not always so consistently as in languages like Chinese. In spoken Khmer, topic-comment structure is common and the perceived social relation between participants determines which sets of vocabulary, such as pronouns and honorifics, are proper.|$|E
5|$|Like other Ojibwe dialects, Ottawa grammar {{includes}} animate and inanimate noun gender, subclasses of verbs {{that are}} dependent upon gender, combinations of prefixes and suffixes that are connected with particular verb subclasses, and complex patterns of word formation. Ottawa distinguishes {{two types of}} third person in sentences: proximate, indicating a noun phrase that is emphasized in the discourse, and obviative, indicating a noun phrase that is less prominent. Ottawa has relatively flexible <b>word</b> <b>order</b> compared with languages such as English.|$|E
5|$|Mongolian has vowel {{harmony and}} a complex syllabic {{structure}} for a Mongolic language that allows clusters {{of up to}} three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. While there is a basic <b>word</b> <b>order,</b> subject–object–predicate, ordering among noun phrases is relatively free, so grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases. There are five voices. Verbs are marked for voice, aspect, tense, and epistemic modality/evidentiality. In sentence linking, a special role is played by converbs.|$|E

5|$|Old English is very {{different}} from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and <b>word</b> <b>order</b> was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb endings (I have, he has), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.|$|E
5|$|Some {{linguists}} {{have argued}} that Nahuatl displays the properties of a non-configurational language, meaning that <b>word</b> <b>order</b> in Nahuatl is basically free. Nahuatl allows all possible orderings of the three basic sentence constituents. It is prolifically a pro-drop language: it allows sentences with omission of all noun phrases or independent pronouns, not just of noun phrases or pronouns whose function is the sentence subject. In most varieties independent pronouns are used only for emphasis. It allows certain kinds of syntactically discontinuous expressions.|$|E
5|$|The basic <b>word</b> <b>order</b> is subject–object–verb, like Latin and Japanese. Like other Niger–Congo languages, {{it has a}} noun class system, with nouns {{classified}} {{according to}} five different classes, which also affects pronouns, adjectives and copulas. The phonology features {{a distinction between the}} length of vowels and whether they are oral or nasal (as in French or Portuguese). There are also three distinct tones, a feature shared with the other Senufo languages. Nafaanra grammar features both tense and aspect which are marked with particles. Numbers are mainly formed by adding cardinal numbers to the number 5 and by multiplying the numbers 10, 20 and 100.|$|E
