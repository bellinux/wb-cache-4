5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E
5|$|Brundage {{took the}} {{position}} that as the Germans had reported nondiscrimination to the IOC, and the IOC had accepted that report, US Olympic authorities were bound by that determination. Nevertheless, it became increasingly apparent that with the Nazi actions, no Jew was likely to secure {{a place on the}} German team. Brundage stated on this issue that as only 12Jews had ever represented Germany in the Olympics, it <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> be surprising if none did in 1936.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and held back from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> have benefited from advancing straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out of the woods and charged at Severus' division, only to be routed by Severus' crack troops.|$|E

He said it gave ’im great {{pleasure}} to take the teapot and the money, and the more pleasure because ’e felt that ’e had earned ’em. He said that if ’e told ’em all ’e’d done to make sure o’ the prize they’d be surprised. He said that ’e’d been like Ralph Thomson’s pig, up early and late.|$|R

25|$|De Landa {{provides}} the most comprehensive account of calendar festivals and rituals (chapters 34-40), but in none of these regular events is human sacrifice mentioned, which must mean his Maya informants were unaware of any instances since the cleric <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> have suppressed such information.|$|E
25|$|We can {{construct}} {{a story of}} backdoor illicit liaisons and front door respectability from these fragments and others— Rydberg <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> be the first, if it were true— but he never spoke openly about his private life at any time, and our best guess would still be guesswork.|$|E
25|$|Sidney's {{reputation}} {{suffered a}} blow when Sir John Dalrymple published his Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland in 1771, which exposed {{him as a}} pensioner of Louis XIV. Dalrymple, who had greatly admired Sidney, wrote that he <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> feel more shame if he had seen his own son run away from a battle.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed, the Lixos {{can be identified}} as the Draa (28°45’N). The Draa is the largest river in the area, and marks the southernmost limit of cultivable land. This well corresponds to Hanno's account. Certainly the area of Herne was known to the Carthaginians because they <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> have sent a colony to an unknown place.|$|E
25|$|In the {{big picture}} the fight would not mean much - Denmark had already lost the war, and a {{possible}} victory <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> have altered this. Generally {{it is said that}} an attacker at the start should have a strength superiority on a factor of three; Here were the Danes not even twice so many as the defending. But yet different causes come from analysing supplementary causes of the Danish defeat.|$|E
25|$|Chelmsford {{realised}} that {{he would}} need to account to the government and to history for the disaster. He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as {{it was meant to be}} temporary.|$|E

60|$|They went on abusing Sam till he {{got sick}} and tired of it, and arter telling 'em wot he thought of 'em he slammed the door and went out and spent the evening by 'imself. He <b>would</b> <b>'ardly</b> speak to them next day, but arter tea he brightened up a bit and they went off {{together}} as if nothing 'ad happened, and the fust thing they saw as they turned out of their street was Sam's nevy coming along smiling till it made their faces ache to look at him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It <b>would</b> be <b>hardly</b> {{reasonable}} {{for me to}} do so,' he answered, 'seeing that this plot was hatched in Paris, and that you only had your orders a few hours ago.' ...|$|R
25|$|In Chee Siok Chin v. Attorney-General (2006), {{counsel for}} the {{applicants}} alleged that the judge was guilty of actual bias and requested that she recuse herself. The judge rejected the application as she found the supporting grounds flimsy, and felt that a fair-minded and reasonable observer <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> conclude {{that she would not}} be able to make an objective and impartial decision of the matters placed before her as another judge would.|$|E
25|$|It is unclear, though, how John {{might have}} {{had access to the}} works of the Rhineland mystics. These works were only {{translated}} into Latin {{in the second half of}} the sixteenth century. This means that copies <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> have been easily available for John. In addition, if it is acknowledged that an influence on John was Francisco de Osuna (who clearly cannot have read the Rhineland mystics since they were not known in Spain in the 1520s), then another problem is raised.|$|E
25|$|Since 1959, {{a second}} enigmatic group of ancient sea {{reptiles}} is known, the Hupehsuchia. Like the Ichthyopterygia, the Hupehsuchia have a pointed snout and show polydactyly, {{the possession of}} more than five fingers or toes. Their limbs more resemble those of land animals, making them appear as a transitional form between these and ichthyosaurs. Initially, this possibility was largely neglected because the Hupehsuchia have a fundamentally different form of propulsion, with an extremely stiffened trunk. The similarities were explained as a case of convergent evolution. Furthermore, the descent of the Hupehsuchia is no less obscure, meaning a possible close relationship <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> clarify the general evolutionary position of the ichthyosaurs.|$|E
60|$|Glancing at {{the girl}} who stood {{listening}} but {{with no sign of}} interest in her face, I remarked that her daughter <b>would</b> perhaps <b>hardly</b> think the journey had been worth taking.|$|R

25|$|Undergraduates at {{many older}} {{universities}} also wear gowns; {{the most common}} essentially a smaller knee-length version of the BA gown, or the Oxford Commoners gown which is sleeveless lay type gown and has two streamers at the back at Oxford. At Cambridge, most colleges have their own distinctive design of gown. This {{is not the case}} at the Ancient Scottish universities, such as the University of St Andrews, where the undergraduate gown is scarlet and typically features a velveteen collar. Undergraduate gowns are seldom worn (even in institutions that prescribe them) nowadays except in the older universities. Most new universities do not prescribe them since academic dress has fallen out of daily use so students <b>would</b> <b>hardly,</b> if ever, wear them.|$|E
25|$|This {{consists}} of an India-rubber contrivance which the female easily adjusts in the vagina before copulation, and which spreads a thin tissue of rubber before {{the mouth of the}} womb so as to prevent the seminal aura from entering. … Conception cannot possibly take place when it is used. The full enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The husband <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> be likely to know that it was being used, unless told by the wife. … It places conception entirely {{under the control of the}} wife, to whom it naturally belongs; for it is for her to say at what time and under what circumstances, she will become the mother, and the moral, religious, and physical instructress of offspring.|$|E
25|$|The {{foregoing}} examples {{present the}} Salticidae as textbook examples of active hunters; they <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> {{seem likely to}} build webs other than those used in reproductive activities, and in fact, most species really do not build webs to catch prey. However, exceptions occur, though even those that do build capture webs generally also go hunting like other salticids. Some Portia species, for example, spin capture webs that are functional, though not as impressive as some orb webs of the Araneidae; Portia webs are of an unusual funnel shape and apparently adapted to the capture of other spiders. Spartaeus species, on the other hand, largely capture moths in their webs. In their review of the ethology of Salticidae, Richman and Jackson speculate on whether such web building is {{a relic of the}} evolution of this family from web-building ancestors.|$|E

6000|$|Tattooing is a gift," [...] {{said the}} night-watchman, firmly. [...] "It ’as to be a gift, {{as you can}} well see. A man ’as to know wot ’e is going to tattoo an’ ’ow to do it; there’s no rubbing out or altering. It’s a gift, an’ it can’t be learnt. I knew a man once as used to tattoo a cabin-boy all over every v’y’gc trying to learn. ’E was a slow, {{painstaking}} sort o’ man, and the langwidge those boys used to use while ’e was at work <b>would</b> <b>’ardly</b> be believed, but ’e ’ad to give up trying arter about fifteen years and take to crochet-work instead.|$|R
25|$|The {{cabinets}} of the Netherlands and Belgium {{are excellent}} models of design. These {{pieces of furniture}} were usually arranged in two storeys with a fine moulded and carved cornice, mid division and plinth. The pilasters at the sides, and small raised panels carved only on the projecting part, would compose a very harmonious whole. A proportion of the French cabinets are decorated with caryatids not carved in the best taste, and, like other French woodwork of this period, are sometimes overloaded with sculpture. The doors of St Maclou, Rouen, fine as they are, <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> to-day be held up as models for imitation. A noteworthy set of doors belong to the Oudenaarde Town Hall. The central door contains twelve and that on either side eight panels, {{each of which is}} carved with Renaissance foliage surrounding an unobtrusive figure. In the Palais de Justice we see that great scheme of decoration which takes up the whole of the fireplace end of the hall. Five large figures carved in the round are surrounded by small ones and with foliage and coats of arms.|$|E

500|$|In season four, Grissom's true {{feelings}} are revealed in [...] "Butterflied", an episode that centers entirely around him discovering his sentiments for Sara. It {{was then that}} he admitted {{not being able to}} risk his career to be with her. In season four, Sara apparently develops a drinking problem, which Grissom acknowledges on the season finale; after this, they <b>would</b> <b>hardly</b> see each other, and Grissom becomes interested in detective Sofia Curtis.|$|E

60|$|The {{next thing}} was {{to take her to}} Poissy to request her {{dismissal}} from the Queen, without which it <b>would</b> be <b>hardly</b> decorous to depart, though in point of fact, in the present state of affairs, as Noemi said, there was nothing to prevent it.|$|R
