50|$|OFII traces {{its roots}} back to 1990 {{when a group}} of US {{subsidiaries}} of Foreign-Owned Corporations worked together to fight a tax in California on global profits. In 1994, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of California against Barclays Bank, a foreign based multinational corporation by a vote of 7-2 (and by a vote of 9-0 against Colgate-Palmolive, a US-based multinational corporation) - sanctioning a state's right to tax the worldwide profits of a multinational corporation via unitary <b>worldwide</b> <b>combined</b> <b>reporting</b> and formulary apportionment. The original group included Nestle, Sony, Unilever and four other non-US-based corporations. Its current President and CEO is Nancy McLernon, formerly with Citizens for a Sound Economy (later renamed Freedom Works) and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation (later renamed Americans for Prosperity) established by David and Charles Koch, of Koch Industries.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} corporate business is increasingly conducted on a national and international basis, it is the intent of the general assembly to adopt a unitary combined system of income tax reporting for corporations, and {{as an integral part of}} this proposal, to lower the corporate income tax rates. Vermont's separate accounting system is inadequate to measure accurately the income of a corporation with non-Vermont affiliates and creates tax disadvantages for Vermont corporations which compete with multistate and multinational corporations doing business in Vermont. It is the intent of the general assembly, in adopting a unitary combined reporting system, to put all corporations doing business in Vermont on an equal income tax footing, and with the revenue from the expanded and more accurate tax base, to lower Vermont's corporate income tax rates.The enabling statute, however, excludes [...] "overseas business organizations" [...] from the taxable combined group so water's edge instead of <b>worldwide</b> <b>combined</b> <b>reporting</b> is adopted. Therefore, purely domestic businesses (i.e. national multi-state corporations) are subject to tax on 100% of their taxable profits, U.S. based multinational corporations are subject to tax on 100% of their reported U.S. profits plus foreign profits via repatriated dividends from foreign subsidiaries (if and when repatriated), and foreign based multinational corporations are subject to tax on 100% of their U.S. subsidiaries' reported U.S.profits. As a result, under water's edge combined reporting, separate accounting is only ignored for purely domestic businesses but retained for multinational corporations. Per the 2003-2004 Biennial Report of the Vermont Commissioner of Taxes, the adoption of unitary combined reporting [...] "will diminish opportunities for certain aggressive tax management strategies that were available to multi-state corporations and will help create a level playing field with respect to Vermont-based corporations." [...] Therefore, under water's edge, U.S. based and foreign-based multinationals have the ability to shift U.S. profits to foreign subsidiaries and avoid federal and state income taxes. Profits shifted out of the U.S. would be taxed only if and when they are repatriated as foreign dividends to a U.S. based multinational. Most foreign countries do not tax foreign dividends received by multinationals based in their countries so profits shifted out of the U.S. by U.S. subsidiaries owned by foreign based multinationals and later repatriated to the foreign parent are usually not taxed.|$|E
40|$|From an {{international}} perspective, formulary apportionment {{has traditionally been}} viewed {{as little more than}} transfer pricing’s “poor relation” as a division-of-income methodology. It receives only grudging recognition as a method of attributing the profits to a permanent establishment under Article 7 of the OECD Model Tax Convention; it receives no mention at all in Article 9 as a method for distributing the profits of associated enterprises among the contracting states in which they conduct their activities; and it was assailed by the international business community and by the EU Member States as out of step with internationally excepted norms in the litigation in the United States over the constitutionality of the application of California’s <b>worldwide</b> <b>combined</b> <b>reporting</b> regime to multinational enterprises. With the European Commission’s proposal for the use of formulary apportionment as a means of dividing the consolidated corporate tax base for companies’ EU-wide activities among the Member States, formulary apportionment may have acquired a new respectability in the international tax arena. There are important distinctions between the use of formulary apportionment within the framework of a political and economic union like the European Union and its use among countries that are not bound by a common legal framework, just as there are important distinctions between the use of formulary apportionment within a union of sovereign states and its use among sub-national states or provinces in a federal union like the United States or Canada. I will consider these contextual considerations below. This article is part of a symposium devoted to “Income Allocation in the 21 st Century: The End of Transfer Pricing” and discusses the benefits of allocating income based on the formulary apportionment methodology...|$|E
