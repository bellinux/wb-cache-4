25|$|Following their {{successful}} 2–1 aggregate {{victory over}} Real Madrid, Lyon were {{inserted into the}} quarter-finals. The draw was conducted on 19 March and Lyon were drawn to face Ligue 1 rivals and fellow French club Bordeaux. On 30 March 2010, Lyon faced Bordeaux at the Stade de Gerland in {{the first leg of}} the competition. Lyon got on the scoreboard early through a goal through Lisandro López following a blunder from Bordeaux defender Michaël Ciani, which allowed Mathieu Bodmer to recover the ball inside the box and find López in front of goal. Undeterred, Bordeaux quickly leveled with a vital away goal from striker Marouane Chamakh after great service from Yoann Gourcuff. In the 32nd minute, Lyon again took the lead with Michel Bastos scoring following another Bordeaux error, this time from Benoît Trémoulinas who misplayed a Lyon cross, which allowed the ball to land at the feet of Bastos who proceeded to blast a shot past goalkeeper Cédric Carrasso. Midway through the second half, Laurent Blanc's team rallied with the Brazilian Wendel drilling a shot on goal, which went by Hugo Lloris, but went directly off the post. Minutes later, Lyon were awarded a penalty courtesy of a Matthieu Chalmé handball. The penalty was converted by Lisandro to give Lyon a 3–1 lead and the Argentine was later carded in the final minutes of the match, which resulted in him missing the second leg. The 3–1 scoreline remained ensuring Lyon a <b>wonderful</b> <b>opportunity</b> to reach their first ever UEFA Champions League semi-final.|$|E

[...] As the U.S. expanded westward, the need for trade and transportation became a very prominent concern. [...] The area along the U.S.–Mexican border quickly became a highly sought-after property for the United States. As Rachel St. John describes in Line in the Sand: A History of the U.S.-Mexican Border, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California were all incredibly valuable properties at the time. [...] She continues to state that California was particularly beneficial, but in order to get there, the U.S. would also need New Mexico and Arizona. [...] The economic benefits of California were endless. [...] It was very profitable in multiple industries including agriculture, mining, trapping, and trading.

[...] It is likely that he with his wife would very much enjoy coming to stay at least for a time in this beautiful place. He would be among the best people always and have all the rights and liberties that he would care for, and I am sure it would more than pay too. [...] The Clarion River runs through the property, and he could have his bark canoe, go fishing, if permitted, and his duties would be to watch the fires and act as a guide and keep up the trails, etc. I think it would be arranged that he would have a salary, and his wife would get considerable by selling bed work out to the tourists. [...] It was my idea that they could have not only a log house but tepee which they could move at will and there are many beautiful places along the river and in the forests, to camp in the summer.” ...|$|E
