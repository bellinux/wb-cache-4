5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But <b>where</b> <b>does</b> this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E

25|$|The US and Western Europe have strict {{codes of}} ethics and {{regulations}} in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, {{though there is a}} vast difference in the regulatory framework. Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: <b>where</b> <b>does</b> society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man. Legal debate would be {{the next step in the}} process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights. Along with issues regarding the rights of chimera, individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating human-chimera diminishes the dignity of being human.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the more}} {{surprising}} and, perhaps, counterintuitive (from a neo-Darwinian viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology {{is that the}} diversity of body plans and morphology in organisms across many phyla are not necessarily reflected in diversity {{at the level of}} the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: [...] "where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change". So, if the observed morphological novelty between different clades does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by mutation), <b>where</b> <b>does</b> it come from? Novelty may arise by mutation-driven changes in gene regulation.|$|E
500|$|The {{growth of}} lesbian {{feminism}} in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused {{to work with}} gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men. The issues most important to gay men—entrapment and public solicitation—were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized {{as an alternative to}} sharing gay men's issues, especially what Adrienne Rich termed [...] "the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars". Veteran gay activist Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, rationalizing [...] "It's a matter of <b>where</b> <b>does</b> it hurt the most?

500|$|Booker gained {{national}} attention when, on December 28, 2010, a constituent used Twitter {{to ask him}} to send someone to her father's house to shovel his driveway because her elderly father was going to attempt to do it himself.

[...] Other people volunteered, including one person who offered his help on Twitter, and 20 minutes later Booker and some volunteers showed up and shoveled the man's driveway. On April 12, 2012, Booker saved a woman from a house fire, suffering smoke inhalation and second-degree burns on his hands in the process. Newark Fire Chief John Centanni said that Booker's actions possibly saved the woman's life. After Hurricane Sandy destroyed much of the shoreline areas of New Jersey and New York in late October 2012, Booker invited Newarkers without power to eat and sleep in his home. In February 2013, responding to a Twitter post, Booker helped a nervous constituent propose to his girlfriend. Booker rescued a dog from freezing temperatures in January 2013 and another dog that had been abandoned in a cage in July 2013.|$|E

500|$|After a cameo {{appearance}} in A Day at the Beach (1970), {{and a serious}} role later in 1970 as an ageing businessman who seduces Sinéad Cusack in Hoffman, Sellers starred in Roy Boulting's There's a Girl in My Soup opposite Goldie Hawn. According to The Times, the film was a major commercial success and became the seventh most popular film at the British box office in 1970. Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, considers that although Sellers favoured playing romantic roles, he [...] "was always more successful in parts that sent up his own vanities and pretensions, as with the TV presenter and narcissistic lothario [...] he played in There's a Girl in My Soup". The film {{was seen as a}} small revival of his career. However, Sellers's next films, including Rodney Amateau's <b>Where</b> <b>Does</b> It Hurt? (1972) and Peter Medak's Ghost in the Noonday Sun (1974), were again poorly received, and his acting was viewed as frenetic rather than funny. Despite these setbacks, Sellers won the Best Actor award at the 1973 Tehran Film Festival for his tragi-comedic role as a street performer in Anthony Simmons's The Optimists of Nine Elms. Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan believed that the early 1970s were for Sellers [...] "a period of indifference, and it would appear at one time that his career might have come to a conclusion". This was echoed by Sellers's biographer, Peter Evans, who notes that out of nine films in the period, three were never released and five had flopped, while only There's a Girl in My Soup had been a success. In his private life, he had been seeing the twenty-three-year-old model Miranda Quarry. The couple married on 24 August 1970, despite Sellers's private doubts—expressed to his agent, Dennis Selinger—about his decision to re-marry.|$|E
