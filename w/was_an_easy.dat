5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy {{scapegoat}} for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> target for those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify Irish Catholics who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 2008, {{before the}} release of Left 4 Dead, Valve Corporation {{announced}} that it had purchased Turtle Rock {{in an effort to}} expand the company's console market. Gabe Newell, founder and president of Valve Corporation, added that it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> decision for the company to make, as they had high expectations for Left 4 Dead and considered themselves having a long-term relationship with Turtle Rock. After being acquired by Valve, Turtle Rock served as Valve's in-house satellite development team, and was renamed Valve South.|$|E
5|$|Originally it {{was thought}} that the {{temporary}} pawn sacrifice 9...b5 <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> equalizer: after 10.Nxb5 Nxe4?! 11.Bxe4 Re8 Black seemingly regains the sacrificed piece without trouble. But in Alburt–de Firmian, USA ch 1990, White uncorked 12.Ng5! and went on to win: this move was judged the most important theoretical novelty in Volume 50 of Chess Informant. Only later was it discovered that the immediate 10...Re8 is a better way of recovering the pawn, with a complicated game in the offing.|$|E

5|$|Despite their film careers, Orci and Kurtzman {{continued}} to create television series. These included Sleepy Hollow, which they developed alongside Phillip Iscove. They pitched the series {{to a number}} of networks, and it was picked up by Fox. Orci took five years to bring the series Matador to television, with it originating from a conversation with his cousin Andrew. It was created for Robert Rodriguez's El Rey Network, and Rodriguez's one demand of the show was that he could direct the pilot episode. Orci later explained in an interview that it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> decision, and he needed to pretend to consider it.|$|E
5|$|Simeon often {{violated}} {{the peace treaty}} with Byzantium, attacking and conquering Byzantine territory on several occasions, such as in 904, when the Bulgarian raids were used by Arabs led by the Byzantine renegade Leo of Tripoli to undertake a maritime campaign and seize Thessaloniki. After the Arabs plundered the city, it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> target for Bulgaria and the nearby Slavic tribes. In order to dissuade Simeon from capturing the city and populating it with Slavs, Leo VI was forced to make further territorial concessions to the Bulgarians in the modern region of Macedonia. With the treaty of 904, all Slavic-inhabited lands in modern southern Macedonia and southern Albania were ceded to the Bulgarian Empire, with the border line running some 20 kilometres north of Thessaloniki.|$|E
5|$|The next {{trip was}} up to Anchorage, for the Northern Lights Invitational, a three-day, eight-team tournament. The first game <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> win against Akron, in which Summitt played her bench frequently. The semi-final game, against Texas A, was not much more difficult. The Ladies won handily, 105–81, leading {{by as much as}} 25. Texas A's 81 points would end up being the most a team would score on Tennessee that season. The {{championship}} game was against Wisconsin, a team ranked in the top 10, but this ranking did not mean much, as the team ended 1997 with an 87–66 victory. The Meeks were named to the All-Tournament team.|$|E

5|$|Hammond {{was posted}} to a {{training}} {{wing of the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) at Hastings in Sussex before he moved with his unit to Torquay. He had mainly administrative duties, including instructing recruits, for whom he made life hard. He played some games of cricket in 1940 for various teams before being posted to Cairo in December. His responsibilities in Egypt included organising, promoting and playing in cricket matches. Posted there until 1943, {{he was promoted to}} flight lieutenant and then to squadron leader. While Hammond may have helped to raise morale, Cairo <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> posting during the war and he was not involved directly in combat. He also spent much time in South Africa, where he played cricket and was reunited with Sybil Ness-Harvey. At the beginning of 1944, Hammond was posted back to England, where he lectured and drilled cadets. Playing as captain in many one-day cricket matches, he was praised by Wisden for encouraging exciting contests. Others applauded his batting, including his hitting of many sixes, fitting the games' relaxed atmosphere. In December 1944, Hammond, suffering from fibrositis, was discharged from the RAFVR on health grounds and returned to work at Marsham Tyres. Once the war ended in Europe in May 1945, several first-class matches were organised. Hammond played in six, scoring 592 runs at an average of 59.20 with two centuries. In a match for an England team against the Dominions at Lord's, he made a century in each innings, becoming the first man to do this seven times.|$|E
25|$|Odom {{was indicted}} by an East Baton Rouge Parish {{grand jury in}} 2002 on twenty-one charges, {{including}} bribery, extortion, and theft. He was acquitted, ran again for a seventh term in the 2003 nonpartisan blanket primary and <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> winner.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 National Championship Game {{proved to}} be a {{coronation}} for the Connecticut Huskies as they handled Paul Hewitt's Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Emeka Okafor led Connecticut with 24 points and <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> choice for Most Outstanding Player of the tournament. Guard Ben Gordon added 21 points to Connecticut's cause. The victory gave Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun his second National Championship (1999).|$|E

25|$|In January 1950 a Sicilian carabiniere, Giovanni Lo Bianco, coerced Giuliano's treasurer, Benedetto Minasola, into betraying the bandit. Minasola fed {{the police}} band members {{one at a}} time until April when Giuliano had no more active operatives. Minasola was then able to persuade Aspanu Pisciotta to betray his closest friend—Pisciotta <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> target, having long doubted Verdiani's plot to get himself and Giuliano out of the country.|$|E
25|$|History {{has better}} words {{to speak for}} Misamis Occidental. Its {{principal}} city was originally populated by the Subanon, a cultural group that once roamed the seas in great number; the province <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> prey to the marauding sea pirates of Lanao whose habit was to stage lightning forays along the coastal areas in search of slaves. As the Subanon retreated {{deeper and deeper into}} the interior, the coastal areas became home to inhabitants from Bukidnon who were steadily followed by settlers from nearby Cebu and Bohol.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Papa Roach {{released}} {{their first}} EP titled Potatoes for Christmas. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown, as Buckner was spending {{the year in}} Seattle studying art. In 1995, they released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled Caca Bonita. By this time Buckner was back. In 1996, they replaced original bass guitarist Will James, who had become heavily involved in a church summer camp, with Tobin Esperance, because James' absence would limit the band's summer practicing and touring. As Esperance {{had been with the}} band as a roadie for a while, the transition <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> one.|$|E

25|$|Written by two Americans with {{a strong}} country-western lyrical theme, the song was first {{released}} in Europe, where it {{has become much more}} popular than in the composers' native country, with a big-band/orchestral pop arrangement sung by Tony Christie. Christie's version was a major hit in Europe and a modest success in his native United Kingdom upon its release, then became even more popular in the mid-2000s when the song was reissued. As Christie's version failed to make a major impact in the U.S., Sedaka released his own recording of the song in 1977, which narrowly missed the top 40 but <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> listening hit in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Jo-Wilfried's Rogers Cup {{campaign}} {{was an extremely}} short affair with a second-round loss to fellow Frenchman Jérémy Chardy. He also crashed out {{in the second round}} of the 2012 US Open, after a defeat by No. 52 Martin Kližan. After a short break for recovery, Jo was back in France for the 2012 Moselle Open. Tsonga rolled to a semifinal berth with Russian Nikolay Davydenko. The Frenchman had never beaten Davydenko in two previous attempts, but made sure that run was not extended to three with a tight three-set win. The final <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> two-set win over Andreas Seppi, Tsonga's ninth ATP career title.|$|E
25|$|In July 1810, {{shortly before}} {{completion}} of the lines, Fletcher left the fortifications to serve alongside Wellington once more in the field, and was thus at the Battle of Buçaco (27 September 1810) where he again distinguished himself and was mentioned in dispatches. Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Masséna, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> one. Wellington's superiors were equally surprised {{to hear about the}} defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Masséna initially retreated to Santarém but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned any thoughts of another attempt and headed north.|$|E

25|$|From 3 February, the Allies were shelled by Japanese {{artillery}} and air attacks on Singapore intensified {{over the next}} five days. The {{artillery and}} air bombardment strengthened, severely disrupting communications between Allied units and their commanders and affecting preparations for the defence of the island. From aerial reconnaissance, scouts, infiltrators and high ground across the straits, such as at Istana Bukit Serene and the Sultan of Johor's palace, the Japanese commander—General Tomoyuki Yamashita—and his staff gained excellent knowledge of the Allied positions. Yamashita and his officers stationed themselves at Istana Bukit Serene and the Johor state secretariat building—the Sultan Ibrahim Building—to plan for the invasion of Singapore. Although advised by his top military personnel that Istana Bukit Serene <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> target, Yamashita was confident that the British Army would not attack the palace because it belonged to the Sultan of Johor. Yamashita's prediction was correct; despite being observed by Australian artillery, permission to engage the palace was denied by their commanding general, Bennett.|$|E
500|$|Within the novel, Gary makes [...] "scathing {{attacks on}} self-aggrandising Jewish pro-black {{sentiment}} and self-serving celebrity campaigners", while making explicit attacks against Marlon Brando and Seberg for {{their involvement in}} civil rights movements and the latter's involvement with the Black Panthers organization. In an interview about the novel, Gary states that as a [...] "typical American idealist" [...] she <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> mark for people seeking money for causes, and he depicts this in the novel by having her frequently appearing in activist events writing checks. After her death, he called the novel the [...] "story of her crusade".|$|E
