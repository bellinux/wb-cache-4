5|$|A {{week before}} her death, Mary <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> papers, weeding out some which were burnt, but her journal survives, as do her letters to William and to Frances Apsley. The Jacobites lambasted her, but the {{assessment}} of her character that came down to posterity was largely the vision of Mary as a dutiful, submissive wife, who assumed power reluctantly, exercised it with considerable ability when necessary, and willingly deferred it to her husband.|$|E

Two other girls were also wounded in the shooting: Kainat Riaz and Shazia Ramzan, both of whom were stable enough to speak to reporters and provide details of the attack.|$|E
2500|$|The result {{brought the}} end of Fanny Cradock's {{television}} career. Mrs Troake <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> menu of seafood cocktail, duckling with bramble sauce and coffee cream dessert. Cradock, grimacing and acting as if {{on the verge of}} retching, claimed not to know what a bramble was, told Mrs Troake that her menu was too rich, and, though accepting that the dessert was delicious, insisted that it was not suitable. [...] "You're among professionals now, dear", she declared. She scorned Mrs Troake's use of an ingredient for being too [...] "English", and insisted that the English have never had their own cuisine, and that [...] "even the good old Yorkshire pudding comes from Burgundy".|$|E
2500|$|This characterization, however, was contested {{by many of}} Lee's friends. Marja Mills, {{author of}} The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee, a friend and former neighbor, painted a very {{different}} picture. In her piece for The Washington Post, [...] "The Harper Lee I knew", she quoted AliceLee's sister, whom she described as [...] "gatekeeper, advisor, protector" [...] for most of Lee's adult lifeas saying, [...] "Poor Nelle Harper can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence." [...] She made note that Watchman was announced just {{two and a half}} months after Alice's death and that all correspondence to and from Lee <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> new attorney. She described Lee as [...] "in a wheelchair in an assisted living center, nearly deaf and blind, with a uniformed guard posted at the door" [...] and her visitors [...] "restricted to those on an approved list." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blannbekin {{described}} {{herself as}} continually beset with visions throughout the day, which she described as imber lacrimarum, or a [...] "rain of tears" [...] from God. Many of these visions involved bright lights, {{and in one}} she described being [...] "so filled with light within that she could gaze at herself." [...] As with the foreskin occasion, many of her visions involved touch, such as being kissed on the cheeks by the Lamb of God. While eating the Eucharist, Blannbekin claimed to taste Christ; on one occasion, a sexually immoral priest could not find his Eucharist, which Blannbekin claimed to have felt in her own mouth. Similarly, she described drinking a [...] "refreshing spiritual drink" [...] from the spear wound of Jesus. Supposed visitations from Jesus himself caused an orgastic reaction: [...] "Agnes herself was filled with an excitement in her chest every time that God visited her that was so intense that it <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> body and that it burned as a result, not in a painful but in a most pleasurable manner." ...|$|E

60|$|Edith {{turned and}} {{perceived}} Arthur {{for the first}} time. A slight shock <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> sensitive nature, as if some faint prophecy of great storms came {{to her in the}} widening gaze of his dark eyes.|$|E
6000|$|A pang <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>her,</b> {{a sort of}} surprise. Suffer! She {{might wish}} him dead, {{but she did not}} want him to suffer--God knew! And yet, gripped by those hands, she could not say: I am sorry! ...|$|E
60|$|The Red Swede {{staggered}} up, {{rubbed his}} cramped knees, lumbered {{to the wire}} fence, held the strands apart for her. She unconsciously smiled at him as she <b>went</b> <b>through.</b> <b>Her</b> skirt caught on a barb; he carefully freed it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Rudden!' exclaimed Arthurine. 'Why, I only {{sent her}} word that I {{was too busy}} to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> {{accounts}} to-day, and asked her to come to-morrow. That isn't against the laws of the Medes and Persians, is it?' ...|$|R

60|$|A shudder {{seemed to}} <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> entire frame, her very lips turned white and cold, and he, not understanding, timorous, chivalrous and humble, {{thought that she}} was {{repelled}} by his ardour and frightened by a passion to which she was too pure to respond.|$|R
6000|$|But {{she could}} not; {{her head and}} hands were broiling hot, and she was terribly thirsty; when she lifted herself up {{to get a drink}} of water such a pang <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> head that she fell back on the bed groaning, and lay there with beating heart. And strange pains that she did not know <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>her.</b> Then a cold shiver seemed to rise in the very marrow of her bones and run down every artery and vein, {{freezing}} the blood; her skin puckered up, and drawing up her legs she lay huddled together in a heap, the shawl wrapped tightly round her, and her teeth chattering. Shivering, she whispered: ...|$|E
6000|$|A little pang <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> heart, but she retorted, [...] "I {{would n't}} go to Europe to escape it, nor up the Nile. I would stay and fight it where I was." [...] "Stay?" [...] He seemed to have caught {{hopefully}} at the word.|$|E
60|$|His voice {{could be}} so soft and happy-go-lucky, it <b>went</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> veins like an exhilaration. Nevertheless she dreamed of a valley, and wild gardens, and peace.
