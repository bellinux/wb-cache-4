500|$|Samples used on {{the album}} were taken from artists {{as diverse as the}} {{electronic}} duo Suicide and gospel choir the Alabama Sacred Harp Singers. [...] "Internet Connection", one of four bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of the album, was recorded in collaboration with a group of Filipino Verizon workers. M.I.A. described the sound and imagery of the album as capturing a [...] "digital ruckus", adding that [...] "so many of us have become typists and voyeurs". We need a digital moshpit like we've never seen, harder than how people <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> in the punk era. We need that energy, but digitally". [...] M.I.A. herself picked out [...] "Steppin Up", [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Teqkilla" [...] as her favourite tracks on the album. She said that she contemplated using only the sound of drills as the backing for [...] "Steppin Up", but concluded that this was [...] "too experimental" [...] an approach.|$|E
500|$|The Andy Griffith Show [...] is an American {{situation}} comedy which aired on CBS from October 3, 1960, to September 6, 1971, {{with a total}} of 249 half-hour episodes spanning over 8 seasons, first in black and white and then in color, which partially originated from an episode of The Danny Thomas Show. It originally starred Andy Griffith in the role of Andy Taylor, the widowed sheriff of the fictional small community of Mayberry, North Carolina. Other major characters include Andy's inept but well-meaning deputy, who is also his cousin, Barney Fife (Don Knotts); Andy's spinster aunt and housekeeper, [...] "Aunt" [...] Bee Taylor (Frances Bavier), and Andy's precocious young son, Opie (Ron Howard). Eccentric townspeople and temperamental girlfriends complete the cast. Regarding the tone of the show, Griffith said that despite a contemporary setting, the show evoked nostalgia, stating in a Today Show interview: [...] "Well, though we never said it, and though it was shot in the '60s, it had a feeling of the '30s. It was, when we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> of a time gone by." ...|$|E

500|$|For Stampede, {{the members}} went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a {{recording}} process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, {{surrounded by the}} obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> at my house solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," [...] Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. [...] "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is {{the main thing that}} I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," [...] Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed {{for the creation of a}} big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. [...] "We slept there, so if one of us just came up with an idea, we could jump on it," [...] guitarist Tom Maxwell said.|$|E
500|$|The Feminist Improvising Group (FIG) {{was founded}} in London in 1977 by Scottish vocalist Maggie Nicols from Centipede and English bassoonist/composer Lindsay Cooper from Henry Cow. Nicols and Cooper first {{discussed}} {{the idea of an}} all-women improvising group at a musician's union meeting. Cooper said, [...] "we agreed that improvisation had become very important and no women <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> And suddenly we thought, well let's do it! Let's get women together and do it ourselves!" [...] While Nicols and Cooper had both performed frequently with men, they had little experience performing with other women, but their involvement in class politics as well as feminist and lesbian activism prompted them to pursue this project. The other members of the five-piece ensemble were cellist/bassist Georgie Born, also from Henry Cow, vocalist/pianist Cathy Williams from the British duo Rag Doll, and trumpeter Corinne Liensol from British feminist rock band Jam Today. They had originally intended to call themselves the [...] "Women's Improvising Group", but at their first engagement they discovered that the organisers had billed them as the [...] "Feminist Improvising Group". Nicols said that the [...] "political statement of the band's name never even came from us! But we just thought, 'OK, they've called us feminist, we'll work with that.|$|E
500|$|Bostock held Cobby {{responsible}} for the [...] "dangerously low level" [...] of morale in 1st TAF, but also noted [...] "it is clear {{that he has been}} badly served by his senior staff". In the event, Jones transferred not only Cobby but also his staff officers, Group Captains Gibson and Simms, and Air Commodore Frederick Scherger took over command on 10May. Cobby's departure was greeted with relief by Australian Army commanders, who were frustrated by the poor working relationship between 1st TAF and the Army units at Tarakan. Cobby defended his leadership of 1st TAF at the subsequent inquiry before Judge John Vincent Barry. During his testimony he declared that while his officers [...] "wished to do more in the war than they <b>were</b> <b>doing...</b> <b>it</b> was not within the power of 1st T.A.F. to give them that more important or more interesting work". He believed that his forces had played a significant part in making safe General MacArthur's flank during the Philippines Campaign. [...] Barry nevertheless found that Cobby had [...] "failed to maintain proper control over his command", and that his removal as 1st TAF commander was justified. Air Force historian Alan Stephens later described it as [...] "a personal and institutional tragedy that a genuinely great figure in RAAF history had to end his career in such circumstances". Similarly, The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History contends that Cobby's [...] "gallant service flying career... became another victim of the weaknesses and feuding within the RAAF's senior leadership during the Pacific War". Stephens summed up Cobby's military career by saying [...] "No Australian airman's experience better illustrates the tensions between 'command', 'leadership' and 'heroism'", concluding that [...] "the qualities that make a hero do not easily translate into those needed by a commander, although they are likely to engender leadership".|$|E

2500|$|Their {{experiences}} at the Reading and Leeds festivals was very negative: the band got bottled by the angry crowd.

2500|$|In 1964, {{director}} Yuri Lyubimov invited Vysotsky to {{join the}} newly created Taganka Theatre. [...] "'I've written some songs of my own. Won't you listen?' – he asked. I agreed to listen to just one of them, expecting our meeting to last {{for no more than}} five minutes. Instead I ended up listening to him for an entire 1.5 hours," [...] Lyubimov remembered years later of this first audition. On 19 September 1964, Vysotsky debuted in Bertholt Brecht's The Good Person of Szechwan as the Second God (not to count two minor roles). A month later he came on stage as a dragoon captain (Bela's father) in Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time. It was in Taganka that Vysotsky started to sing on stage; the War theme becoming prominent in his musical repertoire. In 1965 Vysotsky appeared in the experimental Poet and Theater (Поэт и Театр, February) show, based on Andrey Voznesensky's work and then Ten Days that Shook the World (after John Reed's book, April) and was commissioned by Lyubimov to write songs exclusively for Taganka's new World War II play. The Dead and the Living (Павшие и Живые), premiered in October 1965, featured Vysotsky's [...] "Stars" [...] (Звёзды), [...] "The Soldiers of Heeresgruppe Mitte" [...] (Солдаты группы [...] "Центр") and [...] "Penal Battalions" [...] (Штрафные батальоны), the striking examples of a completely new kind of a war song, never heard in his country before. As veteran screenwriter Nikolay Erdman put it (in conversation with Lyubimov), [...] "Professionally, I can well understand how Mayakovsky or Seryozha Yesenin <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> How Volodya Vysotsky does it is totally beyond me." [...] With his songs – in effect, miniature theatrical dramatizations (usually with a protagonist and full of dialogues), Vysotsky instantly achieved such level of credibility that real life former prisoners, war veterans, boxers, footballers refused to believe that the author himself had never served his time in prisons and labor camps, or fought in the War, or been a boxing/football professional. After the second of the two concerts at the Leningrad Molecular Physics institute (that was his actual debut as a solo musical performer) Vysotsky left a note for his fans in a journal which ended with words: [...] "Now that you've heard all these songs, please, don't you make a mistake of mixing me with my characters, I am not like them at all. With love, Vysotsky, 20 April 1965, XX c." [...] Excuses of this kind he had to make throughout his performing career. At least one of Vysotsky's song themes – that of alcoholic abuse – was worryingly autobiographical, though. By the time his breakthrough came in 1967, he'd suffered several physical breakdowns and once was sent (by Taganka's boss) to a rehabilitation clinic, a visit he on several occasions repeated since.|$|E
