500|$|In {{a review}} for Carey's 2001 album, Greatest Hits, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine felt {{the album was}} solely a string of Carey's most {{commercial}} and popular hits, however, not her best. Cinquemani complimented Greatest Hits and wrote, [...] "It seems like only yesterday that we were served with the self-congratulatory #1s, a collection of Carey's record-breaking string of chart-toppers, but the 27-track Greatest Hits is the singer's first proper hits compilation." [...] In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "choice cut" [...] rating, indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> time or money; Some (choice cut)s are arbitrarily personal, others inescapably social." [...] His [...] "choice cut" [...] was Fantasy (with O.D.B.) ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Christgau {{labeled the}} song as a [...] "choice cut" [...] (...) , {{signifying}} that it [...] "is a good song on an album that isn't <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> time or money". Alex Miller from NME disapproved, {{claiming that the}} [...] "clueless Fergie possesses Stefani for [...] the woefully oddball 'Yummy'", while Norman Mayers from Prefix opined that it was [...] "bizarre". While comparing the five The Neptunes-produced tracks on the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found it [...] to be [...] "rather embarrassing" [...] and [...] "cloying and crass", rather than [...] "effortless and effervescent". Lucy Davies, writing for BBC Music, {{described it as a}} [...] "bland filler" [...] that [...] "sums her up [...] coquettish, amusing, annoying and hip wiggling in equal measure".|$|E
500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Spencer Owen of Pitchfork {{called the}} album [...] "harmless and pretty... nothing else". Barry Walters, writing in The Village Voice, similarly writes that [...] "there's little on Parachutes that demands attention or punctures the pensive spell, and, unlike Travis's, Coldplay's hooks are slight." [...] In his Consumer Guide column for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau selected [...] "Yellow" [...] and [...] "Don't Panic" [...] as [...] "choice cuts", indicating good songs on [...] "an album that isn't <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> time or money." [...] Setareh Yousefi of Stylus Magazine felt that [...] "the finer moments of Parachutes are blended with some boring sappy songs", with Martin's [...] "powerful voice" [...] ultimately being [...] "in many ways wasted on songs that are alright but not bewildering." ...|$|E

500|$|In a mixed review, Rodney Dugue of The Village Voice {{felt that}} the album [...] "never settles on a sound" [...] and only cited its three Timbaland-produced songs as highlights. Although he found the ballads to be {{improvements}} from Rihanna's previous albums, Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani criticized the lyrics, particularly those written by Justin Timberlake, as an [...] "Achilles' high heel for Rihanna". Alex Macpherson of The Guardian found Rihanna to be [...] "ill-suited" [...] for its dance-pop songs and stated, [...] "The gimmicky samples and pounding beats bury her personality, and the summery reggae of her first two albums is sorely missed." [...] Robert Christgau of MSN Music cited [...] "Umbrella" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> time or money".|$|E
500|$|In a mixed review, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian criticized its [...] "production gloss" [...] {{and said}} that, {{although}} Usher's [...] "fluid delivery" [...] redeems weak tracks, {{there are only}} two [...] "great songs"—"Yeah!" [...] and the title track—and [...] "17 less so." [...] Rolling Stone writer Laura Sinagra said that he [...] "is coming of age, again", but [...] "still doesn't quite cut it as a horny roughneck". Jon Caramanica of Blender viewed that Usher's songwriting [...] "isn't a strength, and his ballads often drown in their own inanity". The Washington Posts Elizabeth Mendez Berry called Confessions [...] "Usher's strongest recording to date" [...] but found the more sexual songs mundane. Robert Christgau from The Village Voice cited [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Bad Girl" [...] as [...] "choice cuts", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> time or money".|$|E
500|$|Music critic Green Baron {{reviewed}} {{the music for}} Sputnikmusic, and said: [...] "Dallas Buyers Club itself was a breathtaking motion picture driven by the extraordinary performances from Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Its accompanying soundtrack, however, is less than satisfying. Filled {{to the brim with}} lifeless, stale indie-rock tracks, the supporting album to one of the year's most gripping films is a complete waste of talent and potential." [...] Baron thought that Dallas Buyers Club was saved by a few excellent songs, which were [...] "Ready to Be Called On", [...] "After the Scripture", and [...] "City of Angels". He said that, [...] "Overall, the Dallas Buyers Club soundtrack is one that really isn't <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> time or money. Aside from three superb songs, the whole album is a collection of drab indie pop/rock that ultimately falls flat due to its lack of memorability." ...|$|E

500|$|Carey {{composed}} the gospel-influenced ballad [...] "Fly Like a Bird" [...] with James Wright. The lyrics {{are in the}} form of a prayer that conveys a message of unconditional love for God. The song features a verbal recording of Carey's pastor, Clarence Keaton, who reads two verses from the Bible. The singer wrote the album's fifth cut [...] "Say Somethin, which features rap verses from Snoop Dogg and was produced by The Neptunes. Vibe writer Dimitri Ehrlich described it as [...] "a musical oddity", and characterized the production as [...] "strange instrumentation, weird melodic shifts, hectic drum patterns and a bed of synths." [...] Lyrically, the protagonist makes sexual advances to a romantic interest with the line [...] "If it's <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> while, do something good to me." [...] When interpreting the lyrics in the female role, Cummings noted [...] "a shy woman who doesn't need to say anything at all to get a man's attention." ...|$|E
500|$|Western critics {{had a few}} complaints, {{but gave}} mostly {{positive}} reviews. The Chicago Tribune called the game [...] "a little slow in spots, but, like Final Fantasy, <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> patience", and a [...] "good quest". The newspaper gave the game ratings of 8 out of 10 and 7 out of 10. German gaming magazine [...] gave the game a score of 78%, and praised it for showing potential for the Game Boy as the first role-playing game on the platform. IGN called The Final Fantasy Legend a [...] "compelling RPG with a complex gameplay system and a solid soundtrack", but complained about the game's difficulty and [...] "dated" [...] graphics. Allgame praised the title on its merits as a role-playing game, but criticized its high difficulty and lack {{of a sense of}} direction. 1UP's Retronauts described its gameplay as a successor to Final Fantasy IIs, though added that the systems involved were not properly refined until its sequel; they further stated that the randomness of the mutant and monster character classes made the game very difficult.|$|E

The song {{has been called a}} one-hit wonder. While speaking favourably of the duo, in 2014 Abby Devora from MTV ranked M2M and the song at number 2 on her list [...] "9 Girl Group One-Hit Wonders You Need To Remember Right Now". Jessica Booth from Gurl.com included the duo and song in her 2012 list [...] "Flashback: 15 Old-School Girl Singers We Miss", calling the song [...] "ridiculously catchy".

500|$|The {{review by}} [...] "Herc" [...] for the website Ain't It Cool News, praised {{the story about}} how Porthos was named and the {{elements}} of sexual tension between Archer and T'Pol. However, he didn't think the Odd Couple type relationship between Archer and Phlox worked {{all the time with}} some misfires amongst the comedic elements. He gave the episode a rating of three out of five, describing it as [...] "actually <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> valuable time". Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for TrekNation, saying that she enjoyed the episode on the whole and enjoyed the characterisation. However, she criticised the non-moving Beagle prop as it made her son think the dog was dead, which was then followed by [...] "what looks like a drowned dog in formaldehyde". Jamahl Epsicokhan reviewed the episode for his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", giving it a score of one out of four. He called it [...] "easily the dumbest concept for an episode of Star Trek since Voyager holodeck was hijacked by the residents of [...] ". He felt that the episode made a mockery out of the characters and that some of the situations they were placed in were just ridiculous.|$|E
500|$|The {{major works}} for voices and {{orchestra}} of the twenty-one years of Elgar's middle period are three large-scale works for soloists, chorus and orchestra: The Dream of Gerontius (1900), and the oratorios The Apostles (1903) and The Kingdom (1906); and two shorter odes, the Coronation Ode (1902) and The Music Makers (1912). The {{first of the}} odes, as a pièce d'occasion, has rarely been revived after its initial success, with the culminating [...] "Land of Hope and Glory". The second is, for Elgar, unusual in that it contains several quotations from his earlier works, as Richard Strauss quoted himself in Ein Heldenleben. The choral works were all successful, although the first, Gerontius, was and remains the best-loved and most performed. On the manuscript Elgar wrote, quoting John Ruskin, [...] "This {{is the best of}} me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another. My life was as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw, and knew; this, if anything of mine, is <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> memory." [...] All three of the large-scale works follow the traditional model with sections for soloists, chorus and both together. Elgar's distinctive orchestration, as well as his melodic inspiration, lifts them to a higher level than most of their British predecessors.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for the Xbox 360 {{version of}} Crash: Mind over Mutant were mixed. Christopher Ewen of GameZone praised the series' {{transition}} into a free-roaming gameplay environment, but {{felt that the}} game was too easy. Matt Casamassina of IGN found the game to be [...] "exactly like its predecessor: a mildly enjoyable beat 'em up romp that's sure to satisfy younger players, but won't provide much that seasoned players haven't already experienced before". Andy Eddy of TeamXbox praised the game's strong voice acting, but noted the uninspired gameplay, which was [...] "not very consistent in its fun generation." [...] Justin Calvert of GameSpot claimed that the game [...] "has too much backtracking and too many camera problems to make it recommendable". Official Xbox Magazine concluded that [...] "there's very little about Mind over Mutant that makes it <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> $50 or the four hours it takes to complete." [...] Dan Pearson of Eurogamer criticized the game's fixed camera, extensive backtracking, useless mission log and dated concepts. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer proclaimed that the game's [...] "unpredictable framerates, extensive backtracking, and the guarantee of one death caused by faulty camera positioning for every platforming segment" [...] made it [...] "a mess of a game, and a new low point for the once-loved marsupial." ...|$|E

500|$|The WiiWare {{version has}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, {{with the central}} criticism being the 1200 Wii Point price tag (US$12, £10), after years of free play. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com commended the graphical update, which [...] "sacrifices none of [...] classic-influenced charm". He also remarked that the Classic Controller and Wii Remote are superior to the keyboard input of the PC original. On the issue of price, he explained that [...] "the prospect of Amaya finally earning {{a little something for}} the hard work he invested in this masterpiece strikes me as satisfyingly poetic" [...] and [...] "absolutely <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> money". John Teti of Eurogamer had similar sentiments, but also noted the technical issues with the remixed music, recommending the original soundtrack. Edge compared the remake to , satisfying both modern tastes with its graphical overhaul and old school fans with the option to switch to the original graphics. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt that Cave Story [...] "belongs on a Nintendo system" [...] and noted gameplay similarities to Blaster Master, in which damage reduces the power of weapons as well. Cave Story was nominated for Game of the Year at the 2010 Nintendo Power Awards, as well as WiiWare Game of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Many praised lyrics such as {{the ones}} in [...] "Look inside America/She's alright", and noting Albarn's [...] "obligatory nod to Beck, [...] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so", reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time—an about-face of their {{attitude}} during the Britpop years. Erlewine wrote that [...] "Blur might be self-consciously eclectic, but Blur are at their best when they are trying to live up to their own pretensions, because of Damon Albarn's exceptional sense of songcraft and the band's knack for detailed arrangements that flesh out the songs to their fullest." [...] Alternative Press called it [...] "a whirl of weird esotericism, precious, precocious and impressively". Robert Christgau of The Village Voice was less enthusiastic and cited only [...] "Song 2" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> time or money". However, there was strong praise from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, who awarded the album four out of four stars. Ed Masley wrote that [...] "you can hear the new infatuation with indie rock stylings all over the latest release, with its clattering sonic collages and transistor radio vocals. At times, it's as though they've forgot that they're British. They are British though. It's what makes this eponymous record their greatest." ...|$|E
500|$|The English version {{released}} {{the following year}} met with a similar response, with Skid of GameFan magazine calling it [...] "far and away the best RPG I have ever played in English", praising the game's graphics, sound, and story as [...] "well conceived and executed". The magazine's editors would later name it as the greatest role-playing game of 1993. GamePro similarly reviewed it as [...] "not just the best Sega CD RPG ever, {{but one of the}} best on any Sega system", giving particular merit to the game's translation. Game Players described it as a [...] "solid RPG, and well <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> time" [...] but found fault in the game's small character graphics that [...] "look like every other RPG" [...] and the virtually non-existent replay value. Electronic Gaming Monthly had five reviewers, Ed, Dano, Al, Sushi-X, and Mike, give the game scores of 9, 8, 7, 7, and 7, respectively, ranging from [...] "worthy" [...] to [...] "virtually flawless" [...] ratings. The magazine commended the game's background music soundtrack but described its battle sequences as [...] "a bit dull." [...] EGMs 1999 Video Game Buyer's Guide listed four of these scores, 9, 8, 7, and 7, averaging out to 7.75 out of 10 overall, and described the game as [...] "one of the best RPGs ever." ...|$|E

500|$|However, Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music {{felt that}} the album lacked inspiration, and wrote, [...] "nothing sticks, there's no guts, no depth {{and no matter how}} much he protests to the contrary, nothing to believe". Rolling Stone Melissa Maerz {{perceived}} that Usher had put little effort into the record and stated that [...] "now that he's got the American Dream, he sounds like he's stopped trying." [...] Blender Josh Eells was let down by the large number of ballads and lack of sexual content. Clover Hope of The Village Voice described it as [...] "pure grown-man bidness" [...] and [...] "a little too sitting-on-the-dock-of-the-bay for Chris Breezy–trained earbuds". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine scored Here I Stand two-and-a-half stars out of five, and considered the music [...] "almost always just one notch above mediocrity." [...] The Observer Steve Yates panned the album as [...] "gloop [...] wades through". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau cited the songs [...] "Trading Places" [...] and [...] "Best Thing" [...] as [...] "choice cuts", indicating [...] "good song on an album that isn't <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> time or money". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that [...] "tension, not bliss, creates the album's best songs", referring to [...] "Moving Mountains", [...] "His Mistakes", [...] "Appetite" [...] and [...] "What's a Man To Do". At the 51st Grammy Awards, the album's title track was nominated for the Best Male R Vocal Performance award, but lost to Ne-Yo's [...] "Miss Independent" [...] from his 2008 album, Year of the Gentleman.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for Stylus Magazine, Scott Plagenhoef wrote that on Rings Around the World, the band are [...] "gleefully working {{outside of a}} scene or prototype" [...] and [...] "dabbling {{in a world of}} musical {{influences}} and Western hegemony, playing the merry prankster to Radiohead's gloom – and all with a smile, and in three-part harmony". Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the record, claiming that it [...] "shines brightly" [...] compared to the [...] "dead world of mainstream and indie rock in 2001" [...] but expressed disappointment that it is [...] "the first SFA album not to progress from its predecessor". Rob Brunner of Entertainment Weekly claimed that at its best, the album [...] "recalls a lost Brian Wilson-style psychedelic marvel", but went on to state that it is [...] "at times marred by forced eccentricity", citing the [...] "heavy metal gorgon voice booming through 'Receptacle for the Respectable'" [...] and the [...] "awful lite-rock homage" [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] as examples. Q stated that, although songs such as [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World", [...] "Shoot Doris Day" [...] and [...] "Presidential Suite" [...] are [...] "excellent", the album features [...] "nothing to change anyone's world", while the NME claimed that, despite containing some great songs, it is the band's worst album. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice singled out [...] "Tradewinds" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating a [...] "good song on an album that isn't <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> time or money." ...|$|E
500|$|There's a Riot Goin' On was {{met with}} a divided {{reaction}} from fans and music critics, who {{were not used to}} the album's production and lyrical content. Los Angeles Times writer Robert Hilburn expressed a mixed response towards the band's stylistic change from [...] "soulflavored" [...] songs such as [...] "Everyday People" [...] and [...] "Hot Fun in the Summertime", stating [...] "there is little on the album that is <b>worth</b> <b>your</b> attention". Other major music publications praised this new direction: in his review for Rolling Stone magazine, Vince Aletti wrote that [...] "At first I hated it for its weakness and its lack of energy and I still dislike these qualities. But then I began to respect the album's honesty". Aletti cited it as [...] "one of the most important fucking albums this year" [...] and [...] "the new urban music... not about dancing to the music, in the streets. It's about disintegration, getting fucked up, nodding, maybe dying. There are flashes of euphoria, ironic laughter, even some bright stretches but mostly it's just junkie death, oddly unoppressive and almost attractive in its effortlessness". [...] A columnist for Hit Parader magazine gave Riot a favorable review, and stated that the album has [...] "a lot that makes Sly the in-person rave that he is." [...] In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "what's expressed is the bitterest ghetto pessimism", backed by [...] "subtle production techniques and jarring song compositions". He declared Riot [...] "one of those rare albums whose whole actually does exceed the sum of its parts". Greil Marcus called the record [...] "Muzak with its finger on the trigger." ...|$|E
