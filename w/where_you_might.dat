6000|$|Mrs. Fike {{looked over}} her, through her, about her, and remarked: [...] "I'd {{advise you to}} drop all impudence. You see, you don't do it well. We admit East Side Jews here and they are so much quicker and wittier than you country girls from Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, and Heaven knows <b>where,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> just as well give up {{and try to be}} ladies instead of humorists.

40|$|Think very {{carefully}} before you purchase a digital free-to-air television set or box. Depending on <b>where</b> <b>you</b> live, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> lose an entire channel warns Ellie Rennie. This {{may come as}} a surprise. It is unlikely that you will have read about it in the news or seen a warning sticker on a set-top-box. We were told that digital television would offer more television, not less. Analogue community television is watched by over 3 million Australians in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Lismore and Mt Gambier. These stations (generally located on Channel 31) have not been allowed to broadcast digitally. To do so, they would need to be allocated extra spectrum (another channel) and funds to meet the transmission costs. As more households purchase digital television receivers, the community television audience will continue to diminish. At some point, program-makers will pack away their video cameras and sponsors will close their cheque books. Without digital simulcast, community television will not last long...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Andrew, {{reflecting}} very seriously, [...] "I {{must take}} you home some way or other. It won't do to leave you here, and no matter <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> stay, your mother would be troubled to death about you." ...|$|E

"Not exactly from Wheal Dooem, Jack, but if {{you were}} to go up in a balloon a few hundred yards above the spot <b>where</b> it stands, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> see 'em all on a very clear day, if your eyes were good. The fact is, that I regard this picture as a triumph of art, exhibiting powerfully what is by artists termed `bringing together' and great `breadth,' united with {{exceedingly}} minute detail.

60|$|The {{question}} {{of food and}} water that would have risen paramount in the mind of an ordinary man contemplating such an excursion gave Tarzan little concern. The wilderness was his natural habitat and woodcraft as inherent to him as breathing.

6000|$|... "Well, no, Sir. Not {{for three}} or four weeks yet. I haven't any idea <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> find some.

I've got some very fine oranges, though--from a shipload that came in to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good. Of {{course it}} was of the utmost {{importance}} to prevent you from thinking better of it, and also to keep you from coming into contact with any one who might tell you that your double was at work in Mawson's office. Therefore they gave you a handsome advance on your salary, and ran you off to the Midlands, where they gave you enough work to do to prevent your going to London, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have burst their little game up.

"Then I {{began to}} fear that in your haste you had gone on board the wrong steamer--two others sailed to-day, a little later than ours, and I went to their piers and made all sorts of inquiries, but I could find out nothing.
