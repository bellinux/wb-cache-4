500|$|Arctic Monkeys {{wasted no}} time in {{recording}} new material, and released a five-track EP on 24 April 2006, titled <b>Who</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Are Arctic Monkeys?. Due to its length, the EP was ineligible to chart as a UK single or album. Furthermore, the record's graphic language has resulted in significantly less radio airplay than previous records, although this was not a reported concern according to an insider – [...] "since they made their name on the Internet... they don't care if they don't get radio play". The release of the EP <b>Who</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fuck</b> Are Arctic Monkeys? just three months after their record-breaking debut album has been criticised by some, who have seen it as [...] "money-grabbing" [...] and [...] "cashing in on their success". The band countered that it regularly releases new music not to make money, but to avoid the [...] "boredom" [...] of [...] "spending three years touring on one album".|$|E
500|$|Musson {{received}} an enthusiastic call in late February from a past member of Plastic Little {{telling him that}} his voice was sampled on [...] "Harlem Shake". Musson {{did not have a}} problem with Baauer using the sample without his permission and found the song's production [...] "phenomenal". He subsequently called Baauer to thank him for [...] "doing something useful with our annoying music". However, he felt that the allusion to the dance was [...] "peculiar" [...] and outdated: [...] "I was like, <b>Who</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> is rapping about the Harlem Shake in 2012?" [...] Musson {{said in an interview in}} March that he was negotiating with Mad Decent over compensation and that, although no agreement had been reached, the label had been [...] "more than cooperative during this".|$|E
500|$|According to Jayanathi Daniel, {{writer of}} The New York Sun, Carey's remixes of [...] "Shake If Off" [...] and [...] "It's Like That" [...] helped cement her {{impression}} on the music scene during the release of The Emancipation of Mimi, writing [...] "the multiple mix tapes, further legitimized her return." [...] In a review of Jay-Z's material at the time, an editor at XXL rated the remix two out of five stars, criticizing his lyrics and [...] "swag", which he felt were missing during lines reading [...] "The Emancipation of M-I-M-I / I spray semi rrrah, rrrrah / Twenty worldwide nigga get your plaques / Guess <b>who</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> got his swagger back?". He concluded on a mixed note, writing [...] "With run-of-the-mill punchlines and a dated reference to How Stella Got Her Groove Back, Jay seems to be missing some of his usual swagger on this white label–only remix." ...|$|E

If he let Paul kill him, {{there would have been a}} war. I think he felt, Paul's the boss, so let's 'fess up, this is the truth, this is what happened, here are the tapes.

2500|$|In August 2001, ABC-TV {{broadcast}} the series, Long Way to the Top. Perkins featured on [...] "Episode 6: Gathering of the Tribes 1984–2000" [...] where he discussed his non-mainstream work with both Beasts of Bourbon and The Cruel Sea, [...] which were [...] "Providing the poor forgotten 5% with something – <b>who</b> like <b>the</b> really <b>fucked</b> up weird shit". In September their next album, Where There's Smoke, produced by Magoo (Regurgitator, Midnight Oil) and the band, appeared {{and reached the}} Top30. It was followed by another compilation, We Don't Work, We Play Music in October 2002 with [...] "Groovy Situation" [...] issued as a single.|$|R
500|$|Love denied ever telling Wilson [...] "don't {{fuck with}} the formula", {{adding that the}} Beach Boys [...] "have no formula. In 1967 alone, the year I {{supposedly}} made that comment, we recorded Wild Honey, an R album that was entirely different from anything we'd ever done, and I cowrote ten songs and sang three leads." [...] In 1975, he voiced appreciation of the musical form and content of [...] "Surf's Up" [...] from Smile, which he believed went beyond what is normally expected of commercial pop music, {{and in the same}} 1992 article where he refers to some of the Pet Sounds lyrics as [...] "nauseating", he calls Parks a [...] "very gifted musician", saying: [...] "He's great. He's one of the nicest persons in the world. And I tell him, 'Hey, I thought your lyrics, Van Dyke, were brilliant, except <b>who</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> knows what you're talking about!' That's exactly how I talk to him (laughs). And he and I joke about it." [...] He considers that [...] "a lot of people don't understand I {{have a sense of humor}} that's kind of wack, or different, or sometimes bratty, so I get labeled with that and there goes my image, right down the toilet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{releases}} followed {{over the}} next years including Boulevard of Broken Dreams (1989, seven weeks at no. 1 in Norway; all tracks were produced by Simon Humphrey, except [...] "Young Love", which was produced by Dieter Bohlen), Whose Are These Boots? (1990, no. 1 in Norway), Chasing Shadows (1992) and Celebration (1994), which contained old hits in new arrangements accompanied by an orchestra. None had any real success in the UK. However, Smokie made a surprise return to the UK Singles Chart in 1995, with a duet with the controversial northern comedian Roy Chubby Brown. The re-worked re-release of [...] "Living Next Door To Alice (Who the F**k is Alice)" [...] reached No. 3 in the UK. The band had noticed that, whilst touring in Ireland, whenever they sang the main line [...] "For 24 years/I've been living next door to Alice" [...] the audience would shout [...] "Alice? <b>Who</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> is Alice?" [...] In addition, a resident DJ in a Dutch café, Gompie, organised a recording, and had a No. 17 UK hit with the title of [...] "Alice (Who the X is Alice) (Living Next Door to Alice)" [...] in the United Kingdom, and in the Netherlands where it reached No. 1.|$|E

2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will ask all of you one more time. <b>Who</b> <b>the</b> <b>fuck</b> wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E
