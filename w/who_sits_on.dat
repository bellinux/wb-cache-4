5|$|As {{prescribed}} in the Jayakhya-Samhita, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti may be {{depicted as}} riding his vehicle (vahana) Garuda too, though {{these images are}} rarer. In this configuration, the god holds a sword, a lotus, a mace or a conch and the chakra. Generally, on four feathers of Garuda sit four female figures, two {{on either side of}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The identity of the female figures is uncertain. They are interpreted as two goddesses (possibly consorts of Vishnu - Lakshmi and Bhumi) and two female attendants. The Jayakhya-Samhita mentions that four goddesses Lakshmi, Kirti, Jaya and Maya as the female counterparts of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Rarely, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is accompanied with his consort Lakshmi, <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> his left thigh. This form is called Lakshmi Vaikuntha in the Jayakhya-Samhita.|$|E

25|$|In a vocal recital, {{a concert}} team may {{have one or}} more vocalists as the {{principal}} performer(s). Instruments, such as the Saraswati veena and/or venu flute, can be occasionally found as a rhythmic accompaniment, but usually, a vocalist {{is supported by a}} violin player (<b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> his/her left). The rhythm accompanist is usually a mridangam player (<b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> the other side, facing the violin player). However, other percussion instruments such as the ghatam, kanjira and morsing frequently also accompany the main percussion instrument and play in an almost contrapuntal fashion along with the beats.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court of Bangladesh, {{including}} its High Court and Appellate Divisions, {{is the high}} court of the land. The head of the judiciary is the Chief Justice of Bangladesh, <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> the Supreme Court. The courts have wide latitude in judicial review, and judicial precedent {{is supported by the}} Article 111 of the constitution. The judiciary includes district and metropolitan courts, which are divided into civil and criminal courts. Due to a shortage of judges, the judiciary has a large backlog. The Bangladesh Judicial Service Commission is an independent body responsible for judicial appointments, salaries and discipline.|$|E
500|$|In [...] 1938, {{two years}} before Horton Hatches the Egg, Judge {{published}} perhaps the most obvious precursor to Horton, [...] "Matilda, the Elephant with a Mother Complex", a short story by Geisel about an [...] "old maid elephant" [...] <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> a chickadee egg until it hatches, {{only to have the}} newborn chickadee fly away from her. In 1939, Geisel created an advertisement for NBC featuring a sympathetic-looking elephant lashed with ropes and contained in a cage made of sticks, similar to Horton's situation when the hunters capture him in Horton Hatches the Egg.|$|E

500|$|Charles Cohen, on {{the other}} hand, found traces of Horton Hatches the Egg in early Dr. Seuss works. In an early {{installment}} of Geisel's cartoon feature [...] "Boids and the Beasties", which began in Judge magazine in 1927, he juxtaposed a bird and an elephant. A few weeks later, he drew a story in which a whale ends up passed out in a catalpa tree. In a 1959 cartoon for Life magazine, he depicted a dachshund <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> eggs for storks. In 1961, he drew an illustration for Judge that showed a walrus sitting in a tree, trying to hatch the eggs in a bird nest. Some of his earlier work also featured elephant-bird hybrids, which prefigured the elephant-bird that hatches {{at the end of}} Horton Hatches the Egg.|$|E
500|$|In the morning, they {{escape to}} Harry's house, where Victoria unsuccessfully {{attempts}} to contact Captain Kell. Hannay, alone, meets with Sir George, <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> the defence committee. Hannay reveals {{the contents of}} the notebook, leading to Sir George disclosing that a meeting of the National Committee of Defence is being held the next day at Stirling Castle to unveil new naval plans, matching part of the double code. Later, Hannay and Victoria kiss, and the next morning he sees her leaving with a man, whom he recalls seeing previously on the train and at the rally. With the notebook missing and finding out that Victoria disconnected the call she made to the Secret Service Bureau before it was connected, Hannay goes to Stirling Castle, believing Victoria to be a traitor. There, Victoria reveals she works for the Secret Service Bureau and he meets Kell (Alex Jennings) and Wakeham, the man Victoria left with earlier (Steven Elder), who reveal they used Hannay to distract the Germans and sent Victoria {{to keep an eye on}} him. Hannay deduces that Sir George is the traitor, as he should have heard them when he was at Fisher's House, and, with his photographic memory, has escaped with the naval plans memorised. To identify his rendezvous point with the Germans, they crack the remaining code, referring to the room they were previously imprisoned in at Longkeep Castle, and discover [...] "39 steps" [...] written in the notebook by Scudder using invisible ink. At the Castle, Hannay and Victoria find 39 steps leading to a loch. A shoot-out ensues, and a German U-boat surfaces in the loch. Fisher, the Germans and Sir George fail to get to the U-boat before it submerges, and surrender.|$|E

2500|$|Sculptures {{referencing}} Atlantis {{have often}} been stylized single figures. One of the earliest was Einar Jónsson’s The King of Atlantis (1919–1922), now {{in the garden of}} his museum in Reykjavik. It represents a single figure, clad in a belted skirt and wearing a large triangular helmet, <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> an ornate throne supported between two young bulls. The walking female entitled Atlantis (1946) by Ivan Meštrović was from a series inspired by ancient Greek figures [...] with the symbolical meaning of unjustified suffering.|$|E

2500|$|Since 1966-67, British Columbia {{has been}} {{segmented}} into 27 regional districts {{as a way}} of extending municipal powers outside of municipalities.

[...] In {{the centre of the}} pedestal there is a scene depicting the way of the cross with a centurion, on horseback, whilst a second centurian holds the lance which had pierced Jesus' side. At each corner of the pedestal are statues of the evangelists, Matthew the Apostle with his attribute the child, Luke the Evangelist <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> a bull, Mark the Evangelist with a lion and John the Evangelist with an eagle. There is also a sculpture depicting Christ carry the cross and Saint Veronica holding up the veil on which Jesus' image has appeared and finally a pietà, the Virgin Mary holding the body of Christ which has just been brought down from the cross. The pietà is by Guillouic. There is also a figure on the shaft of the central cross. He seems to be sleeping and is a depiction of Jesse the father of David and thus an ancestor of Jesus. At the feet of the crucified Jesus are two skulls and two crossed bones symbolizing that Jesus' death has washed away the sins of mankind.|$|E
