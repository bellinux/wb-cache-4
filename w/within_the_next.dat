5|$|A recent calm period, {{with almost}} no {{earthquake}} or magmatic activity at Hualālai, has seen the growth of homes, businesses, and resorts on the mountain's flanks. The most recent major activity at the volcano was in 1929, when an intense earthquake swarm rocked Hualālai, most likely caused by magmatic action near the volcano's peak. Although it has been relatively placid in the recent past, Hualālai is still potentially active, {{and is expected to}} erupt again <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 100years.|$|E

He wondered why such {{a considerable amount of}} jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for the band. Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> month.|$|E
5|$|After the First Opium War, Hong Kong was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and {{the colony}} {{soon became a}} popular {{stopover}} for missionaries travelling onwards to China. The parish was established in 1842 by Theodore Joset, the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong, and work began on a new and permanent church soon afterwards. The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street. Construction was completed in 1843. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few years, the number of Catholics in the parish grew significantly, {{partly due to the}} emigration of people from neighbouring Macau. The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline, and many people who resided there sought better opportunities in the young and prospering colony of Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|At the {{hospital}} where Campbell works, he, Johnson, and her partner Mack are attacked by the monstrous Inhuman Lash, and Johnson and Campbell barely manage to hold him off. The subsequent arrival of Price’s forces causes both Lash and Campbell to flee. Afterwards, President Matthew Ellis officially announces Price's organisation—the Advanced Threat Containment Unit—as a replacement for the now underground S.H.I.E.L.D., and they begin hunting their next target after Gutierrez: Campbell.

5|$|Early on August28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an unusually}} vigorous tropical wavean elongated area of low air pressureinland over West Africa. Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked {{toward the open}} Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline. The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off Conakry around 18:00UTC, August29. By that time, the NHC was predicting a favorable environment for tropical cyclone development <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 48hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center. Around midnight August30, satellite images and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression had formed about 300miles (480km) west-northwest of Conakry, with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h).|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Boris Chirikov and Vitaly Vecheslavov {{performed}} {{an analysis of}} 46 apparitions of Halley's Comet taken from historical records and computer simulations. These studies showed that its dynamics were chaotic and unpredictable on long timescales. Halley's projected lifetime could be as long as 10million years. More recent work suggests that Halley will evaporate, or split in two, <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few {{tens of thousands of}} years, or will be ejected from the Solar System within a few hundred thousand years. Observations by D.W. Hughes suggest that Halley's nucleus has been reduced in mass by 80–90% over the last 2000–3000 revolutions.|$|E

5000|$|The {{leptotene}} stage, {{also known}} as the leptonema, is the first of five substages of prophase I in meiosis. The term leptonema derives from Greek words meaning [...] "thin threads". A cell destined to become a gamete enters the leptotene stage after its chromosomes are duplicated during interphase. During the leptotene stage those duplicated chromosomes—each consisting of two sister chromatids—condense from diffuse chromatin into long, thin strands that are more visible <b>within</b> <b>the</b> nucleoplasm. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> stage of prophase I in meiosis is the zygotene stage.|$|R
5|$|Later on September22, the National Hurricane Center began {{noting the}} {{possibility}} of increasing wind shear due to a large upper trough. Despite this, the intensity predictions did not forecast weakening <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three days. Isaac continued to strengthen and reached hurricane status at 1200UTC on September23. However, the National Hurricane Center did not operationally upgrade Isaac until 2100UTC on September23, at which time the storm was a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, Isaac significantly intensified, and on the following day, it reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 120mph (205km/h). The National Hurricane Center then predicted Isaac would become a Category4 hurricane on September25, though this did not materialize.|$|E
