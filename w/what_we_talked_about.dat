60|$|The hours {{passed as}} though in a dream. I talked to my sister and her husband, and {{exchanged}} the usual gossip with their callers.

60|$|It {{was nearly}} eight when I wrote the lines with which this day begins. Feeling strangely restless and uneasy, I left my rooms and walked round {{to spend the}} evening with Agatha and her mother. They both remarked that I was pale and haggard. About nine Professor Pratt-Haldane came in, and we played a game of whist. I tried hard to {{concentrate}} my attention upon the cards, but the feeling of restlessness grew and grew until I {{found it impossible to}} struggle against it. I simply COULD not sit still at the table. At last, in the very middle of a hand, I threw my cards down and, with some sort of an incoherent apology about having an appointment, I rushed from the room. As if in a dream I have a vague recollection of tearing through the hall, snatching my hat from the stand, and slamming the door behind me. As in a dream, too, I have the impression of the double line of gas-lamps, and my bespattered boots tell me that I must have run {{down the middle of the}} road. It was all misty and strange and unnatural. I came to Wilson's house; I saw Mrs. Wilson and I saw Miss Penclosa. I hardly recall <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about,</b> but I do remember that Miss P. shook the head of her crutch at me in a playful way, and accused me of being late and of losing interest in our experiments. There was no mesmerism, but I stayed some time and have only just returned.|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about,</b> {{who shall}} tell? I would not, for my part, break {{the secret of}} one of those delicious conversations, of which I and every man in his time have held so many. You begin, very probably, about the weather--'tis a common subject, but what sentiments the genius of Love can fling into it! I have often, for my part, said to the girl of my heart for the time being, [...] "It's a fine day," [...] or [...] "It's a rainy morning!" [...] in a way that has brought tears to her eyes. Something beats in your heart, and twangle! a {{corresponding}} string thrills and echoes in hers. You offer her anything--her knitting-needles, a slice of bread-and-butter--what causes the grateful blush with which she accepts the one or the other? Why, she sees your heart handed over to her upon the needles, and the bread-and-butter is to her a sandwich with love inside it. If you say to your grandmother, [...] "Ma'am, it's a fine day," [...] or what not, she would find in the words no other meaning than their outward and visible one; but say so to the girl you love, and she understands a thousand mystic meanings in them. Thus, in a word, though Dorothea and I did not, probably, on the first night of our meeting, talk of anything more than the weather, or trumps, or some subjects which to such listeners as Schnabel and Klingenspohr and others might appear quite ordinary, yet to US they had a different signification, of which Love alone held the key.|$|E
