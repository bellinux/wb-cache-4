500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Monsters of Rock appearance, Mustaine fired Behler and Young and {{canceled}} Megadeth's scheduled Australian tour. [...] "On the road, things escalated {{from a small}} border skirmish into a full-on raging war", Mustaine later recalled. [...] "I {{think a lot of}} us were inconsistent [...] because of the guy <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> after the show." [...] During the tour, Mustaine noticed problems developing with Behler and brought in drummer Nick Menza as Behler's drum technician. As with Samuelson, Menza was expected to take over if Behler could not continue the tour. Menza replaced Behler in 1989. Young's dismissal resulted from Mustaine's suspicions that he {{was having an affair with}} Mustaine's girlfriend, an allegation Young denied.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{recording}} sessions, the band worked on what Bono estimated to be 50 songs; the Edge said they had about 25 songs to choose from, five of which were still very much in a rough state. Bono said that the songwriting process was humbling, as some songs, [...] "you could get them halfway up the hill, three-quarters of the way up the hill. A lot of times, we just couldn't get them {{up to the top of}} the hill." [...] Speaking about the record's long gestation period, Bono said, [...] "Rumour has it we haven't made a U2 album in the last five years. We have. We've made several. We just didn't release them because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> something that would be as good as the best we've ever done." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Roth, [...] "My friend Jeff, {{who plays}} the killer pilgrim – {{we grew up in}} Massachusetts, we were huge slasher movie fans and every November <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the Thanksgiving slasher movie. We had the whole movie worked out: A kid who's in love with a turkey, and then his father killed it, and then he killed his family and went away to a mental {{institution}} and came back and took revenge on the town. I called Jeff and said, 'Dude, guess what, we don't have to make the movie, we can just shoot the best parts.'" [...] "Shooting the trailer was so much fun," [...] Roth has stated, [...] "because every shot is a money shot. Every shot is decapitation or nudity. It's so ridiculous, it's absurd. It's just so wrong and sick that it's right." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "We {{had breakfast}} while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the rain to stop, and I can still {{envision}} sitting with the Clowns {{in a restaurant}} behind Griffith Stadium and hearing them break all the plates in the kitchen after we finished eating. What a horrible sound. Even as a kid, the irony of it hit me: here {{we were in the}} capital in the land of freedom and equality, and they had to destroy the plates that had touched the forks that had been in the mouths of black men. If dogs had eaten off those plates, they'd have washed them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Howard D. Griffin (1911-1986) {{purchased}} a boat dealership in 1936 {{while he was}} a student at what became the University of Louisiana at Monroe. By the 1960s, Griffin's company had become the largest outboard motor dealership in the world. He also sold motorcycles. From 1965 to 1985, Griffin and his wife, Birdie M. Griffin (1915-1985), operated their seasonal Land O' Toys store on South Grand Street in Monroe. The motto was [...] "Land O’ Toys; Loads of fun for girls and boys; Bring the kids and look around; The biggest toy deal in the town." [...] Once Christmas was over, the toy store was quickly phased out, and the outboard motors returned to the showroom. From her childhood memories, Sherry Lynn Mason recalls the Land O' Toys: [...] "I loved that store. Every time [...] took me there, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> his outboard motor to be fixed across the street. It was a magical place to me!” Amy Berry Baker recalls, [...] "It wasn't Christmas until we went to Howard Griffin ... magical for kids," [...] according to an article in The Monroe News-Star. Mrs. Griffin died December 15, 1985, and the store close permanently a few days after Christmas of that year. In March 2011, the remaining abandoned building burned. All that remains are the memories of the former customers, now all adults. Cheri Chadduck recalled, [...] "Memories are completely magical, and I am so grateful for my childhood recollections of time there." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E

6000|$|... "Tuts!" [...] {{said the}} doctor, losing patience, [...] "Mr. Dishart gives {{more than any}} other man in Thrums to the poor, and he is not to be preached to by a gypsy. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> you, Nanny." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Parkins, [...] "the head {{baggage man}} (he wears a uniform, you know, in Italy {{just like a}} soldier) {{said it was because}} we'd {{forgotten}} to check them in Vienna. However there <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> twenty-four hours with nothing but our valises." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly so, Mr. S. The {{identity}} is one as I could prove on oath in any court in England. You {{was on the}} railway platform at Exeter on Saturday when <b>we</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the 12 express 'buss;--wasn't you now, Mr. S.?" ...|$|R

60|$|While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the reply, I {{made myself}} master {{of all the}} {{information}} Marian could afford {{on the subject of}} Sir Percival's family, and of his early life. She could only speak on these topics from hearsay, but she was reasonably certain of the truth of what little she had to tell.|$|E
60|$|Commodore Barney {{used the}} Avenger as his flag-ship while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the Scorpion, and our deck was {{literally}} crowded {{with men who}} had been summoned to receive orders. He even ate breakfast with us, doing the greater portion of the eating holding converse with one or another, and it can well be fancied that we were proud because of having made possible such an honor for our pungy.|$|E
60|$|We {{found the}} Tracys {{when we arrived}} at home. Dermot was not equal to {{standing}} about at the pottery, but Lady Diana had promised to come and help me entertain the party, and very kindly she did so during the very trying hungry hour to which we had to submit, inasmuch as, when Sir James at last appeared, it turned out that he never ate luncheon, and was in perfect ignorance that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "And even that," [...] the Duchess remarked, smiling, [...] "has been yellow for {{the last}} few days.

40|$|District {{commander}} Belfast city, {{chief superintendent}} Chris Noble said: “While most post-mortem examinations have <b>been</b> carried out, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> {{the results of}} toxicology tests to {{determine the cause of}} each tragic death.

6000|$|... "We knew--my {{mother and}} I--that the braves {{would be home}} soon. We {{expected}} them every minute. While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> them, my mother went into the bush to pick berries. There she discovered a war-party of our enemies. They were preparing to attack our village, for they knew the men were away, and they wanted the scalps {{of the women and}} children. But they did not know the exact spot where our wigwams were pitched, and were just going, after a feed, to look for it.|$|E
60|$|The {{time was}} whiled away pleasantly enough at Matamoras, while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> volunteers. It is {{probable}} that all the most important people of the territory occupied by our army left their homes before we got there, but with those remaining the best of relations apparently existed. It was {{the policy of the}} Commanding General to allow no pillaging, no taking of private property for public or individual use without satisfactory compensation, so that a better market was afforded than the people had ever known before.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Peter and the Story Girl. Peter {{had gone}} to Markdale after dinner to spend the {{afternoon}} with his reunited parents because it was his birthday. He had left us grimly determined to confess to his father the dark secret of his Presbyterianism, and we were anxious {{to know what the}} result had been. The Story Girl had gone that morning with Miss Reade to visit the latter's home near Charlottetown, and we expected soon to see her coming gaily along over the fields from the Armstrong place.|$|E
6000|$|Countess. You see it, sister! as {{your eyes}} permit you.

6000|$|... "I reckon {{they suspect}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> help, and they {{mean to do}} {{something}} before it gits too late," [...] observed Poke Stover.
