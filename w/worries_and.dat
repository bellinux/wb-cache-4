40|$|Abstract Objective This study {{aimed to}} explore {{cross-sectional}} and longitudinal associations between pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue in a working population. Methods In employees with very low or very high fatigue levels, psychometrics of the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; measuring pathological <b>worry)</b> <b>and</b> the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS; measuring fatigue) were examined and their cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were explored. Results Pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue can be measured as different constructs. However, pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue were also associated on a cross-sectional level. Pathological worry predicted fatigue level 10 months later, but this association disappeared after adjustment for the cross-sectional association between pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue. Conclusion Although they can be measured as different constructs, pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue seem to be associated. When studying longitudinal relations between pathological <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fatigue, their cross-sectional association {{should be taken into}} account. Pathological worry might not be a risk factor for fatigue per se, but might act more like a mediating factor...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Although <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> {{rumination}} are everyday phenomena as well {{as common}} symptoms across numerous psychopathological disorders, the theoretical and clinical delineations of both concepts need more clarification. This study explored the degree of overlap between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination on the levels of standardized questionnaires and a priori lay concepts. Method: The subjective conceptualization of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> of rumination of 221 undergraduate and graduate students was assessed with the semantic differential technique, together with the frequency and intensity with which they experienced <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination (based on their lay concepts). Standardized self-report measures for <b>worry,</b> rumination, depression, <b>and</b> anxiety were also administered. Results: Worry was viewed as more negative than rumination and was more predictive of anxiety {{as well as}} of depression than rumination, especially when the assessment was based on the subjective lay concepts. The different measures of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination were only moderately correlated with each other.

5|$|On 8 February 1963, the Iraqi Regional Branch, led by Ali Salih al-Sa'di, {{took power}} in Iraq by overthrowing Abd al-Karim Qasim. He {{was a far}} more {{formidable}} opponent than al-Kudsi, and the Iraqi Regional Branch managed to take power through an alliance not only with military officers, but also with segments of the middle class. Qasim's downfall changed the rules of Arab politics – the Nasserists had monopolised the Arab nationalist movement since the UAR, but the takeover made the Ba'ath Party {{a force to be}} reckoned with. In contrast to the Iraqi regional branch, the Syrian regional branch did not have mass support or a significant support base in the middle class. While Aflaq cautioned the plotters because of the party's lack of support, they failed to share his <b>worries,</b> <b>and</b> launched the coup on 7 March. However, that day the military intelligence raided the apartment where the plotters were planning to assemble. Assad was given the task of reporting to other units that the coup had been postponed to 8 March.|$|E

40|$|Major {{depression}} is characterised by ruminative thinking whilst worry is considered central in {{generalised anxiety disorder}} (GAD). However, not only do these two forms of repetitive negative thinking regularly co-occur in the same individual but similarities between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination are apparent. Adapting a methodology developed by Langlois et al. (Behav. Res. Therapy 38 (2000) 157 - 173), this study directly compared <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination in a non-clinical population across a series of variables drawn from current models (appraisal, general descriptors and emotional reactions). Each of 149 female volunteers, {{with a wide range}} of age and backgrounds, identified a ruminative thought <b>and</b> a different <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> subsequently evaluated them using the Cognitive Intrusion Questionnaire. Significant within-subject differences were revealed on seven variables: chronicity, unpleasantness, reality of problem, future orientation, past orientation, feelings of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> insecurity. There were no differences found between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination on appraisals and strategies, consistent with accounts that propose that <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination share the same processes but involve different content (Cognitive Ther.

40|$|Worry is {{a common}} feature of chronic pain. The purpose of his {{study was to examine}} he extent of worry {{experienced}} by adult, with chronic pain, and to explore features of problem solving associated with <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> chronic pain. A further purpose was to investigate whether there were differences in <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> problem solving for those presenting at a pain clinic for treatment, compared to those who identified as chronic pain sufferers but who were not presenting for treatment. A final purpose was to examine whether the extent of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> problem solving attitudes helped to predict the primary clinical features of chronic pain such as intensity, disability and depressive mood. One hundred and eighty five adults with chronic pain provided completed questionnaires assessing worrying, problem solving, pain severity, disability, catastrophic thinking and depressive mood. Analyses showed that <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> problem solving approaches sampled in this study were not abnormal. Furthermore, no {{differences were found between the}} clinical and non-clinical sample for <b>worrying</b> <b>and</b> problem solving. In relation to the predictive value of <b>worrying</b> <b>and</b> problem solving, analyses revealed that only worrying had a unique contribution in explaining depressive mood.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was twofold: 1) to {{investigate}} the psychological profile of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) as compared to patients with other chronic pain syndromes (CP) and healthy subjects (HS); 2) to examine the associations between anxiety, depression, <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> angry rumination in FS patients. FS patients (N= 30), CP patients (N= 30) and HS (N= 30) completed measurements of anxiety, depression, <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> angry rumination. FS patients showed higher levels of state <b>and</b> trait anxiety, <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> angry rumination than CP patients and HS, and higher levels of depression than HS. <b>Worry</b> <b>and</b> angry rumination were strongly associated in the FS group. FS patients may use <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination as coping strategies to deal with their negative emotional experience, which might impair their emotional wellbeing. Findings from the present study add to our understanding of the psychological profile of FS patients, and have important implications for developing a tailored CBT protocol for pain management in FS patients...|$|R

40|$|SummaryRisk {{perception}} and psychological concerns are relevant for understanding how people view Lyme disease. This study investigates the four separate outcomes of susceptibility, likelihood to be diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> fear for contracting Lyme disease. University students (n= 713) were surveyed about demographics, perceived health, Lyme disease knowledge, Lyme disease preventive behaviors, Lyme disease history, and Lyme disease miscellaneous variables. We {{found that women}} were associated with increased susceptibility and fear. Asian/Asian-American race/ethnicity was associated with increased <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> fear. Perceived good health was associated with increased likelihood to be diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> fear. Correct knowledge was associated with increased susceptibility and likelihood to be diagnosed. Those who typically {{spend a lot of}} time outdoors were associated with increased susceptibility, likelihood to be diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> fear. In conclusion, healthcare providers and public health campaigns should address susceptibility, likelihood to be diagnosed, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> fear about Lyme disease, and should particularly target women and Asians/Asian-Americans to address any possible misconceptions and/or offer effective coping strategies...|$|R
40|$|<b>Worry</b> <b>and</b> {{rumination}} are cognitive processes, often {{represented as}} verbal or linguis-tic activities. Despite similarities in definition <b>and</b> description, <b>worry</b> {{has been most}} closely examined in relation to anxiety whereas rumination has traditionally been related to depression. This distinction remains in spite of high rates of comorbidity between anxiety and depression. This study sought {{to better understand the}} distinct and overlapping features of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination as well as their relationship to anx-iety and depression. Seven hundred eighty-four unselected college students completed self-report measures of <b>worry,</b> rumination, anxiety, <b>and</b> depression. Items from the respective <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination scales were submitted to factor analysis, which re-vealed a four-factor solution comprised of 2 <b>worry</b> factors <b>and</b> 2 rumination factors. A Worry Engagement factor as well as a Dwelling on the Negative factor emerged as distilled measures of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination, respectively. Scores on these factors were highly correlated with each other and demonstrated equally strong relationships to both anxiety and depression. Findings from this study suggest that <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> rumination represent related but distinct cognitive processes that are similarly related to anxiety and depression.

40|$|Academic {{procrastination}} {{in college}} students is both ubiquitous and problematic. Although {{not considered a}} psychiatric disorder, procrastination has negative impacts on mental and physical health, academic performance, and interpersonal relationships, indicating that further attention is needed. Perhaps {{due in part to}} a relative dearth of research, cohesive theoretical underpinnings have not to date been formulated and impede the development of successful treatment. Research findings have been limited and discrepant with respect to the degree that <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> anxiety correlate with academic procrastination. In contrast, multiple studies have established the moderating role of experiential avoidance in adverse psychological outcomes; however, this role has been minimally addressed with respect to academic procrastination. The goal of the current study was to investigate the relationship between academic procrastination, <b>worry,</b> <b>and</b> experiential avoidance in an undergraduate college population. In an attempt to expand of extant literature, we examined the moderating role of experiential avoidance in the relationship between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> academic procrastination. Contrary to expectation, a significant relationship was not found between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> academic procrastination, and precluded an interaction effect between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> experiential avoidance such that one’s level of experiential avoidance does not appear to impact the relationship between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> academic procrastination. However, experiential avoidance was significantly correlated with academic procrastination, thereby providing implications for future directions and possible effective treatment approaches...|$|R

40|$|Two {{experiments}} that aimed {{to investigate the}} association between clock monitoring, pre-sleep <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> sleep are presented. In Experiment 1, 30 good and 30 poor sleepers were instructed either to monitor or not to monitor a clock as {{they were trying to}} get to sleep. Worry was indexed by self-rating. Sleep was measured by self-report and actigraphy. Compared to non-monitors, clock-monitors reported more pre-sleep <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> they experienced longer sleep onset latency (SOL). These findings held true for both good and poor sleepers. In Experiment 2, following one night of baseline measurement, 38 individuals diagnosed with primary insomnia were instructed to monitor either a clock or a digit display unit (a control monitoring task) as {{they were trying to get}} to sleep. The clock-monitoring task was rated to be more <b>worry</b> provoking <b>and</b> sleep interfering than the display unit-monitoring task. Whilst display unit-monitors experienced less pre-sleep worry, the clock-monitors experienced more pre-sleep <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> reported a longer SOL on the experimental night, relative to baseline. Further, compared to the display unit-monitors, the clock-monitors overestimated their SOL more on the experimental night.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} overlap and {{differences}} between measures of <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). It was expected that: (1) <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> obsessive compulsive symptoms are distinct concepts, yet that (2) <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> the cognitive components of OCD are more strongly related compared to the behaviour components of OCD. By means of confirmatory analysis {{it was found that}} all six components, i. e. worry, obsessive rumination, impulses, washing, checking and precision proved distinct components. Of the obsessive compulsive components, rumination was found to be most closely associated with worry. In further investigating the relative impact of obsessive compulsive symptoms on worry, it was found that obsessive rumination offered the largest unique contribution to the prediction of worry. When controlled for depressive mood, the overlap between rumination <b>and</b> <b>worry</b> dropped substantially. The results of this study clearly underline the differentiation between <b>worry</b> <b>and</b> obsessive compulsive symptoms. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
