40|$|Muscle {{mechanical}} <b>work</b> is {{an important}} biomechanical quantity in human movement analyses and has been estimated using different quantities including external, internal and joint <b>work.</b> The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the relationships between these traditionally used estimates of mechanical <b>work</b> in human walking and to assess whether they can be used as accurate estimates of musculotendon and/or muscle fiber <b>work.</b> A muscle-actuated forward dynamics walking simulation was generated to quantify each of the mechanical <b>work</b> measures. Total joint <b>work</b> (i. e. the time integral of absolute joint power over a full gait cycle) was found to underestimate total musculotendon <b>work</b> due to agonist–antagonist co-contractions, despite the effect of biarticular muscle <b>work</b> and passive joint <b>work,</b> which acted to decrease the underestimation. We did find that when the net passive joint <b>work</b> over the gait cycle is negligible, net joint <b>work</b> (i. e. the time integral of net joint power) was comparable to the net musculotendon <b>work</b> (and net muscle fiber <b>work</b> because net tendon <b>work</b> is zero over a complete gait cycle). Thus, during walking conditions when passive joint <b>work</b> is negligible, net joint <b>work</b> may be used as an estimate of net muscle <b>work.</b> Neither total external nor total internal <b>work</b> (nor their sum) provided a reasonable estimate of total musculotendon <b>work.</b> We conclude that joint <b>work</b> is limited in its ability to estimate musculotendon <b>work,</b> and that external and internal <b>work</b> should not be used as an estimation of musculotendon <b>work...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose To assess {{self-reported}} <b>work</b> {{ability and}} <b>work</b> performance {{of workers who}} stay at <b>work</b> despite chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain (CMP), and to explore which variables were associated with these outcomes. Methods In a cross-sectional study we assessed <b>work</b> ability (<b>Work</b> Ability Index, single item scale 0 - 10) and <b>work</b> performance (Health and <b>Work</b> Performance Questionnaire, scale 0 - 10) among 119 workers who continued <b>work</b> while having CMP. Scores of <b>work</b> ability and <b>work</b> performance were categorized into excellent (10), good (9), moderate (8) and poor (0 - 7). Hierarchical multiple regression and logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} analyze the relation of socio-demographic, pain-related, personal- and work-related variables with <b>work</b> ability and <b>work</b> performance. Results Mean <b>work</b> ability and <b>work</b> performance were 7. 1 and 7. 7 (poor to moderate). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that higher <b>work</b> ability scores were associated with lower age, better general health perception, and higher pain self-efficacy beliefs (R- 2 = 42 %). Higher <b>work</b> performance was associated with lower age, higher pain self-efficacy beliefs, lower physical <b>work</b> demand category and part-time <b>work</b> (R- 2 = 37 %). Logistic regression analysis revealed that <b>work</b> ability a parts per thousand yen 8 was significantly explained by age (OR = 0. 90), general health perception (OR = 1. 04) and pain self-efficacy (OR = 1. 15). <b>Work</b> performance a parts per thousand yen 8 was explained by pain self-efficacy (OR = 1. 11). Conclusions Many workers with CMP who stay at <b>work</b> report poor to moderate <b>work</b> ability and <b>work</b> performance. Our findings suggest that a subgroup of workers with CMP can stay at <b>work</b> with high <b>work</b> ability and performance, especially when they have high beliefs of pain self-efficacy. Our results further show that not the pain itself, but personal and work-related factors relate to <b>work</b> ability and <b>work</b> performance. ...|$|R
