500|$|The writers {{originally}} wanted American actor Sheldon Leonard {{to voice}} Fat Tony, {{but they were}} unable to get him, so they went with Joe Mantegna instead. Mantegna was offered the role during the show's second season, and since he had seen the show before and thought it was [...] "funny", he decided to give it a shot. He felt honored that they asked him to do a voice for the show. In an interview with The A.V. Club, Mantegna said he thinks the reason he got the role was partly due to his performance in the 1990 Mafia film The Godfather Part III, which opened just prior to when he received the role. He thought the script <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> and clever and that he enjoyed recording it. Mantegna has since appeared many times on the show as Fat Tony, who became a recurring character; it is Mantegna's longest-running role in his acting career. Mantegna commented: [...] "Who knew that Fat Tony was gonna resonate in {{the hearts and minds of}} the [...] out there?

Vince Broady, {{executive editor}} of Multimedia World, said Sierra <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year, calling it a [...] "masterwork" [...] and [...] "as close as it gets to a film you control", although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ and called it [...] "one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some [...] "horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger-like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed". Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it [...] "the most sophisticated computer game to date" [...] and [...] "a weird, wild, horrific ride {{that will make you}} jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart".

500|$|The {{asymmetrical}} {{structure of}} the game mostly received praise from critics. Vince Ingenito, from IGN, thought that the system <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> and has successfully delivered a unique multiplayer experience for players. He added {{that the system is}} tactically deep, and that the [...] "evolution" [...] mechanic saved it from being gimmicky. This was contradicted by Steven Strom of Ars Technica, who stated that the game overall was just a [...] "great gimmick and little else: something we'll play for a month or two, and not much longer"., [...] Evan Lahti, from PC Gamer, also commended the structure, and considered it the most compressed multiplayer experience since 2014's Titanfall. He added that such structure is something that the genre needs. Anthony LaBella, from Game Revolution, praised the asymmetrical idea. He added that the distant gameplay elements between Monsters and Hunters had successfully introduced Evolve to a broad audience. However, he noted that such a structure may become repetitive and boring for players after months of playthrough. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd also appreciated the structure, which he thought made every battle feel [...] "vicious and intense". However, Jeff Marchiafava, from Game Informer, thought that the structure felt limited, and that Evolve, even with all the modes, had failed to offer enough variety and challenges to players. Nic Rowan, from Destructoid, thought that Evolve had presented some of the best moments he had had in a multiplayer game, but he felt that these moments are too far between.|$|E

[...] HostGator's Jeremy Jensen attributed {{the campaign}}'s success to Reynolds, as well as Fox embracing the film's R rating. He concluded that, [...] "More than anything the Deadpool marketing campaign managed to create a relationship with the people who ended up going to see it. They were honest, creative, and completely relentless." [...] Alisha Grauso of Forbes felt the campaign's success came from the marketing team understanding the character, having freedom from the usual creative constraints put on film marketers, and not revealing much of the film's actual content. Grauso also praised the marketing team for utilizing Reynolds, and said, [...] "Audiences have been more than ready for the weird and wild, and that's the point—Fox <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> enough to see that and run with it.

500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> and had {{the heart of a}} lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity." ...|$|E

Cristina Gibson of E! described the video as [...] "edgy", similar to Cyrus' video for [...] "Party in the U.S.A.", but [...] "on steroids". Tina Warren of MTV News said the video was a good step toward ridding Cyrus of her good-girl image and gave the video a positive review, calling it [...] "intriguing" [...] and stating, [...] "The video [...] is actually quite magnetic and you can’t look away".

[...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in taking a few musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she <b>was</b> <b>smart</b> enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked."
