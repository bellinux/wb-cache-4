500|$|On 1 September 1917, Kerensky {{declared}} Russia a republic. Michael {{wrote in}} his diary: [...] "We <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to hear Russia declared a Republic. What does it matter which form the government will be {{as long as there}} is order and justice?" [...] Two weeks later, Michael's house arrest was lifted. Kerensky had armed the Bolsheviks after a power struggle with the commander-in-chief and in October there was a second revolution as the Bolsheviks seized power from Kerensky. With a permit to travel issued by Peter Polotsov, a former colleague of Michael from the Savage Division who was now a commander in Petrograd, Michael planned to move his family to the greater safety of Finland. They packed valuables and prepared to move, but their preparations were seen by Bolshevik sympathisers and they were placed once more under house arrest. The last of Michael's cars were seized by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
2500|$|On Australia Day 2015 Abbott {{announced}} that Queen Elizabeth had accepted his recommendation that her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, be appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia. The appointment was criticised by Shorten who said: [...] "It's {{a time warp}} where we're giving knighthoods to English [...] royalty. Some people (have) wondered whether it was an Australia Day hoax." [...] Adam Giles, Northern Territory chief minister and Country Liberal Party leader, said: [...] "I <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and read the wires and was confused between Australia Day and April Fool's Day," [...] adding [...] "It makes us {{a bit of a}} joke. It's Australia Day, we're not a bunch of tossers." [...] Abbott later stated that he had made a captain's call and not consulted with his cabinet colleagues over the appointment. Abbott faced criticism from some parliamentarians in his own party and the Nationals over the proposed appointment.|$|E

However, reports were quickly dismissed by Ward herself saying: [...] "I was surprised to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> and read news of my own retirement.

Yes, true enough, there it was! right over our heads, as it were, blocking up our very existence; filling our minds with its presence; that colossal pyramid of dazzling snow! Its lower parts concealed by the roofs, only the three rounded domes of the summit cut their forms with icy distinctness on the intense blue of the sky! ...|$|R
2500|$|Mahindra team {{principal}} Dilbagh Gill eulogised his team's maiden victory, {{calling it}} [...] "a massive breakthrough for Mahindra and Indian sport" [...] but stated {{the company would}} not get eager for more wins but believed further successes would come: [...] "We knew it would happen soon because we have had increased confidence with multiple podiums. For some reason when I <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I knew we would win." [...] After starting from 14th and gaining positions to finish in fifth place, Buemi was disqualified from the race after post-race scrutineering determined that all four tyres on both his cars were below the minimum mandated pressure of [...] set by tyre supplier Michelin, causing {{him to be in}} breach of Article 25.11 of the series' sporting regulations. Buemi's disqualification meant his teammate Prost, Bird, Vergne and Engel all gained one place and Turvey moved into the final points-scoring position of tenth. e.Dams-Renault co-owner Alain Prost admitted it was a mistake by his team but stated their task was to improve in the following day's race and enable Buemi to remain in contention for the championship. Buemi spoke of his disappointment in the outcome but said he would remain focused on the second race and return with stronger form.|$|E

50|$|Three {{years later}} in 2002 Cork and Waterford clashed in another Munster semi-final. A new-look Waterford, {{sporting}} blue shorts {{for the first time}} in twenty years, shaded a thrilling game by 1-16 to 1-15. It was their first defeat of the Rebels in 13 years. John Mullane will <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> feeling as ifhe won the Lotto but mislaid the ticket. The Waterfordcorner-forward delivered the near-perfect performancein yesterday's Guinness Munster hurling final at SempleStadium but still had to watch through bewildered eyesafterwards as Cork captain Alan Brownewaved the trophy in joyous celebration of another great Leesidetriumph. The Irish Independent sums up John Mullane's fateafter the 2003 Munster final. In 2003 Cork faced Waterford in the Munster final after a winter of discontent on Leeside had seen the hurling panel go on strike for better treatment and conditions. A high-scoring game saw John Mullane top score with 3-1, however, it wasn't enough as Cork triumphed by 3-16 to 3-12.|$|R
50|$|On 10 December 1876, {{three men}} and two women with Molly {{connections}} were attacked in their house by masked men. One woman in the house, wife {{of one of the}} Molly Maguires, was taken outside and shot dead. McParland was outraged that the information he had been providing had found its way into the hands of killers. McParland protested {{in a letter to his}} Pinkerton overseer which declared, in part:Now I <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to find that I am the murderer of Mrs. McAlister. What had a woman to do with the case - did the Maguires in their worst time shoot down women. If I was not here the Vigilante Committee would not know who was guilty and when I find them shooting women in their thirst for blood I hereby tender my resignation to take effect as soon as this message is received. It is not cowardice that makes me resign but just let them have it now I will no longer interfere as I see that one is the same as the other and I am not going to be an accessory to the murder of women and children. I am sure the Maguires will not spare the women so long as the Vigilante has shown an example.|$|R

5000|$|The {{victims had}} been {{secretly}} identified by McParland as Mollies. One {{of the men}} {{was killed in the}} house, and the other two supposed Mollies were wounded but able to escape. A woman, the wife of one of the reputed Mollies, was shot dead. McParland was outraged that the information he had been providing had found its way into the hands of indiscriminate killers. When McParland heard details of the attack at the house, he protested {{in a letter to his}} Pinkerton supervisor. He did not object that Mollies might be assassinated as a result of his labor spying [...] - [...] they [...] "got their just deserving". McParland resigned when it became apparent the vigilantes were willing to commit the [...] "murder of women and children", whom he deemed innocent victims. His letter stated: Friday: <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> at 8 A.M. I heard that a crowd of masked men had entered Mrs. O'Donnell's house ... and had killed James O'Donnell alias Friday, Charles O'Donnell and James McAllister, also Mrs. McAllister whom they took out of the house and shot ... Now as for the O'Donnells I am satisfied they got their just deserving. I reported what those men were. I give all information about them so clear that the courts could have taken hold of their case at any time but the witnesses were too cowardly to do it. I have also in the interests of God and humanity notified you months before some of those outrages were committed still the authorities took no hold of the matter.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{thesis that}} God exists necessarily I could as well not exist. Had I {{fallen from the}} cliff last year, I would not exist now. Furthermore, had my parents not met, or had God not created a universe, I would never have come into existence. At any rate, {{there are many ways}} the world could be without me, or even without anybody like me. It is, in this sense, possible that I do not exist. The same is true for the sparrow who <b>wake</b> me <b>up</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> the bread I had for breakfast, the sun, and the moon. All these things, like you and me, exist contingently. God has traditionally been taken to be different in this respect. Whilst a world without me is a perfectly possible alternative to the actual world, a world without God is not a possible alternative to the actual world. God ex-ists necessarily. Avicenna, Anselm of Canterbury, Thomas Aquinas, and John Duns Scotus, as well as many later authors, e. g. Leibniz, held this view in one or another form. 2 Anselm, for example, expressed this view by saying that God “cannot even be thought not to exist ” and that God, of all things...|$|R
