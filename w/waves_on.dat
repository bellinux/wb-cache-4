The {{acceleration of}} the hurricane concentrated the energy of its swells, resulting in high waves and storm surge across the Hawaiian Islands, though primarily near {{the path of the}} center. It is estimated the storm surge reached eight feet (two meters) on the south coast of Kauai. There, the surge reached 900feet (275m) inland, exceeding a 100-year flood event for the area. The heaviest rainfall reported from the island chain was from the Intake Wainiha 1086 site, where 20.33inches (516mm) was measured. Possible tornadoes were reported in association with a rain squall in Oahu. <b>Waves</b> <b>on</b> the coast of Oahu reached 16.4feet in height (3m), and <b>waves</b> <b>on</b> southern Kauai surpassed 30feet (9m) in height.|$|E

Though winds were reduced by the time Georges hit Cuba, it still retained winds of 75mph (120km/h), along with stronger gusts in squalls.

5|$|Allison made {{landfall}} with a {{storm surge}} {{of two to}} three feet. Combined with <b>waves</b> <b>on</b> top, areas of Galveston Island experienced a wall of water 8feet (2.5m) in height, creating overwash along the coastline. The storm caused winds of up to 43mph (69km/h) at the Galveston Pier. While Allison was stalling over Texas, it dropped heavy rainfall across the state, including 9.77inches (248mm) in Galveston, 12.13inches (308mm) in Jamaica Beach, Texas, and other similar totals along the coast. Minimal beach erosion was reported, and impact was minimal near the coast. While moving northward through Texas as a minimal tropical depression, Allison produced minor wind gusts. Shortly after making landfall, the storm spawned a tornado in Manvel of Brazoria County, causing damage to one home. Within hours of making landfall, rainfall totals of 8 to 12inches (200 to 300mm) were common in Galveston and Harris County. Flash flooding continued for days, with rainfall amounts across the state peaking at just over 40inches (1,033mm) in northwestern Jefferson County. In the Port of Houston, a total of 36.99inches (940mm) was reported.|$|E

Also on Nivalakita communications were cut with the telephone operator having to resort to sending a Morse code message, however as the storm re-curved and re-hit Tuvalu on June 14, it silenced the weak radio telegraph system. In Tepuka Savilivili the whole island was left uninhabitable as coconut trees and other vegetation were swept away with no more than an area of jagged coral left behind.|$|E

5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic <b>waves</b> <b>on</b> a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E
5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by frictional {{losses in the}} oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal <b>waves</b> <b>on</b> Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to making}} landfall, the storm {{produced}} strong <b>waves</b> <b>on</b> the Florida west coast. Following {{a summer of}} tropical moisture in Florida, Henri brought more heavy rainfall to the saturated state, peaking at 9.09in (230mm) in Hialeah in the southeast portion of the state. Two other areas experienced over 7in (180mm), though most areas received only light rainfall. In Hernando County, a stationary thunderstorm dropped over 5in (125mm) of rain in around an hour. It caused a rapid flooding of roads, though quickly retreated. Damage was minor, {{due to lack of}} many homes in the area. A feeder band in Charlotte County dropped 7in (180mm) of rain in three hours, flooding numerous streets and homes. Throughout Florida, damage was minimal, and there were no deaths. However, lightning from a feeder band injured a man in Lee County, while an indirect injury occurred from a car crash due to hydroplaning.|$|E

5|$|Roughly {{paralleling}} the North Carolina coast {{beginning on}} September26, Helene's slow movement and strong intensity resulted in moderate to heavy impacts in coastal {{areas of the}} state. Despite the hurricane's Category4 hurricane intensity, due to its closest approach to land remaining offshore, its storm surge remained less than initially forecast. The hurricane's track also placed its strongest storm surge in the eastern hemisphere of the storm, away from any landmasses. Surge heights peaked at 6ft (1.8m) near Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. In Wilmington, Helene produced ocean swells at the coast 2.5 – 3 times per minute, indicative of a strong hurricane. There, the cumulative sea level was roughly 9ft (2.7m) above normal. However, {{as a result of}} the storm striking at low tide, damage caused by storm surge was mostly mitigated. Despite this, sand dunes in southern areas of Fort Fisher, were mostly destroyed by <b>waves.</b> <b>On</b> Cedar Island, strong winds produced by the hurricane pushed waves inland, inundating homes. Elsewhere, minor beach erosion occurred.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen formed {{over the}} {{northern}} Bahamas on September 6. Early on September 7, it organized into Tropical Storm Ophelia, becoming a hurricane the next day.

The hurricane did not make landfall, although the western eyewall reached the coastal areas of North Carolina, causing extensive damage in the Outer Banks and around Cape Fear. Ophelia moved north and became extratropical late on September 17 near Nova Scotia, but it continued northeastward, producing strong winds and heavy rain over Atlantic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Larry was one {{of eight}} storms to hit Mexico from either the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, the highest since the record of nine in 1971.
