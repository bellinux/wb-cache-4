40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the costs <b>of</b> third-pillar individual <b>pension</b> plans currently available in Italy, namely pension insurance policies and open pension funds, which are new {{products in the}} Italian savings market. For lack of data on annuities, the analysis {{is limited to the}} accumulation phase. To evaluate costs, we use different simulation scenarios, changing the length of the contribution period and the gross returns attainable on financial markets; we also consider participants with different life income and contribution profiles. Following international literature, we present cost measures which reflect the reduction in both the final accumulated pension wealth and the annual rate of return. The main result of our analysis is the existence of a substantial dichotomy in the market. On one side, open pension funds have moderate costs, close to those <b>of</b> voluntary <b>pension</b> plans in other countries and also to those of the Italian occupational pension funds (i. e. the second pillar). On the other, individual insurance policies are burdened by significantly higher charges. We consider different possible rationales for these costs, including the fact that the market is at a very early stage of development, without reaching a completely satisfactory explanation. Finally, we also study the possible regressive feature of the fee structure and the unfavourable treatment <b>of</b> early <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> private <b>pension</b> assets; we conclude that both are indeed present in the majority of products, but that their impact is fairly limited.

40|$|In {{the past}} 30 years, {{consumers}} of financial services firms have {{been victims of}} three major waves of offences in the UK. First, the gradual <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the Conservative government from pension provision, coupled with deregulation of the retail financial services sector {{in the latter half}} of the 1980 s, created the conditions for a wave <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> mis-selling. Companies launcehed into a hard sell, wrongly advising many clients to cash in their existing pensions contributions and transfer them to new, private schemes about which they received false information. One survey conducted by the Securities and Investments Board found that only 9 % <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> companies had complied with legal requirements when originally advising on these pensions transfers. Meanwhile, although breaches had first been uncovered in 1990, a KPMG survey <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> advice given during 1991 - 93 revealed that in "four out <b>of</b> five cases", <b>pensions</b> companies were still giving advice short of legal standards (Slapper and Tombs, 1999, p 63). Early in 1998, the then new regulatory body, the ?Financial Services Authority (since 2012, the Financial Conduct Authority), estimated the final costs of mis-selling as around £ 11 billion, with some 2. 4 million victims...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{alternative}} pension systems preserve retirement benefits when individuals change jobs {{has long been a}} consideration in evaluating vari-ous retirement saving arrangements. Related preservation issues have also been raised with respect to targeted retirement saving accounts, such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401 (k) plans, which permit contributors to withdraw funds, subject to a tax penalty, before they reach retirement age. As the incidence of targeted retirement saving plans increases, the number of tax-payers with the potential to trigger such withdrawals will also increase. Al-though a number of previous studies, including our own (1994 a, 1995), have examined the determinants of participation and contribution behavior in retire-ment saving plans, withdrawal behavior has received much less attention. The incidence and disposition <b>of</b> <b>withdrawals</b> from <b>pension</b> plans or other saving plans, known as lump-sum distributions, is a key determinant of the financial status of elderly households. Consider a 35 -year-old who has accu-mulated $ 10, 000 in a defined contribution pension plan, and who changes jobs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{an ideal}} pension {{system that would}} prevent an increase in net pension liabilities and redress intergenerational inequalities. The direction <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> system reform that this paper proposes is to limit the amount <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> benefits to the sum of premiums, state contributions, and yields on investment of reserves, and also to minimize {{the burden on the}} insured of premium payments. This reform would have roughly the same effect as a switchover to a funded system. It will be, however, no easy task to carry out this kind of reform, because the reform requires a politically unacceptable step: to request those generations already receiving pensions and those who have paid pension premiums to accept reductions in the amount <b>of</b> <b>pension</b> that the government has pledged to pay. One possible means to deal with this problem is to withdraw the reserve funds, which are now over 100 trillion yen. However, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the reserves would reduce the opportunity of future generations to use the funds and yields on investment of the funds. Any attempt to reform the pension system will cause conflicts of interests between generations. This is why the government should positively disclose the outlook for its pension finance, mainly net pension liabilities, and information about intergenerational disparities to provide the public with data for objective discussions on a more desirable form <b>of</b> public <b>pension.</b> net pension liabilities, intergenerational equity...|$|R

40|$|Private pension {{provision}} {{faces the}} challenging task of providing stable income streams during retirement. The challenge has increased markedly {{in the last}} decades due to volatile financial markets, falling interest rates and the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> employers and external insurers as risk bearers of systematic financial and longevity risks. Partly because of these developments, policyholders desire pensions tailored to their individual needs. This paper proposes {{a new type of}} pension: the Personal Pension with Risk sharing (PPR). By unbundling and valuing the investment, (dis) saving, insurance and risk‐sharing functions <b>of</b> <b>pensions,</b> PPRs allow risk management and (dis) saving to be customized to the specific features of heterogeneous individuals. Moreover, unlike variable annuities, PPRs allow investment risks to be combined with longevity insurance without giving rise to high year‐on‐year volatility in consumption streams or opaque and rigid valuation and smoothing rules. The unbundling of functions in the PPR also deepens the internal markets for financial and insurance products {{while at the same time}} accommodating the diverse traditions of countries in terms <b>of</b> occupational <b>pension</b> provision. Finally, the PPR reconciles financial, fiscal and macroeconomic stability with growth by increasing the supply of long‐term risk‐bearing and illiquid capital, complementing public retirement provision, reducing the interest‐rate sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>pensions</b> and smoothing shocks...|$|R
