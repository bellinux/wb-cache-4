5|$|Although the Brut y Tywysogion (The Chronicle of the Princes), a Latin {{chronicle of}} events, which survives in Welsh translations, {{may have been}} <b>written</b> <b>at</b> Strata Florida Abbey, {{it may have been}} kept in Llanbadarn in the {{eleventh}} century, due to Llanbadarn’s scriptorium and its reputation as a centre of learning.|$|E
5|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was <b>written</b> <b>at</b> a {{more rapid}} pace than the band's {{previous}} album. Prior to the Chili Peppers relocation into the mansion, Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated at each other's homes, {{in order to}} arrange song structures and guitar riffs. They would then present ideas to Flea and Smith, and the band would, as a whole, decide what they would use for the bass, guitar, vocal and percussion ensembles.|$|E
5|$|Jane and Kingsley {{lived at}} Lemmons with Jane's mother and brother, two artist friends, and Kingsley's three children, {{including}} the novelist Martin Amis.

5|$|Nine manuscripts {{survive in}} whole or in part, though not all are of equal {{historical}} value and none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was <b>written</b> <b>at</b> Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. Almost all of the material in the Chronicle {{is in the form of}} annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC (the annals' date for Caesar's invasions of Britain), and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was <b>written,</b> <b>at</b> which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|A {{manuscript}} {{of the first}} quarter of the ninth century, Vatican Pal. lat. 899 (Codex Palatinus), known as P, and its direct and indirect copies. P was <b>written</b> <b>at</b> Lorsch in Caroline minuscule. The text in this manuscript has several lacunae marked with dots indicating the missing letters, a confusion in the order of the biographies between Verus and Alexander, and the transposition of several passages: two long ones which correspond to a quire of the original which became loose and was then inserted in a wrong place, and a similar transposition in Carus. P is also distinguished by a succession of six centuries of editorial corrections, beginning with the original scribe, and includes such worthies as Petrarch and Poggio Bracciolini; none of these editors betray any knowledge of any other witness.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} operas, Wagner {{composed}} relatively {{few pieces of}} music. These include a symphony in C major (<b>written</b> <b>at</b> the age of 19), the Faust Overture (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some overtures, and choral and piano pieces. His most commonly performed work {{that is not an}} extract from an opera is the Siegfried Idyll for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the Ring cycle. The Wesendonck Lieder are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment. More rarely performed are the American Centennial March (1876), and Das Liebesmahl der Apostel (The Love Feast of the Apostles), a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.|$|E

5|$|Coleridge {{began writing}} The Eolian Harp on 20 August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. Like his previous poem Lines <b>Written</b> <b>at</b> Shurton Bars, the poem discusses both his engagement and his future marriage. Coleridge {{was inspired to}} write the poem after {{a visit to a}} house in Clevedon that would serve as his and Fricker's home after their marriage. As Coleridge worked on the poem, he and Fricker were married and they moved to the Clevedon home. During this time, Coleridge held an idealised view of his life with Fricker, and these thoughts work their way into the poem. The poem was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections. Of his poems for the 1796 collection, Coleridge felt that The Eolian Harp was his favourite.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the general}} custom of Europe {{in the late}} {{classical}} and early Middle Ages, he was popularly recognised after his death as a saint, along with several hundred other Welsh men and women. But the date and circumstances of {{the foundation of the}} church, and of Padarn's life were long forgotten when it was decided in the twelfth century that he should be commemorated in a Vita or Latin Life, following the example of the Life of St David <b>written</b> <b>at</b> Llanbadarn about 1090. That in turn had followed a European tradition of writing such lives. They are not biographies as we understand them today. Instead they were hagiographies, designed to elevate the saint’s status as a holy person of miraculous achievements.|$|E
5|$|From 1707 to 1708, Bach was the organist {{at one of}} Mühlhausen's {{principal}} churches, Divi Blasii, {{dedicated to}} St Blaise, where he composed some of his earliest surviving cantatas. One or two early cantatas, for example Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150, may have been <b>written</b> <b>at</b> Arnstadt, his previous residence, for a performance at Mühlhausen. He composed Gott ist mein König for a church service that was held annually to celebrate the inauguration of a new town council.|$|E

5|$|Miyazaki's manga {{version of}} Nausicaä was written {{over a period}} of 12 years, with breaks taken to work on Studio Ghibli films. Serialized in Tokuma Shoten's Animage magazine, the first chapter was {{published}} in February 1982 and the last chapter in March 1994. Miyazaki adapted and altered the work for the film because only sixteen chapters of the manga were <b>written</b> <b>at</b> the time of the film's production. The manga would continue to be produced until the seventh and final book was released on 15 January 1995. The English localization was initially done by Toren Smith and Dana Lewis of Studio Proteus. After Miyazaki resumed production of the manga, Viz Media chose a new team and continued to release the rest of manga.|$|E
5|$|Pasties {{have been}} {{mentioned}} in multiple literary works since the 12th century Arthurian romance Erec and Enide, written by Chrétien de Troyes, {{in which they are}} eaten by characters from the area now known as Cornwall. There is a mention in Havelok the Dane, another romance <b>written</b> <b>at</b> the end of the thirteenth century; in the 14th century Robin Hood tales; in Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales; and in three plays by William Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, <b>written</b> <b>at</b> a time women were beginning {{to have the right}} to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E

5|$|Shepseskare is {{completely}} absent from another king list {{dating to the}} same period: the Abydos king list, written {{during the reign of}} Seti I (1294–1279 BC). He is also absent from the Turin canon (reign of Ramses II), although in this case a lacuna affects the papyrus on which the list is <b>written</b> <b>at</b> the place where Shepseskare and Neferefre's names should have been. Of the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list, only one reign length is still legible and it has been variously read as one year, eleven years or one to four months. The damaged state of the papyrus also makes it impossible to decide safely whose reign length this is.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Rules, first {{drawn up}} at Cambridge University in 1848, were {{particularly}} {{influential in the}} development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were <b>written</b> <b>at</b> Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.|$|E
5|$|The James Bond {{literary}} franchise is {{a series}} of novels and short stories, first published in 1953 by Ian Fleming, a British author, journalist, and former naval intelligence officer. James Bond, often referred to by his code name, 007, is a British Secret Service agent; the character was created by journalist and author Ian Fleming, and first appeared in his 1953 novel Casino Royale; the books are set in a contemporary period, between May 1951 and February 1964. Fleming went on to write a total of twelve novels and two collections of short stories, all <b>written</b> <b>at</b> his Jamaican home Goldeneye and published annually. Two of his books were published after his death in 1964.|$|E

5|$|The King's School, Canterbury claims Augustine as its founder, {{which would}} make it the world's oldest {{existing}} school, but the first documentary records of the school date from the 16th century. Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the East Anglian mission. Augustine received liturgical books from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They may have been some of the new mass books that were being <b>written</b> <b>at</b> this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, {{but it would have been}} a form of the Latin language liturgy in use at Rome.|$|E
5|$|The Liber Eliensis is a 12th-century English chronicle and history, {{written in}} Latin. Composed in three books, it was <b>written</b> <b>at</b> Ely Abbey {{on the island}} of Ely in the fenlands of eastern Cambridgeshire. Ely Abbey became the cathedral of a newly formed bishopric in 1109. Traditionally the author of the {{anonymous}} work has been given as Richard or Thomas, two monks at Ely, one of whom, Richard, has been identified with an official of the monastery, but some historians hold that neither Richard nor Thomas was the author.|$|E
5|$|The Liber {{covers the}} period from the {{founding}} of the abbey in 673 until the middle of the 12th century, building on earlier historical works. It incorporates documents and stories of saints' lives. The work typifies a type of local history produced during {{the latter part of the}} 12th century. Similar books were <b>written</b> <b>at</b> other English monasteries. The longest of the contemporary local histories, the Liber chronicles the devastation that the Anarchy caused during the reign of King Stephen. It also documents the career of Nigel, the Bishop of Ely from 1133 to 1169, and his disputes with King Stephen. Other themes include the miracles worked by the monastery's patron saint, Æthelthryth, and gifts of land to Ely.|$|E
