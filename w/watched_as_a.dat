They obviously {{did not expect to}} encounter any Americans. Creger radioed Bouck and told him of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck's position. Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using a more direct route. As he returned to the American lines, he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Lamason {{was among}} a group of 168 allied airmen from Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Jamaica who -- along with over 2,500 French prisoners -- were taken by train—in overcrowded cattle boxcars — from Fresnes Prison outside Paris, to Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp. As the airmen were herded into the boxcars, Lamason protested about the poor treatment of the airmen, only to be struck in the face by a SS guard. Lamason fell to the ground and captured pilot Roy Allen <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> SS Major pulled a Luger from his holster and thought Lamason would be shot on the spot. After five days travel, during which the airmen received very little food or water, they arrived at Buchenwald on 20 August 1944.|$|E

5|$|Lilly Wachowski, after {{completing}} her gender transition, {{decided to take}} some time off and did not return as writer or director for the second season, although she remained active as co-creator. Straczynski, who had a very active role during season 1 from pre-production to post-production in order to assist the Wachowskis with their first foray into TV, said his primary involvement in season 2 finished with the completion of the writing phase, as Lana felt this time she had the required experience to tackle the filmmaking aspect of the show on her own. He also said that the second season was designed to explore the mythology of sensates, introduce other clusters, and provide answers to many of the questions viewers had after the first season. Lana {{came up with the idea}} of making the first episode of the second season a two-hour Christmas special, because of her love for such programming in the television shows that she <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> kid, such as Hill Street Blues, Mork & Mindy, and All My Children. Lana explained she enjoyed watching the lives of the characters in specials intersect with her own and considered birthdays, holidays and celebrations unique events for their ability to make one feel connected but also isolated and alone.|$|E

25|$|When he {{was still}} in college, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane created a cartoon short called The Life of Larry. The short {{centered}} around a middle-aged man named Larry and his anthropomorphic dog Steve. He made a sequel called Larry & Steve, which Cartoon Network broadcast in 1997. In 1999, MacFarlane was working for Hanna-Barbara Studios, writing for shows such as Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Laboratory, and Cow and Chicken. The short caught the eye of 20th Century Fox representatives, who asked him to create a TV series revolving around the characters. MacFarlane received a US$50,000 budget to develop a pilot for the show, which was about one twentieth of what most pilots cost. MacFarlane claims to have drawn inspiration from several sitcoms, namely The Simpsons and All in the Family. Several premises were also carried over from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child, namely The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang, and Rubik, the Amazing Cube.|$|E
25|$|EastEnders is the BBC's most {{consistent}} programme {{in terms of}} ratings. It has proved highly popular and Appreciation Indexes reflected this, rising from 55–60 at the launch to 85–95 later on, a figure which was nearly ten points {{higher than the average}} for a British soap opera. Research suggested that people found the characters true to life, the plots believable and, importantly in the face of criticism of the content, people <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> family and regarded it as viewing for all the family. Based on market research by BBC commissioning in 2003, EastEnders is most watched by 60- to 74-year-olds, closely followed by 45- to 59-year-olds. An average EastEnders episode attracts a total audience share between 35 and 40 percent. The same-day repeat showing on BBC Three attracted an average of 500,000 viewers, whilst the Sunday omnibus generally attracted 3 million. EastEnders {{is one of the more}} popular programmes on British television and while the show's ratings have fallen since its initial surge in popularity and the advent of multichannel digital television, the programme continues to be successful for the BBC. EastEnders two main rivals are ITV soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale.|$|E

500|$|Executives at Fox saw the Larry {{shorts and}} {{contracted}} MacFarlane {{to create a}} series, entitled Family Guy, based on the characters. Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, {{and gave him a}} budget of $50,000. Several aspects of Family Guy were inspired by the Larry shorts. While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian. MacFarlane stated that the difference between The Life of Larry and Family Guy was that [...] "Life of Larry was shown primarily in my dorm room and Family Guy was shown after the Super Bowl." [...] After the pilot aired, the series was given the green light. MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as The Simpsons and All in the Family. Premises were drawn from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> child, such as The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang and Rubik, the Amazing Cube.|$|E
500|$|The 1988 film [...] {{captured}} the Los Angeles scene of successful and aspiring bands. It also highlighted {{the excesses of}} glam metal, particularly the scene in which W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes was interviewed while drinking vodka on a floating chair {{in a swimming pool}} as his mother <b>watched.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, it has been seen as helping to create a backlash against the genre. In the early 1990s glam metal's popularity rapidly declined after nearly a decade of success. Successful bands lost members that were key to their songwriting and/or live performances, such as Mötley Crue's frontman Vince Neil, Poison guitarist C.C. DeVille, Def Leppard guitarist Steve Clark and Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin. Several music writers and musicians began to deride glam metal acts as [...] "hair farmers," [...] hinting at the soon-to-be-popularized term [...] "hair metal". Another reason for the decline in popularity of the style may have been the declining [...] popularity of the power ballad. While its use, especially after a hard-rocking anthem, was initially a successful formula, in the late 1980s and early 1990s audiences lost interest in this approach.|$|E
