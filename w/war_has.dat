5|$|Abraham Lincoln's service {{during the}} Black Hawk <b>War</b> <b>has</b> {{been a source}} of {{discrepancies}} and questioning, with two major battle sites being affiliated with Lincoln in the aftermath of combat. A number of sources assert that on June 26, 1832, the morning after the second battle, members of the company of Captain Jacob M. Early arrived at Kellogg's Grove to help bury the dead. One of the soldiers in the company was Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln assisted with the burial and later made a statement about the experience that has been connected with both the battle at Kellogg's Grove and the fight at Stillman's Run.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, <b>war</b> <b>has</b> a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

5|$|As the Vanir {{are often}} {{considered}} fertility gods, the Æsir–Vanir <b>War</b> <b>has</b> been proposed {{as a reflection}} of the invasion of local fertility cults somewhere in regions inhabited by the Germanic peoples by a more aggressive, warlike cult. This has been proposed as an analogy of the invasion of the Indo-Europeans. Georges Dumézil stated that the war need not necessarily be understood in terms of historicity more than any other myth however.|$|E
5|$|During {{its debut}} {{week in the}} United Kingdom, the game reached #3 in the charts, {{described}} as a respectable debut. In their financial report in April 2005, Eidos reported that Invisible War was among the titles to have sold between 500,000 and one million copies since release, placing it among their successful titles. As of April 2011, Invisible <b>War</b> <b>has</b> sold over 1.2 million copies worldwide, placing it above the original game in terms of copies sold.|$|E
5|$|During the game's present, the <b>war</b> <b>has</b> ended but {{tensions}} are still high on both sides. The game's primary setting is the Okanos region at the Thirteen Towers, a giant fortress suspended above a giant chasm called the Scar, {{held in place}} by thirteen giant chains said to keep the Scar from growing. Initially built five centuries before, a disastrous magical experiment caused the Towers to be infested by monsters. Fifty years {{prior to the start of}} the game, a new experiment involving the monsters triggers the Scar's creation.|$|E

50|$|Civil wars {{since the}} end of World <b>War</b> II <b>have</b> lasted on average just over four years, a {{dramatic}} rise from the one-and-a-half-year average of the 1900-1944 period. While the rate of emergence of new civil <b>wars</b> <b>has</b> been relatively steady since the mid-19th century, the increasing length of those <b>wars</b> <b>has</b> resulted in increasing numbers of wars ongoing at any one time. For example, there were no more than five civil wars underway simultaneously {{in the first half of}} the 20th century while there were over 20 concurrent civil wars close to the end of the Cold War. Since 1945, civil <b>wars</b> <b>have</b> resulted in the deaths of over 25 million people, as well as the forced displacement of millions more. Civil <b>wars</b> <b>have</b> further resulted in economic collapse; Somalia, Burma (Myanmar), Uganda and Angola are examples of nations that were considered to have had promising futures before being engulfed in civil wars.|$|R
5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold <b>War</b> <b>has</b> ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E

Firaxis took the popularity of Long War to add built-in support for modding into the sequel XCOM 2, and used Long War Studios to provide initial add-ons for the game at release. On 19 January 2017, Long War Studios, now known as Pavonis Interactive, released Long War 2 for XCOM 2.|$|E
5|$|Pontiac's <b>War</b> <b>has</b> {{traditionally}} been {{portrayed as a}} defeat for the Native Americans, but scholars now usually {{view it as a}} military stalemate: while the Native Americans had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer the Native Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. The Native Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the Native Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.|$|E

5|$|Sun Tzu's Art of <b>War</b> <b>has</b> {{influenced}} many notable figures.

In the 20th century, the Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong partially credited his 1949 victory over Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang to The Art of War. The work strongly influenced Mao's writings about guerrilla warfare, which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world.|$|E
5|$|The Cold War {{was a major}} political, {{economic}} and military endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically {{by the end of}} Reagan's presidency. The significance of Reagan's role in ending the Cold <b>War</b> <b>has</b> spurred contentious and opinionated debate. That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the Soviet Union is agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The marked {{spread of}} dengue {{during and after}} the Second World <b>War</b> <b>has</b> been {{attributed}} to ecologic disruption. The same trends also led to the spread of different serotypes of the disease to new areas, and to the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever. This severe form of the disease was first reported in the Philippines in 1953; by the 1970s, it had become a major cause of child mortality and had emerged in the Pacific and the Americas. Dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first noted in Central and South America in 1981, as DENV-2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with DENV-1 several years earlier.|$|E

5|$|At the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romanian woman, Marichka, who {{provides}} {{a room where}} Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd finds them in their room, and informs Theo and Kee that <b>war</b> <b>has</b> broken out between the British Army and the refugees, including the Fishes. Having learned {{that they have a}} bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Marichka and Theo fight him off and escape. Amidst the fighting, the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment under heavy fire where he confronts Luke, who is then killed by a tank shell, and escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the combatants temporarily stop fighting; staring at the screaming baby, they allow the group to leave. Marichka leads Theo, Kee, and the baby to a boat in a sewer, and Theo rows away whilst Marichka stays behind.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the British Empire had {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication. As England continued to form new colonies, these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and {{its status as a}} superpower following the Second World <b>War</b> <b>has,</b> along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet. By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{armistice}} on 27July 1953, the squadron remained in South Korea on garrison duties—initially at Kimpo, later at Kunsan—until transferring to Iwakuni on 12October 1954. It departed for Australia on 19November and arrived in Sydney on 3December, having been based overseas for eleven years, {{a record for}} an RAAF unit. Its performance {{in the early days}} of the <b>war</b> <b>has</b> been cited as a factor in the United States' decision to ratify the ANZUS treaty in September 1951. The squadron's casualty rate in Korea was twenty-five percent killed or captured. Forty-one pilots died, thirty-five from the RAAF and six on exchange from the Royal Air Force. A further seven pilots became prisoners of war. Aircraft losses totalled almost sixty, including over forty Meteors, mostly to ground fire. The squadron flew 18,872 sorties, including 3,872 in Mustangs and 15,000 in Meteors. It was credited with shooting down five MiG-15s and destroying 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, ninety-eight railway engines and carriages, and sixteen bridges.|$|E

5|$|In Malaysia, {{a similar}} price war caused {{controversy}} regarding {{sales of the}} book. Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90, while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90. The move by the bookstores {{was seen as an}} attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price <b>war</b> <b>has</b> ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour are selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and fair trade.|$|E
5|$|Long War is {{a partial}} {{conversion}} mod for XCOM: Enemy Unknown and XCOM: Enemy Within. It was first uploaded to NexusMods on 4 January 2013, and exited beta {{with the release}} of version 1.0 on 28 December 2015. The developers announced in July 2015 with beta 15f2 that they had finished adding new features, and that any future releases would only correct bugs or balance issues. At the time that it exited beta, the mod's development was led by four core members, JohnnyLump (John J. Lumpkin), Amineri (Rachel Norman), XMarksTheSpot, and Ellatan (Alex Rozenfeld). They were joined by four senior contributors, 20 voice actors, and 29 contributors assisting with programming, art, sound engineering, translations, research, and porting the mod to Mac and Linux. Three members of Firaxis Games also provided assistance. The team released separate versions for Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within until the end of 2013, and thereafter only released versions for Enemy Within. Long <b>War</b> <b>has</b> been downloaded from NexusMods over 900,000 times by over 333,000 separate users.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{symbolism}} included in memorials was political in tone, and politics {{played an important}} part in their construction. Many memorials were embroiled in local ethnic and religious tensions, with memorials either reflecting the contribution of particular groups to the conflict or being rejected entirely by others. In several countries it proved difficult to produce memorials that appealed to and included the religious and political views of all of a community. The Fascist governments that came to power in Italy and Germany during the inter-war period made the construction of memorials a key part of their political programme, resulting in a number of larger memorial projects with strong national overtones being constructed in the 1930s. While few memorials embraced a pacifist perspective, some anti-war campaigners used the memorials for rallies and meetings. Many of the political tensions of the inter-war period had diminished {{by the end of the}} 20th century, allowing some countries to commemorate the events of the war through memorials for the first time since the end of the war. In the centennial of World War I, the memory of the <b>war</b> <b>has</b> become a major theme for scholars and museums.|$|E
