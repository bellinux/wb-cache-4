5|$|Alexander the Great trained {{his foot}} {{soldiers}} to injure {{the animals and}} cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. Ptolemy, {{who was one of}} Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor Ptolemy II (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in Nubia. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period. The Greek king Pyrrhus used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took elephants across the Alps during his war with the Romans and reached the Po Valley in 217 BC <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> alive, but they later succumbed to disease.|$|E
5|$|European {{exploration}} of the future site of Wagga Wagga began in 1829 {{with the arrival of}} Captain Charles Sturt during his expedition along the Murrumbidgee River. Settlers arrived shortly thereafter with Charles Tompson establishing the Eunonyhareenyha 'run' on the north bank of the river in 1832, and then in soon after George Best establishing the Wagga Wagga 'run' on the south bank. Other settlers followed, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> initially squatting on the land illegally but by 1836 the colonial government regulated the tenure of land and established a licensing scheme. Within a few years settlers numbers increased greatly and before 1850 a local bench of magistrates and a place for holding petty sessions was established. The beginnings of a village formed near the ford used by most traffic passing through the area and included a crude blacksmith's shop, a hotel, and a post office. By 1849 the town was marked out by surveyor Thomas Scott Townsend and formally gazetted as a village.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, the 3-series was introduced, {{continuing}} the main {{models of the}} 2-series. In 1990, the new L113 became available, with a longitudinally rear-mounted engine which was inclined 60° to the left, to make a lower height than the K113. The 4-series was launched in 1997, continuing all model characteristics from the 3-series, but <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> being just modular configurations of the basic chassis. The 8.5-litre engine {{was replaced by a}} 9-litre, and the 11-litre was replaced by an 11.7-litre. They were joined by a 10.6-litre engine in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The Helsinki Metro, {{opened in}} 1982, {{is the only}} metro system in Finland, albeit the Helsinki {{commuter}} rail trains operate at metro-like frequencies. In 2006, {{the construction of the}} long debated extension of the metro into Western Helsinki and Espoo was approved, and serious debate about an eastern extension into Sipoo has taken place. Helsinki's metro system currently consists of 17 stations, with six of them being underground. Once the western expansion is completed, seven new metro stations will be opened, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> being underground. As of May 2017, the opening of the Metro expansion has been delayed until autumn 2017.|$|E

His final appearance is in the book's epilogue, at King's Cross Station, talking loudly about broom regulations.|$|E
25|$|In many ways, {{this shift}} {{mirrored}} the German idea of Gebrauchsmusik ("music for use"), as composers sought to create music {{that could serve}} a utilitarian as well as artistic purpose. This approach encompassed two trends: first, music that students could easily learn, and second, music which would have wider appeal, such as incidental music for plays, movies, radio, etc. Toward this end, Copland provided musical advice and inspiration to The Group Theatre, a company which also attracted Stella Adler, Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg. Philosophically an outgrowth of Stieglitz and his ideals, the Group focused on socially-relevant plays by the American authors. Through it and later his work in film, Copland met several major American playwrights, including Thornton Wilder, William Inge, Arthur Miller, and Edward Albee, and considered projects <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although it {{agrees with}} all the other Scandinavian sources in telling the story of Halga's incestuous {{relationship}} with his daughter Yrsa, it disagrees <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and with Beowulf by removing Hrothgar altogether as the king of Denmark. Instead, his place is taken by his brother Halga, and Hrothgar is sent to Northumberland, where he marries Ögn, the daughter of a positively fictive king Norðri who is named after Northumberland (Norðimbraland). Opinion is divided on whether there is any connection between Hrothgar's wife Wealhþeow in Beowulf and his wife Ögn in Hrólfr Kraki's saga; {{it has been suggested that}} Ögn shows that Wealhþeow and her family (the Helmings) were Anglo-Saxon. Another difference is that Hrothgar's sons Hreðric and Hroðmund do not appear in the Scandinavian tradition, but correspond to Agnar, in Hrólfr Kraki's saga.|$|E
25|$|U-517 {{continued}} to track LN-7 towards the Strait of Belle Isle. Following U-517s attack, air cover was strengthened {{in the area}} and beginning on 3 September, a Digby bomber from No. 10 Squadron RCAF was deployed to the area. The Digby caught U-517 on the surface and dropped four depth charges, missing <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> One of the depth charges blew up on contact with the water and fragments damaged the wing of the aircraft. The U-boat submerged before the depth charges hit and suffered no damage. Thirty minutes after the air attack, Trail arrived on scene and U-517 and turned towards Anticosti Island. Further U-boat attacks on convoys, with the strongest on 6 September on Convoy QS-33, transiting the Gulf and St. Lawrence River would force the Royal Canadian Navy to dedicate more powerful ships to convoy escort. On 9 September, the Royal Canadian Navy informed the Allies that St. Lawrence ports were to be closed to international shipping.|$|E

25|$|The Parade Commander will {{command the}} Parade contingents {{to prepare for}} the Marchpast, and will then march out of the Parade Grounds, with the bands {{bringing}} the rear. In the National Day Parade, 2009, there was a City Marchpast where the contingents marched around the Central Business District, with the march ending at the F1 Pit Building. In the National Day Parade, 2010, the City Marchpast made its second appearance and this time the Marina Bay area was the venue for this, with the Marina Padang as the final stop on the march past. 2011 saw the reinstatement of the march through the stands moment of the supporting contingents of the SAF, SPF and SCDF (previously done in the 2002 edition and now called the Onward March), and that year the participants of the youth uniformed groups and the civilian contingents marched out in a different way, only for all of them to reunite for the City Marchpast later on. The 2012 edition of the parade, the very first National Day Parade officiated by the President Tony Tan Keng Yam, had the Onward March which was now done for the second time by all of the youth uniformed groups present while the military and civilian supporting contingents marched out in a different way similar to the march pasts during the 2000 and 2010 editions <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> rejoining for the City Marchpast to be done later with the GOH contingent battalion to Marina Bay Sands where the march ended.
