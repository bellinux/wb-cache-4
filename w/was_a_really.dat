5|$|The band began {{production}} on Parachutes in late 1999, after producing & releasing The Blue Room EP with British record producer Chris Allison. Allison {{was asked to}} assist with production, and the band's musical direction, which was desired by both the band & the A department. Production started with the track 'High Speed', {{which was part of}} the EP and was later re-released as a part of Parachutes. Allison describes 'High Speed' as thus: 'You'll notice it is quite a bit different to the other tracks, because there are other sounds going on in it: we wanted to mix a soundscape in with the classic rock sound on that particular track. I thought 'High Speed' <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good marriage between the classic rock sound and the new sound that was developing out of it, something that was more atmospheric'. Seven tracks in all were recorded during the sessions at Orinoco studios in London, with three of them ending up on The Blue Room EP.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden, and {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. This was the first episode Scott directed for the show. Crittenden also made her debut as a writer for The Simpsons in this episode. Crittenden was taking a beginners' writing program at 20th Century Fox when former The Simpsons showrunner David Mirkin hired her on the show. Crittenden's only writing experience before that had been as an intern on the Late Show with David Letterman. 20th Century Fox introduced Crittenden to Mirkin, and Mirkin read a script of hers that he liked. When Mirkin first talked to Crittenden, he thought she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> nice woman who was very mature. Crittenden was only 23 {{years old at the}} time, but Mirkin liked her and he hired her.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was and so it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass {{at the time and}} me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

500|$|The show's main characters, Olivia, Peter, and Walter, were core of {{the concept}} for Fringe.

They were able to provide the characters with backstories that, like with other long-term plot elements, could be alluded to over several episodes and seasons.|$|E

I loved my little bump. My reckless hubbie had had a motorbike accident, in which a baby was injured, after promising to give the bikes up.

So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics.

UGO Networks writer Alex Zalben compared [...] "What Lies Below" [...] to the similarly-plotted The X-Files episode [...] "Ice".
