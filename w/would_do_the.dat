5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same.|$|E
5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E

5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's other children and the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains up the steep climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives that <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> main haulage from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in the country, with a single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|E

5|$|By February {{the next}} year, {{construction}} had resumed. On 8 April 25men {{working on the}} bridge went on strike. This was of concern due to time dependent concreting being undertaken at that time. As the construction was considered unemployment relief, the constructing authority began to look for men who <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> work in their places. By 13 April, further details had emerged; {{the number of the}} men on strike was actually 32, and it had been caused by the alleged wrongful dismissal of three men who had left for their lunch break early. The strike continued until at least 21 April. Work had resumed by early May, and the bridge was reported as being a little over half completed at that time.|$|E
5|$|Dax helps Worf save Kor, and {{afterwards}} takes {{possession of the}} sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot be trusted with it. The three make camp and sleep through the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport blocker so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Regional Plan Association {{advocated}} for {{an extension of}} the BMT Canarsie Line from Eighth Avenue to Jersey City under the Hudson River. The tunnel under the Hudson would have cost $40,000,000. The extension would have provided access to commuter railroads in New Jersey as most lines converged there, and the lines that didn't would be rerouted to stop there. The RPA also suggested having a parking lot there for access from the Pulaski Skyway and the New Jersey Turnpike. It was suggested that either the New York City Transit Authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey or the Bi-State Metropolitan Rapid Transit Commission <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> construction.|$|E

5|$|Some {{time after}} his return, and before 293, Diocletian {{transferred}} {{command of the}} war against Carausius from Maximian to Flavius Constantius, a former Governor of Dalmatia and a man of military experience stretching back to Aurelian's campaigns against Zenobia (272–73). He was Maximian's praetorian prefect in Gaul, and the husband to Maximian's daughter, Theodora. On 1 March 293 at Milan, Maximian gave Constantius the office of caesar. In the spring of 293, in either Philippopolis (Plovdiv, Bulgaria) or Sirmium, Diocletian <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same for Galerius, husband to Diocletian's daughter Valeria, and perhaps Diocletian's Praetorian Prefect. Constantius was assigned Gaul and Britain. Galerius was initially assigned Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and responsibility for the eastern borderlands.|$|E
5|$|The Roar {{missed the}} finals {{in the first}} two A-League seasons, {{finishing}} sixth in 2005–06 and fifth in 2006–07 on goal difference to Sydney FC, who finished fourth. In the 2007–08 season the roar finished in 4th placed in the regular season and 3rd place after the finals series, and in 2008–09 the team finished 3rd on the ladder but again were eliminated in the finals, finishing 3rd. The Roar would suffer their worst season to date in 2009–10, finishing 2nd last on the ladder of 10 teams. This would all change a season later, where the Roar <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> double by winning both the premiership and championship, topping the cake with an Australian sporting record of 28 unbeaten games {{at the end of the}} season, which continued into the 2011–12 A-League season, ending at 36 games. The record was brought to an end by Sydney FC on a wet and windy afternoon in Sydney's west by 2 goals to nil.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg led an {{incursion}} into Ottoman territory near Ohrid {{with the}} aid of Venetian forces under a condottiero named Antonio da Cosenza, also known as Cimarosto, on 6 September 1464. Together, they defeated the Ottoman forces under Şeremet bey stationed there on 14 or 15 September. The Venetian Senate informed the Hungarians the joint Albanian-Venetian success on 29 September. Mehmed, sensing the weakness in his frontier, assigned Ballaban Badera as commander, replacing Şeremet. Ballaban was an Albanian by birth who had been incorporated into the Ottoman army through the devşirme system and was sanjakbey of the Sanjak of Ohrid in 1464 and 1465. In the meantime, Pope Paul II began planning his own crusade, but with means different from his predecessor. He planned to get the major European states to help fund the crusade while Venice, Hungary, and Albania <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> fighting. He also wanted to aid the Albanians as much as possible and urged the Kingdom of Naples to supply Skanderbeg with able forces. Venice began to consider peace with the Ottomans since its resources had significantly decreased, while Hungary adopted a defensive strategy, however, pressure from the Pope and Skanderbeg forced them to abort their efforts.|$|E

5|$|With {{no other}} choices left, Feige {{drew up a}} plan for another offensive. The thinly {{stretched}} forces of the 169th division had to split up {{to take over the}} defense line along the entire frontline between Kayrala and its adjacent lakes. The Finnish 6th Division would then be freed to undertake another massive flanking operation. Coming from the very south, they would circumvent the Soviet positions at Kayrala and thrust to a position east of it behind the Soviet lines at Lake Nurmi. The 169th Division <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same, but from the north, resulting in a large pincer movement to trap the Soviets. At the beginning of August 1941 this plan was launched with the Finnish 6th Division heading the renewed drive of the XXXVI Corps with the 169th Division following. The plan met with unexpected success. The attack completely surprised the Soviets and a large firefight developed around Kayraly. The German-Finnish force was able to encircle large parts of the Soviet 42nd Rifle Corps and its 104th Division. Although some units escaped, large Soviet formations were subsequently destroyed and the Soviets had to leave most of their equipment behind. In the face of the new German thrust, the Soviets retreated to the Tuutsa River. They tried to establish a new defensive line around Alakurtti, but were unable to hold out against the pursuing Finnish-German units. After the Soviets lost Alakurtti they withdrew to the Voyta River where the old 1939 Soviet border fortifications were situated.|$|E
