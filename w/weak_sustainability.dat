50|$|Case {{studies of}} <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> in {{practice}} have had {{both positive and}} negative results. The concept of <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> still attracts a lot of criticism. Some even suggest that the concept of sustainability is redundant.

5000|$|Although related subjects, {{sustainable}} development and sustainability are different concepts. <b>Weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> {{is the idea}} within environmental economics, which states that 'human capital' can substitute 'natural capital'. It {{is based upon the}} work of Nobel Laureate Robert Solow and John Hartwick,. Contrary to <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability,</b> strong sustainability assumes that [...] "human capital" [...] and [...] "natural capital" [...] are complementary, but not interchangeable.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{critics have}} gone one step further, dismissing the entire concept of sustainability. Beckerman’s {{influential}} work concludes that <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> is, “redundant and illogical”. He holds that sustainability {{only makes sense}} in its 'strong' form, but that [...] "requires subscribing to a morally repugnant and totally impracticable objective." [...] He goes as far {{to say that he}} regrets so much time has been wasted on the entire concept of sustainable development. Contradictorily, {{it could be argued that}} even <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> measures are better than having no measures or action at all.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} to what extent Canada and Alberta have been fulfilling the principles of sustainable development as they have adopted in the 1990 s from the essential U. N. documents - the Brundtland Report and the Rio Declaration- {{and to what extent}} both governments failed in providing and enforcing efficient environmental law protection as it is the basic premise for achieving sustainability. I assessed this level of sustainability in Canada and Alberta {{on the basis of a}} stronger and <b>weaker</b> <b>sustainability</b> theoretical framework. Author's presumption was that Canada, as it defined sustainable development in its legislation, acted according to stronger sustainability, which emphasizes stronger protective environmental measures. Given a very large scope of environmental impacts of oil extraction on different ecosystems, the sector of water resources was selected to serve as a case study to compare and analyze government and alternative reports assessing the sustainability of water management. Thus, the author follows how the oil industry in Alberta affects the water resources and how both governments of Canada and Alberta provide environmental protection to the water resources. In this respect the author illustrates how the government is reluctant towards the implementation of [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> {{has been}} defined using {{concepts}} like human capital and natural capital. [...] Human (or produced) capital incorporates resources such as infrastructure, labour and knowledge. Natural capital covers the stock of environmental assets such as fossil fuels, biodiversity and other ecosystem structures and functions relevant for ecosystem services. In very <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability,</b> the overall stock of man-made capital and natural capital remains constant over time. It {{is important to note}} that, unconditional substitution between the various kinds of capital is allowed within <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability.</b> This means that natural resources may decline as long as human capital is increased. Examples include the degradation of the ozone layer, tropical forests and coral reefs if accompanied by benefits to human capital. An example of the benefit to human capital could include increased financial profits. If capital is left constant over time intergenerational equity, and thus Sustainable Development, is achieved. An example of <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> could be mining coal and using it for production of electricity. The natural resource coal, is replaced by a manufactured good which is electricity. The electricity is then in turn used to improve domestic life quality (e.g. cooking, lighting, heating, refrigeration and operating boreholes to supply water in some villages) and for industrial purposes (growing the economy by producing other resources using machines that are electricity operated.) ...|$|E
50|$|Another {{critical}} {{weakness of}} the concept is related to environmental resilience. According to Van Den Bergh, resilience {{can be considered as}} a global, structural stability concept, {{based on the idea that}} multiple, locally stable ecosystems can exist. Sustainability can thus be directly related to resilience. With this in mind, <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> can cause extreme sensitivity to either natural disturbances (such as diseases in agriculture with little crop diversity) or economic disturbances (as outlined in the case study of Nauru above). This high level of sensitivity within regional systems in the face of external factors brings to attention an important inadequacy of <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike <b>weak</b> <b>{{sustainability}},</b> {{strong sustainability}} puts {{the emphasis on}} ecological scale over economic gains. This implies that nature {{has a right to}} exist and that it has been borrowed and should be passed on {{from one generation to the}} next still intact in its original form.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we explain}} how the latest {{international}} handbook on environmental accounting, the System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting or SEEA (United Nations et al., 2003), {{can be used to}} measure <b>weak</b> and strong <b>sustainability.</b> We emphasise the importance of understanding the conceptual differences between <b>weak</b> and strong <b>sustainability.</b> We then outline what we consider to be current best practice in measurement, all the time flagging the relationship between our discussion and that of the SEEA- 2003. This is an important task in our view, because, despite covering a very wide range of relevant conceptual and empirical issues, the handbook is by design not meant to provide clear guidelines for the purpose of measuring sustainability in either its weak or strong version. ...|$|R
40|$|Romer (1990) {{introduced}} {{endogenous growth}} by placing emphasis on human capital {{as a major}} driver of innovation. Barbier (1999) expanded this framework to include a single exhaustible resource, natural capital. These developments added to the discussion of economic growth, innovation, and the production process. This project extends Romer and Barbier’s endogenous growth framework to include natural resource utilization in the consumption function in order to open the discussion to <b>weak</b> and strong <b>sustainability.</b> This project compares the growth rates, steady state, and dynamics across these models so that we more effectively capture non-linearities and feedback loops. Finally, we explore {{the question of whether}} a <b>weak</b> or strong <b>sustainability</b> viewpoint in an endogenous growth framework leads to economic collapse or prosperity...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept has}} become {{confused}} as each discipline {{has tried to}} mold the concept to their set of tools. This “silo” thinking inhibits the kind of policy integration {{that is needed to}} develop a sustainable urban transport solution strategy. There remains much confusion as to what a sustainable transport system would comprise. It is helpful therefore to consider different approaches to sustainable transport along a spectrum of viewpoints, ranging from <b>weak</b> to strong <b>sustainability.</b> Generally efforts to address the impact of transport on climate change to date have been largely focused on technology. The impact of this technological-led approach has been very limited in the transport sector. TDM has the potential to move the transport sector from a position of <b>weak</b> to strong <b>sustainability</b> by combining behavior-change with technology improvements.|$|R

50|$|A {{prime example}} of a <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> is the Government Pension Fund of Norway. Statoil ASA, a {{state-owned}} Norwegian oil company invested its surplus profits from petroleum into a pension portfolio to date worth over $325 billion. The oil, a type of natural capital, was exported in vast quantities by Norway. The resultant fund allows for long-lasting income for the population {{in exchange for a}} finite resource, actually increasing the total capital available for Norway above the original levels. This example shows how <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> and substitution can be cleverly applied on a national scale, although it is recognised that its applications are very restricted on a global scale. In this application, Hartwick’s rule would state that the pension fund was sufficient capital to offset the depletion of the oil resources.|$|E
50|$|A less {{positive}} {{case is that}} of {{the small}} Pacific nation of Nauru. A substantial phosphate deposit was found on the island in 1900, and now approximately 80% of the island has been rendered uninhabitable after over 100 years of mining. Concurrent with this extraction, Nauru’s inhabitants, over the last few decades of the twentieth century, have enjoyed a high per capita income. Money from the mining of phosphate enabled the establishment of a trust fund, which was estimated to be as much as $1 billion. However, chiefly {{as a result of the}} Asian financial crisis, the trust fund was almost entirely wiped out. This ‘development’ of Nauru followed the logic of <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability,</b> and almost led to complete environmental destruction. This case presents a telling argument against <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability,</b> suggesting that a substitution of natural for man-made capital may not be reversible in the long-term.|$|E
40|$|This article {{contains}} a review of recent literature in sustainability, discusses the concepts of <b>weak</b> and strong <b>sustainability,</b> and identifies three levels of organisational sustainability: non, <b>weak</b> and strong <b>sustainability.</b> An analysis {{was conducted on the}} responses of CEOs to questions in a survey conducted by a leading Australian newspaper to gain an insight into the areas of concern forefront in their minds. Evidence was sought for CEO attention to financial, growth, sustainability, environmental and social issues. The responses of fifty-six CEOs from leading Australian companies as per market capitalisation were analysed for key words, derivatives of, including sustainability, environmental concern, resource concern, innovation, growth, long-term, social concern, employee/recruitment, global concern, financial, technology, government policy/regulation, competition, managerial/ cost control, image/marketing.

50|$|According to Pearce and Atkinson’s calculations, the Japanese {{economy is}} one of the most {{sustainable}} economies in the world. The reason for this is that its saving rate is so high. This trend still remains today and therefore exceeds depreciation on both natural and man-made capital. Thus, they suggest that it is the gross negligence of factors other than savings in measuring sustainability that makes <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability</b> an inappropriate concept.|$|E

40|$|In June 2010 Poland was {{electrified}} {{by the big}} news: {{the country}} claimed to hold the largest shale gas reserves in Europe. Following the enthusiastic approach {{of the government and}} extractive companies, the public discourse has focused on the expected economic and geopolitical benefits of shale gas extraction. Meanwhile, the broader context of sustainability tends to be neglected. Some recent references to sustainable development in the context of shale gas extraction in Poland indicate that this concept needs a more thorough understanding. This article explores the following three aspects of sustainable development that need to be considered in the discussions on shale gas extraction in Poland. (1) Will the extracted natural capital be replaced with other forms of capital to ensure the well-being of future generations? (2) Will the formal institutions ensure that extractive companies pre-vent and mitigate all real and potential negative effects resulting from shale gas extraction? (3) How will the contribution of shale gas extraction to human well-being and national wealth be measured? The above issues link to important theoretical considerations within the concept of sustainable development, such as the <b>weak</b> vs. strong <b>sustainability</b> dilemma, internalizing external costs, and sustainability indicators (e. g. greening the GDP). Key words: shale gas, <b>weak</b> vs. strong <b>sustainability,</b> externalities, greening GDP, resource curs...|$|R
40|$|Corsetti and Roubini (1991) {{reported}} that the government finances of Greece, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands (now all EMU countries) did not satisfy the intertemporal budget constraint (IBC). We re-examine this issue by utilizing a new empirical approach and extended data set. Structural shifts, an issue which Corsetti and Roubini were unable to address {{due to the lack}} of suitable econometric methods, are tackled. We find that: (i) multiple structural shifts, most of which correspond to important policy changes, did occur in the fiscal path of these countries; (ii) the effect of the majority of structural shifts has been to strengthen the evidence supporting IBC; and (iii) government finances of all four countries satisfy the IBC and this finding is robust to different time horizons. We also find a clear positive Maastricht effect on IBC for all countries. intertemporal budget constraints, strong and <b>weak</b> form <b>sustainability,</b> structural breaks...|$|R

50|$|Green {{accounting}} {{is a type}} {{of accounting}} that attempts to factor environmental costs into the financial results of operations. It has been argued that gross domestic product ignores the environment and therefore policymakers need a revised model that incorporates green accounting. The major purpose of green accounting is to help businesses understand and manage the potential quid pro quo between traditional economics goals and environmental goals. It also increases the important information available for analyzing policy issues, especially when those vital pieces of information are often overlooked. Green accounting is said to only ensure <b>weak</b> <b>sustainability,</b> which should be considered as a step toward ultimately a strong sustainability.|$|E
40|$|The {{transformative}} {{potential of}} accounting-sustainability hybrids {{has been promoted}} and problematized in the literature. We contribute to this debate by exploring, theoretically and empirically, the role of accounting in shaping and reshaping sustainability practices. We develop a holistic framework which we use to analyse the governing and mediating roles of accounting-sustainability hybrids in the Environment Agency (of England and Wales) and West Sussex County Council. Our analysis identifies that local accounting-sustainability hybrids contribute positively to improving eco-efficiency, have some impact on eco-effectiveness, but limited bearing on social justice. Emerging assemblages of accounting-sustainability hybrids create capacity for wider sustainability transformations, particularly through their mediating roles. However, {{a number of factors}} combine to frustrate further sustainability transformations within these organisations and those they are charged with governing. These factors include the structural constraints of the accounting-sustainability hybrids, influenced by a relatively <b>weak</b> local <b>sustainability</b> programmatic and the pressing need to meet increasing service delivery expectations in a period of severe resource constraints...|$|R
