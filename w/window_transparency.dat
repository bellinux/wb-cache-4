Our modeling enables us to identify three signal-field strength regimes (with a signal-field strength always higher than the probe-field strength), quantified by the Rabi frequency, for slowing the probe field. These three regimes correspond to a weak signal field, with the probe-field group velocity and <b>transparency</b> <b>window</b> width both smaller for the second window compared to the first window, a medium-strength signal field, with a probe-field group velocity smaller in the second window than in the first window but with larger transparency-window width for the second window, and the strong signal field, with both group velocity and <b>transparency</b> <b>window</b> width larger for the second window.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new technique}} for measuring trace quantities of gases. The technique {{involves the use of}} a reference cell (containing a known amount of the gas being sought) and a sample cell (containing an unknown amount of the same gas) wherein the gas densities are modulated. Light passing through the two cells in sequence is modulated in intensity at the vibrational-rotational lines characteristic of the absorption spectrum for the gas of interest. Since the absorption process is nonlinear, modulating the two absorption cells at two different frequencies gives rise to a heterodyning effect, which in turn introduces sum and difference frequencies in the detected signal. Measuring the ratio of the difference frequency signal for example, to the signal introduced by the reference cell provides a normalized measure of the amount of the gas in the sample cell. The readings produced are thereby independent of source intensity, <b>window</b> <b>transparency,</b> and detector sensitivity. Experimental evaluation of the technique suggests that it should be applicable {{to a wide range of}} gases, that it should be able to reject spurious signals due to unwanted gases, and that it should be sensitive to concentrations of the order of 10 to the minus 8 th power when used with a sample cell of only 20 cm length...|$|E
40|$|A {{helicopter}} structure experiences substantial high-frequency mechanical excitation from powertrain components such as gearboxes {{and drive}} shafts. The resulting structure-borne vibration excites the windows which then radiate sound {{into the passenger}} cabin. In many cases the radiated sound power can be reduced by adding damping. This can be accomplished using passive or active approaches. Passive treatments such as constrained layer damping tend to reduce <b>window</b> <b>transparency.</b> Therefore this paper focuses on an active approach utilizing compact decentralized control units distributed {{around the perimeter of}} the window. Each control unit consists of a triangularly shaped piezoelectric actuator, a miniature accelerometer, and analog electronics. Earlier work has shown that this type of system can increase damping up to approximately 1 kHz. However at higher frequencies the mismatch between the distributed actuator and the point sensor caused control spillover. This paper describes new anisotropic actuators that can be used to improve the bandwidth of the control system. The anisotropic actuators are composed of piezoelectric material sandwiched between interdigitated electrodes, which enables the application of the electric field in a preferred in-plane direction. When shaped correctly the anisotropic actuators outperform traditional isotropic actuators by reducing the mismatch between the distributed actuator and point sensor at high frequencies. Testing performed on a Plexiglas panel, representative of a helicopter window, shows that the control units can increase damping at low frequencies. However high frequency performance was still limited due to the flexible boundary conditions present on the test structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a novel analytical technique, electrochemical X-ray fluorescence (EC-XRF), is described and applied to the quantitative detection of heavy metals in solution, achieving sub-ppb limits of detection (LOD). In EC-XRF, electrochemical preconcentration of a species of interest onto the target electrode is achieved here by cathodic electrodeposition. Unambiguous elemental identification and quantification of metal concentration is then made using XRF. This simple electrochemical preconcentration step improves the LOD of energy dispersive XRF by over 4 orders of magnitude (for similar sample preparation time scales). Large area free-standing boron doped diamond grown using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition techniques {{is found to be}} ideal as the electrode material for both electrodeposition and XRF due to its wide solvent <b>window,</b> <b>transparency</b> to the XRF beam, and ability to be produced in mechanically robust freestanding thin film form. During electrodeposition it is possible to vary both the deposition potential (Edep) and deposition time (tdep). For the metals Cu 2 + and Pb 2 + the highest detection sensitivities were found for Edep = − 1. 75 V and tdep = 4000 s with LODs of 0. 05 and 0. 04 ppb achieved, respectively. In mixed Cu 2 +/Pb 2 + solutions, EC-XRF shows that Cu 2 + deposition is unimpeded by Pb 2 +, across a broad concentration range, but this is only true for Pb 2 + when both metals are present at low concentrations (10 nM), boding well for trace level measurements. In a dual mixed metal solution, EC-XRF can also be employed to either selectively deposit the metal which has the most positive formal reduction potential, E 0, or exhaustively deplete it from solution, enabling uninhibited detection of the metal with the more negative E 0...|$|E

40|$|Sub-wavelength metal {{nanoparticles}} {{demonstrate a}} resonant coupling to incident optical fields {{known as the}} localized surface plasmon resonance, enabling enhanced absorption, scattering, and nano-focusing of light. In this work, plasmonic properties of metal nanoparticles and nanorods are studied and engineered to realize selective management of incident light {{as a function of}} wavelength, angle, and polarization, for application to photovoltaics and selectively transmissive / absorptive systems. For photovoltaics (PV) applications, metal nanoparticle scattering is exploited to realize a wavelength selective backscattering layer. Placed behind a thin film PV absorbing layer, an array of silver nanoparticles backscatters light on resonance while off-resonance light is transmitted, allowing engineering of selective transparency vs. absorption and modulation of photocurrent. Further tuning the array by considering anisotropic particle shape (increasing the aspect ratio), the plasmonic resonance becomes a function of both wavelength and incident angle. We propose employing such a nanorod array to realize an angle selective photovoltaic window for building integration: light normal to the window is off resonance, retaining high transmission and window quality visibility, while angled light, including direct sunlight, is resonantly scattered and harvested for conversion to photocurrent. Optical analysis indicates 20 - 30 % improvement in direct sunlight absorption and photocurrent is possible without sacrificing <b>window</b> <b>transparency</b> in the viewing direction. Beyond photovoltaics, we consider integrating angle selective metal nanorods with actuating micro-origami structures to control their orientation with respect to incident light. By tuning the plasmonic and angular properties of the system, we propose a novel method to realize balanced 0 - 90 +% transmission modulation of the full visible spectrum for application to adjustable smart glass window coatings, potentially significantly improving on current implementations. Large area patterning of deeply sub-wavelength (10 's of nm) metal nanorods remains a challenge for traditional nanofabrication techniques. We investigate and describe ways to realize the structures of interest based on the electrochemical synthesis of high aspect ratio self-assembled nanoporous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) films, including both bottom-up (electroplating) and top-down (reactive ion etching) approaches. Finally, the anisotropic and angle dependent scattering properties of high aspect ratio AAO itself are considered for similar light management applications...|$|E

The main elements used in our systems are nanorods and nanocrosses of variable sizes. The nanomaterial can be designed as a solution, nanocomposite film or metastructure. The principle {{of the formation of}} the <b>transparency</b> <b>window</b> in the broad extinction spectrum is based on the narrow lines of longitudinal plasmons of single nanorods and nanorod complexes. To realize the spectrum with a transmission window, we design a nanocomposite material as a mixture of nanorods of different sizes. Simultaneously, we exclude nanorods of certain lengths from the nanorod ensemble. The width of the plasmonic <b>transparency</b> <b>window</b> is determined by the intrinsic and radiative broadenings of the nanocrystal plasmons. Nanocrystals can be randomly dispersed in a solution or arranged in metastructures. We show that interactions between nanocrystals in a dense ensemble can destroy the window effect and, simultaneously, we design the metastructure geometries with weak destructive interactions.
