[...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E
500|$|While walking home, Mr. Mackey drunkenly {{sings the}} 1983 Pat Benatar song [...] "Love Is a Battlefield". During Ike's {{supposed}} funeral, a bagpipe player starts playing the Hebrew folk song [...] "Hava Nagila". At the funerals, the priest uses the phrase [...] "Ashes to ashes, dust to dust", from the Anglican burial service. When the townspeople start to harass Mackey, {{one of them}} shouts, [...] "Now we see <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Homer Simpson have in common... Dope!". This references the famous catchphrase from The Simpsons, [...] "D'oh!", which sounds similar to the word dope, meaning illicit drugs. At Kyle's house, Kyle's parents offer the boys a dish called [...] "GaHekgafuga", {{which is not a}} real dish. When Mackey is in India, he is captured by members of The A-Team, and driven away in their van. Mackey is taken to rehabilitation to the Betty Ford Clinic, which is based on a real-life hospital.|$|E

He was escorted on the death-walk by the prison chaplain, who was reading aloud from The Consolations of Religion about the fires of hell. Peace burst out [...] "Sir, if I believed <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> the church of God say that you believe, even if England were covered with broken glass from coast to coast, I would walk over it, if need be, on hands and knees and think it worth while living, just to save one soul from an eternal hell like that!" ...|$|E

Putting aside all personal predilection in his favour, all affection and friendship...is he [...] to be shaken off from his connection with sound constitutional men, and forced into the arms of the Tookes and the Paines? We must be sure that the Colossus is theirs before we take a step to make him so. ... I am one of those who feel that one country has a self-interest in the events of another, and therefore for its own sake it is entitled to watch over them. ... France ought to be watched, not altogether on account of the spirit of universal interference and conquest which she manifests but on account of the weapons she uses...; it is not the red-hot balls of her cannon that are to be dreaded, but the red-hot principles with which she charges them. An invasion from these is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> I dread, and if we feel that an universal junction is necessary in order to repel them, the foundation of that junction must be founded in exclusion.|$|E
