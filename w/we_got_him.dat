500|$|Colts {{head coach}} Weeb Ewbank cited {{injuries}} to fullback Alan Ameche {{as the key}} reason for the team's inability to win a third straight NFL championship. Ewbank hoped Perry could fill in the role if Ameche was not ready when the season began. Ameche retired prior to the season, and Perry filled in to lead the Colts in rushing in 1961, while catching a career-high 34 passes for 322 yards. [...] "Joe {{was the kind of}} guy you'd love to play your whole career with," [...] said Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas. [...] "He was older when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him,</b> but he did well for us. He was amazing on the screen pass, like McElhenny. And Joe clawed and scratched for every yard." [...] A thigh ligament injury caused him to miss several games in 1962 which, along with an injury to halfback Lenny Moore, severely hampered the Colts' running game. He was traded back to San Francisco in 1963, where he played a diminished role in his final nine games before retiring at age 36.|$|E
500|$|Morrison and EMI {{producer}} Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, {{and as part}} of the deal, {{the band}} agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: [...] "I found [...] in the dressing room and he was so... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [...] <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> out to the stage... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".|$|E
2500|$|At age 29, Givens {{made his}} big-league debut on June 24, 1995, {{pitching}} {{well in a}} loss. [...] In his second game, Givens was shelled. [...] "I would have sent {{him back to the}} minor leagues if I had somebody else to replace him with", the Brewers' manager, Phil Garner, told the Sporting News. [...] "His problem was he wasn't throwing his breaking ball for strikes. [...] <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> to be more aggressive. [...] He responded. [...] I changed my opinion on him." [...] Givens earned his first major league win on July 16, 1995. [...] "There are a lot of guys who make it to the big leagues despite injuries or a lot of time served in the minors", Givens said shortly after his first big-league win. [...] "It just so happens persistence paid off for me. [...] I'm just very fortunate, with all my operations, I can still throw the ball the way I can." [...] Givens finished his rookie big-league season with a 7–5 record and a 3.95 earned-run average in 19 games.|$|E
60|$|At {{last one}} day <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>'im</b> alone down the fo'c'sle, and Bill put 'is arm round <b>'im</b> and <b>got</b> im on the locker and asked 'im {{straight}} {{out where the}} money was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] the lock-keeper's {{wife was}} saying. [...] "As fast as I pulled to get 'im out, 'e crawled back. Then I called for 'elp, and some workmen 'appened along, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>'im</b> out and turned 'im {{over to the}} constable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{sometimes}} wish ... <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>him</b> on the Board of the Cloetedorp Golcondas. Mag--nificent combinations {{he would}} make in the City!" ...|$|R
2500|$|At Kinston, Cruceta started seven games, going 2–0 with a 2.50 ERA. In November, the Indians added {{him their}} 40-man roster, {{indicating}} {{their confidence in}} him. Nevertheless, Cruceta would not pitch in a major league game for the Indians {{until the end of}} the [...] season. Cruceta began the [...] season with the Double-A Akron Aeros. At the time, Cruceta had in his arsenal a fastball (which topped out at [...] ), slider, and changeup. John Farrell, then the Indians director of player development, praised Cruceta's mechanics: [...] "He throws the ball on a downward plane. It allows the action of all his pitches to work down and force ground-ball outs. We're ecstatic that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> in the Rodriguez trade." [...] Cruceta enjoyed a strong year at Akron, going 13–9 with a 3.09 ERA. Cruceta returned to the Aeros for the 2004 season, and in mid-June the Indians promoted him to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, where he went 6–5 with a 3.25 ERA as the Bisons defeated the Richmond Braves for the International League championship and the Governors' Cup. Following the series Cruceta was one of six Bisons players called up by the Indians for the fall expansion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> and {{his stuff}} off pretty sharp--whoever he was," [...] said the high official, rubbing his arm with {{something}} approaching satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|Well, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> {{off before}} any harm was done, but Shadrach's face, lined with its livid scars, {{was a thing}} to remember. Between rage and fear, it looked {{like that of a}} devil.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, {{never mind}} the hurt,' I said, 'so that <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>him.</b> What are you doing, chief? You {{are not going to}} make a fire here, are you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get round! Of {{course he}} will," [...] Dr. Green replied cheerily. [...] "Now that <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>him</b> bound up <b>we</b> will soon bring him round. It {{is only a}} {{question}} of loss of blood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We were so glad dear uncle wasn’t hurt much," [...] {{continued}} Mrs. Berry, smiling, {{and shaking}} her head at Mr. Cox; [...] "but the idea of your burying him in the geranium-bed; <b>we</b> haven’t <b>got</b> <b>him</b> clean yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then,' Eames went on, 'he became rather noisome, and {{we thought}} {{we might as well}} impound the correspondence'--he {{wrinkled}} his swelled left eye--'and after that, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> to take a seat in my car.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{man whose}} cloak Captain Ephraim there has put round him. He came on us {{when you were}} away rousing your lady, but <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> to be quiet between us. Is the lady there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] {{returned}} Paul; [...] "but haven't <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> on Tolly's pony to-day? and isn't that a sign he's better? An' {{would you}} have me risk Betty fallin' Into the hands o' Buxley?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, lass, you're a hard woman,' {{was all he}} said. And {{they were}} his last words. Thomas and I carried {{him back to his}} room, but the breath was gone from <b>him</b> before <b>we</b> ever <b>got</b> <b>him</b> there.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, doctor, you're wrong," [...] said Uncle Beamish. [...] "What {{we want is}} {{a strong}} horse that will take us there whether it storms or not, and <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>him.</b> And who cares for a little snow that won't hurt nobody?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The end of {{this and}} {{subsequent}} meetings with Mr. Maine was, that <b>we</b> proposed and <b>got</b> <b>him</b> elected {{as a member of}} the 'Sarcophagus Club.' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{took him}} home that night. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> {{to go by}} telling him {{that his father had}} bought a silver-mounted rifle and a pair of moccasins for him, {{and we were going to}} hunt bears the next day.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} bring him to, and then I went for the doctor. He revived, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> home to his mother's. The doctor says he will get well; but he advised me {{to come and see}} you." ...|$|E
60|$|This gave us new hope. Traddles and I laying {{our heads}} {{together}} apart, while Mr. Dick anxiously watched {{us from his}} chair, we concocted a scheme in virtue of which <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> to work next day, with triumphant success.|$|E
6000|$|We made George work, now <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>him.</b> He did {{not want}} to work, of course; that goes without saying. He had had a hard time in the City, so he explained. Harris, who is callous in his nature, and not prone to pity, said: ...|$|R
60|$|MAYOR. Dangerous times, these. Authority {{questioned}} {{all over}} the place. We want a man that feels his responsibilities, and <b>we</b> think we've <b>got</b> <b>him</b> in you.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must see}} to the other wounds after <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>him</b> away," [...] he said. [...] "Now, Hassan, do you two bind one of those spare {{blankets}} to the shaft of the two spears, wind it round them until the sides are not more than three feet apart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{looked like}} a London trader, father, and was some forty years old; {{but it was hard}} to tell, for by the time <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> to the hostelry he was well-nigh spent and scarce able to crawl along, even with my help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I told Tippy Tilly that, if {{he could}} help us, we would turn him into a Bimbashi when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> back into Egypt. I think he's willing enough if he only had the power. By Jove, Belmont, do {{look back at the}} river." ...|$|E
6000|$|P. C. MAN. [With sudden resolution] Now, look here! This man George Blunter was had {{up three}} years ago--for livin' on the {{earnings}} of a woman called Johnson. He was dismissed with a caution. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> again last year over a woman called Lee--that time he did-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little indeed, and {{as little}} did poor mother dream {{of such a}} fate," [...] {{returned}} Dominick, [...] "when she let us all go so readily, on the understanding that we should give father no rest until <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>him</b> to give up business, quit Java for ever, and return home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, shut up, Flinders," [...] {{interrupted}} Gashford, swallowing his wrath. (Paddy {{brought his}} teeth {{together with a}} snap in prompt obedience.) [...] "You know well enough that <b>we</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>him,</b> and you know you're not sorry for it; but mark my words, I'll hunt him down yet. Who'll go with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, wot are {{we going}} to do?" [...] ses Ginger. [...] "I’m {{beginning}} to be sick of the sight of <b>’im.</b> ’Ave <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to lead <b>’im</b> about all day on a bit o’ string?" ...|$|R
60|$|I think I {{never saw}} {{anything}} more ridiculous--I was sensible of it, {{even at the}} time--than Mr. Micawber making broad-sword guards with the ruler, and crying, 'Come on!' while Traddles and I pushed him back into a corner, from which, as often as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> into it, he persisted in emerging again.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{not much}} more to tell," [...] {{she said with a}} shiver. [...] "I was very anxious while I waited behind a hummock of ice, but at last I heard the men coming; they were {{carrying}} Lawrence, who couldn't walk. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> down to the hotel--and I think that's all." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>him</b> {{comfortable}} again, {{telling him}} about his people, and how Brace's wife had been dead three years, and Brace wanted to marry Benny and she shook him, and Jubiter was working for Uncle Silas, and him and Uncle Silas quarreling all the time--and then he let go and laughed.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must comfort him, Leach," [...] {{whispered the}} captain; [...] "for I see he is {{fetching}} {{up in the}} old way, as was duly laid down by our ancestors in the platform. First, groanings and views of the devil, and then consolation and hope. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>him</b> into the first category, and we ought now, in justice, to bring to, and heave a strain to help him through it." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{few hours}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> sight of <b>him,</b> out on the bank in a saw-grass wallow. He was a monster for size—a perfect whale of a saurian, gray in color—and by all the powers, he was a genuine crocodile! ...|$|R
6000|$|The man in {{the grey}} suit got into an omnibus, going westward. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> in after <b>him.</b> There were latent {{reserves}} of youth still left in Mr. Bruff. I assert it positively--when he took his seat in the omnibus, he blushed! ...|$|R
