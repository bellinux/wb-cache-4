The writer noted that the series was [...] "more overtly sexual" [...] than previous adaptations of Austen's works and added, [...] "The novel is as much about sex and money as social conventions."

50|$|In Adamczewski’s view « … {{languages}} {{have two}} parallel series of grammatical markers, {{from which the}} speaker alternately chooses according to his/her strategy in terms of meaning » (1999: 72-transl. ours). Phase 1 markers are those grammatical items which indicate open paradigmatic choice, while Phase 2 items, marking closed paradigmatic choice, enable the speaker to use {{the result of that}} operation to express his/her own standpoint relative to what s/he is saying and relative to the addressee (this for instance could be warning, or regret, or justification...). Phase 2 markers will therefore appear in what is referred to as ‘presupposing contexts’ in the theory. Let us take the example of the French microsystem VOICI/VOILA. In Voici le Professeur X (« This is Professor X »), the NP le Professeur X is non-predictable (open paradigmatic choice), hence the element of surprise that more or less accompanies such utterances; in Voilà le Professeur X (« Here comes Professor X »), somehow the NP le Professeur X is already part of the linguistic context and/or situation of utterance, for instance because it has been mentioned before (« Why! We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Professor X, and here he comes. »).|$|E

This {{is the first}} television series {{in which he has}} made an appearance. Although he appears in numerous episodes as a background character, Elongated Man has only three speaking roles. In [...] "The Greatest Story Never Told", {{he is one of the}} members to help in the battle against Mordru, although to his disappointment he is put on crowd control (along with Booster Gold) as Green Lantern told him that Plastic Man was already fighting Mordru and that they did not [...] "need two stretchy guys". As they were on crowd control, he complains to Booster about his position. This soon annoys Booster Gold, with Elongated Man saying that the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Wonder Woman then appears and says that the team needs Elongated Man's help. He willingly follows her to the fight, much to Booster's disappointment as he thought the team needed his help. The episode goes on to follow Booster's attempt to stop a black hole. At the end of the episode, it is shown that Elongated Man had devised a plan to defeat Mordru and the team is shown praising him. As he is helping clean up the mess in the city, Booster walks past him with Dr. Tracy Simmons beside him (as he won a date with her by stopping the black hole) and says [...] "Squeaky wheel, buddy. Squeaky wheel." [...] In [...] "The Ties That Bind", Elongated Man and Flash express concern about the fact that some other members of the League don't show them enough respect. Flash asks Elongated Man if he seems immature to him. Elongated Man replies [...] "Not in the least". It is then shown they are playing [...] "Brawlin' Bots" [...] (a parody of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots). In [...] "Clash," [...] his powers are stolen by Parasite, who uses them to nearly defeat Metamorpho and Batman before the timely intervention of Captain Marvel. After Parasite is defeated, Elongated Man notices Captain Marvel blushing and tells him not to be modest as he thinks Superman couldn't have done a better job. Superman appears as he says this, with Elongated Man quickly saying, [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> you."r ...|$|E
50|$|The play {{begins in}} Ogwoma’s house. Odibei enters {{and begins to}} examine the items and {{furniture}} in the room, searching for something. She wonders out loud {{about the death of}} her son when Odibei enters looking for Ogwoma. Odibei continues searching for some kind of murder weapon or poison while the two converse about her son, Adigwu’s, death. Otubo states wisely that people are born and people die and that is how life takes course but Odibei insists that her son’s wife, Ogwoma {{had something to do with}} his death. She firmly believes that Ogwoma murdered him and has hidden the cause of his death in her house. Otubo insists that Ogwoma could not have killed her husband but Odibei won’t hear it and is still searching the house, muttering to herself in somewhat of a crazed state. Odibei goes on to complain that Ogwama hasn't even been mourning her son properly during the three-month mourning period. Eventually Otubo is able to calm Odibei enough to lead her away from the Ogwoma’s house to rest. Ogwoma and Anwasia enter carrying goods back from the market. Ogwoma is dressed suitably for mourning. As they enter it is clear that they were just having a very serious conversation. Anwasia goes on to reveal that the two friends <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> how Ogwoma is pregnant with another man’s child even though she is still only on the second month of her three-month mourning period. Ogwoma doesn't want to talk about it but Anwasia pushes the subject saying that what she has done is unheard of in their culture and that she at least should have waited another month before letting another man in her bed. Anwasia also reminds her that it is custom for the widow to marry the brother of the deceased husband Ogwoma comes back by saying that Uloko is not just another man, she is the love of her life and because of that not she could not have waited. She goes on to say that she is not in mourning because her husband dying was no loss to her. She never felt anything for him and was forced to marry him through an arranged marriage for money. Anwasia reminds her that that is simply how it is in their culture and even goes on to say that Ogwoma should be grateful for the money the marriage brought her family because it saved her terribly ill brothers life. Anwasia warns Ogwoma about her mother in law, Odibei, when Uloko enters. The lovers embrace with passion and Anwasia announces that she is leaving. As she exits she insists that Ogwoma tell Uloko about the child. After a lot of pleading on Uloko’s part Ogwoma finally tells him that his child is growing inside of her. Uloko is filled with joy. He lifts Ogwoma up and spins her around while he cheers with excitement. He claims that now that his child is inside of her there is no way she can be married to Adigwu’s brother. Ogwoma stops the short celebration because she hears something outside. Worried that Odibei is sneaking around she tells Uloko that he must leave. Uloko doesn't understand the severity of the situation and stays put saying that they should just let Odibei catch them. Ogwoma insists that he go and says that he shouldn't underestimate Odibei’s cruelty. Ogwoma admits that she plans to run away before her pregnant belly begins to show. Odibei enters and immediately advances on Ogwoma to slap her but Uloko gets in between them, defending his love. Odibei, in a rage, says that Uloko should be looking for marriageable women and not hanging around a woman in mourning’s home. Ogwoma says that she always hated her son and that God has freed her to be with Uloko. Odibei goes to leave saying that no one messes with her. Uloko demands that she keep Ogwoma out of her evil plans but Odibei exits and simply says, “We will see.” Ogwoma breaks down into Uloko’s arms in despair over Odibei catching them. Uloko promises that he will handle her and that no one can hurt them. Ogwoma continues to sob.|$|E

(Yesterday I got {{the one you}} wrote Thursday- what a mail system). Gosh it’s swell {{to hear from you}} that often angel. Your letters are so long and swell. The pay {{vouchers}} came down with the mail for us to sign so I’ll get paid this month thank goodness, 206. 60 too! That’s a slight improvement over cadet pay. We’re going to leave on the buses that bring the other jokers down here from Craig Saturday so counting blowouts, etc. I might be at the field by 10 o’clock Saturday night, and God knows what time I’ll be able to take off for town what with signing in and getting bedding and cleaning up, it ought to be about 11 however. I’ll call you as soon as I can when I get to Craig honey. Well baby you can just call me “Ace” for short. Man I really shot the hell out of that target today. I got 85 hits! And it wasn’t luck either, I finally caught on. Gunnery is a funny thing there 2 ̆ 7 s a certain knack (that is not right!) nak, nack, nach (that’s a tough one) nack to it, and you’ve just got to keep at it ‘til you get it. And I think I finally have. Boy I’m glad for the higher scores we get here the better chance we have for an assignment. Enclosed is a letter from Mom to us. Isn’t that a riot about the measles? I can just see Nanny quarantined with all those kids. I feel sorry for Ace though, I’d go nuts if they ever made me an instructor. Honey I don’t agree with you reasoning about me being able to do more by instructing. I may sound concieted [sic], but my marks prove that I’m a slightly better than average pilot and to instruct you don’t have to be good, just patient. I could do much more overseas while some below average pilot could do the instructing. That’s logical isn’t it honey. I want to be put where I’m best suited, and I’m sure it’s not instructing and so do you, really, honey. Yeah I agree with you there. Are kids are going to have different names. I still want the girl to be named Leslie, I love that name. And who said the name of the first boy is settled? I’m glad to know that. Something tells me we’re going to have some slight differences over these names. I wish we weren’t so stubborn sometimes. We’ll just have to have about a dozen kids so each of us can name half, ok? Gosh it will seem funny to live with you again when I come back, those first two days seem like a dream, a wonderful dream though. Oh honey, only five more nights, I count the nights now, that’s when I miss you most baby. It sure has been an unusual wedding all right, but I like it that way, nothing we ever do is normal anyhow, and that’s the way I like it, it would be awful dull to lead a normal life wouldn’t it. I hope we never will. Tom and I <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> old times at Stewart. Gosh I wonder {{what would have happened if}} I hadn’t been sent there or you had had shoes on when you walked down the stairs in your house that first night. Oh I guess I’d have loved you just as much anyhow. And remember that nigh we went to the Rodeo, Oct. 21 st it was. You told me you loved me that night, along with two others. I didn’t know what to think, what that “different way” was. Baby, you had me confused. And I’ll never forget that Christmas. That was wonderful honey, but not as wonderful as the next few months are going to be if I can ever get out of this damned Florida desert. Four more days and we’ll be together darling. I miss you so much. It was nothing like this at Spence, wonder what made the difference. Must be that smattering of married life we’ve had. I hope you didn’t think I was mad when you told me you’d taken 35 out of the bank honey. You spend all you want darling, I gave it to you and it’s yours to do with as you like. I never realized it, but it must cost a lot [sic] to live nowadays, the Army has been taking care of me lately. Well angel I’m gonna hit the sack. I love you my darling wife, and miss you so much. Gosh it’s awful being apart like this. So until we’re together again, angel, I’ll just be existing, and thinking of you ever minute of every day that we’re apart. I love you, and send you all my love, as always. Your devoted husband Judd [Translation ends...|$|E
