25|$|As the {{questioning}} continues, Ingrid admits to Emma {{that she wants}} her {{to be part of}} her family, but then uses mind tactics on Emma to convince her that her family do not love her, they fear her. Emma denies this, but as she pauses for a second, Ingrid casts a spell on a glass of water, and when she returns Ingrid increases the pressure on Emma, resulting in the glass of water to boil as Emma's powers are unleashed due to her fear, causing the wall in the station to blast open and Ingrid to escape. Emma then walks out and as David, Mary Margaret, Hook, Elsa, Gold, and Belle show up to stop her, Emma wants everyone to stay away but when Hook touches her, Emma causes the streetlight to fall on David. Emma runs away after a horrified Mary Margret looks at her with disgust and gets into her car driving away even as Mary Margret calls after her that it's okay. Everyone present suspects that The Snow Queen/Ingrid has succeeded in turning Emma against them. After Elsa and Hook are unable to find Emma, Mary Margret blames herself, stating that no one wants their family to see them as a monster. Elsa reassures a fearful Hook that Emma will be fine, but that she needs time alone {{to come to terms with}} her powers, the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> Meanwhile, a terrified Emma sits in her parked bug in the woods overlooking the town.|$|E
25|$|Marlena {{joins the}} hunt for the reasons behind the Brady/DiMera feud, while keeping John on life support. John then comes out of his coma, and helps Marlena and the others on their quest. John is hit by a car, and {{seemingly}} dies on October 17, 2007. As is often the case in Salem, characters rarely die. On January 8, 2008, EJ discovers John {{in the basement of the}} DiMera mansion, being programmed by Stefano to become a super soldier. After he is discovered by the police, John wakes up with amnesia, and Marlena struggles to help John remember. It is discovered that John is the child of Shawn Brady's sister Colleen, and Stefano's father, Santo DiMera. Their affair and its disastrous ending was the beginning of the feud. John's obesession with his DiMera heritage and his changed personality both start to take a toll on Marlena, and she finds it hard to stay with John. Stefano wakes up from a coma (after Marlena purposely sends him into a comatose state in January 2008), and intends on getting revenge on Marlena and taking the DiMera empire back from John. He causes Marlena to fall into a coma the exact <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> to him. However, Marlena wakes up after receiving a ghostly visit from her late sister, Samantha. John relinquishes his control of the empire to Stefano, but Marlena, by then, decides to move on with her life and files for divorce.|$|E
500|$|As part of Why Not? with Shania Twain, she {{arranged}} a session with music producer David Foster, hoping to collaborate on [...] "Today Is Your Day". Although she felt skeptical, Twain visited vocal coach Eric Vetro {{to prepare for}} her session with Foster. Twain and Vetro executed vocal exercises to loosen up the tension and tightness in her vocal chords. [...] "The goal is to free up, to let go. She has {{to take all of}} that tension and tightness that she's been feeling for so long, and transform it to free herself from it. And to start singing from her heart again, the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{when she was a little}} girl, when she started," [...] Vetro stated. He also opined that Twain was ready to return to her music career. Twain learned beneficial vocal techniques and appreciated Vetro's understanding of her psyche.|$|E

500|$|When {{discussing}} his collaboration with Cyrus, Borgore stated that [...] "you {{have to understand}} that I grew up in Israel, and the whole Hannah Montana thing, I've never seen it. I've heard about this, but the Miley Cyrus persona you might have in America I don't have." [...] Her involvement with [...] "Decisions" [...] was originally not publicly acknowledged in an attempt to [...] "make a tune together that we're super happy about and just see people's real opinion about this." [...] However, Cyrus unexpectedly tweeted [...] "Yo check out Decisions me & @borgore new track" [...] in August 2012, which Borgore commented was [...] "super cool [...] she did it the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> it". He added that he was impressed with her vocal abilities, elaborating that [...] "I thought she was made up more to be a star, but she was pretty phenomenal behind the booth." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com complimented the writers, who he said {{are able}} to make {{consistently}} strong episodes because they seem to have a perfect understanding of their characters. He also said [...] "Jerry's Painting" [...] proved Ben's character has comedic potential beyond being Leslie's romantic interest. Zap2it writer Rick Porter said it was not the best of the season, but still [...] "a very solid half-hour of comedy" [...] and that [...] "the show's batting average this season is remarkably high". While Porter praised the main story, he said he found the subplot less entertaining, and did not believe April's character would have acted the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> or lived in such filthy conditions. Not all reviews were positive. Matt Fowler of IGN said the idea of Jerry subconsciously painting Leslie and Tom was [...] "a bit too absurd", and that the episode did not feature enough of Ron Swanson. Fowler also said he did not enjoy seeing the normally positive Chris taking on an authoritarian role.|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} from Nobody's Daughter was [...] "Skinny Little Bitch", {{released}} in {{promotion of the}} album in March 2010. The album received mixed reviews. Robert Sheffield of Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, saying that Love [...] "worked hard on these songs, instead of just babbling a bunch of druggy bullshit and assuming people would buy it, the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> on her 2004 flop, America's Sweetheart". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also gave the album three out of five stars, saying, [...] "It's Marianne Faithfull's substance-ravaged voice {{that comes to mind}} most often while listening to songs like 'Honey' and 'For Once in Your Life'. The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date... the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim." [...] Love and the band toured internationally from 2010 into late 2012 promoting the record, after which she dropped the Hole name and returned to a solo career.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{it speaks}} about a love {{stronger}} than a gunshot, {{and according to}} Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe magazine it is a [...] "less violent version" [...] of Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "Man Down". Edmonton Journal Sandra Sperounes wrote that on [...] "No Love Allowed" [...] Rihanna plays with the Barbadian accent on the same <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> on her 2005 debut single [...] "Pon de Replay". According to a reviewer of Billboard, Rihanna's cry to the love police in the song, {{can be heard in}} the lines, [...] "Broken heart was the case / go'on and put him away / He's the only one one one / I let get the best of me." [...] BBC Music's Natalie Shaw wrote that some of the song's lyrics like [...] "Like a bullet your love hit me to the core / I was flying ‘til you knocked me to the floor", are uncomfortably balanced between true love and awkward acrimony. According to Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly, the up stated lines [...] "doesn’t sound like she has forgiven" [...] Chris Brown for the 2009 domestic violence case.|$|E

500|$|James Roosevelt's lackluster {{campaign}} led Douglas backers {{to state}} {{that he was not}} only failing to help Douglas, he was not even helping himself. With polls showing the two major Democratic candidates in dire straits, Roosevelt wrote to President Truman, proposing that Truman campaign in the state in the final days before the election. Truman refused to do so. He also declined Douglas's pleas for a letter of support (privately calling her [...] "one of the worst nuisances"), and even refused to allow her to be photographed with him at a signing ceremony for a water bill which would benefit California. When Truman flew to Wake Island in early October to confer with General Douglas MacArthur regarding the Korean situation, he returned via San Francisco, but told the press he had no political appointments scheduled. He spoke at an event at the War Memorial Opera House during his stopover, but both Roosevelt and Douglas were relegated to orchestra-level seats, far from the presidential box. Vice President Alben Barkley did visit the state to campaign for the Democrats. However, Time magazine wrote that he {{did not appear to be}} helpful to Douglas's campaign. The Vice President stated that while he was not familiar with Douglas's votes, he was certain that she had voted the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> out of sincere conviction and urged Californians to give the Senate a [...] "dose of brains and beauty". Attorney General McGrath also came to California to campaign for the Democrats, and freshman Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota tirelessly worked the San Joaquin Valley, talking to farmers and workers.|$|E

I will say there’s a reason <b>she</b> looks the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> and wears those clothes. And it’s all {{a part of the}} game, learning those reasons one by one." [...] Joosten herself was surprised with the controversy, but said [...] "When I got to see her design, I was shocked too. But everybody didn’t get to hear her story yet so I can understand people are angry about it or saying she is showing too much. But I am not bothered by it.” ...|$|R

They were: 1. Visual Thinkers like her who think in photographically specific images. 2. Music and Math Thinkers – these people think in patterns and may be good at mathematics, chess, and programming computers. 3. Verbal Logic Thinkers – These people think in word details and their favorite subject may be history.|$|E

2500|$|The series {{began at}} a time when {{violence}} on television was under intense scrutiny. As a result, Wonder Woman was less frequently seen punching or kicking people the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> in the early episodes. She would usually be shown pushing and throwing enemies or using creativity to get them to somehow knock themselves out (such as jumping high into the air to cause pursuers to collide). Despite the wartime setting, she almost never resorted to deadly force. The only exception occurs in the pilot episode when she sinks a German U-boat by crashing an airplane into it, presumably killing everyone aboard. [...] Wonder Woman herself was occasionally overpowered by chloroform and poison gas, but she always came {{back in the second half}} of the show to save the day. In some episodes, her enemies learn the secret of her superhuman strength – her magic belt – and temporarily steal it, leaving her with average human strength. Her indestructible lasso and bracelets were stolen or taken away in one episode (leaving her defenseless against gunfire), but Wonder Woman recovered them by the end of the episode. (In the comics, Wonder Woman's bracelets were welded onto her forearms, and she would lose most of her strength if men were to join them forcibly with metal.) ...|$|E

She chose to leave Callum with her grandmother, Hilda, {{so she could get}} herself cleaned up. Hilda then had everything related to Sonya removed from the family. Callum was around four or five when Sonya left and Morey believed that he had blocked out the bad memories of her. Morey commented that Sonya's relationship with Callum would have been [...] "a love-hate one" [...] because she was only 16 when she had him. He would have become like a younger brother to her rather than a son. Executive producer Susan Bower defended the storyline when asked why Sonya and Callum's history had been rewritten. She told an Inside Soap columnist that they worked with the character's established backgrounds and found reasons and motivations for Sonya to act the <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>did.</b> Bower admitted that the only discrepancy that could be pointed out was Callum's age.
