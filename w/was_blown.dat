5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} {{so badly that}} almost every window, front and back, <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> in as the {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof {{of at least one}} house <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, {{not only because of the}} smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, 13lumber vessels were beached. A 30mile (48km) {{portion of}} the Carrabelle, Tallahassee and Georgia Railroad was washed away. A {{passenger}} train <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> over 100yards from the track, injuring many passengers. Many boats at the harbor and the wharfs in Lanark were wrecked. The local summer resort of Lanark Inn <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> into the Gulf of Mexico. Large portions of stores and pavilions in the city were damaged. At McIntyre, virtually the entire town was destroyed, except for only two mill boilers. The city of Curtis Mill was completely destroyed. Additionally, the resort city of St. Teresa suffered significant damage. A total of fifteen ships either destroyed or beached at Dog Island, including the Benjamin C. Cromwell and James A. Garfield. At least 15people were reported missing. Six drowning deaths were confirmed in association with this storm.|$|E
5|$|One of Grant's photos <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> up {{to eight}} feet and {{displayed}} for one year in Grand Central Terminal in New York City.

A menu item at the Casa Dominguez restaurant in Dallas was named for Grant.|$|E
5|$|St. Dominic's Demi-Bastion, {{also known}} as Left Demi-Bastion or No. 5 Bastion – the demi-bastion at the {{northern}} end of the land front. It was damaged during the Froberg mutiny of 1807, when its magazine <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> up.|$|E
25|$|Flutes can {{be played}} with several {{different}} air sources. Conventional flutes <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> with the mouth, although some cultures use nose flutes. The flue pipes of organs, which are acoustically similar to duct flutes, <b>are</b> <b>blown</b> by bellows or fans.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{instruments}} {{can be used}} to measure wind direction, such as the windsock and wind vane. Both of these instruments work by moving to minimize air resistance. The way a weather vane is pointed by prevailing winds indicates the direction from which the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b> The larger opening of a windsock faces the direction that the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> from; its tail, with the smaller opening, points in the direction the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nearly all wind {{turbines}} are of an upwind design, meaning the rotor {{is in front}} of the nacelle when the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b> Some turbines <b>are</b> of a downwind design, meaning the rotor is behind the nacelle when the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing.</b>|$|R
5|$|Steam Whistle – An {{industrial}} {{steam whistle}} has been present on Georgia Tech's campus {{ever since the}} early industrial shop years. It typically <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> for the change of classes at five minutes before the hour. On football game days, the whistle is blown after every Yellow Jackets' score, and again after every Yellow Jackets' victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} of the wreck refutes Goodall's theory of a torpedo explosion, while the eyewitness {{evidence of}} venting from the 4-inch magazine prior to the main explosion conflicts with {{the theory that the}} Hood <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> up by her own guns. The other theories listed above remain valid possibilities.|$|E
5|$|The statue <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> {{from its}} place by an {{artillery}} shell during the 1945 Battle of Manila, completely obliterating its marble pedestal. It was re-erected on November 13, 1946 inside the UST campus in Sampaloc, Manila.|$|E
50|$|Trees <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> {{over and}} {{buildings}} damaged as the derecho raced through Wisconsin. A meteorologist {{working at the}} University of Wisconsin-Madison saw the derecho approach from the southeastern shore of Lake Mendota near Madison, Wisconsin. On the university's campus, the windows <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> out of {{the second and third}} stories of the library. Tiles from the roof <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> off and landed several blocks to the southeast. The strong winds resulted in 4 foot (1.2 m) waves on Lake Mendota.|$|R

50|$|In the 1806 Vellore Mutiny, {{beginning}} with a night massacre of British officers and soldiers, with many sepoys killed during the suppression, 6 individuals were sentenced to <b>be</b> <b>blown</b> from the guns. In 1812, a plot was discovered at Travancore to kill the European officers; two ring leaders <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> from the guns, and several others were hanged. In 1819, six deserters who had joined the ousted rajah of the annexed Kingdom of Nagpur were apprehended by the British and <b>were</b> <b>blown</b> from the guns on 7 February. In 1832 Bangalore, a conspiracy allegedly designed to exterminate all Europeans was discovered. Out of some 100 implicated, 4 were sentenced to <b>be</b> <b>blown</b> from the guns, two others to be shot.|$|R
5|$|At 8:00am on 1 August, a Georgian police lorry <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> up by {{an improvised}} {{explosive}} device on the road near Tskhinvali, injuring five Georgian policemen. In response, Georgian snipers assaulted some of the South Ossetian border checkpoints, killing four Ossetians and injuring seven. According to majority of reports, South Ossetians were responsible for instigating the bomb explosion which marked the opening of hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, {{accompanied}} by his wife and her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York. The voyage was exceptionally stormy, and Bellomont's ship <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> well south, eventually putting into Barbados before continuing on to New York. He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.|$|E
5|$|Due to Turkish {{government}} {{fears of}} a terrorist attack, security measures during the summit were tight. Demonstrators {{from around the world}} gathered to protest against NATO or the American foreign policy under the George W. Bush Administration, while the summit itself <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> off the front pages of the world press by the unexpected transfer of Iraqi sovereignty, coinciding with {{the first day of the}} NATO summit on June 28.|$|E
5000|$|Third, Luke {{states that}} when they got behind Clauda, the sailors were afraid that they would <b>be</b> <b>blown</b> onto the Syrtis sandbanks of north Africa. However, {{for them to have}} <b>been</b> <b>blown</b> onto those banks from Clauda, Euraquilo would have had to have <b>been</b> <b>blowing</b> from a point somewhere between east 18 degrees north and east 37 degrees north. The point midway between these figures is east 27 degrees north. This figure is only 1/4 point off the mean figure of the {{previous}} calculation.|$|R

5|$|In the New York City area, a peak {{wind gust}} of 60mph (100km/h) was {{reported}} at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The winds caused some minor roof damage to buildings, and forced officials in New York City to cordon off parts of Manhattan as debris ranging from wrapping paper to crushed soda cans <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> about. This debris injured four people, one critically, and disrupted a 9/11 memorial service, though it continued as planned.|$|E
5|$|The inquest {{determined}} that Kehoe murdered Superintendent Emory Huyck {{on the morning}} of May 18. It was also the jury's verdict that the school <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> up as part of a plan and that Kehoe alone, without the aid of conspirators, murdered 43 people in total, including his wife Nellie. Suicide was determined to be the cause of Andrew Kehoe's death, which brought the total number of dead to 44 {{at the time of the}} inquest.|$|E
5|$|The ship <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> up {{by her own}} guns. At {{the second}} board, eyewitnesses {{reported}} unusual types of discharge from the 15-inch guns of Hood, suggesting that a shell could have detonated within the gun, causing an explosion within the gunhouse. It is possible that, under the stress of combat, the safety measures, introduced after the disasters at Jutland to prevent such an explosion reaching the magazines, could have failed.|$|E

5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that its cover <b>was</b> <b>blown.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} most of the next decade in duties in the Western Pacific, Yancey was decommissioned in March 1958 and placed in reserve at Olympia, Washington. Yancey was reactivated {{in the aftermath of}} the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and recommissioned in November. During the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis she sailed in support of the U.S. blockade of Cuba, and during the April 1965 U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic she carried almost a quarter of all of the evacuees from Santo Domingo. In January 1970, Yancey <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> by a storm into the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel which closed the structure for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|At Passo de Torres, many shipyards were destroyed, as {{they were}} not {{designed}} to withstand the pressure differentials caused by Catarina's winds; widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well. Near the Mampituba River, a house <b>was</b> <b>blown</b> about 50meters (165ft) upstream, literally landing in another state: it originally {{was built in the}} Torres municipality of Rio Grande do Sul, yet it ended up in Passo de Torres, within Santa Catarina. In rural areas, the corn, banana, and rice fields received the most damage, although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses, as they had harvested before Catarina made landfall.|$|E

5000|$|Lee shore, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} windward and ward shore, is a nautical {{term used to}} describe a stretch of shoreline that is to the lee side of a vessel — meaning the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> towards it. A weather shore has the wind blowing from inland over it out to sea. For example, a person standing on a shore when the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> out to sea (or any large body of water) is standing on a weather shore. If the wind <b>is</b> <b>blowing</b> into shore from the sea, the person is on a lee shore.|$|R
