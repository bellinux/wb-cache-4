5|$|While Richard was at Mile End, the Tower {{was taken}} by the rebels. A force of rebels, {{separate}} from those operating under Tyler at Mile End, approached the castle, possibly in the late morning. The gates were open to receive Richard on his return and a crowd of around 400 rebels entered the fortress, encountering no resistance, possibly because the guards <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> by them.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee is {{a mythical}} sea {{creature}} that {{appears as a}} horse-like demon when it ventures onto land. Writer and folklorist Ernest Marwick considered it {{very similar to the}} Norwegian nøkk, the nuggle of the Shetlands and the kelpie. A unique and solitary creature possessing extensive evil powers, its malevolent behaviour can influence events throughout the islands. Islanders <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> of the creature and would not speak its name without immediately saying a prayer. It was often found in the vicinity of a beach, but would never come ashore if it was raining.|$|E

25|$|In 1960, {{the former}} {{government}} minister Sebazungu ordered {{the burning of}} the Muslim quarter and the mosque in Rwamagana. Following this event, Muslims <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> {{and many of them}} fled to neighbouring countries. It is alleged that the Catholic Church was involved in these events, which aggravated the bitterness between Muslims and Christians.|$|E
25|$|For many years, the Purples enjoyed {{seemingly}} {{complete immunity}} from police interference as witnesses to crimes <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> of testifying against any criminal {{identified as a}} Purple gangster. The Purple Gang reputedly became more arrogant and sloppy as time progressed. They dressed flamboyantly and were well-known {{to the public and}} the city's night spots. They lived in fine houses and soon a romantic aura surrounded the Purples that distinguished them from the other gangs in Detroit. Jealousies, egos, and inter-gang quarrels would eventually cause the Purple Gang to collapse. The police eventually moved against them as gang members began leaving behind too much evidence of their crimes.|$|E
25|$|William A. Prestre, a Swiss citizen {{living in}} Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{proposed}} using large dogs to kill Japanese soldiers. He convinced {{the military to}} lease an entire island in the Mississippi River to house the training facilities. There the army hoped to train {{as many as two}} million dogs. The idea was to begin island invasions with landing craft releasing thousands of dogs against the Japanese defenders, then followed up by troops as the Japanese defenders scattered in confusion. One of the biggest problems encountered was getting Japanese soldiers to train the dogs, as very few Japanese soldiers were being captured. Eventually, Japanese-American soldiers volunteered for the training. The biggest problem was the dogs, as they were either too docile, did not respond to training teaching them to rush across beaches, or <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> by shellfire. After millions of dollars were spent, the program was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a popular}} {{misconception}} among the general public that most Jews went to their deaths passively. Nothing {{could be further from}} the truth. Jewish resistance to the Nazis comprised not only their armed struggle but also spiritual and cultural opposition which gave the Jews dignity despite the inhumane conditions of life in the ghettos. Many forms of resistance were present, even though the elders <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> by the prospect of mass retaliation against the women and children in the case of anti-Nazi revolt. As the German authorities undertook to liquidate the ghettos, armed resistance was offered in over 100 locations on either side of Polish-Soviet border of 1939, overwhelmingly in eastern Poland. The uprisings erupted in 5 major cities, 45 provincial towns, 5 major concentration and extermination camps, as well as in at least 18 forced labor camps. Notably, the only rebellions in Nazi camps were Jewish.|$|E
25|$|Another program {{attempted}} during World War II {{was suggested}} by a Swiss citizen living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. William A. Prestre proposed using large dogs to kill Japanese soldiers. He convinced {{the military to}} lease an entire island in the Mississippi to house the training facilities. There the army hoped to train {{as many as two}} million dogs. The idea was to begin island invasions with landing craft releasing thousands of dogs against the Japanese defenders, then followed up by troops as the Japanese defenders scattered in confusion. One of the biggest problems encountered was getting Japanese soldiers to train the dogs with, as few Japanese soldiers were being captured. Eventually, Japanese-American soldiers volunteered for the training. The biggest problem was with the dogs; either they were too docile, did not properly respond to their beach crossing training, or <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> by shellfire. After millions of dollars spent and inconclusive results, the program was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 208–209, Gan Ning fought in the Battle of Red Cliffs under Zhou Yu's command {{against the forces of}} Cao Cao, and {{defeated}} the enemy at Wulin (烏林). He also participated in the Battle of Jiangling, a follow-up to Red Cliffs. Sun Quan's forces, led by Zhou Yu, attacked Cao Cao's general Cao Ren at Nan Commandery (南郡; commandery capital in present-day Jiangling County, Hubei) but were unable to conquer the city. Gan Ning suggested that he lead a separate force to capture Yiling (夷陵; around present-day Yichang, Hubei). He had only a few hundred soldiers with him when he reached Yiling but the strength of his army increased to around 1,000 after he recruited some men in the area. Cao Ren sent 5,000–6,000 troops to besiege Gan Ning at Yiling. Cao Ren's men built high towers, from which they rained arrows upon Yiling. Gan Ning's men <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> but Gan remained calm. He sent a messenger to request aid from Zhou Yu, who heeded Lü Meng's plan and led reinforcements to help Gan Ning while leaving behind Ling Tong to defend their position. Zhou Yu, Lü Meng and the others succeeded in lifting the siege at Yiling, while Ling Tong managed to hold his ground well for that period of time. Eventually, Cao Ren was ordered to abandon Nan Commandery because the prolonged war had drained much manpower and resources on Cao Cao's side, and this resulted in the capture of the commandery by Sun Quan's forces.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, on Victory in Europe Day, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret mingled {{anonymously}} {{with the}} celebratory crowds in the streets of London. Elizabeth later said in a rare interview, [...] "We asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> of being recognised... I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief." ...|$|E
500|$|George and May {{had five}} {{sons and a}} daughter. Randolph Churchill claimed that George was a strict father, {{to the extent that}} his {{children}} <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> of him, and that George had remarked to Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby: [...] "My father was frightened of his mother, I was frightened of my father, and I am damned well going {{to see to it that}} my children are frightened of me." [...] In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.|$|E

500|$|The {{provisions}} of the Confederate armies were running out. Horses and camels were dying out of hunger and wounds. For days the weather had been exceptionally cold and wet. Violent winds blew out the camp fires, taking away from the Confederate army their source of heat. The Muslim camp, however, was sheltered from such winds. [...] The enemy’s tents were torn up, their fires were extinguished, the sand and rain beat in their faces, and they <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> by the portents against them. They had already well nigh fallen out among themselves. During the night the Confederate armies withdrew, and by morning the ground was cleared of all enemy forces.|$|E
500|$|According to folklorist Jennifer Westwood, the stoor worm's {{head was}} [...] "like a great mountain"; its breath was putrid, contaminating plants and {{destroying}} any humans or animals with its blast. Traill Dennison reported the serpent's length was [...] "beyond telling, and reached {{thousands and thousands}} of miles in the sea". Giant sea swells and earthquakes were attributed to the beast yawning, a sign it wanted to be fed rather than of fatigue. Islanders <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> of the serpent; it was described by Traill Dennison, who transcribed its story, as [...] "the worst of the nine fearful curses that plague mankind". A further tale recorded by Traill Dennison gives a brief mention of another stoor worm, described as the progeny of the Orcadian monster, which is killed when it is severed in two by an oversized mythical ship.|$|E
500|$|That night Coolidge {{received}} a telegram from AFL leader Samuel Gompers. [...] "Whatever disorder has occurred", Gompers wrote, [...] "is due to Curtis's {{order in which}} {{the right of the}} policemen has been denied…" [...] Coolidge publicly answered Gompers's telegram, denying any justification whatsoever for the strike – and his response launched him into the national consciousness (quoted, above left). Newspapers across the nation picked up on Coolidge's statement and he became the newest hero to opponents of the strike. In the midst of the First Red Scare, many Americans <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> of the spread of communist revolution, like those that had taken place in Russia, Hungary, and Germany. While Coolidge had lost some friends among organized labor, conservatives across the nation had seen a rising star. Although he usually acted with deliberation, the Boston police strike gave him a national reputation as a decisive leader, and as a strict enforcer of law and order.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the war, nearly 21 million people lived in the North {{compared}} to 9 million in the South. While the North's population was almost entirely white, the South had an enormous number of black slaves and people of color. [...] While the latter were free, becoming a soldier was seen as the prerogative of white men only. Many Southerners <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> at the idea of a black man with a gun. Excluding old men and boys, the white males available for Confederate service were less than two million. [...] There was also the additional burden that the near four million black slaves had to be heavily policed as there was no trust between the owner and [...] "owned". The North had vastly greater industrial capacity, built nearly all of the locomotives, steamships, and industrial machinery and had a much larger and more integrated railroad system. Nearly all of the munitions facilities were in the North, while critical ingredients for gunpowder were in very short supply in the South.|$|E
500|$|With {{the accompaniment}} of loud noise made from {{metallic}} tools and weapons being clapped together, the Albanians charged into the Turkish camp. The Ottomans were caught by surprise and, despite their large numbers, <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> by the fury of the Albanian assault, thinking they were attacking in larger numbers than they actually had. Hamza tried to reorder his men, assuring them that the Albanians were few. Isak bey, tried to send reinforcements to Hamza's men, but the arrival of new Albanian contingents forced him to turn his attention. A series of cavalry charges and counter-charges kept the battle moving with a rain of missiles and arquebusiers forcing the Ottomans {{into the heart of}} the camp. Seeing that they were surrounded, the Ottoman force began to panic and melted away. Hamza was thus captured, though Isak bey fled. The Ottoman dead may have been as high as 30,000, but it is unlikely that they suffered more than 15,000 deaths. In addition, 15,000 men were taken prisoner, twenty-four standards were captured, and all the riches in the camp were lost to the Albanians. A multitude of men were also captured, among them Hamza Kastrioti. The fallen Albanian warriors were buried in the Cathedral of St. Mary in the village of Shumri ( [...] east of Mamurrasi) near the battlefield.|$|E
500|$|On 6November, with Fawkes {{maintaining}} his silence, the fugitives raided Warwick Castle {{for supplies}} {{and continued to}} Norbrook to collect weapons. [...] From there they continued their journey to Huddington. [...] Bates left the group and travelled to Coughton Court to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Father Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army. [...] Garnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their [...] "wicked actions", before himself fleeing. [...] Several priests set out for Warwick, worried {{about the fate of}} their colleagues. [...] They were caught, and then imprisoned in London. [...] Catesby and the others arrived at Huddington early in the afternoon, and were met by Thomas Wintour. [...] They received practically no support or sympathy from those they met, including family members, who <b>were</b> <b>terrified</b> at the prospect of being associated with treason. [...] They continued on to Holbeche House on the border of Staffordshire, the home of Stephen Littleton, a member of their ever-decreasing band of followers. Whilst there Stephen Littleton and Thomas Wintour went to 'Pepperhill', the Shropshire residence of Sir John Talbot to gain support but to no avail. Tired and desperate, they spread out some of the now-soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, to dry out. [...] Although gunpowder does not explode unless physically contained, a spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and a man named Morgan (a member of the hunting party).|$|E
