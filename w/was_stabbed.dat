5|$|Before {{heading out}} of Brazil on a mid-1991 European tour, Sepultura {{performed}} one more concert in São Paulo, the country's largest city. It {{took place at}} Praça Charles Miller (in front of Estádio do Pacaembu), on May 11. Local military police expected 10,000 to attend. 30,000 showed up instead, making crowd management nearly impossible. Six people were hurt, 18 were arrested and one was murdered with an axe. A week before, a young man <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> to death at a Ramones concert in São Paulo, during a brawl between headbangers and skinheads. These events were followed by a huge mainstream media backlash throughout the country against rock music.|$|E
5|$|Even though Sava's {{diplomacy}} was of {{no effect}} either, Strez died the night after Sava's departure. Serbian sources present the death of Strez as a miracle, Strez being stabbed by an angel, though in reality he was very likely murdered in a plot orchestrated by Sava. Historian John V. A. Fine theorizes that Sava may have found supporters among Strez's nobles, {{some of whom had}} turned against him and organized his murder, only to defect to Serbia immediately afterwards. According to the hagiography of Saint Sava, in his dying words Strez claimed he <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> by a young soldier on the order of Sava.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Wallwork {{moved to}} West Bromwich Albion, {{where he was}} the Player of the Year for 2004–05. He was not always a regular in the side however, and spent time on loan at Bradford City, Barnsley and Huddersfield Town. His spell at Barnsley was cut short when he <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> in a nightclub, causing him to miss more than two months of the 2006–07 season. Wallwork was {{transferred}} to Sheffield Wednesday in January 2008, but was released just four months later. In December 2011, he was sentenced to 15 months in prison after he pleaded guilty to three counts of receiving stolen goods.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, Van der Sloot was {{transferred}} to Challapalca prison in the mountainous South of Peru, where circumstances are harsh due to the location's altitude. Two months later, a Dutch online news service claimed that Van der Sloot <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> and critically injured by fellow prisoners in Peru. Although Van der Sloot's wife's claim of a stabbing is contested by Peruvian authorities, photos have been published showing Van der Sloot as suffering from multiple stab wounds from two separate attacks.|$|E

On April 8, while traveling to the temple, Caracalla <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> to death by Justin Martialis, a soldier whom Macrinus had recruited to commit the murder. In the aftermath, Martialis was killed by one of Caracalla's men.|$|E

5|$|Meermin {{set sail}} from Madagascar on 20 January 1766, {{heading to the}} Cape Colony. Two days into the trip, Johann Godfried Krause, the ship's chief merchant, persuaded the captain, Gerrit Cristoffel Muller, to release the Malagasy slaves from their {{shackles}} and thus avoid attrition by death and disease in their overcrowded living conditions. The Malagasy were put to working the ship and entertaining the crew. In mid-February, Krause ordered the Malagasy to clean some Madagascan weapons, which they subsequently used to seize the ship {{in an attempt to}} regain their freedom; Krause was among the first of the crew to be killed, and Muller <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> three times but survived.|$|E

His parents Ronald John O'Sullivan and Maria O'Sullivan (née Catalano) ran a string of sex shops in Soho. O'Sullivan's father was jailed in 1992 for murder and released 18 years later. In 1991 dad-of-two Bruce Bryan <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> to death inside a club on Chelsea’s King’s Road. O’Sullivan, then 37, {{had been on a}} drinking binge with a friend when he went “looking for trouble” at the club. Bruce was murdered with a 3.75 inch lock knife wielded by O'Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|On August 1, 1844, Wickliffe {{and two of}} {{his daughters}} boarded the {{steamship}} Georgia traveling from Old Point Comfort in Virginia to Baltimore, Maryland. While en route, he <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> in the chest by a man wielding a claspknife. The knife bounced off Wickliffe's breastbone without damaging any major internal organs, and a U.S. Navy officer prevented a second blow from hitting Wickliffe. Wickliffe's attacker, J. McLean Gardner, was disarmed and arrested. Later that night, he wrote Wickliffe a letter of apology. Wickliffe was not seriously injured, and returned home three days after the attack. Gardner was tried and found to be insane; he was later sent to an asylum.|$|E

5|$|On the Wednesday at 1:00, Galatasaray fans {{attacked}} {{a bar in}} Strøget in Copenhagen, where some Arsenal fans were located. The Arsenal fans left the bar to confront the Galatasaray fans, {{which led to a}} fight lasting for an hour before riot police managed to control it and arrested four Britons and four Turks. In the fight, Paul Dineen, an Arsenal fan, <b>was</b> <b>stabbed,</b> leading to Arsenal offering fans refunds if {{they did not want to}} fly to the game. Dineen was released from hospital later in the day and attended the match as a guest of the Arsenal directors.|$|E
5|$|One Arsenal supporter, Paul Dineen <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> in {{the back}} with a knife, during the riots in a pub, near the City Hall Square. The {{incident}} caused Arsenal to offer their fans full compensation, if {{they did not want to}} travel and attend the match. Another three members of the public, identified as one Englishman, Turk and Dutchman were also wounded by knifing when the event was still under its way. Sixty people, all presumed to have been involved, were detained by Danish law enforcement, while another 19 suffered injuries as a result of the violence.|$|E
5|$|PC Blakelock {{had been}} {{assigned}} {{on the night of}} his death to Serial 502, a unit of 10 constables and one sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters. When the rioters forced the officers back, Blakelock stumbled and fell. Surrounded by a mob of 30–50 people, he received over 40 injuries inflicted by machetes or similar, and was found with a six-inch-long knife in his neck, buried up to the hilt. He was the first constable to be killed in a riot in Britain since 1833, when PC Robert Culley <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> to death in Clerkenwell, London.|$|E

5|$|President Tyler {{appointed}} Wickliffe as Postmaster General following Wickliffe's term as governor. While {{aboard a}} steamship in 1844, he <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> {{by a man}} who was later found to be insane. In 1845, President James K. Polk sent Wickliffe on a secret mission to report on British and French intents with regard to annexing Texas and to assess the feasibility of the United States undertaking such an action. Wickliffe's participation in this endeavor further distanced him from the Whigs.|$|E
5|$|Tabram {{was killed}} on 7 August 1888; she had {{suffered}} 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and {{the closeness of the}} location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them. The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> rather than slashed at the throat and abdomen, and many experts do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray is not aggressive, and {{has been}} known to {{approach}} and investigate divers. However, if harassed it can inflict a severe wound with its venomous tail spine. This species has been responsible for at least one recorded fatality, of a diver who <b>was</b> <b>stabbed</b> while attempting to ride the ray. The round ribbontail ray is popular with ecotourist divers because of its size and spectacular appearance. Although displayed in public aquariums, it is not hardy and 81 days is the longest one has been kept in captivity.|$|E
