25|$|Red Cloud {{and other}} Indian leaders, {{encouraged}} by their successes, decided {{to undertake a}} large military operation against Fort Kearny before winter snows forced them to break up their large village on the Tongue River and disperse. The decoy trick had worked on December 6 {{and they decided to}} try it again, this time with a force adequate to destroy any group of soldiers sent to chase them. The warriors, possibly numbering more than 1,000, congregated about 10 miles north of Fort Kearny, reconnoitered, and decided the best place to lay the trap was along the Bozeman trail north of Lodge Trail ridge. It <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> but only about four miles from Fort Kearny. The Cheyenne and Arapaho took up positions {{on the west side of}} the trail and the Lakota on the east. The group of Indians chosen to decoy the soldiers included the young Oglala, Crazy Horse.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographical}} {{layout of}} Teotihuacan {{is a good}} example of the Mesoamerican tradition of planning cities, settlements, and buildings as a representation of the view of the Universe. Its urban grid is aligned to precisely 15.5º east of North. One theory says this is due to the fact that the sun rose at that same angle during the same summer day each year. Settlers used the alignment to calibrate their sense of time or as a marker for planting crops or performing certain rituals. Another theory is that there are numerous ancient sites in Mesoamerica that seem to be oriented with the tallest mountain in their given area. This appears to be the case at Teotihuacan, although the mountain to which it is oriented is not visible from within the Teotihuacan complex due to a closer mountain ridge. Pecked-cross circles throughout the city and in the surrounding regions indicate how the people managed to maintain the urban grid over long distances. It also enabled them to orient the Pyramids to the distant mountain that <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|E
25|$|At 7.30am the {{infantry}} battalions set {{off from the}} east of the town; first the 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers, then the 1st King's Royal Rifle Corps and lastly the 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers (the 1st Leicestershire Regiment were left to guard the camp). The first part of the advance went well and they reached a small wood {{at the foot of the}} hill where they found some shelter but beyond the wood there was a wall with a small gap and then open ground. Some of the Dublins were pinned down in a ditch ahead and the Fusiliers were lining the wall to the left. Shortly after 9am Symons rode up to the wood being followed by an aide-de-camp holding up a red pennant, to find out why the attack had stalled. He ordered the men to proceed, rode through the wood and dismounted, then walked through the gap in the wall still being followed by his pennant. After a few moments he returned and was helped to remount his horse. He then rode back from the front lines until he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> from his troops before he asked for assistance from the Indian stretcher bearers as he had been shot in the stomach.|$|E

25|$|The Apex Building was {{the last}} to be {{constructed}} and dedicated. A major impetus for the building's construction came in June 1935, when the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) headquarters at C Street NW and 21st Street NW was razed {{to make way for the}} Federal Reserve Board Building. The FTC petitioned the Commission on Fine Arts to permit it to occupy the Apex Building. Testing for the foundation began in September 1936, and was completed shortly thereafter. With design work long completed and President Roosevelt expressing his wish that the structure be built, a $3.1 million contract for the building was signed on December 29, 1936. Using the George Washington trowel, President Roosevelt laid the cornerstone for the building on July 12, 1937. The building's $3.665 million cost was paid for out of Public Works Administration funds, and officials estimated it would be ready for occupation by January 1, 1938. Demolition of the old foundation for the unbuilt Washington Memorial occurred in July 1937, and much of the Apex Building's steel superstructure was rising by then as well. The great depth of the building's foundation meant that the crane operator lifting the steel beams into place <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> in the basement, and a series of telephone links from observers on the street relayed instructions to him. By December 1937, the building was two months ahead of schedule.|$|E
25|$|After {{learning}} {{he was to}} {{be removed}} from command, Villeneuve put to sea on the morning of 19 October and when the last ship had left port, around noon the following day, he set sail for the Mediterranean. The British frigates, which had been sent {{to keep track of the}} enemy fleet throughout the night, were spotted at around 1900 hrs and the order was given to form line of battle. On the morning of 21 October, the main British fleet, which <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> and sailing parallel some 10 miles away, turned to intercept. Nelson had already made his plans: to break the enemy line some two or three ships ahead of their commander-in-chief in the centre and achieve victory before the van could come to their aid. At 0600 hrs, Nelson ordered his fleet into two columns. Fitful winds made it a slow business, and for more than six hours, the two columns of British ships slowly approached the French line before , leading the lee column, was able to open fire on Fougueux. Around 30 minutes later, Victory broke the line between Bucentaure and Redoutable firing a treble shotted broadside into the stern of the former from a range of a few yards. At a quarter past one, Nelson was shot, the fatal musket ball entering his left shoulder and lodging in his spine. He died at half past four. Such killing had taken place on Victorys quarter deck that Redoutable attempted to board her, but they were thwarted by the arrival of Eliab Harvey in the 98-gun , whose broadside devastated the French ship. Nelson's last order was for the fleet to anchor, but this was countermanded by Vice Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. Victory suffered 57 killed and 102 wounded.|$|E
500|$|The crash site, which <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight</b> of {{standard}} flight lanes and not visible by ship, remained undetected and undisturbed {{for over a}} month. On July 10, 1942, an American PBY Catalina piloted by Lieutenant William [...] "Bill" [...] Thies spotted the wreckage. Thies's Catalina had been patrolling by dead reckoning and had become lost. On spotting the Shumagin Islands, he reoriented his plane and began to return to Dutch Harbor by the most direct course—over Akutan Island. Machinist Mate Albert Knack, who was the plane captain (note: the term [...] "plane captain" [...] in US Navy usage refers to an aircraft's assigned maintenance crew chief, not the pilot-in-command), spotted Koga's wreck. Thies's plane circled the crash site for several minutes, noted its position on the map, and returned to Dutch Harbor to report it. Thies convinced his commanding officer, Paul Foley, to let him return with a salvage team. The next day (July 11), the team flew out to inspect the wreck. Navy photographer's mate Arthur W. Bauman took pictures as they worked.|$|E

He told his friend Trevor Birdsall to drive off quickly. Sutcliffe said he had followed a prostitute into a garage and hit her over the head with a stone in a sock. According to his statement, Sutcliffe said, [...] "I got out of the car, went across the road and hit her. The force of the impact tore the toe off the sock and whatever was in it came out.

2500|$|Avenger and the escorts {{joined the}} homeward bound Convoy QP 14 at 05:00 17 September and sent up a Swordfish on anti-submarine patrol, which was {{maintained}} throughout the day. Ice {{on the flight}} deck prevented any flying on 18 September, and the convoy turned further north, away from the German airfields in Norway. A German reconnaissance plane did locate the convoy, but only kept it under observation and did not attack, so the Sea Hurricanes were kept on board Avenger. The Swordfish remained on patrol on 19 and 20 September without locating any U-boats. One merchant ship was torpedoed and sunk on 20 September. At 18:45 that evening, with three destroyers as escorts, Avenger left the convoy for Scapa Flow. Almost {{as soon as she}} <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> [...] was torpedoed, and two days later a merchant ship was torpedoed and sunk. After returning to port, Avengers captain Commander Colthust submitted a report highlighting how inadequate the Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes had been. In a single escort carrier the number of airframes and crews were never enough for what they had been asked to do. The Swordfish could not take off from the short flight deck of an escort carrier deck armed with torpedoes or enough depth charges and fuel to be useful, and the [...]303 calibre machine guns on the Sea Hurricane were ineffective against the armoured German reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|As the {{shooting}} continued outside, nurses and medics entered the building. [...] An unidentified soldier secured the south double doors with his ACU belt {{and rushed to}} help the wounded. According to the responding nurses, {{there was so much}} blood covering the floor inside the building, that they were unable to maintain balance, and had difficulty reaching the wounded to help them. In the area outside the building, Hasan continued to shoot at fleeing soldiers. [...] Herman Toro, Director of the Soldier Readiness Processing Site, arrived at this time. [...] Hasan had gone around the building and <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sight,</b> but still shooting. Toro and another site worker rushed to assist Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman who was down on the ground north of the medical building. [...] They both took her by the arms and tried to carry her to safety when Hasan returned and aimed his red laser across Toro's chest, but did not fire. [...] Toro took cover behind an electrical box and saw civilian police Sergeant Mark Todd arrive and shout commands at Hasan to surrender. Todd said: [...] "Then he turned and fired a couple of rounds at me. I didn't hear him say a word, he just turned and fired." [...] The two exchanged shots, and then Hasan's pistol was empty. [...] He stopped, turned and reached into his pocket for a new magazine and was felled by five shots from Todd, who ran over to him, kicked the pistol out of his hand and put handcuffs on him as he fell unconscious. LTC Tom Eberhart, Deputy Director of Human Resources, Fort Hood, arrived and entered the Medical Building to help. [...] He had to step over bodies to enter the building's north entrance. He assisted another soldier in performing CPR on one of the wounded soldiers at the building's waiting area. [...] Folding chairs were scattered all around. [...] He noticed a soldier outside the south doors of the building and went to help. [...] He had to remove the belt from the door and went outside as others were arriving. [...] The downed soldier was Staff Sergeant Alonzo Lunsford, a medical assistant from the building. [...] He had two wounds in the abdomen and a wound to the scalp. He was unconscious and LTC Eberhart went back into the building to retrieve a folding table. [...] Other soldiers assisted getting SSG Lunsford onto the table and around the building to the triage area.|$|E
