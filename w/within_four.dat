5|$|A small {{proportion}} of follicles open and release their seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in one study, B.brownii seeds {{were placed on the}} ground in both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots <b>within</b> <b>four</b> weeks.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Olga {{eventually}} {{obtained a}} divorce and married Kulikovsky. They had two sons. Her brother was deposed in the Russian Revolution of 1917, and Kulikovsky was dismissed from the army by the revolutionary government. The Kulikovskys were forced into exile, and he became a farmer and businessman in Denmark, where they lived until after World War II. In 1948, they emigrated to Canada as agricultural immigrants, but <b>within</b> <b>four</b> years of their arrival they had sold their farm and moved into a small suburban house. He became increasingly disabled by back pain, and died in 1958 aged 76.|$|E
5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this <b>within</b> <b>four</b> or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E

5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters end up with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers. This transfer is quite efficient: flowers typically lose nearly all their pollen <b>within</b> <b>four</b> hours of opening, and pollen is deposited on the majority of stigmata. Around 15% of these stigmata end up with pollen lodged in the stigmatic groove, a prerequisite to fertilisation.|$|E
5|$|In February 1959, formal {{authority}} for beginning construction was granted. However, while Menzies was on holiday, some {{officials from the}} Department of Treasury convinced ministers to withhold money needed for the lake, so {{the start of the}} construction was delayed. Once it started, progress was fast. At its peak, the number of people physically working on the construction in the lakes was between 400 and 500. John Overall, the Commissioner of the NCDC, promised Menzies that the work would be finished <b>within</b> <b>four</b> years, and he succeeded, despite the Prime Minister's scepticism. Equipment was quickly requisitioned.|$|E

American Aztecas have four categories of registration based on the relative degree of blood from each foundation breed, seeking an ideal blend of 3/8 Quarter Horse and 5/8 Andalusian.
