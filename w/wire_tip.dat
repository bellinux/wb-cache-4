Unpredictable {{movement of the}} RF <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> was a major concern while crossing long occlusive segment in caudal to cranial direction, especially when the flexible tip {{moves away from the}} power generator towards the beating heart.

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{investigate}} the {{factors related to}} the successful computed tomography–guided nodule localization for subsequent nodule excision. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records for 181 patients who had undergone computed tomography–guided nodule localization using hook wire and subsequent video-assisted thoracic surgery resection for lung nodules. The demographic factors, nodule factors, and technical factors were reviewed to determine what affects effective nodule localization for video-assisted thoracic surgery resection using both univariate and multivariate models. ResultsA total of 174 patients were included in our study. Successful localization was accomplished in 166 patients (95 %). Univariate analysis implicated patient age, nodule solidity, zonal location, and a sufficient distance between the hook <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> and pleural surface as significant factors for successful localization. Multivariate analysis focused on {{the distance between the}} <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> and pleural surface as the sole independent factor for successful localization (P = . 012). ConclusionsThe distance between the hook <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> and pleural surface was the major significant factor for successful computed tomography–guided nodule localization for subsequent video-assisted thoracic surgery resection. Thus, the localization of a hook wire adjacent to a target nodule with sufficient depth from the pleural surface is crucial {{to the success of the}} procedure...|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{two very}} different morphologies for GaP and GaAs nanowires grown by Au-assisted MOVPE on Si(111) substrates: rodlike wires and tapered <b>wires</b> with sharp <b>tips.</b> We show that the morphology {{is related to the}} stability of the particles at the <b>wire</b> <b>tips</b> during growth, and we propose that the mechanism of this effect is diffusion of Au away from the tip. Diffusion occurs, leading to tapered wires, only if there is a clean Si surface to act as a reservoir for the Au. Furthermore, the presence of indium in the particles, even at background levels from previous growth runs, inhibits the migration of Au. These results demonstrate a dramatic example of the sensitivity of wire morphology to substrate and particle chemistry, which could provide an important tool to tune nanowire morphology through particle alloying or surface treatment...|$|R

30|$|RF wire recanalization {{has been}} {{successfully}} used to treat pulmonary atresia, to create atrial septal perforation, to recanalize completely occluded thoracic aorta and to recanalize chronic or malignant central venous obstructions after failure of conventional endovascular techniques (Guimaraes et al., 2012; Auyang et al., 2018). In these studies, RF wire successfully recanalized upto 10  cm long chronic occlusions within SV, BV and SVC (Guimaraes et al., 2012). However use of RF wire to cross long IVC occlusions has not been reported. Anticipated obstacles for RF wire recanalization were long course of IVC, tough organized scar tissue within these chronic occlusions, risk of damaging critical neighboring structures due to high penetrability and flexibility of RF <b>wire</b> <b>tip,</b> and constant destabilization of RF <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> due to motion of the heart.|$|E
40|$|In this project, the {{mechanism}} of ultrasonic angioplasty was investigated. The "Jackhammer" effect hypothesis was discredited because it was shown that the cholesterol plaque could be ablated without any physical contact between the plaque and the ultrasonic <b>wire</b> <b>tip.</b> In addition, {{the results showed that}} in a liquid medium with many nucleation sites such as tap water or Hexabrix which was used as a dampener in the ultrasonic wire system, cavitation occurred at distances less than 0. 86 mm from the vibrating ultrasonic <b>wire</b> <b>tip.</b> These results were obtained with the ultrasonic generator supplying a 22. 5 kHz signal at a 20. 7 W power output setting. It was concluded that the liquid jets caused by collapsing cavitation bubbles near the cholesterol plaque were responsible for the ablation of the plaque. In other words, the results confirmed that {{the mechanism}} of ultrasonic angioplasty is cavitation...|$|E

40|$|Coatings {{produced}} by feeding a steel wire into a high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) torch are being intensively studied by {{the automotive industry}} as a cost-effective alternative to the more expensive cast iron sleeves currently used in aluminum engine blocks. The microstructure and properties of the sprayed coatings and the overall economics of the process depend critically on the melting and atomization occurring at the <b>wire</b> <b>tip.</b> This paper presents results characterizing several aspects of wire melting and droplet breakup in an HVOF device. Fluctuations in the incandescent emission of the plume one centimeter downstream from the <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> were recorded using a fast photodiode. A Fourier transform of the light traces provided {{a measure of the}} stripping rate of molten material from the <b>wire</b> <b>tip.</b> Simultaneous in-flight measurement of atomized particle size and velocity distributions were made using a Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA). The recorded size distributions approximate a log-normal distribution. Small particles traveled faster than large particles, but the difference was considerably smaller than simple aerodynamic drag arguments would suggest. A set of experiments was carried out to determine the effect that variations in torch gas flow rates have on wire melt rate, average particle size, and average particle velocity. The observed variation of particle size with spray condition is qualitatively consistent with a Weber breakup of the droplets coming off the wire. The measurements also showed {{that it was possible to}} significantly alter atomized particle size and velocity without appreciably changing the wire melt rate...|$|E

After 2  mm cranial advancement, multiple real time anteroposterior (AP) & oblique views were obtained to confirm the intraluminal location of RF wire.

By fully incorporating a metallic tip on a silicon chip using modern micromachining and nanofabrication techniques, we realize so-called smart tips and show the possibility of device-based STM tips. Contrary to conventional etched metal <b>wire</b> <b>tips,</b> these can be integrated into lithographically defined electrical or photonic circuits, as well as mechanical systems. We experimentally demonstrate that the performance of the smart tips is on par with conventional ones, both in stability and resolution. In situ tip preparation methods are possible and we verify that they can resolve the herringbone reconstruction and Friedel oscillations on Au(111) surfaces. In addition, these devices can be made to accommodate two isolated tips with sub- 50 nm apex-to-apex distance to measure electron correlations at the nanoscale using a new type of double-tip experiment described in this letter...|$|R

She had full elbow flexion and extension; however, her forearm rotations were restricted and painful. Investigations revealed prominent <b>tips</b> of the <b>wire,</b> eroding the radial tuberosity with heterotopic ossification between the radius and ulna.

During surgery, before implant removal, examination under anaesthesia revealed a mechanical block of the rotation beyond 30 ° on pronation and supination from neutral. However, after the removal of implant, the mechanical block eased off and with gentle manipulation, full pronation and supination were achieved.

40|$|Abstract. Electrical {{conductance}} {{through various}} nanocontacts between gold electrodes is studied {{by using the}} density functional theory, scalar-relativistic pseudopotentials, generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation energy and the recursion-transfer-matrix method along with channel decomposition. The nanocontact is modeled with pyramidal fcc(100) tips and 1 to 5 gold atoms between the tips. Upon elongation of the contact by adding gold atoms between the tips, the conductance at Fermi energy EF evolves from G ≈ 3 G 0 to G ≈ 1 G 0 (G 0 = 2 e/h 2). Formation of a true one-atom point contact, with G ≈ 1 G 0 and only one open channel, requires at least one atom with coordination number 2 in the <b>wire.</b> <b>Tips</b> that share a common vertex atom or tips with touching vertex atoms have three partially open conductance channels at EF, and the symmetries of the channels are governed by the wave functions of the tips. The long 5 -atom contact develops conductance oscillations and conductance gaps in the studied energy range − 3 ≤ E −EF ≤ 5 eV, which reflects oscillations in the local density of electron states in the 5 -atom linear ”gold molecule” between the electrodes, and a weak coupling of this ”molecule ” to the tips...|$|R

40|$|The {{addition}} of wire {{is an option}} during laser welding, laser cladding or laser additive manufacturing. By high speedimaging of leading wire addition during fibre laser keyhole welding {{it was observed that}} for the 40 experiments underconsideration the <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> always established a concave boiling front. The front appears similar to a keyhole front and issort of a continuation of the keyhole, owing to the leading wire employment. For most of the parameters the melt istransferred downwards from the <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> into the melt pool surrounding the keyhole front. In other words, hardly anyuncontrolled spatter to the sides was observed. A trailing wire would normally tend to a completely different behaviour. Typical as well as limiting phenomena of the wire melt transfer mechanism are presented and discussed. Controlledvertical melt transfer of the wire through the ablation pressure from a laser-induced boiling front, either in contact withthe workpiece surface or positioned higher above, can be a desirable mechanism of metal deposition for the differenttechniques, namely welding, surface treatment or LAM. By suitable choice of the laser power density above the boilingthreshold, the here observed mechanism can be applied in a controllable manner. An interesting technique option islateral beam oscillation for example by a galvanometer optics which shears off the melt {{in a manner similar to}} remotefusion cutting. The process limits become different to the static technique. The wire melt transfer technique has thepotential to be developed further towards a highly controllable remote drop transfer, e. g. in terms of direction.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the heating {{enhancement}} produced by microbubble ultrasound contrast agents {{have focused on the}} risks posed by unencapsulated bubbles. The results from theoretical simulations by the authors, however, indicate that the temperature rise due to viscous dissipation in the microbubble coatings may be sufficient to generate harmful bio-effects even under conventionally "safe" insonation conditions. The aim of this work was to make a preliminary experimental examination of the heating effect generated by contrast agents under diagnostic imaging conditions. Fine wire metal resistance thermometers were embedded in an agar block, with the <b>wire</b> <b>tips</b> protruding into a central cylindrical cavity into which suspensions of different types of microbubble agent (Optison®, Levovist® and Expancel®) could be injected. The results indicate that such agents do produce a measurable temperature rise under typical diagnostic conditions, which is of the same order of magnitude as that predicted theoretically. There are a number of areas of uncertainty, including {{the degree to which the}} sound field was modified by the presence of the contrast agent. If the validity of the results is confirmed by future experiments, however, there may be significant implications for the validity of existing safety guidelines.

40|$|The {{diameter}} of droplets in electric arc wire spraying {{is critical in}} determining the microstructure, porosity and oxide content of the resulting sprayed coatings. Droplet diameter controls dynamic and thermal behaviour in the spray, and the splashing and spreading behaviour of droplets at deposition. In electric arc wire spraying, the droplet diameter is determined {{by a combination of}} the melting behaviour of the feedstock wires in a direct current arc, combined with primary and secondary atomisation processes under the action of a high velocity atomising gas. The high frequency arc voltage variations during electric arc spraying of Fe- 0 · 8 C have been investigated and arc voltage fluctuations related to atomisation events occurring at the <b>wire</b> <b>tips</b> during spraying. A simple analytical model has been proposed which allows the {{diameter of}} primary droplets produced by atomisation to be calculated from the wire feedrate and the average time period for material removal, which was obtained from the voltage traces. Primary droplets were then assumed to undergo secondary atomisation according to correlations from the literature, and resulting droplet diameters were compared with diameters measured by experiment.
