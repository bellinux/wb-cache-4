40|$|Abstract:- The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to study the performance of household refrigerator having both air and <b>water-cooled</b> <b>condenser,</b> with 0. 06 % mass fraction CuO nanoparticle-lubricant mixture and different types of compressor oils. The experiment was done using HFC 134 a as the refrigerant, CuO nanoparticles, Polyol-ester oil (POE) oil which is used as the conventional lubricant in the household refrigerator and SUNISO 3 GS mineral oil as the lubricant alternatively. The result indicates that the refrigerator performance had improved while using CuO nanoparticle-lubricant mixture. The performance was also improved when HFC 134 a/SUNISO 3 GS mineral oil system was used instead of HFC 134 a/POE oil system and there was also an enhancement when <b>water-cooled</b> <b>condenser</b> was used instead of the conventional air-cooled condenser on all load conditions. The HFC 134 a/CuO/SUNISO 3 GS mineral oil system works normally and safely in the refrigerator. HFC 134 a/CuO/SUNISO 3 GS mineral oil system reduced the energy consumption between 12 % and 19 % when compared with the HFC 134 a/POE oil system and between 9 % and 14 % while working with <b>water-cooled</b> <b>condenser</b> on various load conditions.

The condenser prototype was assessed under a range of different physical conditions, that is, external water cooling, partial insulation and aspects of air circulation, via implementing an internal honeycomb screen structure.

With smaller temperature differences across the evaporator and condenser, the compressor work is reduced and energy efficiency is improved. To reduce these temperature differences, techniques of heat transfer enhancement are needed. This forms {{the basis of the}} present study in which heat transfer characteristics of enhanced annuli are studied experimentally in a <b>water-cooled</b> <b>condenser.</b> Normally superheated refrigerant vapour enters the condenser in turbulent flow conditions, and exits as subcooled liquid which is in the transition region of flow.

In order to avoid limiting the apparatus to location near a water outlet, and for greater ease and speed in handling the condensers, air cooling has since been substituted. A choice of several designs of trap is offered. Boiler-receiver tubes made to fit the Klett-Summerson photoelectric colorimeter provide for the extraction and the development and reading of the colors, {{all in the same}} tubes. The method of extraction is given, and the errors due to esters of cholesterol and other substances are discussed. AT CHILDREN’s HOSPITAL in Cincinnati, Ohio (4, 5) and elsewhere (1) {{it has been shown that}} extraction of either wet samples on cellulose fibers or samples predried on cellulose resulted in irregularly low values for cholesterol, presumably due to incomplete extraction. In contrast, drying of the sample in the extractor in the presence of chlo-roform vapor with collection of the moisture driven off from the sam-ple in a water trap inserted between the condenser and the sample re-sults in a uniformly maximum yield. Apparatus The extractor shown in Fig. 1 is a modification of one with water-cooled condensers used at Children’s Hospital. The older apparatus functioned satisfactorily, but it could not be operated far from a wa-ter connection, amid handling of the water-cooled condensers was awk...|$|E
