5|$|To {{demonstrate}} Henry's immortality, Miller {{decided that}} Henry would die and <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pain {{every time he}} died. Anything on Henry's body would disappear with his body during each death. Miller felt that Henry's naked rebirth in water would be an interesting {{way to keep the}} show's protagonist alive during the series by completing the death and rebirth process; the nakedness would create several comedic moments within the series. Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life.|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} the spectators {{would now be}} able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view, while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the 1970 final between Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forcing the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} the main level {{in its current form}} evolved around this time, but the Space Deck (now named SkyPod) {{was not part of the}} plans until some time later. One {{engineer}} in particular felt that visitors <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> higher observation deck would be worth paying extra for, and the costs in terms of construction were not prohibitive. It was also some time around this point that it was realized that the tower could become the world's tallest structure, and plans were changed to incorporate subtle modifications throughout the structure to this end.|$|E

500|$|By the 1850s, cheap Southern cotton {{fueled the}} {{industries}} of Europe. The mills of Britain, {{developed during the}} first half of the 19th century, by 1860 used more cotton than the rest of the industrialized world combined. Cotton imports to Britain came almost entirely from the American South. [...] According to an article in The Economist in 1853, [...] "let any great social or physical convulsion visit the United States, and England <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> shock from Land's End to John O'Groat's.

500|$|Chrono Cross was {{scored by}} {{freelance}} video game music composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who previously worked on Chrono Trigger. Director Masato Kato personally commissioned Mitsuda's involvement, citing {{a need for}} the [...] "Chrono sound". Kato envisioned a [...] "Southeast Asian feel, mixed with the foreign tastes and the tones of countries such as Greece"; Mitsuda centered his work around old world cultural influences, including Mediterranean, Fado, Celtic, and percussive African music. Mitsuda cited visual inspiration for songs: [...] "All of my subjects are taken from scenery. I love artwork." [...] To complement the theme of parallel worlds, he gave Another and Home respectively dark and bright moods, and hoped players <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> emotions of [...] "'burning soul,' 'lonely world,' and 'unforgettable memories'". Mitsuda and Kato planned music samples and sound effects with the philosophy of [...] "a few sounds {{with a lot of}} content".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself {{to secure the}} Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over {{the execution of the}} prostitution story in this episode, asking, [...] "If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme." [...] Sepinwall described the story as [...] "something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, {{that it has to be}} just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then." [...] Todd VanDerWerff opined that,"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter what we try to do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them." [...] VanDerWerff compared it to the [...] "Employee of the Month" [...] episode of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call [...] "The Other Woman" [...] a stronger episode.|$|E
2500|$|Dina Spector of the Business Insider {{called the}} {{publication}} of the memos [...] "underwhelming" [...] and gave three reasons why Britain <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same way. According to her, firstly, Charles and his staff were reportedly [...] "sanguine" [...] about the decision to publish the letters and there were claims by those who had read the letters that they were mostly harmless. Additionally, even if they did contain some damaging material, the letters would be published with some redactions to avoid naming third parties. Furthermore, fewer than 10 of the 27 published letters were personally authored by Charles and all of them are typed out rather than handwritten in the “black spider” handwriting.|$|E
2500|$|Rutledge {{recommended}} that the executive power should consist of a single person, rather than several, because he felt that one person <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> responsibility of the office more acutely. Because the president {{would not be able}} to defer a decision to another [...] "co-president", Rutledge concluded that a single person would be more likely to make a good choice. Rutledge was largely responsible for denying the Supreme Court the right to give advisory opinions. Being a judge himself, he strongly believed that a judge’s sole purpose was to resolve legal conflicts; he held that a judge should hand down an opinion only when ruling on an actual case. He also thought that the legal community was the higher tier of society.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{the first}} film's release, {{producer}} Tom DeSanto had [...] "a very cool idea" [...] to introduce the Dinobots, while Bay was interested in including an aircraft carrier, which was dropped from the 2007 film. Orci claimed they did not incorporate these characters into Revenge of the Fallen {{because they could not}} think of a way to justify the Dinobots' choice of form, and were unable to fit in the aircraft carrier. Orci also admitted he was dismissive of the Dinobots because he does not like dinosaurs, saying [...] "I recognize I am weird in that department." [...] However, he became fonder of them during filming because of their popularity with fans. He added [...] "I couldn't see why a Transformer <b>would</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> need to disguise himself in front of a bunch of lizards. Movie-wise, I mean. Once the general audience is fully on board with the whole thing, maybe Dinobots in the future." [...] When asked on the subject, Michael Bay said he hated the Dinobots and they had never been in consideration for being featured in the movies.|$|E
