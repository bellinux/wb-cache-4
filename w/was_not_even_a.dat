25|$|The {{most direct}} attack by Bandić on Josipović {{came at the}} very end of the first debate when he accused him of {{damaging}} the city of Zagreb in 1998 by allegedly abusing his position as the head of the oversight board of a savings bank Zlatica to make a series of financial maneuvers that enabled him to collect his deposit of 138,000 Deutsche Marks from the bank Komercijalna banka that had been blocked and later went bankrupt. Bandić cited a court ruling from 2006 that had invalidated those maneuvers. Josipović defended himself saying that was merely a civil case which he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> part of and that he did not commit any illegal actions.

25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Kamakura in 1333, changes in the balance of power forced the Ashikaga to try to modify the state's economy and structure. The process of {{reversing}} the extreme parcelization of the land would occupy the next couple of centuries. The dynasty tried to eradicate local warlords and concentrate power in its hands, but this in fact only increased the level of hostility. It seized the lands of the Hōjō clan, former rulers of Kamakura, and of all defeated gokenin but, at seeing the Ashikaga keep those lands for themselves, {{to the point where they}} had direct control of almost 25% of the country, their own allies started fearing for themselves and their heirs. The ensuing turmoil gave inadvertently rise to the figure of the daimyō feudal lord, although the term wouldn't be in wide use for the first half a century. Many daimyōs were shugo or jitō of gokenin extraction or even noblemen, but most were new faces who had supplanted their superiors. Crucially, because resisting the Ashikaga required a strong central power and a smooth succession, among them inheritance was no longer shared, but passed on intact to a single heir, who often <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> blood relative, but a promising man adopted specifically to be heir.|$|E

500|$|However {{federal judge}} William H. Pauley III in New York City [...] the U.S. government's global {{telephone}} data-gathering system {{is needed to}} thwart potential terrorist attacks, and that it can only work if everyone's calls are swept in. U.S. District Judge Pauley also ruled that Congress legally set up the program {{and that it does}} not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. He further ruled that when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> search under the Fourth Amendment. He also concluded that the controlling precedent is Smith v.

The American Civil Liberties Union declared on January 2, 2014 that it will appeal Judge Pauley's ruling that NSA bulk phone record collection is legal.

500|$|Keats's {{use of the}} odal hymn in his six odes, {{along with}} {{his use of the}} odal hymn with a responsal voice in [...] "Ode to a Grecian Urn" [...] and [...] "Ode to a Nightingale", created, {{according}} to Walter Jackson Bate, [...] "a new tone for the English lyric." [...] Bate, when speaking about the 1819 odes, wrote: [...] "The productivity of the three and a half weeks that begins on April 21 is difficult to parallel in the career of any modern writer. Yet to Keats it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> new beginning. It was rather a matter of becoming more alive in preparation for the next beginning." [...] In addition to this, Bate argued that [...] "It is because [...] "To Autumn" [...] is so uniquely a distillation, and at many different levels, that each generation has found {{it one of the most}} nearly perfect poems in English. We need not be afraid of continuing to use the adjective [...] The 'Ode to a Nightingale,' for example, is a less 'perfect' though a greater poem." [...] Charles Patterson argued the relationship of [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] as the greatest 1819 ode of Keats, [...] "The meaningfulness and range of the poem, along with its controlled execution and powerfully suggestive imagery, entitle it to a high place among Keats's great odes. It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of [...] "To Autumn" [...] but is much superior in these qualities to the [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over-all structure. In fact, the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom." [...] Later, Ayumi Mizukoshi argued that early audiences did not support [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] because it [...] "turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] drew neither attention nor admiration. Herbert Grierson believed [...] "Nightingale" [...] to be superior to the other odes because it and [...] "To Autumn" [...] were more logical and contained stronger arguments. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'." ...|$|E
