The industry {{has been successful in}} creating large numbers of jobs, with furniture manufacturing enterprises employing around 40,000 workers and manufacturing in total around 107,000, making Bình Định leading in the South Central Coast in terms of industrial employment. More than two thirds of the province's gross industrial output is produced in Quy Nhơn, which is the region's third largest industrial center after Da Nang and Nha Trang.

25|$|In contrast, {{the regions}} of Lika and Gorski Kotar are the least {{developed}} area {{of the region and}} the country in general. The main source of income in the area was forestry, farming and animal husbandry. Forests represent a development potential of the area as 45% of Lika and as much as 83% of Gorski Kotar is forested. Industrialisation of the region started after the World War II, with a particular emphasis on development of <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industry</b> in Gorski Kotar and other industries elsewhere in the region, but it did not create sufficient jobs to prevent economic migrations. Furthermore, the economic structure of the area sustained great downturn in the 1990s during the Croatian War of Independence. Since the 2000s, an increasing prominence is given to tourism sector, especially rural tourism.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{exposures}} and perceived risks (occupational, lifestyle and psychological factors) of workers in the <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> in Mutare, Zimbabwe. This project is important in that it will reveal why health, safety and hygiene should be perceived as a priority in the <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> of the Eastern Highlands of Zimbabwe. Usually industry owners and managers do not provide sufficient maintenance and funds to buy protective equipment. Not much attention is thus given to the safety of processing machines, equipment and tools as well as their link to health requirements in such enterprises. A detailed descriptive study was undertaken in the timber working industries of Mutare with a focus between August and October 2011. Random sampling was employed targeting the workers and management of the <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> enterprises. The samples were drawn from the total employees in each of the two companies under survey. The first company with 1200 full-time workers and 800 contract workers had a sample size of 200 (10 % of the total) and the second with 1400 workers had sample size of 140. The wood sector in Zimbabwe needs to be guided by a comprehensive national policy dealing with safety and health issues in the <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> sector. <b>Wood</b> workers seem not to be covered by appropriate national safety and health standard.

40|$|Industrial {{clusters}} are {{a worldwide}} phenomenon and a vital economic development strategy. The approach is defined {{to be an}} interrelationship between its participants, suppliers and related industries that produce synergy in a particular location. Clustering has become to be a crucial feature in nation’s economic development. However, the approach {{has not yet been}} studied widely in Sub-Saharan African countries and the existing number of empirical studies are limited. Therefore, this leaves a gap for an up-to-date study to investigate the possibilities of developing an efficient forest industry cluster in Angola. The {{purpose of the study was}} to critically assess and to define the potential of different <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> in connection to develop an efficient forest industry cluster in the Province of Huambo. The objective was to create a comprehensive picture of the existing market situation through a field study and to develop the future concept of <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries.</b> Research methods were qualitative in the empirical part of the study and quantitative in the investment calculations. The primary data were collected through a semi-structured field interviews and observations of existing operators. Interviews were conducted in January and February 2017 to obtain knowledge about the prevailing market situation and about the existing wood product manufacturers. The data were collected with nine interviews, which were transcribed. Pictures and video clips were recorded to support the observations from the factories in the data collection. Based on the field study and observations, investment alternatives were decided and calculated to different <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries.</b> Profitability of the investments were calculated with the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Multiple of Invested Capital (MOIC) and Wood Paying Capability (WPC) at stumpage. Attention was paid to the uncertainty in the calculations with the help of sensitivity analysis. The literature review was based on the cluster theory, collective efficiency and the capital expenditure projects. As a result of this study, an investment model was developed in a shape of a cluster. The cluster model contains five different dimensions: sustainable plantation forestry, production of primary wood products, production of secondary wood products, wood residues sufficient utilization and production of sustainable energy. This study suggests that veneer peeling and sawn timber production could be selected for the primary wood production, carpentry and furniture for the secondary <b>processing</b> and <b>wood</b> residues to produce sustainable energy. The corresponded 10 -year investments NPVs varied from USD 606 000 to USD 974 000 at an interest rate of 15 %. The maximum IRR achieved was 31. 6 % and the minimum was 16. 8 %. The highest WPC at stumpage achieved was USD 69. 8 and the lowest was USD 44. 1. The MOIC ranged between 2. 4 and 4. 0 times the invested capital. This study suggests that the Company could develop an efficient forest industry cluster around veneer peeling with the support from other <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> to the region...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of third-party forest and timber certification schemes in Indonesia has created benefits and challenges, mainly for forest industries. In the end, {{the interests and}} objectives of those industries will determine whether they decide to get certified and if so, what certification schemes they will use. This study analyses the stakeholder recognition of the competing forest legality and sustainability certification systems and describes the preferences for particular schemes based on stakeholder interests. Online questionnaires were distributed to relevant stakeholders, namely logging companies, <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries,</b> <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> associations, auditors, academics, environmental organisations and government officials. The results indicate that there are different scheme preferences based on the stakeholder's interests. Sistem verifikasi legalitas kayu (SVLK) is the most frequently preferred scheme due to the simplicity of its requirements and the low cost of its certifying process, while the forest stewardship council (FSC) is valued for its reputation and very high standards. Furthermore, lembaga ekolabel Indonesia (LEI) was least preferred because of its complexity {{and because it was}} unpopular with foreign end buyers, and the programme for the endorsement of forest certification (PEFC) was identified as being a complex scheme that was expensive and subject to high standards, and also appeared to have the least demand. Each scheme should be improved based on stakeholders' expectations, that their popularity with end buyers of timber products should be improved, and that this should be done in a way that allows logging and <b>wood</b> <b>processing</b> <b>industries</b> to choose freely the scheme that is most advantageous to them. ...|$|R
