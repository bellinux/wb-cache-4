40|$|Noninvasive macro- and microcirculatory tests provide {{quantitative}} information that offers answers to most questions posed in venous diseases. Duplex scanning <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the macrocirculation, and microcirculatory methods <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> and quantify venous microangiopathy. Laser Doppler flowmetry <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> perfusion. Transcutaneous Po 2 and Pco 2 measurements <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> study venous hypertension, and strain-gauge plethys-mography <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> capillary filtration. In venous hypertension, fluid filtration into the extracapillary compartment is increased. The increase in filtration {{is associated with}} a decreased venoarteriolar response. To quantify capillary filtration, two methods have been developed: venous occlusion plethysmography and rate of ankle swelling. These methods quantify filtration into the extracapillary compartment and, therefore, are an indication of the formation of edema, the most frequent sign in venous hypertension. Other methods, such as the vacuum suction chamber and the edema tester, can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> changes due <b>to</b> treat-ments in venous hypertension.

3000|$|First, the 20 -item Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS; Watson et al. [1988]) <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> {{positive}} and negative mood states.

50|$|Theories of the {{executive}} system were largely driven by observations of patients having suffered frontal lobe damage.

50|$|Cardiac markers or {{cardiac enzymes}} are {{proteins}} that leak out of injured myocardial cells through their damaged cell membranes into the bloodstream. Until the 1980s, the enzymes SGOT and LDH <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> cardiac injury. Now, the markers {{most widely used}} in detection of MI are MB subtype of the enzyme creatine kinase and cardiac troponins T and I as they are more specific for myocardial injury. The cardiac troponins T and I which are released within 4-6 hours of an attack of MI and remain elevated for up to 2 weeks, have nearly complete tissue specificity and are now the preferred markers for assessing myocardial damage.Heart-type fatty acid binding protein is another marker, used in some home test kits.Elevated troponins {{in the setting of}} chest pain may accurately predict a high likelihood of a myocardial infarction in the near future.

In this quasi-experiment the researchers aimed to discover if clique membership status was linked to increases in children's psychopathology. Children from five different elementary schools in northwestern Quebec, Canada were the participants of this particular study.

By landing on the middle or front of the foot, barefoot runners have almost no impact collision." [...] Lieberman et al.'s study was an experiment that involved five groups of runners from Kenya and the United States. The two American groups were adult athletes who had run with shoes since childhood, and those who habitually ran barefoot or with minimal footwear such as Vibram FiveFingers (mentioned by name in the study). The three Kenyan groups were adults who had never run in shoes until late adolescence, {{as well as two}} teenage groups: those that habitually wore shoes and those that always ran barefoot. The runners were instructed to run over a force plate that was embedded in a 25-meter track, and were recorded during the run using a three-dimensional infrared kinematic system.
