Maggie Roswell was given the role of Maude, Ned's loving wife, and became a regular cast member with this episode. She had previously played supporting parts in the show's first season. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart, commented on Roswell's acting: [...] "Maggie has been blessed with a skill in creating one of the hardest things to create: the 'normal sound,' <b>whatever</b> <b>that</b> <b>is.</b> So she can easily slip into the gal next door [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|On {{its release}} most critics {{agreed that the}} book was both scandalous and career-ending. [...] (Even with {{a quarter of the}} 1,000-page {{original}} manuscript excised, it took lawyers at Random House fourteen months to approve it for publication.) Lewis Cole, in The Nation, described it as being [...] " [...] written but spat out, a breakneck, formless performance piece...propelled by spite and vanity". Newsweek's review called it a [...] "573-page primal scream", while one Hollywood producer said it was [...] "the longest suicide note in history". In the 2003 documentary version of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, based on Peter Biskind's 1998 anecdotal history of New Hollywood, Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial fury at Phillips' revelations, before more circumspectly listening to [...] "a little voice inside my head [...] 'Richard, Richard, the truth was so much worse'." [...] Despite Phillips' criticisms of Steven Spielberg in the book, Spielberg nevertheless invited her to a 1997 screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind as a way of [...] "keeping his friends close and his enemies closer." [...] Rapper Tupac Shakur mispronounces {{the title of the book}} in a Vibe Interview in 1996, stating briefly that it was one of the books he read recently. [...] "You’ll Never Work Again in Hollywood, <b>whatever</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that they’re talking about, all the people that slept together." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to her live action roles, Roswell did some voice acting in animated films and shows, including the voice of Teegra in Fire and Ice from 1983. This led to her being hired on the animated television series The Simpsons in 1989. Her first appearance was in the season one episode [...] "Homer's Night Out", in which she voiced the character Princess Kashmir (a belly dancer who seduces Homer). Out of the total thirteen episodes of the first season, Maggie Roswell appeared in four; however, they were only minor roles. Maggie Roswell did not become a regular cast member {{until the middle of}} the second season in the episode [...] "Dead Putting Society" [...] (1990), with the introduction of Maude Flanders (neighbor to the Simpson family and the loving wife of Ned Flanders). Maggie Roswell went on to voice other recurring characters on the show, such as Helen Lovejoy (the reverend's wife), Miss Hoover (an elementary school teacher), and Luann Van Houten (a housewife and mother), as well as several more one-time characters and background characters. Fellow Simpsons cast member Nancy Cartwright wrote in her autobiography that [...] "Maggie Roswell has been blessed with a skill in creating {{one of the hardest things}} to create: the 'normal sound,' <b>whatever</b> <b>that</b> <b>is.</b> So she can easily slip into the gal next door or any number of assorted reporters, medical students, jury members, accountants, scientists and moms." [...] Roswell was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on The Simpsons. She also received a 1997 Annie Award nomination in the category [...] "Best Individual Achievement: Voice Acting by a Female Performer in a TV Production" [...] for her role as Sharry Bobbins in the episode [...] "Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious", but lost to June Foray.|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Lopez, journalist Diane Sawyer of ABC News noted that people [...] "in the abuse counseling industry, have said you can't tell women that, they can't do that. That something that's dangerous, even {{to see it in}} their minds." [...] Lopez responded by stating: [...] "Well, you know, this is a movie that has the touches upon those themes, but really, it's a thriller [...] it's about empowering yourself in any situation, you know, that you have. When I read the script, I saw it as, you have the power within yourself, no matter how severe the situation can be, to change <b>whatever</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> to find that power within yourself to change any negative situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the songs}} on Paranoid evolved during onstage improvisational jams. In the Classic Albums {{documentary}} on the making of Paranoid, guitarist Tony Iommi declares that [...] "War Pigs" [...] came from [...] "one of the clubs" [...] with Butler adding, [...] "During the song [...] "Warning" [...] we used to jam that out and that particular night when were jamming it out Tony just went da-dum!" [...] In the same documentary, Iommi demonstrates his approach to the guitar solo in the song, explaining that [...] "I always {{tried to keep the}} bottom string ringing so it fills it out nicely." [...] On [...] "Planet Caravan", Osbourne sings through a Leslie speaker, with the singer telling Mojo in 2010, [...] "Then Rodger Bain used an oscillator on it <b>whatever</b> <b>that</b> <b>is.</b> It looks like a fridge with a knob on." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the series}} {{does not have}} many lead characters, there are many {{recurring}} characters. Jeffrey Dean Morgan portrays John Winchester, father of Sam and Dean. Making an appearance in the pilot episode, John does not return until nearly halfway through the first season, after which he becomes a recurring character until his eventual death in the second season's premiere episode, though his spirit returns to help his sons in the season finale. Later in the series, it is announced that John Winchester fathered a third son with another woman; a half-brother to Sam and Dean. According to writer John Shiban, it was decided early on that John would die. The writers found that having the brothers being separated from their father [...] "split the show". Shiban noted that [...] "...the boys were looking for Dad, and {{they were looking for}} a monster of the week, <b>whatever</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> whatever case crosses their path. It became difficult, because we thought it was like – 'what is Dad doing? Is he doing more interesting things than the boys are doing, or what?'" [...] They believed Morgan was initially reluctant about returning to Supernatural for the second season because of his recurring role on the series Grey's Anatomy. Future appearances of the character have been hindered by Morgan's busy schedule.|$|E

60|$|Before {{concluding}} these lectures {{there is}} one point to which I must advert,--though, as Mr. Darwin has said nothing about man in his book, it concerns myself rather than him;--for I have strongly maintained on sundry occasions that if Mr. Darwin's views are sound, they apply as much to man as to the lower mammals, seeing that it is perfectly demonstrable that the structural differences which separate man from the apes are not greater than those which separate some apes from others. There cannot be the slightest doubt {{in the world that}} the argument which applies to the improvement of the horse from an earlier stock, or of ape from ape, applies to the improvement of man from some simpler and lower stock than man. There is not a single faculty--functional or structural, moral, intellectual, or instinctive,--there is no faculty <b>whatever</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not capable of improvement; there is no faculty whatsoever which does not depend upon structure, and as structure tends to vary, it is capable of being improved.|$|E
