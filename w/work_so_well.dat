It doesn’t <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> so when The Bachelorette comes to Quahog, Peter takes Cleveland to {{audition}} for the show. Cleveland gets nervous at the audition and in an effort to calm him, Peter removes Cleveland’s clothes and then his own. The producers see this and Brian apologizes for what happened with Peter and Cleveland--Brian begins to explain how Cleveland and his wife recently divorced and how Cleveland's confused about what he really wants in a relationship.|$|E

25|$|When {{writing the}} stories, {{he started with}} their twist endings, and then worked his way back from that. He {{designed}} {{the flow of the}} story by using a spreadsheet, and wrote prototypes of potential outcomes of the different scenarios in the game; after this, he matched it with the flowchart he had made, and came up with the details of each story. As he wrote each scene, he imagined what the player might be thinking as they play through it, and decided what to write based on it; {{this was one of the}} most important things to him when writing. A key element to Uchikoshi when writing the outcomes of player decisions is that the importance of the decision usually is much greater after the player has made it, with the consequences only being revealed later on as the player learns more information; this was to maintain the high suspense level, and to avoid situations where choices end up not actually mattering. One big challenge for him was to maintain player interest through all branches; he tried to have each branch develop differently, as to avoid repetition and fatigue, and keep the player motivated. While he came up with the set-up, the setting, and the characters on his own, he had a sub-writer helping him with writing the second game, and two sub-writers for the third game. They would help with brainstorming ideas and finding what does not <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> and how to improve scenarios.|$|E

Hinckley went on to remark that [...] "Ugly Americans packs a lot into 21 or 22 minutes. Happily, its often droll and deadpan style makes it easy to watch even if some of the references are whizzing by unappreciated". RedEye critic Curt Wagner rated it three stars out of four and wrote that it includes [...] "visual [...] ", cultural references and [...] "so-fast-you'll-miss-them jokes" [...] that it might require multiple viewings. Wagner, however, meant that this was a rather positive feature, writing: [...] "For example, you might be laughing so hard at what just happened that you miss a fun line..."

But instead of being pent up yet emotionally explosive, like his David Fisher on [...] "Six Feet Under," [...] he's cool and calculated and entirely without compassion as Dexter. That makes him alluring, in a strange way. while Ryan found him to be [...] "among the more compelling characters on the small screen". Gilbert described Dexter as a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, calling him a vigilante obsessive murderer with a slippery personality, but [...] "also a hero of sorts". InsidePulse.com reviewer Mathan Erhardt said that the episode did not quite meet his expectations and that [...] "to me the major flaw in the show is Dexter’s noir-esque narration", although he finished the review by saying [...] "Dexter, despite [...] flaws is yet another reason why Sunday night {{is one of my favorite}} nights to watch TV." ...|$|E

500|$|The λ/4 coupled line {{design is}} good for coaxial and {{stripline}} implementations but does not <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> in the now popular microstrip format, although designs do exist. [...] The {{reason for this is}} that microstrip is not a homogeneous medium – there are two different mediums above and below the transmission strip. [...] This leads to transmission modes other than the usual TEM mode found in conductive circuits. [...] The propagation velocities of even and odd modes are different leading to signal dispersion. [...] A better solution for microstrip is a coupled line much shorter than λ/4, shown in figure 5, but this has the disadvantage of a coupling factor which rises noticeably with frequency. [...] A variation of this design sometimes encountered has the coupled line a higher impedance than the main line such as shown in figure 6. [...] This design is advantageous where the coupler is being fed to a detector for power monitoring. [...] The higher impedance line results in a higher RF voltage for a given main line power making the work of the detector diode easier.Vizmuller, pp.102–103 ...|$|E
500|$|Vore {{said that}} the game is lacking in [...] "advanced {{graphics}} and interface", but felt that it makes up for it through its charm and intrigue.

He called the music [...] "uniformly outstanding and used masterfully", both for conveying various moods throughout the story, and for characters' personalities. Harris found the music [...] "moody and appropriate", but wished {{that there had been}} a full voice-over as an option. He {{said that the}} game's art was nice, but not more than that. Thomas called the localization outstanding despite finding some errors, finding it impressive how smoothly Capcom was able to localize such a text-heavy game. Harris liked the game's localization, saying that the localization team's writing was what made the game design <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>well.</b> Walker called the localization incredible, and said that while there are a few spelling errors and grammatical errors in the text, it did not bother him much as the localization was included in the Japanese Nintendo DS release.|$|E

The comedy critic Bruce Dessau called it [...] "a hit", and Mark Butler, of i, offered a positive review of an episode that, for him, [...] "ended up being a down-to-earth, relatable and ultimately feel-good slice of drama". Many critics characterised it as weaker than other episodes of Inside No. 9, though both Julie McDowall (The National) and Lawrence stressed the quality of the programme overall, emphasising that [...] "Empty Orchestra" [...] was still commendable. The more upbeat story was [...] "a refreshingly restrained change of pace for the show" [...] for Butler, and possessed its [...] "own charm" [...] for Owen.

[...] Critics have repeatedly singled out Irons' performance, praising it extensively: Cindy White of IGN called Irons' performance [...] "deliciously smarmy," [...] while Andy Patrizio of IGN wrote that Irons voices Scar [...] "in perfect Shakespearean villain mode." [...] Rolling Stones Peter Travers hailed Irons for [...] "deliver a triumphantly witty vocal performance that ranks with Robin Williams' in Aladdin."

2500|$|Bowes in 1930 was a {{significant}} factor in what Kilburn called Yorkshire's [...] "year of changeover".

Arthur Wood, with whom Bowes was to <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> established himself as the successor to Arthur Dolphin as Yorkshire's keeper. Yorkshire's batting was already strong, based on the triumvirate of Sutcliffe, Holmes and Leyland. It has always been said that bowlers win both matches and championships; in the partnership of Bowes and Verity, Yorkshire were onto a winning combination. For his part, Verity with his slow-medium left-arm bowling was virtually unplayable on sticky wickets, while Bowes enhanced his natural armoury of pace, lift and in-swing by learning how to bowl out-swing too. As Kilburn put it, 1930 was a season that [...] "gave sight of the great team to come as the embers of a great team past were being raked out".|$|E

2500|$|The {{evidence}} above contains detailed {{descriptions of}} passing that are lacking in reports of the 1872 Glasgow international.

[...] Although the Scottish team are acknowledged to have worked better together during the first half, this contemporary account acknowledges that in the second half England played similarly: [...] "During {{the first half of the}} game the English team did not <b>work</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> together, but in the second half they left nothing to be desired in this respect." [...] The Scotsman concludes that the difference in styles in the first half is the advantage the Queens' Park players had [...] "through knowing each other's play" [...] as all came from the same club. [...] Unlike the 1872 Glasgow international - which was drawn - the contemporary evidence above shows that the Engineers' team playing style benefited their team play by winning games.
