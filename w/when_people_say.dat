[...] Nevertheless, {{he also said the}} film is [...] "an opera, not a documentary. That's what I say <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> it's historically inaccurate".

[...] "I don't know know what to say <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> I was lucky... life is so hard today," [...] she remarked. Vulović said she was [...] "tired" [...] of discussing her fall. She only occasionally granted interviews and declined numerous requests, most notably from Oprah Winfrey and the BBC. Vulović's deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years. In December 2016, Vulović's friends became concerned for her well-being after she abruptly stopped answering her telephone. On 23 December, locksmiths discovered Vulović's lifeless body in her apartment after forcing open the door. Vulović's friends said that she had struggled with heart ailments in the years leading up to her death. She was buried in Belgrade's New Cemetery on 27 December.|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Hindu noted, [...] "The film {{takes off}} as a typical family drama. The {{first half of the}} film is intentionally slow-paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of Georgekutty. This half combines the elements of drama and comedy genres. The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold {{from the end of the}} first half. The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family, despite the vengeful villainy of a corrupt cop, stands its ground even as the law takes its course." [...] When asked whether this change in narrative style post-interval was intentional, Jeethu replied: [...] "I really don't understand <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> the first half lacked pace. A story or a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a zig-zag away, capturing all the ups and downs of our lives. Right from the start if you accelerate the pace, sooner or later, the story-telling will lose its steam." ...|$|E
500|$|Jan C. Snow laments {{that the}} phrase was trite and {{indicative}} of the speaker's lack of vocabulary. She wrote that on Saturdays, people could be asked to [...] "have a relaxing day". People with highly variable jobs such as emergency room nurses may appreciate [...] "have a routine day", while mothers of young children may wish to [...] "have a quiet day". Debbie Lundberg wrote in her 2008book Have a Nice Day Is Not Thank You, and No Problem Is Not You're Welcome that service people should say [...] "thank you" [...] instead of [...] "have a nice day". She argued that [...] "thank you" [...] is shorter and is a [...] "recognition of the ability you have to thank someone", which adds more worth to the purchase than something that will occur in the future. Paul V. Marshall, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem, concurred, writing in the Reading Eagle that he prefers [...] "thank you" [...] to [...] "have a nice day" [...] or [...] "have a great day" [...] even though [...] "thank you" [...] has a [...] "host of socially acceptable responses". He stated that <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> [...] "thank you", they admit that they are dependent on others, {{which leads to a}} healthier, safer society.|$|E

That's even one of the reasons why, even though his name is Mario, I call him Perez Jr. I want him to have an alter ego as well so <b>when</b> <b>people</b> do <b>say</b> things that are hurtful about his dad or hurtful about him hopefully it won't hurt as much because they don't really know him.

2500|$|During the 1992 presidential campaign, Krugman praised Bill Clinton's {{economic}} plan in The New York Times, and Clinton's campaign {{used some of}} Krugman's work on income inequality. At the time, it was considered likely that Clinton would offer him {{a position in the}} new administration, but allegedly Krugman's volatility and outspokenness caused Clinton to look elsewhere. Krugman later said that he was [...] "temperamentally unsuited for that kind of role. You have to be very good at people skills, biting your tongue <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> silly things."

2500|$|Bree {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "hugely popular" [...] character despite her villainous characteristics and Blampied expected a lot more [...] "hate". Television New Zealand listed Bree, alongside sister Brooke (Beth Allen), as some of the soap's most memorable [...] "bad girls". Bree's introduction to the soap was named as a conclusion to a drama filled year for Brooke. Louise Wallace predicted the scenes where her character Annette Freeman, was held captive by Bree, would captivate the audience, she stated: [...] "It’s great stuff ... I think that there will be a few water cooler moments <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>say,</b> ‘Hey, did you see Shorty last night?’" [...] Television blogger Chris Philpot disliked the character of Bree and jokingly offered to sacrifice his least favoured characters – Harry Warner and Daniel Potts, in order for her to leave. The storyline that saw Bree lose her mind has been named as one of the show's most [...] "dramatic breakdowns".|$|E

2500|$|The {{mathematical}} analysis originated in {{observations of the}} behaviour of game equipment such as playing cards and dice, which are designed specifically to introduce random and equalized elements; in mathematical terms, they are subjects of indifference. [...] This {{is not the only}} way probabilistic statements are used in ordinary human language: <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "it will probably rain", they typically do not mean that the outcome of rain versus not-rain is a random factor that the odds currently favor; instead, such statements are perhaps better understood as qualifying their expectation of rain with a degree of confidence. [...] Likewise, when it is written that [...] "the most probable explanation" [...] of the name of Ludlow, Massachusetts [...] "is that it was named after Roger Ludlow", what is meant here is not that Roger Ludlow is favored by a random factor, but rather that this is the most plausible explanation of the evidence, which admits other, less likely explanations.|$|E
2500|$|Noted logician and philosopher Arthur Prior (originator of tense logic) {{has also}} drawn a {{distinction}} between what he calls A-facts and B-facts. The latter are facts about tenseless relations, such {{as the fact that}} the year 2025 is 25 years later than the year 2000. The former are tensed facts, such as the Jurassic age being in the past, or the end of the universe being in the future. Prior asks the reader to imagine having a headache, and after the headache subsides, saying [...] "thank goodness that's over." [...] Prior argues that the B-theory cannot make sense of this sentence. It seems bizarre to be thankful that a headache is earlier than one's utterance, anymore than being thankful that the headache is later than one's utterance. Indeed, most people who say [...] "thank goodness that's over" [...] are not even thinking of their own utterance. Therefore, <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>say</b> [...] "thank goodness that's over," [...] they are thankful for an A-fact, and not a B-fact. Yet, A-facts are only possible on the A-theory of time.|$|E

Mr. Gold says that is good because it is an antidote to a poison he was given yesterday. Anna, horrified by this, tells Rumplestiltskin the truth and says they must go back to the cottage. They look in Rumplestiltskin's crystal ball and see the man succumbing to the poison by turning into a mouse.|$|E
