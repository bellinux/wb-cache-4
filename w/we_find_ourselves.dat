25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} political application of social media is Barack Obama's election campaign in 2008. It {{was the first of}} its kind, as it successfully incorporated social media into its campaign winning strategy, evolving the way of political campaigns forever more in the ever-changing technological world <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> in today. His campaign won by engaging everyday people and empowering volunteers, donors and advocates, through social networks, text messaging, email messaging and online videos. Obama's social media campaign was vast, with his campaign boasting 5 million 'friends' on over 15 social networking sites, with over 3 million friends just on Facebook. Another significant success of the campaign was online videos, with nearly 2,000 YouTube videos being put online, receiving over 80 million views.|$|E
25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which none of us had any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

When you were little, you needed a lot of care; as you became older, you needed less care. There were times when you were sick that you needed special care until you were well or able to care for yourself. As we age, we may get to the point that we cannot care for ourselves, and we look to others to care for us. When that happens to persons around us, <b>we</b> may <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> in the role of caregiver. <b>We</b> may <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> at first just giving occasional care such as when a person is ill. <b>We</b> then <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> doing more, caring more, and spending more time in the role of caregiver...|$|R

[...] Burgas continued, comparing the nature of Anarky as a change agent against Batman: [...] "He is able to show how ineffective Batman is against the real problems of society, and although Batman stops his spree, <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> sympathizing much more with Anarky than with the representative of the status quo." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{opposition}} from 2012 to 2015, Tsakalotos {{was a key}} proponent of Syriza's economic policy. He argued that Greece needed something similar to the Marshall Plan, with a payment scheme that took into account {{the strength of the}} economy. He told Bloomberg News that [...] "People say that we are responsible for the situation <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> in. OK, sure. But I think that Germany will find it hard to argue that in 1953 [...] they were completely blameless." [...] He appeared in various international media as a spokesperson for Syriza and making the case for their policies: among others, he was interviewed on Lateline, an Australian news programme on ABC, by SBS, another Australian news channel, was quoted by the BBC and Bloomberg, and also appeared in an Intelligence Squared debate arguing for the motion 'Angela Merkel is Destroying Europe'.|$|E

Alonso was again fastest with a 1:34.057. Hamilton, both Ferraris, BMW Saubers, and Toyotas, as well as Rosberg (Williams) and Webber (Red Bull) also passed through to the final part. Kovalainen (Renault), Fisichella (Renault), Coulthard (Red Bull), Sato (Super Aguri), Button (Honda) and Liuzzi (STR) were eliminated. 2006 champions Renault failed to get either car into the final part. Team engineering director Pat Symonds noted that [...] "...the overall level of performance is disappointing, but we now have to knuckle down and {{make the most of the}} situation <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> in."

500|$|Disney {{grew more}} {{politically}} conservative {{as he got}} older. A Democratic Party supporter until the 1940 presidential election, when he switched allegiance to the Republicans, he became a generous donor to ThomasE.Dewey's 1944 bid for the presidency. In 1946 he was {{a founding member of}} the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, an organization who stated they [...] "believ in, and like, the American Way of Life... <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> in sharp revolt against a rising tide of Communism, Fascism and kindred beliefs, that seek by subversive means to undermine and change this way of life". In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Disney testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), where he branded Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman and William Pomerance, former animators and labor union organizers, as communist agitators; Disney stated that the 1941 strike led by them was part of an organized communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{succeeded in}} combating incipient scurvy through a fresh seal meat diet, and Scott recommended it for future polar expeditions. This was despite {{the medical profession}} being ignorant {{of the causes of}} the disease. At that time it was known that a fresh meat diet could provide a cure, but not that lack of fresh meat or other fresh food containing the as yet undiscovered vitamin C was a cause. Thus, fresh seal meat was taken on the southern journey [...] "in case <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> attacked by scurvy", On his 1907–09 Nimrod expedition Shackleton also avoided the disease through careful dietary provision, including extra penguin and seal meat. However, Lieutenant Edward Evans almost died of presumably self-inflicted scurvy during the 1910–13 Terra Nova expedition, and scurvy was particularly devastating to Shackleton's marooned Ross Sea party during 1915–16. It remained a danger until its causes were finally established, some 25years after the Discovery expedition.|$|E

However, Azuma has been criticized for creating characters that are [...] "too clean, too perfectly functional," [...] for overusing [...] "outrageous expressions and reactions," [...] and for dragging out jokes too long.|$|E

In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised the film, calling it, [...] "one {{of the most}} deliriously funny, ingenious and stylish American adventure movies ever made." [...] Roger Ebert in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "Two things, however, make Raiders of the Lost Ark {{more than just a}} technological triumph: its sense of humor and the droll style of its characters [...] <b>We</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourselves</b> laughing in surprise, in relief, in incredulity at the movie's ability to pile one incident upon another in an inexhaustible series of inventions." [...] He later added it to his list of [...] "Great Movies". Rolling Stone said the film was [...] "the ultimate Saturday action matinee–a film so funny and exciting it can be enjoyed any day of the week." [...] Bruce Williamson of Playboy claimed: [...] "There's more excitement in the first ten minutes of Raiders than any movie I have seen all year. By the time the explosive misadventures end, any movie-goer worth his salt ought to be exhausted." [...] Stephen Klain of Variety also praised the film. Yet, making an observation that would revisit the franchise with its next film, he felt that the film was surprisingly violent and bloody for a PG-rated film.|$|E
