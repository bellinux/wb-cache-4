40|$|A {{low cost}} {{solution}} for a mini roll to roll web coating system is presented. The design {{is very simple}} and involves only three active rolls, two winding/unwinding rolls and a cooling drum. No extra load cells are used to control the web winding mechanism operation. To reach such result it has been necessary to develop an adequate control solution which acts on the two <b>winding</b> <b>roll</b> torques to make the web moving properly. The effect of the control mechanism is to increase electronically the total mechanical inertia of the roll to roll system. In such manner the stick-slip motion of the web, induced by the dry friction affecting {{the rotation of the}} rolls, is avoided. The effectiveness of this strategy has been corroborated: a first test showed that the web moves continuously while it is kept tense; in a second experiment a-Si material has been deposited by hot-wire chemical vapor deposition technique. For that material the optical transmission measurements at several points over the deposited area indicate a satisfactory uniformity. The presented tests validate the goodness of the new control method...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the family}} Amaranthaceae (s.l., {{including}} Chenopodiaceae), several annual {{species of the}} genus Kali are the most notorious tumbleweeds. They {{are thought to be}} native to Eurasia, but when their seeds entered North America in shipments of agricultural seeds, they became naturalized in large areas. They have been so successful that in the cinema genre of Westerns, they have long been symbols of frontier areas. Salsola tragus (currently not valid synonym Kali tragus) is the so-called [...] "Russian thistle". It is an annual plant that breaks off at the stem base when it dies, and forms a tumbleweed, dispersing its seeds as the <b>wind</b> <b>rolls</b> it along. [...] It is said to have arrived in the United States in shipments of flax seeds to South Dakota, perhaps about 1870. [...] It now is a noxious weed throughout North America, dominating disturbed habitats such as roadsides, cultivated fields, eroded slopes, and arid regions with sparse vegetation. Though it is a troublesome weed, Salsola tragus also provides useful livestock forage on arid rangelands.|$|R

40|$|In Ersilia, to {{establish}} the relationships that sustain the city’s life, the inhabitants stretch strings {{from the corners of}} the houses, white or black or gray or black-and-white according to whether they mark a relationship of blood, of trade, authority, agency.

40|$|A large-angle {{simulation}} {{model for the}} F- 18 C/D has been recently validated and reported. 1 - 11 Utilizing this model, various methods of suppressing falling leaf motions were evaluated. The results indicated that falling leaf motions were highly susceptible to damping applied to the <b>wind</b> <b>roll</b> axis. The difficulty of implementing such a scheme is that the required states are not always measured, or measured accurately. Another suppression strategy, which performed at nearly the same level, involved applying a damping moment directly against the instantaneous angular momentum vector of the aircraft. The advantage of this system is that it requires information which is available and accurately measured on most fighter aircraft. In general, the method performed consistantly on all types of falling leaf motions and would likely be effective in oscillatory and flat spins. Comparisons between these two motion suppression schemes {{as well as others}} are presented.
