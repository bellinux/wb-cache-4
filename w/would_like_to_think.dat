25|$|Rowling {{noted in}} an {{interview}} that because Snape abandoned his post before dying or officially retiring, a portrait of him does not immediately appear in the Headmaster's office following his death. She adds, however, that she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> Harry made Snape's true loyalty and heroism known in the Wizarding world, and that he lobbied to ensure that a portrait be installed in the office. In a separate interview, Rowling discussed Snape's back story, saying she had planned it ever since she wrote the first book because the whole series is built around it and she considers him {{one of the most important}} characters of the seventh book.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

500|$|Cameron {{said that}} he wanted to make [...] "something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the {{adventure}} and all that" [...] but also have a conscience [...] "that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think {{a little bit about the}} way you interact with nature and your fellow man". He added that [...] "the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> we are" [...] and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans [...] "represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future".|$|E
500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E

I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> he (would still be with Chicago), but he was very independent and I wonder what he would have thought about the 1980s. I'd have to say it's 50/50. It could have gone either way.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006 he {{reflected}} on his career saying [...] "Those {{who have been}} doing for this for 40 years <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that it's a kind of Darwinian survival of the talented. But I think that's half the picture. It has as much as {{to do with the}} survival of temperament. There are few people still working now that started when I did. Not many people have the temperament to deal with that." ...|$|E

Although I did not get a lot of wickets in the series last year, I like to think I contributed with bat and ball. I didn't have a lot of opportunities in the West Indies, which was a bummer.

2500|$|... "I wrote a quick script which I was not {{particularly}} enamored with myself," [...] Hill said. However it attracted the interest of Paul Newman and John Huston. [...] "One <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> you are mistaken about the wonders of your work, but I didn't believe it," [...] he said. [...] "That part {{turned out to be}} true. I went over to work on the script with Huston. He wasn't very well, I ended up with sole screen credit, but {{one of the problems is}} the screen credit is misleading very often. I wrote 90% of the first half, various people wrote the rest. I didn't think it was a very good film. Hill says he never saw the final product, but was told it was [...] "a real bomb".|$|E

2500|$|On {{his return}} to Lancashire from Leicestershire, manager Mike Watkinson was {{impressed}} by Smith's performances with the bat and ball. Smith's contract with the club was renewed, along with nine other young players who were expected to {{form the basis of}} Lancashire's squad in the future. Smith stated his intent to cement his place in the Lancashire side as an all-rounder, saying that [...] "My batting has come on in leaps and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of myself as more of an allrounder. I batted in the top six at Leicestershire in the limited-over games and at seven in the four-dayers, and I got 50-plus {{a couple of times and}} had a run average of about 40. After the responsibility there I know I can do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mad Men has {{encouraged}} much discussion about gender. The show presents a subculture in which men, {{many of whom}} are engaged or married, frequently enter sexual relationships with other women. Most of the main characters have strayed outside of their marriages. Marie Wilson, in an op-ed for The Washington Post said that [...] "it is difficult and painful to see the ways in which women and men dealt {{with each other and with}} power. It's painful because this behavior is not as far back in our past as we <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> Our daughters continually get the messages that power still comes through powerful men. And unfortunately being pretty is still a quality that can get you on the ladder—though it still won't take you to the top." ...|$|E
2500|$|The biggest brigade in the Obamacon army {{consists}} of libertarians, furious with Mr Bush’s big-government conservatism, {{worried about his}} commitment to an open-ended “war on terror”, and disgusted by his cavalier way with civil rights. ... For many conservatives, Mr Obama embodies qualities that their party has abandoned: pragmatism, competence {{and respect for the}} head rather than the heart. Mr Obama’s calm and collected response to the turmoil on Wall Street contrasted sharply with Mr. McCain’s grandstanding. ... How much do these Obamacons matter? More than Mr McCain <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> The Obamacons are manifestations of a deeper turmoil in the Republican rank-and-file, as the old coalition of small-government activists, social conservatives and business Republicans falls apart. They also influence opinion. ... The more tantalising question is whether the rise of the Obamacons signals a lasting political realignment. ... If the Republican Party continues to think that the problem lies with the rats, rather than the seaworthiness of the ship, then the Obamacons are here to stay.|$|E
