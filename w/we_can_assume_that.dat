In a sense <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> fear was a big influence on things such as morality.

25|$|The {{increase}} in pressure produced by a single stage {{is limited by the}} relative velocity between the rotor and the fluid, and the turning and diffusion capabilities of the airfoils. A typical stage in a commercial compressor will produce a pressure increase of between 15% and 60% (pressure ratios of 1.15–1.6) at design conditions with a polytropic efficiency in the region of 90–95%. To achieve different pressure ratios, axial compressors are designed with different numbers of stages and rotational speeds. As a rule of thumb <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> each stage in a given compressor has the same temperature rise (Delta T). Therefore, at the entry, temperature (Tstage) to each stage must increase progressively through the compressor and the ratio (Delta T)/(Tstage) entry must decrease, thus implying a progressive reduction in stage pressure ratio through the unit. Hence the rear stage develops a significantly lower pressure ratio than the first stage.|$|E

2500|$|On 30 April 1733, Henry Price of Boston was {{appointed}} Provincial Grand Master [...] "of New England" [...] by the Viscount Montagu, Grand Master of the Moderns' Grand Lodge in London. Clearly, this appointment {{would not have}} included Pennsylvania, except for Price's repeated, but disputed, claims that the Grand Master had [...] "ordered him to extend Freemasonry over all North America." [...] Price held this office until December 1736, when he was succeeded by Robert Tomlinson, also of Boston, who held the office {{until his death in}} 1740. Tomlinson was succeeded by Thomas Oxnard, who was deputized Provincial Grand Master [...] "for North America" [...] on 23 Sept. 1743. He remained in office until his death in 1754. Whether Price's office gave him jurisdiction over Pennsylvania Masonry has always been disputed, but the question, according to those who favor the supremacy of Massachusetts, became a moot point for a brief period with Oxnard's appointment over all of North America. Historians who argue in favor of Massachuestts' primacy over Pennsylvania also point to an appointment of Benjamin Franklin as Provincial Grand Master for Pennsylvania on 10 July 1749. They argue that Provincial Grand Masters had no authority to appoint other Provincial Grand Masters and Franklin's appointment was void since only grand lodges had authority to do so. However, Daniel Coxe's deputation from the Grand Lodge of England did in fact provide the Freemasons in Pennsylvania to elect a Provincial Grand Master every two years in perpetuity. Because of this <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> all successive Provincial Grand Masters of Pennsylvania were elected under the authority of this deputation.|$|E
