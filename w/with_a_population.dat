5|$|In Montana, {{municipalities}} {{are divided}} into four classes by state statute based on their population. Members of the three largest classes are deemed cities, while {{the members of the}} fourth class are called towns. Cities and towns are classified {{at the time of their}} organization, and are reorganized when they change classification due to an increase or decrease in population. A place may incorporate as a town with the support of 300 electors or two-thirds of the registered electors. A municipality <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>population</b> between 1,000 and 5,000 people is a Third Class city. A municipality <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>population</b> between 5,000 and 10,000 people is a Second Class city. And a municipality <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>population</b> over 10,000 people is a First Class city. Under certain exceptions municipalities <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>population</b> of between 9,000 and 10,000 may elect by resolution to be either a First or Second Class city. Under similar exceptions municipalities <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>population</b> of between 5,000 and 7,500 may elect by resolution to be either a Second or Third Class city.
