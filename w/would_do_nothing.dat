5|$|After their {{experience}} of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely {{been replaced by a}} newer generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of PedroII's reign. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity and saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them PedroII was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to defend it. PedroII's achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Some {{had said}} that the {{database}} might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where children from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that the database would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The sheer size of the database could have meant that serious cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate {{of the cost of the}} database. The information commissioner estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects tend to go over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted the database to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that the database <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to prevent child abuse, and that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E

25|$|To ensure {{against a}} student uprising, the {{president}} combined {{the two major}} youth organizations in Dahomey, chapters of the World Federation of Youth and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, into the National Union of Dahomeyan Youth. It was to remain a nationally run organization, unaffiliated with any international institution. Nonetheless, he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> more than reprimand students who protested him, not even revoke their scholarships. On December 31, 1961 the Maga administration raised certain taxes, including those on income, transportation, and permits {{in an attempt to}} balance his country's budget. He nonetheless ran into trouble in the enforcement of his plan. Throughout his first term as president, Maga toured various parts of Dahomey to bring enthusiasm to his plan, offering undeveloped land to its supporters.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems that}} Cortina was most active in 1896–1898, during {{the run-up to}} the Spanish–American War. Busy in the Hispanic New York {{community}} and contributing to a daily Las Novedades, he tried to confront the anti-Spanish frenzy of American press and complained about lack of assistance on part of Madrid, the charges which thanks to Vázquez de Mella reached the Cortes and the government in 1896. Following a visit in Spain, starting 1897 Cortina changed the tone of his press endeavors; he switched to advertising the claims of Carlos VII. Thanks to his efforts few US periodicals, including New York Herald, published pieces on Carlism. Some quoted Cortina say that 100,000 volunteers waited for an order to rise and that by January 1, 1898, Don Carlos would assume the throne, though also that the claimant <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> which might impair international standing of his country.|$|E
25|$|In January 1933 Hitler became chancellor, {{and within}} a few months, dictator. The Defence Minister, General Werner von Blomberg, ensured that the Army {{remained}} loyal to the new regime. In February he arranged for Hitler to meet with senior generals, including Rundstedt. Hitler assured the generals that he favoured a strong Army and {{that there would be no}} interference with its internal affairs. Rundstedt was satisfied with this, but made it clear in private conversations that he did not like the Nazi regime. He also said, however, that he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to oppose it. In 1934, when General Kurt Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord resigned as chief of staff, Hitler wished to appoint General Walther von Reichenau to succeed him. Rundstedt led a group of senior officers in opposing the appointment, on the grounds that Reichenau was too openly a supporter of the regime. Hitler and Blomberg backed down and General Werner Freiherr von Fritsch was appointed instead. When Fritsch was forced to resign in 1938, Rundstedt again blocked Reichenau's appointment, and the post went to General Walther von Brauchitsch.|$|E
25|$|With {{the surging}} fears {{haunting}} {{the people of}} Madras, the Congress party of the state <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> bigger than a small demonstration and insisted {{to the people that}} there were no grounds for alarm. In contrast, DMK held an Anti-Hindi Conference in Trichirapalli on 17 January 1965. The conference was supported by all major opposition parties and funded by major wealthy industrialists – the industrialists who themselves feared of losing to influence of the North if Hindi were made the official language. The conference decided to hold 26 January (the fifteen anniversary of India’s republic day) as a Day of Mourning. Madras State's Chief Minister Bhakthavatchalam declared a warning that the state government would not tolerate the sanctity of the Republic day blasphemed. Hence DMK advanced the day of mourning by two days, id est. on 24 January. Although no longer a day of mourning, plans of demonstration on the 26th were still underway. DMK and its then ally, Swatantara Party had asked its members to fly black flags in their homes on that day. Bhakthavatchalam declared that such acts would be considered traitorous.|$|E

25|$|A {{more serious}} {{incident}} took place when {{the region of}} Sfax in Tunisia rose in revolt against French intervention. The revolt was started by a local artillery commander, who was called upon to produce his troops {{in support of the}} French, but in fact despite receiving pay for the men, had none. To divert attention, he organised a local demonstration against the French. This led to other foreign nationals fleeing the region, although it was only the French who were affected. Local Bedawin then took up the revolt which grew out of control, although order and respect for foreign property in the town was maintained by a local leader, Camoum. The French sent ships and then a fleet to bombard the town, and eventually troops which landed to occupy it on 16 July. After order was restored, the French set up a commission of enquiry to investigate claims for damages and invited the British and Italians each to appoint a representative. Tryon was chosen to represent the British on the commission which first met 29 August. The Commission sat for six weeks, by which time the evidence submitted already indicated strongly that damage to property and looting had been carried out by the French troops, at which point the commission was suddenly dissolved. The British official position was one of neutrality, and in effect allowing the French to do what they wanted. This placed Tryon in a delicate position that while he confirmed the views of locals that the French had caused much of the problems and intended {{to take control of the}} region, Britain <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to intervene. He was instructed to send reports directly to the Admiralty and foreign office, rather than to his commander, Admiral Seymour. Monarch spent much of a six-month period at anchor off Tunisia in temperatures of 80-90 degrees Fahrenheit, without any leave being permitted, which made the task an uncomfortable one for all concerned. Although the warship was not required, the Foreign office specifically requested that Tryon should remain for as long as possible. Tryon was commended for his handling of the affair by Earl Granville from the foreign office, the Lords of the Admiralty, and by the French Government.|$|E
500|$|After McNary-Haugen's defeat, Coolidge {{supported}} a less radical measure, the Curtis-Crisp Act, {{which would have}} created a federal board to lend money to farm co-operatives in times of surplus; the bill did not pass. In February 1927, Congress took up the McNary-Haugen bill again, this time narrowly passing it, and Coolidge vetoed it. In his veto message, he expressed {{the belief that the}} bill <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to help farmers, benefiting only exporters and expanding the federal bureaucracy. Congress did not override the veto, but it passed the bill again in May 1928 by an increased majority; again, Coolidge vetoed it. [...] "Farmers never have made much money," [...] said Coolidge, the Vermont farmer's son. [...] "I do not believe we can do much about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Parliament {{opened in}} February 1877, with Disraeli {{now in the}} Lords as Earl of Beaconsfield. He spoke only once there in the 1877 session on the Eastern Question, stating on 20 February {{that there was a}} need for {{stability}} in the Balkans, and that forcing Turkey into territorial concessions <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to secure it. [...] The Prime Minister wanted a deal with the Ottomans whereby Britain would temporarily occupy strategic areas to deter the Russians from war, to be returned on the signing of a peace treaty, but found little support in his cabinet, which favoured partition of the Ottoman Empire. As Disraeli, by then in poor health, continued to battle within the cabinet, Russia invaded Turkey on 21 April, beginning the Russo-Turkish War.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the media}} {{coverage}} of the Essjay controversy, a number of academics noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia.

[...] Ross Brann, a professor of Judeo-Islamic studies at Cornell University in Ithaca, stated that Wikipedia lacks a process of scholarly review, saying, [...] "They could make up your life if they wanted to." [...] Brann also said that Wikipedia [...] "has no place in the University", and he believed the Essjay incident <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to change the unfavorable opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia.|$|E
500|$|According to his biographer, Scarry: [...] "No {{president}} of the United States... has suffered as much ridicule as Millard Fillmore". He ascribed much of the abuse to a tendency to denigrate the presidents {{who served in the}} years just prior to the Civil War as lacking in leadership. For example, later president Harry Truman [...] "characterized Fillmore as a weak, trivial thumb-twaddler who <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to offend anyone", responsible in part for the war. Anna Prior, writing in The Wall Street Journal in 2010, stated that Fillmore's very name connotes mediocrity. Another Fillmore biographer, Finkelman, commented, [...] "on the central issues of the age his vision was myopic and his legacy is worse... in the end, Fillmore was always {{on the wrong side of}} the great moral and political issues". Rayback, however, applauded [...] "the warmth and wisdom with which he had defended the Union".|$|E
500|$|At {{around the}} same time, Calgary radio evangelist William Aberhart began to preach a new {{economic}} theory called social credit. [...] Though the theory required control of monetary policy, a federal responsibility, it became increasingly popular among former UFA supporters who, following Aberhart's instructions, began to form local social credit [...] "study groups". [...] Brownlee argued against social credit {{on the basis that}} its application by a provincial government would be unconstitutional and that it <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to create markets for Alberta's unsold wheat, which he viewed as the source of Alberta's woes. [...] The legislature held a series of hearings to investigate the theory, and both Aberhart and C. H. Douglas, the theory's originator, testified at them. [...] Brownlee questioned both on how the introduction of [...] "credit certificates" [...] issued by the Alberta government could help people so heavily dependent on interprovincial and international trade; neither answered the question to his satisfaction.|$|E

500|$|The {{electoral votes}} of closely contested New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would {{determine}} the election. In New York, the Tammany Democrats {{decided that they}} would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> for them. Blaine hoped {{that he would have}} more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine's mother was Irish Catholic, and he had been supportive of the Irish National Land League while he was Secretary of State. The Irish, a significant group in three of the swing states, did appear inclined to support Blaine until a Republican, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech pivotal for the Democrats, denouncing them as the party of [...] "Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion." [...] The Democrats spread the word of this implied Catholic insult {{on the eve of the}} election. They also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City's wealthiest men.|$|E
500|$|On August 3, 1964, Congress passed {{legislation}} {{providing for the}} striking of 45,000,000silver dollars. Silver coins, including the dollar, had become scarce due to hoarding {{as the price of}} silver rose past the point at which a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as currency. The new coins were intended to be used at Nevada casinos and elsewhere in the West where [...] "hard money" [...] was popular. Many in the numismatic press complained that the new silver dollars would only satisfy a small special interest, and <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>nothing</b> to alleviate the general coin shortage. Much of the pressure for the coins to be struck was being applied by the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield (Democrat–Montana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars. Preparations for the striking proceeded at a reluctant Mint Bureau. Some working dies had survived Sinnock's 1937 destruction order, but were found to be in poor condition, and Mint Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) Frank Gasparro was authorized to produce new ones. Mint officials had also considered using [...] the Morgan Dollar design; this idea was dropped and Gasparro replicated the Peace dollar dies. The reverse dies all bore Denver mintmarks; as the coins were slated for circulation in the West, it was deemed logical to strike them nearby.|$|E
