500|$|Abu Nidal {{had carried}} out the {{operation}} without the permission of Fatah. Abu Iyad (Arafat's deputy) and Mahmoud Abbas (later President of the Palestinian Authority), flew to Iraq to reason with Abu Nidal that hostage-taking harmed the movement. Abu Iyad told Seale that an Iraqi official at the meeting said: [...] "Why are you attacking Abu Nidal? The operation was ours! <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to mount it for us." [...] Abbas was furious and left the meeting with the other PLO delegates. From that point on, Seale writes, the PLO regarded Abu Nidal as {{under the control of}} the Iraqi government.|$|E
500|$|Their {{subsequent}} recording for {{the album}} was influenced by their experiences in Trinidad and Caribbean musical styles, including the rhythms and festive atmosphere of the local music scene. They enlisted Trinidadian dancehall artist General Grant, a regular at Caribbean Sound Basin, to perform a ragga rap on [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Dance Hall", songs they developed in Trinidad. Raphael Wiggins recalled this in an interview for the Toronto Star: [...] " [...] was just hanging around the studio. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to come freestyle on [...] After that, he just kept hanging around. Then we had the song 'Dance Hall' playing one night and he started again, so we just turned on the mic." [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend" [...] was also recorded there. According to D'wayne, they recorded [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] in the studio at 3a.m., and Raphael was [...] "quite snookered" [...] on an alcoholic beverage when delivering his vocals. Collectively, the group had written and recorded approximately 40songs {{at the end of}} the sessions. In an interview for Billboard, D'wayne Wiggins said that they focused on the love songs when having to decide what songs would make the album.|$|E
500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E

[...] "Shall <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> why {{a man of}} sense and education, and {{who has lived in}} the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Scraps, [...] "suppose {{we go in}} {{and find}} him? Very likely if <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> politely to let us pull three hairs out of {{the tip of his}} tail he won't hurt us." ...|$|R

2500|$|Jim McKellar, {{assistant}} {{general manager of the}} London Knights when Perry played for them, has said about Perry: [...] "He's a very personable guy who has a great sense of humour. He's also great with the fans. He was always very accommodating and never said no to anything <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to participate in. Whether it was a trip to the hospital or an autograph session, Corey was great. He was the ideal ambassador." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Sepp Blatter's sudden {{departure}} at Fifa on 2 June 2015, when Blatter {{claimed he}} was resigning for honourable reasons and to allow Fifa to move on, Dyke said," [...] I don't believe a word of this. [...] If he believes that, why not step down last week when <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to? [...] He was cock-a-hoop {{when he won the}} election and terribly arrogant. [...] Clearly there is a smoking gun. [...] This is nothing to do with Mr Blatter being honourable; he hasn't been honourable for years".|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why, {{but he said}} it was no matter. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> why, once or twice, as {{we walked}} back to the camp but he still said it was no matter. But late at night, when he was sitting in a {{thoughtful}} mood on the bed, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> again and he said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Devine {{appeared}} reflective. [...] "Grant has {{not been}} away for almost two weeks now, and it is quite that time since we have seen Mr. Brooke," [...] she said. [...] "Didn't <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to come when you had Minnie here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do ye {{hear this}} boasting Egyptian, who talks of {{entering}} the reeds and facing the lions in their lair, {{a thing that}} no man dare do where none can see to shoot? What say ye now? Shall <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to prove his words?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mortimer Lightwood,' resumes Veneering, 'whom {{you both}} know, {{is out of}} town; but he writes, in his {{whimsical}} manner, that as <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to be bridegroom's best man when the ceremony takes place, he will not refuse, though he doesn't see {{what he has to}} do with it.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{to give us}} {{the history}} of the case, and he did so.|$|E
60|$|We asked {{a gentleman}} by us {{if he knew}} what cause was on. He told us Jarndyce and Jarndyce. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if {{he knew what was}} doing in it. He said really, no he did not, nobody ever did, but as well as he could make out, it was over. Over for the day? <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him.</b> No, he said, over for good.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to tell it. He {{dropped out}} of his {{conversational}} vein and back into his lecture-gait without an effort, and rolled on as follows-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{replied the}} Scarecrow, {{brightening}} at the suggestion. [...] "The Tin Woodman {{will do anything}} <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him,</b> for he's one of my dearest friends.

6000|$|... 'It {{must be a}} forlorn condition,' said Albinia; 'he {{is above}} the other clerks, {{and he seems to}} be voted below the Bayford Elite, since the Polysyllable has made it so very refined! One never meets him {{anywhere}} now it is too dark to walk after the banking hours. Cannot <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to come in some evening?' ...|$|R
5000|$|As for Lynch's {{contribution}} to the band's sound, Courtney commented, [...] "He's a very different musician from Matthew, all around. <b>We</b> weren't <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to join to replace Matthew. <b>We</b> were <b>asking</b> <b>him</b> to join {{in order to make}} the band new. He was a friend, yes, but it was an added bonus that he would be pretty different from Matt. So it was exciting for us to see what that meant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We did," [...] said Shep; [...] "and then <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> who he was, but he put us off. He {{said he was}} out {{tramping}} {{the mountains}} for his health." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the thing. We'll do it. We {{only need}} one other chap. Leveson would come if <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him.</b> Let's {{get back to}} the lines. It's almost tea-time. Tell him after tea." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet {{one morning}} he appeared, at about half past nine, {{just as we}} were {{finishing}} breakfast. It was sunny and warm and beautiful, so <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> please to come with us picnicking.|$|E
6000|$|Only bear this in mind, {{that whether}} {{you know him}} or not, he is {{standing}} among us. We have not driven him away, and cannot drive him away. Our not seeing him will not prevent his seeing us. He is always near us; ready, if <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him,</b> as the Collect bids us, to 'come among us, and with great might succour us.' ...|$|R
60|$|Meantime he has our pen. If {{he turns}} up in any costume {{that we can}} spot at sight, <b>we</b> shall <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> for it.|$|R
60|$|God is Love. Can <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Him</b> to be more? God is Intelligence. Can we {{inform the}} {{infinite}} Mind, or tell Him anything He does not already comprehend? Do {{we hope to}} change perfection? Shall we plead for more at the open fount, which always pours forth more than we receive? The unspoken prayer does bring us nearer the Source of all existence and blessedness.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Robert? Yes, {{he called}} {{when we first}} came to town, and <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to dinner; {{but he said it}} was a fast day; and you know Sir Nicholas would never {{encourage}} that sort of thing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Harris had a sad {{expression}} on him, so we noticed, {{when we got}} into the boat. He gave you the idea {{of a man who had}} been through trouble. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if anything had happened, and he saidâ€” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm getting rather blown at starting,' Harry {{called out}} {{at last to}} Herbert, some yards in front of him. 'Do you think the despotic guide would let us sit down and rest a bit if <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> very prettily?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, my dear. There is {{an end of}} that, and I'm {{sorry for}} him. I think that if I had been a young man at The Cleeve, I should have done just the same. And now let us decide this {{important}} question. When Master Graham's ribs, arms, and collar bones are a little stronger, shall <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> {{to come back to}} Noningsby?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Arter {{that dream}} about Bill, {{there was no}} keeping the cook in his place. He 'ad dreams pretty near every night, and talked little bits of 'em in his sleep. Little bits that you couldn't make head nor tail of, and when <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>'im</b> next morning he'd always shake his 'ead and say, [...] "Never mind." [...] Sometimes he'd mention a chap's name in 'is sleep and make 'im nervous for days.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "but we {{must pay}} the sacristan for showing them to us. <b>We</b> can <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about {{them when we}} {{come down from the}} galleries." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{capacity}} for sympathy in these stout, placid men! Davidson was stirred to the depths; {{and it was}} easy to see that it was about Heyst that he was concerned. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> if he had passed that way lately.|$|E
6000|$|... "We met at Grindelwald, you know. He always {{calls me}} his Ice Maiden because {{we first got}} to know each other on the skating rink. Quite romantic, wasn't it? Then <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to tea one day, and we got to be quite friendly. Then he proposed." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next thing}} worth telling that {{happened}} was that, {{an hour or}} more later, Japhet arrived, looking very frightened. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> our usual question: if anything was wrong with the wires. With a groan he answered [...] "No," [...] the wires seemed all right, but he had met a ghost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Jack, hadn't <b>we</b> better <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> {{to take us}} to the Hall first?" [...] whispered Fred to his cousin. [...] "Maybe Colonel Colby can {{fix this}} up for us." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. If <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> a {{question}} about anything, he should give us an answer all about ourselves. He should invariably praise us for whatever qualities he knows we haven't got. But he should be pitiless, quite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never dreamed of possessing. He should never believe that we know the use of useful things. That would be unforgiveable. But he should shower on us everything we don't want.|$|R
6000|$|Arriving at the door, the Frenchman bethought {{himself of}} his {{travelling}} companion. 'My scene-painter {{is here with}} me,' he said, 'on the look-out for materials.

'I {{will be back in a}} minute. It's at the end of the corridor--13 A.' ...|$|R
