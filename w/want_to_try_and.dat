500|$|During an {{interview}} with The Pulse of Radio, vocalist Taylor said that Slipknot would be changing their stage set around for the US arena leg. [...] "We're {{getting away from the}} pyro. We're going way more visual this time. We're incorporating a lot of video." [...] He explained that they always try to do something different: [...] "We've got people still coming to see us for, you know, after ten years, and we just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> give something special." [...] On the opening show of the leg, percussionist Crahan debuted a new mask which was significantly different from the one he wore while touring in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Since 1996, when MLS {{teams were}} first {{included}} in the tournament, the home team had won nine times and lost only twice in the final match. Commenting on what his team brings to the game, Sounders FC coach Sigi Schmid stated, [...] "We bring a clean slate. We haven't had any negative experiences in championship games, {{so we want to}} just build up a positive legacy for our team and we know {{we have a chance to}} make some history for our team. Every player knows that and that's something we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> do." [...] D.C. United had previously won the U.S. Open Cup twice in 1996 and 2008 and this was their fourth appearance ever in the tournament final. D.C. United president Kevin Payne simply stated, [...] "We want to win anything we enter." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hillenburg halted {{production}} of the show after the third season had been completed {{to focus on the}} making of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, which was set for release in 2004: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> do a movie and the series at the same time. We have 60 episodes and that is probably as many as [...] really needs. It is a standard number for a show like this. I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on doing a good job on the movie," [...] he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the {{production of}} The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel {{died at the age of}} 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory. He said that Engel [...] "truly was the most influential artistic person in [...] life." [...] The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie grossed $140 million worldwide, and received positive reviews from critics. The review-aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes rates it 68 percent positive based on 125 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. Its consensus states in summary, [...] "Surreally goofy and entertaining for both children and their parents." ...|$|E

5000|$|Stuckey recalls [...] "everyone <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> fit {{us into a}} {{specific}} demographic, but we weren't willing to change the format" [...] so Stuckey and Bad Robot ended their relationships on good terms. In 2011, Pancake Mountain decided to stop production.|$|R

I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> go back <b>to</b> our roots. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make {{a link between}} the traditional and the contemporary in our own style." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> persuade you," [...] he confessed, [...] "that America has {{everything}} in the world to gain from Germany's success, and everything to lose if the Allies should triumph in this war and Great Britain should continue her tyranny of the seas." ...|$|E

There is no more large bush to pass between this and Williamstown, and so far as we have heard, no attempt has been made further on the road to stop convoys. That poor fellow who is lying wounded in the waggon is a Mr. Armstrong. He was an officer in the service {{when he was a young}} man, and fought, he told me, at Waterloo. His place is near the spot where I was quartered for two months just before the outbreak, and he showed me great kindness, and treated me as a friend. Well, sir, one of the three women who were, as you heard, carried off in the waggons, was Mr. Armstrong's daughter. Now, sir, you know what her fate will be in the hands of those savages: dishonour, torture, and death. I am going to save her if I can. I don't know whether I shall succeed; most likely I shall not. My life is of no great consequence to me, and has so far been a failure; but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> rescue her whether it costs me my life or not. Kreta has offered to accompany me with five of his men. Alone, I should certainly fail, but with his aid there is a chance of my succeeding." ...|$|E
60|$|Graham Balfour the new {{cousin and}} Lloyd are away with Clark the Missionary {{on a school}} {{inspecting}} malaga, really perhaps the prettiest little bit of opera in real life that can be seen, and made all the prettier by the actors being children. I {{have come to a}} collapse this morning on D.B.: wrote a chapter one way, half re-copied it in another, and now stand halting between the two like Buridan's donkey. These sorts of cruces always are to me the most insoluble, and I should not wonder if D.B. stuck there for a week or two. This is a bother, for I understand McClure talks of beginning serial publication in December. If this could be managed, what with D.B., the apparent success of The Wrecker, Falesá, and some little pickings from Across the Plains--not to mention, as quite hopeless, The History of Samoa--this should be rather a profitable year, as it must be owned it has been rather a busy one. The trouble is, if I miss the December publication, it may take the devil and all of a time to start another syndicate. I am really tempted to curse my conscientiousness. If I hadn't recopied Davie he would now be done and dead and buried; and here I am stuck about the middle, with an immediate publication threatened and the fear before me of having after all to scamp the essential business of the end. At the same time, though I love my Davy, I am a little anxious to get on again on The Young Chevalier. I have in nearly all my works been trying one racket: to get out the facts of life as clean and naked and sharp as I could manage it. In this other book I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> megilp them together in an atmosphere of sentiment, and I wonder whether twenty-five years of life spent in trying this one thing will not make it impossible for me to succeed in the other. However {{it is the only way}} to attempt a love story. You can't tell any of the facts, and the only chance is to paint an atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|In 2008 {{automatic}} {{promotion and}} relegation between the Second Division and Super League was abolished and teams {{would have to}} apply for a license every four years if they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> gain entry <b>to</b> Super League.

5000|$|Stryder began a {{partnership}} with English record producer and songwriter Fraser T Smith. According to Smith {{in an interview with}} HitQuarters, [...] "Kwasi had no shortage of beats and cool sounding production, but I think he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> break through into the mainstream, and I had some experience crossing underground over into mainstream having worked with artists like Craig David." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{discussed}} the casting including his push for Alan Arkin as Freud.

[...] "You're asking {{someone a}} questions… but you don't want to push too hard, trying… in the most {{harmonious}} way possible… to prove a point… Staying emotionally open (is) a choice… Do you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> then maybe fail half {{of the time and}} then succeed half of the time or whatever your odds are? Or is it your choice to not even try?" ...|$|E
5000|$|On 21 September of that year, the Daily Mirror {{reported}} that Aston Villa {{were interested in}} Henriksen whilst Napoli had also been known to have scouted him. Henriksen furthered speculation linking him abroad in a November interview with Aftenposten, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> show that I am good enough to play elsewhere than in Norway. I think I'd best fit Germany, so it is my dream {{to play in a}} good team in the Bundesliga." ...|$|E
5000|$|As Braids' Flourish // Perish tour neared its end in December 2013, Standell-Preston {{revealed}} that after recording the album in {{the confines of}} a garage, [...] "for our next record, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> embrace open space. We want to go to Arizona and rent out some weird place {{in the middle of the}} desert and just have endless space". The band recorded their third album, Deep in the Iris, throughout the first half of 2014 in Arizona, New York and Vermont.|$|E
5000|$|In a Rain Taxi interview, Hoenigman {{explains}} that Burn Your Belongings was an experimental {{work in the}} sense that he had no idea what the outcome would be: [...] "I had some theories and some things I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try,</b> <b>and</b> I just let it fly from there[...] [...]artistic result is my attempt to present this chaos in a manageable form, like a piece of music." ...|$|R
50|$|What we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{cover was}} our {{experiences}} of modern Cambodia {{and the history}} of the music that we were referencing. We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> tell some of the story of the Cambodia of the ’60s and ’70s. We had been excited by the songs that we were hearing and it didn’t feel right to rap just anything over it. We wanted for new listeners to understand something about Cambodia and the music.|$|R
5000|$|I {{also like}} singing in {{different}} ways. I get really annoyed {{when people are}} like, “So what kind of singer are you?” That just seems so limiting to you as an artist—I like to sing operatic, in jazz, soul, blues, I’m up for everything. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> showcase that across the album and be a different character for each song and have different instruments ... I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> show that dynamic approach.|$|R

But I've got a bunch of new ideas that I think will fit with us that are a lot different. I kind of <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> make these slower songs I've written seem really heavy atmospherically. ...On our last album, I never would have thought to try that because the record was so aggressive, but I'm going to try and take us into some new, weird territories.

5000|$|The album title {{refers to}} the radical feminist Shulamith Firestone whose book The Dialectic of Sex was the main {{inspiration}} to singer and lyricist Channy Leaneagh after the recording of the album. Describing Firestone as [...] "This woman to me is like my pop star. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> be more like her," [...] Leaneagh insisted that the name wasn't chosen [...] "because I {{wanted to make a}} statement about feminism." [...] At the same time, themes explored in the album dovetail with feminist concerns such as the conflict of desire and frustration that attend living up to cultural ideals as well as the pitfalls of materialism and perfectionism.|$|E

5000|$|... "I think it’s a new challenge. I think {{trying to}} do {{something}} that we didn’t do on the record before-we want to {{have a little bit of}} a shock value each time. The last two albums were a shock to people as far as what was coming from Greeley Estates. We started off some of early albums with pop songs so we’ve changed a lot over the years but we want to kind of have that same approach going into this record too. We just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> figure out what we can do to combine the things we know our fans love and what we love to perform but also do something a little different." ...|$|E
5000|$|Fitzpatrick {{has said}} that the band's musical style can be fairly {{described}} as [...] "soul-influenced indie pop." [...] He noted that while the band is influenced by the classic songs of the Motown and Stax record labels, the band is not trying to create an exact replica of that music. In another interview, Fitzpatrick talked about his decision to not use guitars in the band. [...] "I did <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> make a big sounding record without guitars," [...] he said.

5000|$|The {{success of}} the show's alumni however {{has led to a}} more {{positive}} assessment of the show, and the show was described as having [...] "proven it has a valid way to pick talent and a proven way to sell records". While the industry is divided on the show success, its impact is felt particularly strongly in the country music format. According to a CMT exec, reflecting on the success of Idol alumni in the country genre, [...] "if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> get famous fast by going to a cattle call audition on TV, Idol reasonably remains the first choice for anyone", and that country music and Idol [...] "go together well".|$|E

Basically what Mal had said was that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> get that feeling of being in a room with it all happening. I don't think it really worked entirely.|$|R
