5000|$|Because {{encrypted}} messages sent by telegraph often omit punctuation and spaces,cryptographic {{frequency analysis}} <b>of</b> such <b>messages</b> includes trigrams that straddle word boundaries. This causes trigrams such as [...] "edt" [...] to occur frequently, {{even though it}} may never occur in any one <b>word</b> <b>of</b> those <b>messages.</b>|$|R

50|$|Active {{listening}} is {{a special}} way of reflecting back what the other person has said, {{to let them know}} that you're listening and to check your understanding of what he means.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} includes theoretical {{analysis of}} the problem and explores the peculiarities of the influence <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth communication on brand equity. Our empirical research results presented in this paper revealed that both vividness and usefulness <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth communication <b>message</b> characteristics give positive impact on brand equity and its dimensions based on the context of luxury good. The statistically positive relation of average strength was determined between the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth communication (vividness, usefulness) and brand equity dimensions (brand association, brand awareness, brand loyalty, perceived quality) after having analyzed empirically the influence <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth communication <b>message</b> on brand equity with the help of correlation and regression...|$|R
60|$|When George Mason {{heard all}} this, {{he walked out}} of the {{back-door}} and over to the wood-pile, where he got an axe and cut down the pole that was in Cousin Maria's back yard.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{communication}} efficiency for speech-disabled users of nonvocal com-munication devices, a procedure has been developed that generates sets of units for use as language representation systems. Given a limit N {{to the number of}} units the user and device can accommodate, and the type of language system desired (phoneme sequences, letter se-quences, or words with letters), the procedure produces sets of units that require a minimum number <b>of</b> selections per <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>message.</b> One nonvocal individual trained in a system of this type (N = 400 phoneme sequences) improved communication rate by 30 % over an alphabet system, despite a manual selection rate that was twice as slow with the large unit set. Implications are drawn for improvement of communication rate, for the design of com-munication systems and devices, and for the development of systems for other languages...|$|R

50|$|This is {{explained}} by a common complaint about the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> in the alert box, which is often incomprehensible to the user. In applications without proper user-centered design, the developers decide the text <b>of</b> the <b>message,</b> including terms and concepts from the mental model of the programmer, not of the user's view of the world. Since the dialog doesn't work to accomplish the user needs, the common reaction will be to dismiss the alert without further consideration.|$|R

"It was at {{that time}} half an hour too late to be of any use to me, if I wanted to go and meet my people--which was the case--for by the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> you can see that they were to arrive at the station at 11.45.

60|$|So Pen {{returned}} to Fairoaks, in company {{with his friend}} the Chevalier, without having uttered a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> {{which he had been}} so anxious to deliver to Laura at Baymouth. He could wait, however, until her return home, which was to take place on the succeeding day. He was not seriously jealous of the progress made by Mr. Pynsent in her favour; and he felt pretty certain that in this, as in any other family arrangement, he had but to ask and have, and Laura, like his mother, could refuse him nothing.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} techniques <b>of</b> {{system log}} <b>messages</b> (syslog messages) {{have a long}} history from when the syslog mechanism was invented. Typically, the analysis consists of two parts, one is a message template generation, and the other is finding something interesting using the messages classified by the inferred templates. It is important to generate better templates to achieve better, precise, or convincible analysis results. In this paper, we propose a classification methodology using the length <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> each <b>message.</b> Our method is suitable for online template generation because it does not require two-pass analysis to generate template messages, that is an important factor considering increasing amount <b>of</b> log <b>messages</b> produced by a large number of system components such as cloud infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. HAVAL is a {{cryptographic}} hash function proposed in 1992 by Zheng, Pieprzyk and Seberry.

In this paper we describe a practical attack that finds collisions for the 3 -pass version of HAVAL. This means {{that it is possible to}} generate pairs <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> hashing to the same value. The computational complexity of the attack corresponds to about 229 computations of the compression function of 3 -pass HAVAL; the required amount of memory is negligible. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} edition of Train Call was ultimately retired {{due to the}} need to update the outdated <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>messages,</b> with the most noticeable change being the reference to the concourse stations. The original audio announced [...] "This train is approaching Concourse A," [...] where it now says [...] "We are approaching the station for all 'A' Gates." [...] Station signage was also changed to reflect this. Some information regarding Baggage Claim monitors in the Terminal station also caused confusion and needed to be removed from the messages, since the monitors themselves were removed from the station years prior.|$|R

Ruth's eyes {{looked up at him}} with swift comprehension, and there was a tear in them as he told in ten <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> that Forrest was dead.|$|R

40|$|Online reviews are {{one example}} <b>of</b> {{electronic}} <b>word</b> <b>of</b> mouth <b>messaging</b> (eWOM), which {{research has shown}} {{plays an important role}} in purchasing decisions for consumers. Yet most eWOM research has ignored the potential effect <b>of</b> specific <b>message</b> and source features within the messages themselves. This study used a narrative lens to explore how the presence of a similar and explicitly identified character influences perceived trustworthiness of the reviews, as well as overall attitudes and purchase intention toward products. A mixed design experiment was conducted to test effects of character presence, as well as types of appeal, positive and negative valence, and product involvement in online review messages. Character presence was found to increase perceived trustworthiness and brand attitudes, but only for low-involvement products. Rational appeals and negative valenced reviews were also seen as more trustworthy, yet these main effects were complicated by a three-way interaction that suggests the effects <b>of</b> <b>message</b> features in eWOM reviews are complex and require more research to explore their nuances...|$|R
