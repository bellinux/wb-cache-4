5|$|John Clifford, 9th Baron Clifford, 9th Lord of Skipton (8 April 1435 – 28 March 1461), was a Lancastrian {{military}} leader during the <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roses. The Clifford family {{was one of}} the most prominent families among the northern English nobility of the fifteenth century; and by the marriages of his sisters John Clifford had links to some very important families of the time, including the earls of Devon. He was orphaned at about twenty years of age when his father was slain at the first battle of the <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roses, the Battle of St Albans in 1455. It was probably as a result of his father's death there that Clifford became one of the strongest supporters of Queen Margaret of Anjou, consort of King Henry VI, who ended up as effective leader of the Lancastrian faction.|$|E

5|$|Percy married Eleanor Poynings, who outlived him; {{together}} they had four children.

He was not, however, to live to enjoy these gains, being killed at the Battle of Towton in 1461 on the defeated Lancastrian side.|$|E
5|$|The Seaforth's royalist inclinations led to Lewis {{becoming}} garrisoned {{during the}} <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three Kingdoms by Cromwell's troops, who destroyed the old castle in Stornoway and in 1645 Lewismen fought on the royalist {{side at the}} Battle of Auldearn.

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the House of Plantagenet's two cadet {{branches}} of York and Lancaster {{brought about the}} <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roses, a decades-long fight for the English succession, culminating in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, when {{the reign of the}} Plantagenets and the English Middle Ages both met their end with the death of King Richard III. Henry VII, of Lancastrian descent, became king of England; two years later, he married Elizabeth of York, thus ending the <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roses, and giving rise to the Tudor dynasty. The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power, which allowed them to avoid {{some of the problems that}} had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers. The resulting stability allowed for the English Renaissance, and the advent of early modern Britain.|$|E

5|$|This {{control was}} further {{consolidated}} during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, which witnessed English and Scottish colonisation in the Plantations of Ireland, the <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three Kingdoms and the Williamite War. Irish losses during the <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the Irish Confederacy and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland) {{are estimated to}} include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have {{died as a result}} of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence over the duration of the war. A further 50,000 were sent into indentured servitude in the West Indies. Some historians estimate that as much as half of the pre-war population of Ireland may have {{died as a result of}} the conflict.|$|E
5|$|A third North American genus called Stegomus {{was named}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1896. Marsh had a long-time rivalry with Cope {{that was made}} famous in the Bone <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century, {{in which the two}} tried to out-compete one another in the field and in {{scientific}} literature. Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, Stegomus was found from the eastern United States in Connecticut. Marsh also recognized Stegomus as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in his initial description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes to belong to phytosaurs during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Big Butte Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled over 8,000 {{years ago by}} the Klamath, Upper Umpqua, and Takelma tribes of Native Americans. In the Rogue River <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the 1860s, naming the creek after Snowy Butte, an early name for Mount McLoughlin. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging. The small city of Butte Falls was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the Punic <b>wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2nd century BC, this form of {{organisation}} was found to be inefficient. In a new Polybian system, infantry were sorted into classes according to age and experience rather than wealth, the principes being older veterans with a greater degree of experience. Their equipment and role was very similar to the previous system, except they now carried swords, or gladii, instead of spears. Each princeps also carried two pila, heavy javelins that bent on impact to prevent them being removed from the victim or thrown back.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted.

5|$|Exeter {{had been}} {{stripped}} of his armour and left for dead on the battlefield at Barnet, but he was alive—though gravely injured. His followers found him {{and took him to}} Westminster Abbey. On his recovery, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for four years before submitting to Edward's rule.

5|$|For 19 years, {{the castle}} {{served as a}} prison for John I, Duke of Bourbon after he was taken at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. His {{custodian}} was a Nicholas Montgomery the Younger. Nineteenth-century local historian John Joseph Briggs claimed that during the <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roses, the castle was partially dismantled by the Lancastrian forces of Margaret of Anjou, but since her campaign was {{along the line of}} the Great North Road, it was Melbourn, Cambridgeshire she sacked, not its Derbyshire namesake.|$|E
5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, {{to the extent}} that half of global food production (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World <b>Wars</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century.|$|E
