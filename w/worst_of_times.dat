25|$|France {{seemed to}} be at the start of civil unrest in 1899, and once again Louis Lépine was {{recalled}} to help ease the situation. Again and again Paris appeared to be on the point of violent protestations, but through wise diplomacy and carefully organised policing, Lépine managed to avoid the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>times.</b> He attempted to limit the role of the army as a force of internal order by handling most situations with police and gendarmerie alone. During these febrile times France faced the possibility of a military government and whilst there were occasions when Lépine required military assistance to control demonstrations it is credit to his reforms that these were rare and that the gendamerie largely controlled the civil strife.|$|E

The couple remained married for 45 years until her death after a brain aneurysm on June 25, 2011.

[...] He also often wrote sentimental poems to Grant throughout their marriage, as well as to his daughters. The couple renewed their marriage vows every seven years.|$|E
2500|$|Hannibal Barca (247–183). Of Carthage, not of Rome, {{in fact a}} sworn {{enemy of}} Rome, as the Roman people became acquainted with him. No Punic writer has left us an account of him, but only his 'enemies' whether Greek or Roman. Mommsen tells us, [...] "the Romans charged him with cruelty, the Carthaginians with covetousness." [...] It is [...] "true that he hated" [...] and knew [...] "how to hate" [...] and that [...] "a general who never fell short of money and stores can hardly have been less than covetous. But though anger and envy and meanness have written his history, {{they have not been}} able to mar the pure and noble image which it presents." [...] His father Hamilcar served Carthage as an army general; Hannibal's [...] "youth had been spent in the camp." [...] As a boy on horseback he'd become [...] "a fearless rider at full speed." [...] In his father's army he had {{performed}} [...] "his first feats of arms under the paternal eye". In Hispania his father spent years building colonies for Carthage from which to attack Rome; but the son saw his father [...] "fall in battle by his side." [...] Under his brother-in-law Hasdrubal, Hannibal led cavalry with bravery and brilliance; then Hasdrubal was assassinated. By [...] "the voice of his comrades" [...] Hannibal at 29 years took command of the army. [...] "ll agree in this, that he combined in rare perfection discretion and enthusiasm, caution and energy." [...] His [...] "inventive craftiness" [...] made him [...] "fond of taking singular and unexpected routes; ambushes and stratagems of all sorts were familiar to him." [...] He carefully studied the Roman character. [...] "By an unrivalled system of espionage—he had regular spies even in Rome—he kept himself informed of the projects of his enemy." [...] He was often seen in disguise. Yet nothing he did at war [...] "may not be justified under the circumstances, and according to the international law, of the times." [...] "The power which he wielded over men is shown by his incomparable control over an army of various nations and many tongues—an army which never in the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>times</b> mutinied against him." [...] Following the war Hannibal the statesman served Carthage to reform the city-state's constitution; later as an exile he exercised influence in the eastern Mediterranean. [...] "He was a great man; wherever he went, he riveted the eyes of all." ...|$|E
