50|$|In 1917 he was {{appointed}} consulting chemist to the U.S. Bureau of Mines upon the inauguration by the Bureau of experiments with regard to helium and during the World War I he did {{a large amount of}} analytical and research work, the results of which influenced the designs of the various helium plants which were constructed by the government. He also made valuable research into the limits of the inflammability of helium and hydrogen mixtures and carried out a number of experiments on the permeability of balloon fabric by helium. In 1933 he developed a process for using chimney gases in the manufacture of a refrigerant. In 1936 he developed an ingenious new method for the accurate measurement of gaseous densities by means of a modified <b>Westphal</b> <b>balance.</b> The invention made it possible for the determination of molecular weight of gases with a degree of speed and precision not approached by any other method.|$|E
40|$|Of a {{representative}} series of aliphatic acydic acetals previously studied (1), none equals paraldehyde in efficiency as a hypnotic. As a greater structural resemblance to paraldehyde {{is found in}} the cyclic acetals, formed from an aldehyde and a glycol, it might be expected that such compounds would approach it more closely in pharmacological properties. Accordingly, a number of these were prepared, using formalde-hyde and acetaldehyde, and ethylene, propylene, trimethylene, and 2, 3 butylene glycols. The procedure used was that of Clarke (2). Ethylene formal was kindly supplied by Dr. Frederic Walker of the Roessler-Hasslacher Chemical Co. The dioxane was a product of the Carbon Carbide Chemical Co., redistilled before use. The specific gravity of the compounds was found by the <b>Westphal</b> <b>balance,</b> and their aqueous solubility roughly determined by the amount of water required to dissolve a fixed amount; each procedure was at 24 #{ 176 }C. The properties of the compounds are shown in table 1. The pharmacological activity of the compounds was deter-mined as in the previous study, administering them to rats intraperitoneally and to rabbits by stomach tube, and the results recorded as seen in table 2. From the data it appears that the compounds in which the ring is unsubstituted, that is, ethylene formal, trimethylene formal, and dioxane, are of lowest activity, the five-membered ring compound being slightly inferior to the other two. With each substitution of the ring, whether of th...|$|E
