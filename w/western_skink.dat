5|$|More than 70species {{of animals}} {{are known to}} live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, {{southern}} alligator lizard, and <b>western</b> <b>skink</b> have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reptiles}} in {{the region}} include lizards and turtles. Lizards are highly represented {{in the region}}, the most distinctive denizen being the Gila monster, native only to the American Southwest {{and the state of}} Sonora in Mexico. Other lizards include: Sonoran collared lizard (Crotaphytus nebrius); several types of geckos, including western banded gecko (Coleonyx variegatus), the common house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus), and the Mediterranean house gecko (Hemidactylus turcicus), the last two species being non-native to the region but have been introduced; the desert iguana (Dipsosaurus dorsalis); the chuckwalla (Sauromalus ater); the greater earless lizard (Cophosaurus texanus scitulus); several sub-species of horned lizards (Phrynosoma); numerous species of spiny lizards (Sceloporus); Gilbert's skink (Plestiodon gilberti); the <b>western</b> <b>skink</b> (Plestiodon skiltonianus); Trans-Pecos striped whiptail (Aspidoscelis inornata heptagrammus); and the Arizona night lizard (Xantusia arizonae). Turtles are less numerous than their other reptilian counterparts, but several are found in the region, including: the western painted turtle (Chrysemys picta bellii); the Rio Grande cooter (Pseudemys gorzugi); the desert box turtle (Terrapene ornata luteola); the Big Bend slider (Trachemys gaigeae gaigeae); the Sonora mud turtle (Kinosternon sonoriense); and the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii).|$|E

50|$|Found in {{a variety}} of {{habitats}} from sea level to at least 2,130 m (7,000 ft), the <b>western</b> <b>skink</b> is commonest in early successional stages or open areas within habitats in which it occurs. Heavy brush and densely forested areas are generally avoided. The <b>western</b> <b>skink</b> seems to prefer a somewhat moist environment, although it can also be found on dry hillsides. Frequents grassland, broken chaparral, pinon-juniper and juniper-sage woodland, and open pine-oak and pine forests. The soil of its nest chambers is invariably moist. Standing water is apparently not required.|$|E

40|$|The <b>western</b> red-tailed <b>skink</b> (Eumeces gilberti rubricaudatus) is a {{sensitive}} species {{that is on}} the Nevada Natural Heritage Program’s “Animal and Plant At-Risk Tracking List. ” Information about this species is lacking, especially for southern Nevada. A pilot project was initiated in 2006 on portions of the Nevada Test Site (NTS) to (1) develop techniques for determining <b>western</b> red-tailed <b>skink</b> distribution, (2) determine if skinks are still present at historic locations, (3) evaluate habitat use by trapping in a variety of habitats, and (4) collect tissue samples for genetic analysis. Skink capture success was compared in trap arrays with and without drift fences. A total of 9 <b>western</b> red-tailed <b>skinks</b> were captured in 6, 092 trap days (0. 1 %, 1 skink/ 677 trap days). No skinks were captured in trap arrays with drift fences, which suggests that funnel traps set near rocks or vegetation without drift fences is a viable technique for capturing skinks. This greatly reduces the effort and cost to capture skinks. Skinks were captured at one of the three historic locations. Captures occurred in a variety of habitats including springs, ephemeral washes, and dry rocky areas. Genetic analysis revealed that NTS skinks are part of the Inyo clade, and are most closely related to skinks from slightly further north in Esmeralda County, Nevada, and west into the Panamint and Inyo/White Mountains in California. Results from this pilot study will be used to develop a <b>western</b> red-tailed <b>skink</b> distribution study for the entire NTS...|$|R

It is a good burrower and sometimes constructs burrows several times its own body length.|$|E
50|$|The western blue-tongued lizard (Tiliqua occipitalis), {{also known}} as the <b>western</b> blue-tongued <b>skink,</b> is a large skink native to Australia. It is one of six species of blue-tongued lizards found in Australia, though further species are found in New Guinea and Indonesia.|$|R
5000|$|The IUCN has {{listed the}} <b>western</b> three-toed <b>skink</b> as being of [...] "Least Concern" [...] {{because of its}} wide range {{and the fact that}} it is very common in some parts of its range. It is {{nevertheless}} threatened by changes in agricultural practices resulting in degradation of its habitat. In some areas it is persecuted because it is mistakenly thought to be venomous.|$|R
50|$|Adult <b>Western</b> <b>skinks</b> {{have a broad}} brown stripe {{down their}} backs, edged with black and bordered on each side by a {{conspicuous}} whitish to beige dorsolateral stripe that begins on nose and extends over the eye and back alongside body onto the tail. A second pale stripe, starting on upper jaw, occurs low on each side and is separated from the first by a broad dark brown or black band originating {{on the side of}} head and usually extending well out onto the tail, though this band can be disrupted if the tail is lost and regrown. Juvenile skink's tails are bright blue, turning to grey in adulthood. In the breeding season reddish or orange color appears on the side of head and chin, and occasionally on the sides, tip, and underside of the tail. They usually have seven supralabial scales and four enlarged nuchals. Young skinks' colorations are more vivid than those of adults.|$|R
50|$|The {{reproductive}} {{season for}} this species varies geographically and {{from year to}} year depending on local conditions. Mating probably occurs in the spring soon after emergence. Males turn orange on the underside when they are breeding. Females lay 2-6 eggs during June and July. <b>Western</b> <b>skink</b> females construct nest chambers that are several centimeters deep in loose moist soil. Typically these chambers are located under surface objects, especially flat stones, logs, and sometimes in or near rock outcrops.|$|E
50|$|Other {{common names}} include blue-tailed skink (for juveniles) and {{red-headed}} skink (for adults). It is technically appropriate {{to call it}} the American five-lined skink to distinguish it from the African skink Trachylepis quinquetaeniata (otherwise known as five-lined mabuya) or the eastern red-headed skink to distinguish it from its western relative Plestiodon skiltonianus (otherwise known as the <b>western</b> <b>skink).</b> The blue-tailed skink proper is Cryptoblepharus egeriae from Christmas Island, but in North America the juveniles of any Eumeces or Plestiodon species may be called this.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of a lack}} {{of surface}} water, {{amphibian}} presence in the monument is limited. The most common species found in the monument is the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla). This species is also found in the biologically rich cave entrances in the monument. Reptile species found in the monument include: northern sagebrush lizard (Sceloporus graciosus graciosus), Great Basin fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis biseriatus), <b>western</b> <b>skink</b> (Eumeces skiltonianus skiltonianus), Rocky Mountain rubber boa (Charina bottae utahensis), gopher snake (Pituophis melanoleucus), desert night snake (Hypsiglena torquata deserticola), western rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis).|$|E
50|$|Large {{animals that}} {{frequent}} the park include elk, deer, cougar, and pronghorn. Beaver, otter, mink, and raccoons {{are found in}} or near the river. Coyotes, bats, and badgers are among the park's other mammals. Predators hunt smaller animals such as the rabbits, voles, mice, and shrews found in the park's grasslands and sagebrush-covered hills. Bushy-tailed woodrats inhabit caves and crevices in the monument's rock formations. Bighorn sheep, wiped out in this region in the early 20th century, were reintroduced in the Foree Area of the Sheep Rock Unit in 2010.Many habitats in the monument support populations of snakes and lizards. Southern alligator and western fence lizards are common; others that live here include short-horned and common side-blotched lizards and <b>western</b> <b>skinks.</b> Garter and gopher snakes and western yellow-bellied racers frequent floodplains and canyon bottoms.
