25|$|One day Eliza surprises {{herself by}} winning the class {{spelling}} bee, then the school bee at McKinley Elementary School. At first Saul is unaware of her success, but then he becomes increasingly involved with her. Eliza is invited into his study to practice, and Aaron {{for the first time}} finds the door closed to him. But as Eliza progresses through the district bee and prepares for the national bee, the troubled lives of her family come into sharp focus. Saul, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> to reach God, first through drugs and then through study, becomes convinced that Eliza's talent shows a propensity for mysticism greater than his, which has the potential to lead her to shefa, the influx of the Divine. He gradually introduces her to the writings of Abraham Abulafia, a Medieval kabbalist writer, and it becomes clear that his ambitions for her go far beyond the winning of the spelling bee.|$|E

So I wanted {{to put her in}} Street Fighter 4 and I really wanted to put her in 'Super,' so I basically harassed the director.. Unfortunately he didn't listen but maybe next time..." ...|$|E
500|$|Christopher Borrelli of The Blade {{describes}} ferret-legging as a [...] "remarkable" [...] {{sport in}} which you get [...] "more agony of defeat than thrill of victory," [...] and Louis Mahoney of the [...] Richmond Times-Dispatch said it is [...] "sure to bring a laugh." [...] Cracked listed it as the fifth [...] "most baffling" [...] sport in the world. The Atlanta Journals Scott Bernarde commented that anyone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> ferret-legging [...] "will agree that falling off a mountain isn't all that bad." [...] American sportswriter Rick Reilly of ESPN tried ferret-legging {{as part of his}} quest to find [...] "the world's dumbest sport" [...] for a book published in 2010.|$|E

60|$|Big Alec {{had never}} been {{captured}} by the fish patrol. It was his boast that no man could take him alive, {{and it was his}} history that of the many men <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to take him dead none had succeeded. It was also history that at least two patrolmen <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to take him dead had died themselves. Further, no man violated the fish laws more systematically and deliberately than Big Alec.|$|R
2500|$|Scene I: Sir Oliver {{describes}} {{his plan to}} visit each of the brothers incognito to test their characters. He will disguise himself as their needy relative Mr. Stanley, and ask each for his help. Rowley also brings in the [...] "friendly Jew" [...] Moses, a moneylender <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> to help Charles, to explain Charles' position. Moses mentions that he is to introduce Charles to yet another moneylender ("Mr. Premium") that very evening. Sir Oliver decides that with Moses' assistance, he will pose as Premium when visiting Charles (still intending to visit Joseph as Stanley).|$|E
2500|$|In July 2010, {{video footage}} of Steele was {{released}} in which he stated that the Afghan war was [...] "a war of Obama's choosing. If he's such a student of history has he not understood that, you know, that's {{the one thing you}} don't do - is engage in a land war in Afghanistan? Everyone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried,</b> over a thousand years of history has failed." [...] He also said the war was [...] "not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in." [...] In fact, War in Afghanistan was initiated by George W. Bush in October 2001 in retaliation for the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington D.C.; Barack Obama has increased troop levels there since taking office.|$|E
2500|$|The Fantastic Four #12 (March 1963), {{featured}} the Hulk's first {{battle with the}} Thing. Although many early Hulk stories involve General Thaddeus [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] Ross trying to capture or destroy the Hulk, the main villain is often a radiation-based character, like the Gargoyle or the Leader, along with other foes such as the Toad Men, or Asian warlord General Fang. Ross' daughter Betty loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk. General Ross' right-hand man, Major Glenn Talbot, also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing Hulk and trying to gain Betty's love more honorably. Rick Jones serves as the Hulk's friend and sidekick in these early tales. The Hulk's archenemies are the Abomination and the Leader. The Abomination is more monstrous and wreaks havoc for fun and pleasure. The Leader is a super-genius <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> plan after plan {{to take over the}} world.|$|E

60|$|Every one <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> {{it knows}} what a silly, almost imbecile, feeling comes over one when one {{attempts}} the communication of ideas in dumb show.

60|$|The last of {{this series}} of letters is less like the style of Lady Byron than any of them. We cannot judge {{whether it is a}} whole {{consecutive}} letter, or fragments from a letter, selected and united. There is a great want of that clearness and precision which usually characterised Lady Byron's style. It shows, however, that the decision is made,--a decision which she regrets on account of the sister <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> so long to prevent it.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} they were heroic, {{this line of}} dishevelled, bedraggled pleasure-seekers. They were all looking Death in the face, and the closer they looked the less they feared him.

The dragoman made a motion {{of his hands and}} shoulders, as one <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> and failed. The Emir Abderrahman said something to a negro, who hurried away.|$|E
