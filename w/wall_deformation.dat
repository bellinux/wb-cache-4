The two most common limit states used in soil nail wall design is strength limit and service limit states. The strength limit state is the limit state that addresses potential failure mechanisms or collapse states of the soil nail wall system. The service limit state is the limit state that addresses loss of service function resulting from excessive <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> and is defined by restrictions in stress, deformation and facing crack width under regular service conditions. The two most common design approaches for soil nail walls are limit state design and service load design.|$|E
50|$|Current {{research}} on antibiotic synergy and potential therapies {{is moving in}} three primary directions. Some research is devoted to finding combinations of extant antibiotics which when combined exhibit synergy. A classic example of this effect is the interaction between β-lactams, which damage the bacteria cell membrane, and aminoglycosides, which inhibit protein synthesis. The damage dealt to the cell wall by β-lactams allows more aminoglycoside molecules to be taken up into the cell than would otherwise be possible, enhancing cell damage. In some cases, antibacterial combinations restore potency to ineffective drugs. Other research {{has been devoted to}} finding antibiotic resistance breakers (ARB’s) which enhance an antibiotic’s potency. This effect is mediated through direct antibacterial activity of the ARB, targeting and destroying mechanisms of bacterial resistance thereby allowing the antibiotic to function properly, interacting with the host to trigger defensive mechanisms, or some combination thereof. The third direction of research involves combining traditional antibiotics with unconventional bactericides such as silver nano particles. Silver nano particles have strong non-specific interactions with bacterial cells that result in cell <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> and the generation of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of cellular components. These effects are thought to weaken bacterial cells, making them more susceptible to assault from conventional antibiotics.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. From previous studies, {{it is known that}} the use of <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> in alternate directions while keeping a quasiconstant cross-section is an efficient way to enhance the heat transfer in a laminar flow regime inside a tube. In the present study, the tube cross-section shape gradually changes along the tube length while keeping the same cross-sectional area to prevent flow separation areas thereby limiting pressure drops. These <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> create vortical macrostructures inside the flow that significantly modify the transfer properties. Two geometrical parameters characterize the tube wall shape: the radial deformation amplitude and its streamwise wavelength. Through a numerical study, the effects of the variation of these two parameters on the flow and on the heat transfer have been studied. An important finding is that the ratio between the wavelength and the amplitude has {{a significant impact on the}} observed results: both the friction and the heat transfer increases as this deformation ratio decreases. At the same time, a local analysis of the flow mechanisms has been performed to outline the modifications that occur in the flow pattern when the <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> are increased. Flow in the entrance region has also been specifically considered: it has been found that geometrical parameters do have an influence on the length needed for the flow to get fully hydrodynamically and thermally established. Finally a performance analysis has been conducted to assess, for a given performance criterion, the deformation parameters that give optimal results. Through this parametric study, for the given Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, an alternate wall deformed tube geometry that maximizes the heat transfer without significantly increasing the pressure drops can thus be defined. dc 201...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Laboratory model {{tests of}} {{reinforced}} soil retaining wall {{were performed to}} evaluate instantane-ous and residual <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> by monotonic, sustained and cyclic vertical loading on the wall crest. The <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> during primary loading was noticeably larger when reinforced with a less stiff and more ine-lastic grid of polyester. The residual <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> by sustained and cyclic loading during otherwise global unloading was negligible or even negative. This preferred deformation mode was more obvious when rein-forced with a polyester grid. The residual <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> during cyclic loading was due primarily to the vis-cous properties of the backfill, while the rate-independent effects of cyclic loading on the stress-strain behav-iour of the backfill was also important. The tensile stress and strain in the polyester grid decreased with time at sustained and cyclic loading stages during otherwise primary monotonic loading, indicating that the danger of creep failure of reinforcement placed in the backfill subjected to long-term sustained and cyclic loading may decreases time. 1 INTRODCTION In the current design for geosynthetic-reinforced soil structures, a safety factor against ultimate failure is evaluated by limit equilibrium stability analysis between earth pressure and tensile strength of reinforcement.

40|$|We explore {{an optimal}} control {{strategy}} {{in the framework of}} high Reynolds number asymptotics in which the growth of Gortler vortices is reduced by local <b>wall</b> <b>deformations.</b> The Gortler vortices are excited by a row of roughness elements that enter the analysis through upstream conditions derived previously using an asymptotic analysis (Goldstein et al., J.

Since the leading order Navier-Stokes equations reduce to the boundary region equations (BRE) in a transverse region that scales on the local boundary layer thickness, they are parabolic in the streamwise direction, and may be solved by marching downstream. <b>Wall</b> <b>deformations</b> are introduced into the BREs via a Prandtl transformation for an arbitrary streamwise/spanwise wall surface shape. The vortex energy is then controlled using an optimal control algorithm formulated in the framework of the Lagrange multipliers method, wherein the solution to the adjoint equations are determined by an arbitrary variation in the Lagrangian, in which the cost functional is associated with the local energy of the Gortler vortices.

40|$|Blood pumps assist or {{take over}} the pump {{function}} of a failing heart. They are essentially activated by a pusher plate, a pneumatic compression of collapsible sacs or they are driven by centrifugal pumps. Blood pumps relying upon one of these actuator mechanisms do not account for realistic <b>wall</b> <b>deformation.</b> In this study, we propose an innovative design of a blood pump actuator device which {{should be able to}} mimic fairly well global left ventricular (LV) <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> patterns in terms of circumferential and longitudinal contraction, as well as torsion. In order to reproduce these basic <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> patterns in our actuator device, we designed a novel kind of artificial LV “muscle” composed of multiple actively contracting cells. Its contraction is based on a mechanism by which pressurized air, inside such a cell, causes contraction in one direction and expansion perpendicular to this direction. The organization and geometry of the contractile cells within one artificial LV muscle, the applied pressure in the cells, and the governing LV loading conditions (preload and afterload) together determine the global deformation of the LV wall. Starting from a simple plastic bag, an experimental model based on the abovementioned principle was built and connected to a lumped hydraulic model of the vascular system (including compliance and resistance). The <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> pattern of this device was validated visually and its pump performance was studied in terms of LV volume and pressure and heart rate. Our experimental results revealed (i) a global LV motion resembling a real LV, and (ii) a close correlation between our model and a real LV in terms of end-systolic volume and pressure, end-diastolic volume and pressure, stroke volume, ejection fraction and pressure-volume relationship.

40|$|This {{project is}} mainly {{concerned}} with {{a description of}} anatomical and ultrastructural characteristics of cell <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> in brittleheart of E. regnans, development of methodology for quantification of percentage of broken fibre pieces (PBFP) in E. regnans, and physical and anatomical properties of E. regnans in relation to the occurrence of brittleheart. Two 1939 regrowth E. regnans butt logs and one mature growth E. regnans butt log removed from a tree approximately 120 years old were used in the study. The anatomical and ultrastructural characteristics of cell <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> were examined with bright field, polarized light, and scanning electron microscopy. The microscopic compression lines were found to consist of slip planes, minute compression failures, corrugations, and buckles. The width of microscopic compression lines along the longitudinal fibre axis ranged from one single fold in the cell wall up to 7 times the average fibre width. The length of the microscopic compression lines ranged from ones which only crossed a few fibres to ones which crossed up to 200 fibres. The severity of microscopic compression lines appeared to be dependent on the type of cell <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> and degree of compaction in the deformed zone. In the methodology studies it was found that for a pulp sample prepared from a 2 mm by 2 mm by 15 mm wood chip approximately 400 cellular elements in 8 out of 16 areas on a slide needed to be counted in order to obtain PBFP with less than 10 % error. For macerated thin sections, all the cellular elements on 2 slides each carrying about 600 fibres and fibre pieces needed to be counted. A highly significant correlation was found between the length of microscopic compression lines per unit area and the microscopically determined PBFP. A highly significant correlation was found between the theoretical PBFP and the microscopically determined PBFP. These findings confirm that maceration of wood containing cell <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> results in broken fibres and verifies the validity of the maceration technique for quantifying the amount of microscopic compression lines. PBFP was found to increase with macerating time. A maceration time around 10 hours appears sufficient to cause fibres having cell <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> to break but longer times cause fibres without cell <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> to also break due to overmaceration. A significant relationship was found between PBFP determined after 5 hours and after 10 hours of maceration at the same temperature. It was found that parameters extracted or derived from cell length distributions produced by the Kajaani FS- 200 may be used to determine the amount of fibre fragments in pulp samples. These parameters were the high peak, the length weighted average, and the mass weighted average of the cell length distributions for pulps which had PBFP greater than 10. Based on the maceration technique, brittleheart was detected in both the mature and the 1939 regrowth logs. Brittleheart was more severe and occupied a larger area in the mature growth than in the regrowth wood. The PBFP was found to be mostly below 5 in the regrowth wood although relatively high PBFP values of 21 and 30 were observed. PBFP values as high as 85 was found in the mature growth wood. In general, PBFP was found to be higher nearer the pith, decreasing toward the bark, and dropping to zero before reaching the two-thirds theoretical point where the stress is assumed to be 0. A large circumferential variation in PBFP was observed in four adjacent growth rings of the mature log. A large variation in PBFP was also found within a volume of 1000 mm^ 3 for both the mature and the 1939 regrowth wood. The earlywood PBFP was found to be significantly higher than the latewood PBFP for the mature and regrowth logs. A total of 72 green and 132 12 % MC Izod specimens were prepared from the two 1939 regrowth logs and tested for impact strength. The mean Izod value was found to be 9. 9 ft. lb for the 132 12 % MC Izod specimens and 9. 2 ft. lb for the 72 green Izod specimens. For side-matched Izod specimens, the mean Izod value was found to be 9. 2 ft. lb at green and 9. 7 ft. lb at 12 % MC and the mean for the 12 % MC specimens did not reflect the expected increase in strength with moisture loss. Excessively low Izod values (eg. 1. 8 ft. Ib) were found in the 12 % MC Izod specimens located near the pith. For 76 12 % MC Izod specimens, their PBFP, fibre length, and specific gravity were also measured. Significant relationships (p= 0. 01) were found between Izod values and specific gravity, PBFP, and fibre length for these 76 12 % MC Izod specimens. Specific gravity and fibre length positively contribute to the impact strength whereas PBFP negatively affects the impact strength. Brash-break specimens showed a low mean Izod value, a low mean specific gravity, the presence of brittleheart, and a short mean fibre length.

In this context, the aim of this thesis was to evaluate the role of adhesion forces in the response of bacteria to their adhering state. To this end, we used a model pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, common in biomaterial associated infections and several of its isogenic mutants and applied Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Surface Enhanced Fluorescence (SEF) to quantify adhesion forces and cell <b>wall</b> <b>deformation,</b> respectively. Bacterial response was evaluated in terms of gene expression on different biomaterials commonly used in orthopedic implants.

They do not respond to pressure per se because they are not activated by pressure changes in the absence of deformation (Hauss et al., 1949; Angell-James, 1971). Pressure is sensed by the baroreceptors in a multi-step process that includes pressure-mechanical deformation in the vessel wall followed by mechano-electrical transduction in the receptors themselves. The re-lationship between <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> and intravas-cular pressure is not direct. <b>Wall</b> <b>deformation</b> may be quantified as strain that is calculated from the ratio of the change in wall radius produced by wall stress to the initial unstressed wall radius. Wall stress is calculated as the product of the distending pressure and the radial distance over which it acts divided by the wall thickness. <b>Wall</b> <b>deformation</b> is also viscoelastic in nature, due principally to the elastin, collagen, and smooth muscle present in the vessel wall. When the wall is strained by pressure, the receptor is deformed by an unknown coupling mechanism probably located in the processes de-scribed by Krauhs (1979) and presumably viscoe-lastic, which influences strongly the dynamic re-sponse of the receptors.

In this study it is investigated how another type of actuation, active <b>wall</b> <b>deformation,</b> could be used to yield a similar effect.. Ãƒ??Ãƒ?? First. discrete time-dependent <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> is studied in laminar flow. Lacking background turbulence, the baseflow allows clear identification of the flow perturbation. The analysis reveals that a downward moving actuator is surrounded by a region of negative wall-normal velocity and vice versa. Comparably less intuitive are the vorticity fields which often display complicated structures. A similar, subsequent study in turbulent flow shows that, indeed, active <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> can restruckJre wall turbulence. Seised on thesA findings, a series of experiments were conducted on opposition control. This scheme. aims at opposing the velocity sensed away from the wall by imposing velocity of opposite direction at the wall. By locally deforming the wall accordingly, skin friction reductions of up to 15 % are observed. Parameters critical to the performance of the control scheme, such as actuation scales and deformation limiters, are identified and analysed. As Reynolds number and actuation scales are much smaller than in practical applications, the results are of limited applicability but encouraging for prospective drag reduction at higher Reynolds numbers.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of hypereosinophilic {{syndrome}} with a large apical mass, which markedly reduced end-systolic left ventricular cavity volume. Standard blood pool Doppler findings showed a restrictive filling pattern. However, ultrasound-derived regional strain rate and strain parameters suggested that <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> was not compromised, inferring that the restrictive filling pattern {{in this case was}} solely {{as a result of the}} reduction in end-systolic cavity size. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ground {{curvature}} {{caused by}} underground mining {{is one of}} the most obvious deformation quantities in buildings. To study the influence of surface curvature on buildings and predict the movement and deformation of buildings caused by ground curvature, a prediction model of the influence function on mining subsidence was used to establish the relationship between surface curvature and <b>wall</b> <b>deformation.</b> The prediction model of <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> was then established and the surface curvature was obtained from mining subsidence prediction software. Five prediction lines were set up in the wall from bottom to top and the predicted deformation of each line was used to calculate the crack positions in the wall. Thus, the crack prediction model was obtained. The model was verified by a case study from a coalmine in Shanxi, China. The results show that when the ground curvature is positive, the crack in the wall is shaped like a “V”; when the ground curvature is negative, the crack is shaped like a “∧”. The conclusion provides the basis for a damage evaluation method for buildings in coalmine areas...|$|E

It accounts for <b>wall</b> <b>deformation</b> while yet working on a fixed geometry. The model is established first. Then a numerical approximation is proposed and some tests are given. The model is also used for optimal design of a stent and possible recovery of the arterial wall elastic coefficients by inverse methods...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{relative}} distortability of the lungs and chest wall, we cannulated one lung in intact anesthetized dog and starting at different lung volumes (VL), inflated one lobe with known volume increments (+ΔVx) using positive pressure, leaving the other lobes free. to change volume (+ ΔVy), i. e. inflate or deflate. If the lung were very distortable (liquid-like) ΔVy would equal - ΔVx. If the chest wall were very disortable, ΔVy would equal zero. If neither were distortable, ΔAy would be very much greater than zero. At low VL, ΔVy max was - 12. 5 % of ΔVx max. At high VL, ΔVy max was zero. Measured pleural surface pressure differences between lobes were large. Results indicate that; 1) lung distortabllity decreases as volume increases; 2) the pressure cost of chest <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> is substantial and results in marked regional differences in pleural surface pressures...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of viscous flow in an elastic tube. Elastic tubes collapse (buckle non-axisymmetrically) when the transmural pressure (internal minus external pressure) falls below a critical value. The tube's large deformation during the buckling leads to a strong interaction between the fluid and solid mechanics. In this study, the steady 3 D Stokes equations are used to analyse the slow viscous flow in such a tube whose deformation is described by geometrically non-linear shell theory. Finite Element methods are used to solve the large-displacement fluid-structure interaction problem. Typical <b>wall</b> <b>deformations</b> and flow fields in the strongly collapsed tube are shown. Extensive parameter studies illustrate the tube's flow-characteristics (e. g. volume flux {{as a function of the}} applied pressure drop through the tube) for boundary conditions corresponding to the four fundamental experimental setups. It is shown that lubrication theory provides an excellent appro [...] ...|$|R
