25|$|At one time, 25 {{subspecies}} of beavers {{were identified}} in North America, with distinctions based primarily on slight morphological differences and geographical isolation {{at the time of}} discovery.

500|$|In 1973, rice rats were {{discovered}} at Cudjoe Key in the Florida Keys, and in 1978 Spitzer and Lazell described this {{population as a}} new species, Oryzomys argentatus. The status of this form—either a distinct species or not even subspecifically distinct from O.palustris natator—has remained controversial since; the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the <b>World</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> recognize O.argentatus as a separate species, but acknowledges a need for further research. A 2005 study using microsatellite DNA found that Florida Keys rice rats exhibit low genetic variation and are significantly different from Everglades rice rats; the study concluded in favor of classifying the Keys rice rat as a [...] "distinct vertebrate population". This population probably diverged from mainland rice rats about 2000 years ago.|$|E
500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, {{was that it}} fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But {{how is it possible}} that the world [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the <b>world</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.|$|E

500|$|According to {{historian}} Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, {{during the}} Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, the Mamluks used cannons against the Mongols. He claims {{that this was}} [...] "the first cannon in history" [...] and used a gunpowder formula almost identical to the ideal composition for explosive gunpowder. He also argues {{that this was not}} known in China or Europe until much later. Hassan further claims that the earliest textual evidence of cannons is from the middle east, based on earlier originals which report hand-held cannon being used by the Mamluks at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. However Hassan's claims have been refuted by other historians such as Iqtidar Alam Khan, Joseph Needham, and Toino Andrade. Khan argues that it was the Mongols who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world, and cites Mamluk antagonism towards early riflemen in their infantry {{as an example of how}} gunpowder weapons were not always met with open acceptance in the Middle East. According to Needham, the term midfa, dated to textual sources from 1342 to 1352, did not refer to true hand-guns or bombards, and contemporary accounts of a metal-barrel cannon in the Islamic <b>world</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> occur until 1365 Andrade too dates the textual appearance of cannons in middle eastern sources to the 1360s.|$|E
