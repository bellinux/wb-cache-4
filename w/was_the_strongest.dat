5|$|The 1991 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was a near-average Pacific {{hurricane season}}. The worst storm {{this year was}} Tropical Depression Five-E, which killed one person in Mexico. Elsewhere, Tropical Storm Ignacio injured forty people in Mexico, and Hurricane Fefa caused flooding in Hawaii. Hurricane Kevin <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> system {{of the season and}} became the then longest-lasting hurricane in the eastern north Pacific basin. Hurricane Nora <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> November storm at that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} the only one on record to form in the Mozambique Channel in June. In addition, it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> storm to form so late in the season.|$|E
5|$|At {{its peak}} Gwenda <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> storm on record to form near Australia, surpassing Cyclone Orson in 1989. Gwenda held this record until 2003, when its maximum winds were eclipsed by Cyclone Inigo. Despite the minimal damage, {{the name was}} retired from the {{circulating}} lists of tropical cyclone names for the Australian Region.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{damage from}} Typhoon Sudal totaled about $14million (2004USD, $16.1million 2010USD), {{most of which}} on Yap from {{property}} damage. Despite the heavy damage, there were no deaths, although there were initial reports of one fatality. Only 8people required hospital treatment due to injuries, none of them serious. Typhoon Sudal <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> typhoon to strike Yap in about 50years.|$|E
5|$|The shock {{occurred}} near Nagoya, and {{was felt}} throughout the country, but <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> in central Japan. The cities of Gifu and Ogaki experienced heavy damage, {{due largely to}} fire, but Osaka and Nagoya were also significantly affected. The earthquake was strong in Tokyo, lasting for many minutes, and knocked items off shelves and stopped clocks.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is intended to}} validate the measurement model of organization reputation, strategic leadership, and organization culture as a resources-based view. The essence of the measurment model as follow as: (1) <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> good employer <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> organization reputation will be; (2) <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> ability to think strategically <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> strategic leadership is; and (3) <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> freedom to grow and to fail <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>the</b> organization culture <b>is.</b> <b>The</b> measurement model based on theoretical framework successfully reaches convergent validity and composite reliability. This measurement model of intangible asset in the organization base of resource based view {{to be used in}} advanced research on corporate entrepreneurship. The revalidation of measurement model in wider context and population, for example the small business sector, becomes the agenda of the future research. For practical purpose, the usage of measurement model indicators can be accomplished...|$|R
5|$|The strongest {{hurricane}} to hit {{the state}} during the time period was Hurricane Charley, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> hurricane to strike the United States since Hurricane Andrew.

5|$|After passing {{north of}} Taiwan, Rananim made {{landfall}} at peak intensity around 1300UTC on August12, near Wenling in Zhejiang province in China. The China Meteorological Administration {{reported that the}} typhoon <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> to hit Zhejiang since Typhoon Sally in 1956. Moving over land, the typhoon quickly weakened to tropical storm status as it turned toward the west. Early on August13, the JMA downgraded Rananim to a tropical depression and issued the last warning; by that time, the circulation was over Jiangxi. The depression lasted another two days before dissipating over northwest Hunan.|$|E
5|$|An eyewall {{replacement}} {{cycle and}} weakening convection {{along the northern}} side resulted in steady weakening starting on July10. Increasing wind shear prevented the system from reorganizing as it neared East China. Early on July11, the typhoon reached the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge and began turning {{to the north and}} later north-northeast. Chan-hom made landfall in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, or roughly 140km (80mi) south-southeast of Shanghai, around 08:40UTC. The JMA assessed the storm to have had winds of 140km/h (85mph) while the JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds at 155km/h (100mph). Based on the JTWC estimate, Chan-hom <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> typhoon to pass within 160km (100mi) of Shanghai in at least 35years, and it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> landfall in Zhejiang since recordkeeping began in 1949. Thereafter the storm accelerated north-northeast and moved over the cool waters of the Yellow Sea, prompting further degradation of its structure. Chan-hom weakened below typhoon-force around 18:00UTC on July11. The system's low-level center completely exposed on July12 as it approached the Korean Peninsula. Around 18:00UTC, Chan-hom moved ashore on the Ongjin peninsula in North Korea, southwest of the capital Pyongyang, with winds of 95km/h (60mph). By 00:00UTC on July13 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while retaining gale-force winds, and six hours later the system dissipated over north-central North Korea.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Hary <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> {{tropical}} cyclone of the season. Developing on March5 from the monsoon trough, the storm initially moved generally {{to the west}} and gradually intensified. With favorable conditions, Hary quickly intensified on March7, developing an eye and well-defined outflow. After reaching an initial peak, the cyclone briefly weakened due to an eyewall replacement cycle, by which time the storm turned southwestward toward Madagascar. Hary re-intensified and attained peak winds of 220km/h (140mph) on March10 just offshore of eastern Madagascar, which made it the first very intense {{tropical cyclone}} since 2000.|$|E
5|$|Few storms formed this season, but it {{was very}} eventful. Twelve {{tropical}} cyclones formed during this season, of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas. Two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered the eastern north Pacific Ocean. Early in the season three tropical cyclones impacted Mexico in a ten-day span, while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began. Hurricane Douglas <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> storm, reaching Category4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Cesar.|$|E
5|$|Five ships {{recorded}} {{tropical storm}} force winds {{in association with}} Arthur, of which two were when the storm was extratropical. Early on July 16, a vessel with the call sign Weston reported sustained winds of 51mph (82km/h) from the south-southwest, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> ship reported wind speed. As the storm approached Canada as an extratropical storm, a buoy reported an 8minute average wind speed of 45mph (72km/h), along with a wind gust of 60mph (97km/h).|$|E

Julich's victory in Paris–Nice made him the first rider to wear the leader's jersey in the new UCI ProTour. This was followed by three team stage wins in the Giro d'Italia, one by David Zabriskie and two by Basso, though the overall victory escaped from Basso when he was beset by a stomach ailment.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Juliette <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> {{hurricane}} {{and final}} tropical cyclone of the inactive 1995 Pacific hurricane season. The tenth named storm of the season, Juliette formed on September16 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico. For {{the majority of}} its track, the storm moved toward the west-northwest, and Juliette quickly intensified to major hurricane status. On September20, the hurricane reached peak winds of 150mph (240km/h). Later it turned toward the northeast, briefly threatening the Baja California Peninsula, although the hurricane never affected land.|$|E

5|$|Several storms {{throughout}} the season affected land. Hurricane Estelle passed south of Hawaii, resulting in $2million in damage and two deaths. Hurricanes Newton, Paine and Roslyn each struck Northwestern Mexico. While damage was minimal from these three systems near their location of landfall, Paine brought considerable flooding to the Great Plains. The overall flooding event resulted in $350million in damage, with the worst effects being recorded in Oklahoma. Hurricane Roslyn <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>strongest</b> storm of the season, attaining peak winds of 145mph (230km/h).|$|E
