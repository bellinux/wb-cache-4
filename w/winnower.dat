In 1926 the company owned also three large shops in Warsaw, Krakow and Łódź offering {{a wide range}} of agricultural machines: horse mills, threshing machines, reapers, <b>winnowers</b> and chaff cutters. In addition, the company also produced a wide variety of pipes, pots, kettles, stoves, ovens, horse cart parts and many more products.

However, the Great Depression stroke the company hard. In 1927 the owners had to split the company and 96% of shares of the Huta Ludwików were taken over by the Huta Pokój in Bytom, the largest steel company of Poland at that time. The new management, since 1931 led by Otmar Kwieciński, quickly restructured the factory and started expanding the product range to include more complex products.

To reach the place, pioneers had to transport and deliver commodities using the carabao-drawn cariton, given its ease in negotiating mud tracks. For Malanday residents, 1937 holds a special significance - it was the year they were released from the bondage of paying land taxes to the Tuasons, owner of most of the lands in Marikina. As a result, petitions for transfer of land ownership were filed. In response, the government bought a big portion of a vast estate and distributed it to occupants, requiring only the beneficiaries to pay a nominal amount for every square meter of land owned over a period of one decade. This development would give rise to the founding of Barangay Malanday.|$|E

The first definite reference to this mill was in 1317, when the mill was held by John de Cheggeworth. John de Chageworth was recorded at the mill in 1324. The mill was in the ownership of Sir Cheney Culpeper in 1657. It was then known as the Lower Mill. The previous owners were Thomas Hatche and Richard Austen, who had recently sold the mill at that date. John Pecke was the miller.

In 1702, John Feverstone was the miller. The mill was known as Pendmill in 1745 when the miller was recorded as John Feverstour the Elder. John Feverstone the older was the miller in 1766, when the lease was renewed. Richard Tilbe being the owner at this time. Thomas Willett leased the mill in 1792 and in 1800 Chegworth Mill, otherwise Pendmill was mortgaged by Willett. The mill was recorded as Checqworth Mill on the 1801 Ordnance Survey map.
