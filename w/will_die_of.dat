5|$|Koalas {{may live}} from 13 to 18 {{years in the}} wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more {{hazardous}} lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males. Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>of</b> starvation.|$|E
5|$|Fireflash is {{recalled}} and Captain Hanson and his co-pilot {{instructed to}} circle the airspace above the airport. The shielding on the airliner's atomic reactor is weakening; if Fireflash does not land within two hours, the passengers and crew <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>of</b> radiation exposure. Air Traffic Control commandeers an Air Force jet called a TX-204 Target Carrying Aircraft that docks with Fireflash in flight, allowing a Lieutenant Bob Meddings to board the hold and attempt to remove the bomb. Meddings is almost killed when he falls through the unclosed maintenance hatch and plummets to the ground; moments before impact, however, he successfully deploys his parachute and ultimately survives.|$|E
5|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} with neighbouring birds {{has been}} recorded and may be a reason for adult males {{to stay close to}} the female before and during the egg laying period. Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch three to five days later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>of</b> starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located close to each other, young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food. In the Spanish population, young fledge and leave the nest after 90 to 110 days. Fledged birds continue to remain dependent on their parents for at least a month.|$|E

25|$|Acarine mites are {{commonly}} controlled with grease patties (typically made {{from one part}} vegetable shortening mixed with three to four parts powdered sugar) placed on the top bars of the hive. The bees come to eat the sugar and pick up traces of shortening, which disrupts the mite's ability to identify a young bee. Some of the mites waiting to transfer to a new host remain on the original host. Others transfer to a random bee—a proportion of which <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>of</b> other causes before the mite can reproduce.|$|E
25|$|Fry of {{this species}} are {{particularly}} sensitive to changes in water chemistry and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28°C, fry <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>of</b> heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26°C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22°C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry—the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment—must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place. While the fry are likely to develop best if given infusoria {{as part of their}} feeding régime, it is possible to raise fry to adulthood entirely upon prepared foods.|$|E
25|$|Smoking most {{commonly}} leads to diseases affecting {{the heart and}} lungs and will {{most commonly}} affect areas such as hands or feet with first signs of smoking related health issues showing up as numbness, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), emphysema, and cancer, particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, and pancreatic cancer. Overall life expectancy is also reduced in long term smokers, with estimates ranging from 10 to 17.9. years fewer than nonsmokers. About one half of long term male smokers <b>will</b> <b>die</b> <b>of</b> illness due to smoking. The association of smoking with lung cancer is strongest, both in the public perception and etiologically. Among male smokers, the lifetime risk of developing lung cancer is 17.2%; among female smokers, the risk is 11.6%. This risk is significantly lower in nonsmokers: 1.3% in men and 1.4% in women. Historically, lung cancer was considered to be a rare disease prior to World War I and was perceived as something most physicians would never see during their career. With the postwar rise in popularity of cigarette smoking came a virtual epidemic of lung cancer.|$|E

2500|$|To {{give the}} {{illusion}} that the game world is always available, persistence can be simulated.

Aside from virtual worlds, the simulation of a persistent world is also possible in single player games. In Noctis, players are advised to turn off the game while refueling because it takes so long. In addition, if a player who has landed on a planet stops playing and then after a while resumes, he or she can see visible changes in the sea level or the daytime/nighttime cycle.
