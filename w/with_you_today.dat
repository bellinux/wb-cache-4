Compared with the Mississippi River above their confluence, the Missouri is twice as long and drains an area three times as large. The Missouri accounts for 45 percent of the annual flow of the Mississippi past St. Louis, and as much as 70 percent in certain droughts.|$|E
40|$|I am very {{grateful}} to FTL and Ruth Padilla for their kind invitation to share <b>with</b> <b>you</b> all <b>today.</b> The sessions yesterday and today have been very interesting and thought provoking. This presentation is arranged in three parts. Part I briefly examines the biblical and theological foundations of my vision of a desired society from a political perspective. Part II presents the reasons why I believe representative democracy is an appropriate system of government for a desired society. Part III describes an empirical problem that Christian churches are currently experiencing in Latin America. While my expertise as a comparative political scientist {{is limited to the}} Latin American region, I honestly believe that this is a problem that can affect Christians in any region, particularly in many countries of the two thirds world, where democracy remains fragile.

40|$|I {{would like}} to begin by thanking the conference {{organizers}} for inviting me to join <b>you</b> here <b>today</b> and to share my research on globally networked learning environments. What I share <b>with</b> <b>you</b> here <b>today</b> is what I have learned through my work with many, many colleagues and students for whose collaboration I am deeply grateful.

For several years now, my colleagues and I have been studying partnerships and the role of the internet in higher education. More recently, we have focused on faculty innovations in globally networked learning—the visions they create and aspire to, the hard work and passion they put into helping students develop global understanding and make knowledge in new ways, the challenges they have faced, the successes they have celebrated, and the new opportunities for innovation they have created at their universities. As I will discuss in a little while, globally networked learning environments represent an exciting paradigm shift—an innovation in learning that is critical to the development of a global civil society. And while these learning environments are only emerging, they reflect deeper social and technologica...|$|R

It {{is a pleasure}} for me to interact <b>with</b> <b>you</b> all, <b>today</b> at this Summit. The theme of the Summit revolves around risk and governance, the two terms which are being looked at by policy makers with renewed interest and a fresh perspective {{in the aftermath of}} the global financial crisis. I intend to talk briefly on both risk and governance from a conceptual perspective before deliberating on the regulatory changes (Basel III) and conclude with a brief overview of the Indian perspective. Risk is almost God like in qualities. It is omnipresent. You find risk everywhere ranging from simple things such as walking (you run the risk of tripping and falling) or talking (you run a risk of saying something inappropriate or getting misquoted) to more serious things such as flying airplanes, launching satellites or conducting surgeries. Unmanaged risk can prove disastrous and the recent global crisis is a continuing testimony of this fact. Risk has a long history, perhaps as long as human history, and so does risk management. Reflecting on risks and risk management as it would have prevailed in the early ages, I a...|$|R
