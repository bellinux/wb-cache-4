40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe conceptual template {{laid out in}} Joint Vision 2010 called for leveraging technological opportunities to achieve new {{and higher levels of}} effectiveness in a joint operating environment. Born out of this concept the U. S. Joint Forces Command developed a concept - the Common Relevant Operational Picture, or CROP. It is a presentation of timely, fused, accurate, assured and relevant information. The CROP concept addresses battlespace awareness, information transport and processing, combat identification and joint command and control - four of the six high priority challenges identified by the Joint Staff for the 21 st century. This thesis investigates CROP, comparing and contrasting it to uncoordinated separate service systems in a time-critical targeting setting. The Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) used are the time to kill a target and the number of weapons expended. Previous work on this problem used an analytical model with some simplifying assumptions concerning processing time latency following target detection. In this thesis, a simulation is used to investigate the validity of some of the analytical model assumptions. The simulation also extends the model for more general command and control time distributions and models Battle Damage Assessment. The results provide distributional information about the MOEs, showing how improvements in information sharing and optimal <b>weapons</b> <b>assignment</b> due to CROP can improve systems performance. However, this improvement is lost if processing time latency under CROP is too long. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|The task of optimally {{assigning}} military ordinance to enemy targets, often {{termed the}} Weapon Target Assignment (WTA) problem, {{has become a}} major focus of modern military thought. Current formulations of this problem consider the enemy targets as either passive or entirely defensive. As a result, the assignment problem is solved purely as a one sided team optimization problem. In practice, however, especially in environments characterized by the presence of an intelligent adversary, this one sided optimization approach has very limited use. The presence of an adversary often necessitates incorporating its intended actions in the process of solving the <b>weapons</b> <b>assignment</b> problem. In this dissertation, we formulate the weapon target assignment problem in the presence of an intelligent adversary within the framework of game theory. We consider two teams of opposing units simultaneously targeting each other and examine several possible game theoretic solutions of this problem. An issue that arises when searching for any solution is the dimensionality of the search space which quickly becomes overwhelming even for simple problems with a small number of units on each side. To solve this scalability issue, we present a novel algorithm called Unit Level Team Resource Allocation (ULTRA), which is capable of generating approximate solutions by searching within appropriate subspaces of the search space. We evaluate the performance of this algorithm on several realistic simulation scenarios. We also show that this algorithm can be effectively implemented in real-time as an automatic target assigning controller in a dynamic multi-stage problem involving two teams with large number of units in conflict...|$|E

Erroneous BDA returns dead targets to the shooter targeting list.

The algorithm provides flexibility and optimality by swapping between two objective functions, i. e. the preferential and subtractive defense strategies as and when required. To further enhance the solution quality, it outlines and divides the critical parameters used in Threat Evaluation and <b>Weapon</b> <b>Assignment</b> (TEWA) into three broad categories (Triggering, Scheduling and Ranking parameters).

Threat Evaluation and <b>Weapon</b> <b>Assignment</b> (TEWA) sits at the core of SCR system. In such a system, maximal or near maximal utilization of constrained resources is of extreme importance. Manual TEWA systems cannot provide optimality because of different limitations e. g. surface to air missile (SAM) can fire from a distance of 5 Km, but manual TEWA systems are constrained by human vision range and other constraints. Current TEWA systems usually work on target-by-target basis using some type of greedy algorithm thus affecting the optimality of the solution and failing in multi-target scenario. his paper relates to a novel two-staged flexible dynamic decision support based optimal threat evaluation and <b>weapon</b> <b>assignment</b> algorithm for multi-target air-borne threats.

40|$|A typical {{ground-based}} {{air defence}} (GBAD) environment comprises defended assets {{on the ground}} which require protection from enemy aircraft entering the defended airspace. Protection against these aircraft is afforded by means of pre-deployed ground-based weapon systems that are assigned to engage these enemy aircraft according to some pre-specified criterion or set of criteria. The conditions under which human operators have to propose <b>assignments</b> of <b>weapon</b> systems to engage these aircraft are severely stressful since time is a critical factor {{and there is no}} room for error. Some progress has already been made with respect to the design of computerised threat evaluation and <b>weapon</b> <b>assignment</b> (TEWA) decision support systems (DSSs) within the context of a GBAD system.

A list of relevant factors (related to objectives) is identified by means of feedback received from a WA questionnaire which was completed by a number of military experts. For illustrative purposes, two objectives, namely the cost of assigning weapon systems for engagement and the accumulated survival probabilities of observed threats as a result of these engagements, were isolated from these factors in order to derive a bi-objective WA model. This model is solved in the context of a simulated, but realistic, GBAD environment by means of an existing multiobjective solution technique called the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} rule-based heuristic to solve asset-based dynamic weapon-target assignment (DWTA) problems. The main {{idea of the}} proposed heuristic is to utilize the domain knowledge of DWTA problems to directly achieve <b>weapon</b> <b>assignment,</b> without large number of function evaluations. We update the saturation states of con-straints in the assignment process to guarantee the feasibility of generated solutions. For the purpose of testing {{the performance of the}} proposed heuristic, we build a general Monte Carlo simulation-based DWTA frame-work. For comparison, we also employ a Monte Carlo method (MCM) to make DWTA decisions in different defense scenarios. From simulations with DWTA instances under different scales, the heuristic has obvious advantages over the MCM with regard to solution quality and computation time. The proposed method can solve large-scale DWTA problems (e. g., those including 100 weapons, 100 targets, and four defense stages) within only a few seconds.

30|$|The task {{used was}} the Simulated Combat Control System microworld (S-CCS; Lafond et al., 2009; Vachon et al., 2012), a {{simulation}} {{of the essential}} subset of cognitive activities performed by tactical coordinators aboard Canadian navy frigates. The use of a microworld represents the best compromise between internal and ecological validities; it provides {{a high degree of}} experimental control while allowing the re-creation of displays and scenarios that are functionally comparable to those encountered in real C 2 operations (Brehmer & Dörner, 1993; Elliot et al., 2004). For Experiment 1, participants were required to perform TEWA processes while also being alert and responding to unexpected critical changes (i.e. an aircraft changing from a non-threatening to a threatening status) which could potentially compromise the safety of the own ship. The TEWA task involved categorizing aircraft appearing on a radar display according to their threat level (threat evaluation) and scheduling retaliatory actions against threatening aircraft (<b>weapon</b> <b>assignment).</b> Participants were required to detect the critical changes as part of the higher-order goal of ensuring that aircraft were categorized appropriately and defending the own ship.|$|R
30|$|The {{increase}} in subjective workload in the CHEX condition {{would seem to}} provide some explanation for the associated decrease in TEWA performance {{in the presence of}} the tool. Such a result suggests that the presence of the DSS on the display provided an additional source of information to monitor that could have increased the apparent cognitive load of the task (Perry, Wiggins, Childs, & Fogarty, 2013). Indeed, introducing a table listing all the changes (critical and non-critical) occurring in the complex dynamic situation increased the amount of visual information to process before making a decision. It has also been shown that the mere presence of a tool or modifying a part of an interface can change the way a task is performed when compared to that observed beforehand (McCrickard, Catrambone, Chewar, & Stasko, 2003; Rousseau, Tremblay, Lafond, Vachon, & Breton, 2007). Therefore, this extra burden and pressure that the addition of CHEX put on participants may have affected their efficacy in making precise and timely decisions with regard to <b>weapon</b> <b>assignment,</b> thus leaving the own ship more exposed to attack (ship hits).|$|R

Due to this reason, this critical mission of any air defence C 2 system should be supported by a smart algorithm to help the operators in the battlefield and not to create any defence weakness by means of overloading human operators.
