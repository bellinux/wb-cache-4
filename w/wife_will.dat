5|$|Sawyer is in prison, {{trying to}} befriend Munson (Ian Gomez), {{a man who}} has hidden ten million dollars. He warns Munson that the warden (Bill Duke) is trying to con him out of his money. Eventually, Munson, worried that his <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> find where he has hidden the money, enlists Sawyer's help in moving the stash. Sawyer then reveals this {{information}} to the warden in exchange for a reduced sentence and a part of the money, which he puts in a bank account for Clementine Phillips, a baby that previous con victim Cassidy Phillips (Kim Dickens) has told him is his daughter. The warden sarcastically congratulates Sawyer on lying and cheating his way out of prison.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{widespread}} fady about indri and sifakas. They are often protected from hunting and consumption {{because of their}} resemblance to humans and their ancestors, mostly due to their large size and upright or orthograde posture. The resemblance is even stronger for indri, which lack the long tail of most living lemurs. Known locally as babakoto ("Ancestor of Man"), the indri is sometimes seen as the progenitor of the family or clan. There are also stories of an indri that helped a human down from a tree, so they are seen as benefactors. Other lemur fady include the belief that a <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> have ugly children if her husband kills a woolly lemur, or that if a pregnant woman eats a dwarf lemur, her baby will get its beautiful, round eyes.|$|E
5|$|Two years {{pass and}} couple have their first child. Their family {{physician}} offers {{to perform an}} operation to restore May's sight. Despite Frank's worries that his <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> not love him if she should see his scarred face, Frank consents to the operation. The operation is a success and the doctor warns May not to remove the bandages as she will lose her sight again. May's desire to see her child {{is so strong that}} she removes the bandages and gazes upon her child. Upon trying to gaze upon her husband, who is standing in strong light, May is permanently blinded. The film concludes with May being content with her blindness and knowing that her baby is as beautiful.|$|E

25|$|As a dry rice farmer, {{the male}} {{head of a}} {{household}} annually clears a fresh section of tropical forest where his <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> plant and harvest their rice. Isneg women also cook the meals, gather wild vegetables and weave bamboo mats and baskets, while the men cut timber, build houses and take extended hunting and fishing trips. Often when a wild pig or deer is killed, its meat is skewered on bamboo and distributed to neighbors and relatives. Nearly all Isneg households also harvest a small grove of coffee trees since the main cash crop of the area is coffee.|$|E
25|$|Ecclesiastically {{divorced}} Orthodox (not civilly divorced only) {{are usually}} allowed to remarry in the Orthodox Church, {{though there is}} usually imposed on them a fairly severe penance by their bishop and the services for a second marriage in this case are more penitential than joyful. Widows are permitted to remarry without repercussion and their second marriage is considered just as valid as the first. One exception to this rule is the clergy and their wives. Should a married priest die, it is normal that his <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> retire to a monastery once their children {{are out of the}} house. Widowed priests are not allowed to remarry (no priest may be married after his ordination) and also frequently end up in monasteries.|$|E
25|$|A {{dead man}} is {{prepared}} {{by his wife}} for the wake, known in Ilocano as the bagongon. Typically, only the <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> clothe the corpse, believing {{that the spirit of}} the dead man can convey messages through her. There are many customs and beliefs that are followed, such as coffin placement, lighting a wooden log in front of the house, chanting while crying (dung-aw), in order to give the deceased one respects and ensuring a safe travel to heaven. During the wake, immediate family members of the deceased one are not allowed to work, cook, or carry heavy objects. The ceremonial attire of female mourners for the vigil is black clothing, while their heads and shoulders are covered in a black veil called a manto.|$|E

25|$|An elderly cultivator, {{with several}} wives and likely several young male children, {{benefits}} {{from having a}} much larger workforce within his household. By the combined efforts of his young sons and young wives, he may gradually expand his cultivation and become more prosperous. A man with a single wife has less help in cultivation {{and is likely to}} have little or no help for felling trees. According to Boserup's historical data, women living in such a structure also welcome one or more co-wives to share with them the burden of daily labor. However, the second <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> usually do the most tiresome work, almost {{as if she were a}} servant to the first wife, and will be inferior to the first wife in status. A 1930s study of the Mende in the west African state of Sierra Leone concluded that a plurality of wives is an agricultural asset, since a large number of women makes it unnecessary to employ wage laborers. Polygyny is considered an economic advantage in many rural areas. In some cases, the economic role of the additional wife enables the husband to enjoy more leisure.|$|E

With proper funding I’m confident this little baby could destroy {{an area the size of}} New York City!" [...] Grampa responds with [...] "But I want to help people, not kill ‘em!", to which Frink replies [...] "Oh. Well, to be honest, the ray only has evil applications.

During Ramadhan, he is sent to buy a blanket but, on the way home, a wayward cigar burns a hole in the blanket. Afraid of what his <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> say, Dang buys another blanket. The first blanket is given to Dang's stepson, Boejoeng. Later that week, Dang tries to break the fast early by {{stealing}} some biscuits. Rather than be found out by his stepson, Dang convinces Boejoeng to cover his head with his blanket. That evening Boejoeng, having seen Dang take the biscuits {{through the hole in the}} blanket, demands that his stepfather double his allowance or else he will reveal Dang's secret.

They enter the church and intercept the princess, just before she is forcibly married to Booster, but Chef Torte and his apprentice attempt to prevent their escape. While fighting them, the wedding cake that they made comes to life, forcing the chefs to flee, leaving Mario and friends to deal with the living cake (who name is Bundt). Booster helps defeat Bundt by swallowing it whole and now satisfied and no longer needing Toadstool, he returns to his tower in hopes a new <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> come to him overtime.|$|E
500|$|In season three, Abby {{sets her}} {{sights on the}} wealthy Gary Ewing, the husband of her good friend Valene Ewing. While Gary {{initially}} thwarted her attempts, he eventually gave in and had a full-fledged affair with her. Actress Joan Van Ark, who played Val, said: [...] "I went in way early, whenever Donna Mills came on the show, and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby. Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center I can’t believe I did that but it really provided us with some great stories. And it was the longest running story on the show." [...] Dan Lewis of the Sarasota Journal said, [...] "In a recent episode, Abby lures Gary Ewing into an affair, and sets it up so that his <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> discover it. After she completed the scene, Miss Mills recalls, the crew hissing at her – jokingly, of course." [...] The character was known for her numerous rivalries with other female characters, such as Paige and Karen. Carole Glinez said, [...] "Mills' character faced her rival Paige, played by future Desperate Housewives sexpot Nicollette Sheridan." ...|$|E

While he is doing so, the priests fly down in a crop-duster and kidnap Lois. Peter is then given a message telling {{him that if he}} does not return the film to Gibson at his estate on top of Mount Rushmore, his <b>wife</b> <b>will</b> be killed. Peter arrives at the house and gives Gibson a film can. As Peter and Lois are about to leave, Gibson discovers that the film has been replaced with dog feces, leading to a chase {{on the face of the}} mountain. While being chased, Lois slips but hangs on to George Washington's lips. Peter grabs her and, while being held at gunpoint, he tells Gibson that the film [...] "is in President Rushmore's mouth" [...] and points to the other side of the monument. Gibson follows Peter's direction and falls off the edge as Peter pulls Lois to safety. Upon climbing back to the top of the mountain, the two have sexual intercourse there, improving their marriage.|$|E
