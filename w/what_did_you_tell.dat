5000|$|The {{recording}} sessions, mainly {{supervised by}} veteran producers like Russ Titelman and Lenny Waronker, {{were said to}} be contentious. Wilson's collaborators reportedly clashed with Landy and his medical staff. As Paley expounds: [...] "The guy was saying something like, 'Brian, don’t you think the lyrics would be better if Alexandra fixed them?' And Brian said, 'No, I like them the way they are.' Then the guy’s like, 'Well, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me last night when I said you could have that milkshake if you switched the lyrics?' And then Brian said, 'Oh, okay. The new lyrics are better than the old ones.'" [...] Landy made repeated attempts to modify lyrics and arrangements by interrupting sessions, sometimes confiscating master tapes to assert his control. According to Paley [...] "Anything good we got out of those sessions was done totally on stolen time… Landy was always checking in, phoning in directions, basically never wanting to give Brian any breathing room. It was a hassle and many times heartbreaking because we’d do something good, finally, and then Landy would swoop in and dive-bomb it." ...|$|E
