Verrocchio never married, and had to provide financial support for some members of his family. He was at first apprenticed to a goldsmith. It {{has been suggested that}} he was later apprenticed to Donatello, but {{there is no evidence of}} this and John Pope-Hennessy considered that it is contradicted by the style of his early works.

His main works are dated in his last twenty years and his advancement owed much to the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici and his son Piero. His workshop was in Florence where he was a member of the Guild of St Luke. Several great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Lorenzo di Credi passed through his workshop as apprentices; beyond this, artists like Domenico Ghirlandaio, Francesco Botticini, and Pietro Perugino were also involved and their early works can be hard to distinguish from works by Verrocchio. At the end of his life he opened a new workshop in Venice where he was working on the statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni, leaving the Florentine <b>workshop</b> in <b>charge</b> of Lorenzo di Credi.

40|$|Introduction and {{background}} Primary producers play critical structural and functional roles in aquatic ecosystems; therefore, {{it is imperative}} that the potential risks of toxicants to aquatic plants are adequately assessed in the risk assessment of chemicals. The standard required macrophyte test species is the floating (non-sediment-rooted) duckweed Lemna spp. This macrophyte species might not be representative of all floating, rooted, emergent, and submerged macrophyte species because of differences in the duration and mode of exposure; sensitivity to the specific toxic mode of action of the chemical; and species-specific traits (e. g., duckweed's very short generation time). Discussion and perspectives These topics were addressed during the workshop entitled “Aquatic Macrophyte Risk Assessment for Pesticides” (AMRAP) where a risk assessment scheme for aquatic macrophytes was proposed. Four working groups evolved from this <b>workshop</b> and were <b>charged</b> with the task of developing Tier 1 and higher-tier aquatic macrophyte risk assessment procedures. Subsequently, a SETAC Advisory Group, the Macrophyte Ecotoxicology Group (AMEG) was formed as an umbrella organization for various macrophyte working groups. The purpose of AMEG is to provide scientifically based guidance in all aspects of aquatic macrophyte testing in the laboratory and field, including prospective as well as retrospective risk assessments for chemicals. As AMEG expands, it will begin to address new topics including bioremediation and sustainable management of aquatic macrophytes in the context of ecosystem services. ...|$|R

Surface properties of the adsorbent were studied using Fourier Transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectrometer. The linear form of langmuire and Freudlich models were applied to represent adsorption data. The calculated equilibrium data of Pb(II) were well fitted to both Langmuir and Freudlich isotherm models with maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of 50 mg/g. Two kinetic models were used to determine the adsorption mechanism and the kinetic data were correlated (R 2 = 0. 99) well with the pseudo second order kinetic model for the adsorption study of Pb(II) which implies that adsorption follows second order kinetics.

40|$|During {{the three-year}} funding period the author`s {{achievements}} {{can be summarized}} as follows: (1) The author has systematically studied the effect of phase modulation on bunch distribution. (2) The author has found that a frequently observed proton beam instability when the velocity of cooling electrons {{differs from that of}} protons is due to Hopf bifurcation. The equilibrium proton beam distribution becomes a limiting cycle attractor. This technique can be used to measure the temperature of cooling electrons. (3) The author has studied mechanisms of controlled bunch dilution. Evolution of beam bunch profile is measured while the beam is perturbed by the modulation of a secondary rf system. The experimental data reveal that mean square bunch length {sigma}{sup 2 }(t) exhibits two characteristic time scales. He finds that overlapping parametric resonances {{plays an important role in}} beam diffusion. (4) He has studied the effects of global chaos on the halo formation of space charge dominated beams. He has analyzed the halo produced by a modulating mismatched space charge dominated beam in a uniform focusing channel. He found that the halo formation is determined by a single scaling parameter, the space charge perveance parameter divided by the phase advance per unit length. The condition of global chaos can thus be predicted. In June 1994, Indiana University has served as the host of the USPAS (United States Particle Accelerator School).

40|$|This workshop’s {{long term}} {{goal is to}} foster a {{community}} of Information Systems researchers and practitioners {{who are interested in}} the socio-technical perspective and see it as an important approach to improve the quality and reduce the costs of the information systems that have become an essential part of our lives in this 21 st century. All communities need meeting places where they can discuss and debate existential issues. These workshop proceedings are the first attempt to set a broad platform for discussion and debate on the benefits and problems of viewing information systems as socio-technical artefacts. * In the first presentation session of the workshop, we look at education, tools and terminology. There are a number of questions asked and answered. Can we mix ethnographic educations with engineering education? What should be included in a good socio-technical analyst’s tools box? Are the terms that both practitioners and theoreticians use when discussing a socio-technical perspective correct or incorrect or are they just out of date for modern organizations and businesses? * In the second session, we have two papers that consider the socio-technical perspective as a collaborations and coordination constituent of a system. That is to say the socio-technical perspective is seen as an independent variable and the performance outcome of the work system in focus as the dependent variable. The third paper in this session views the topic from a work-system lens. * In the third session we asks more fundamental questions as to the nature of mind and organization of work. One paper questions whether the socio-technical perspective affects the mind or the mind is affected by the socio-technical perspective. * The last session of the workshop and the post session are called diverse issues and is designed to capture both the breadth and depth of socio-technical perspective. * All and all, these first workshop proceedings have hopefully set a good broad base for discussion and debate on the strength and weakness of a socio-technical perspective in the information systems research and teaching domain. * The organizers are grateful to the members of Program Committee for their excellent work of reviewing submitted papers in short time.

40|$|The {{research}} of the EBIT (Electron Beam Ion Trap) program in N Division of the Physics and Space Technology Directorate at LLNL continues to contribute significantly {{to the understanding of}} physical processes with low energy highly charged ions in atomic physics, plasma physics, and material science. Low-energy highly charged ions (up to U 92 +), provided by the EBIT facilities, provide a unique laboratory opportunity to study high field effects in atomic structures and dynamic interaction processes. The formation, existence, and structure of highly charged ions in astrophysical environments and laboratory plasmas make highly charged ions desirable for diagnosing various plasma conditions. The strong interaction of highly charged ions with matter and the response of solid surfaces make them a sensitive analysis tool and possibly a future capability for materials modifications at the atomic scale (nano technology). These physical applications require a good understanding and careful study of the dynamics of the interactions of the ions with complex systems. The EBIT group hosted an international conference and a <b>workshop</b> on trapped <b>charged</b> particles. The various talks and discussions showed that physics research with trapped charged particles is a very active and attractive area of innovative research, and provides a basis for research efforts in new areas. It also became obvious that the EBIT/RETRAP project has unique capabilities to perform important new experiments with trapped very highly charged ions at rest, which are complementary to and competitive with research at heavy ion storage rings and other trapping facilities planned or in operation in Europe, Japan, and the United States. Atomic structure research at EBIT provides ever better and more experimental complete benchmark data, supplying data needed to improve atomic theories. Research highlights through 1996 and 1997 include hyperfine structure measurements in H-like ions, QED studies, lifetime and polarization measurements on high-Z highly charged ions. Studies of the interaction of highly charged ions with solid surfaces and thin foil targets reveal new interaction phenomena. The measurements of high secondary ion sputter yields {{led to the development of}} a prototype electron/ion emission microscope, which allows simultaneous topographic and chemical composition analysis with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. The enabling technology to trap, confine, and cool hundreds of highly charged ions in a precision Penning trap has been established and first evidence for the formation of a strongly coupled highly charged ion plasma via a sympathetic laser/ion cooling scheme has been observed. The benefits to DOE programs for a continued long term EBIT program are evident. The program requires the application and development of state-of-the-art experimental techniques necessary for spectroscopy, ion confinement and manipulation with spin-off applications in other laboratory programs. Thus, it serves as an excellent training ground for young scientists who will later work on energy-related plasma research or similar areas. It promises new research results towards the growth of our understanding of basic physics phenomena in atomic, nuclear and plasma physics, such as solid phases, astrophysical plasma evolution, and quantum control. This reserach will also provide input for applications in areas like ion beam manipulation and control for materials research. The activities at EBIT have created great interest among scientists from other areas (e. g. biology and environmental sciences) with several new ideas and research directions emerging. External funding for the project has in part been provided by the DOE office of Basic Energy Science (Chemical Science Division) and by NASA...|$|R
