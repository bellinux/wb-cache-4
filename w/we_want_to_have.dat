He said at a press junket held by the Television Critics Association in July 2002 that [...] "We're just starting. We want to capitalise more {{on the fact that}} [...] is a sequel. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a season that maybe has more action in it than it had last season." [...] He predicted that possible storylines would include Jonathan Archer fulfilling more of his potential as Captain of the Enterprise, as well as further instalments in the Temporal Cold War story-arc and further interactions between the crew and both the Andorians and the Vulcans.|$|E
500|$|For {{its fourth}} album, Sleater-Kinney {{wanted to work}} with {{producer}} Roger Moutenot due to his textural work on Yo La Tengo's critically acclaimed 1997album I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One. This marked a change from regular producer John Goodmanson, who had recorded every previous Sleater-Kinney album. As Tucker explained, [...] "These songs warranted a different production, so we looked to other people". The band wanted to expand their sound and challenge themselves in new ways, stating that it was important for them not to make the same record twice. According to Tucker, [...] "We have to keep pushing in order to stay interested in making music together, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> longevity as a band". Similarly, drummer Janet Weiss stated that they [...] "wanted the record to sound different than Dig Me Out, to make each song have a real strong personality". The album was written {{over the course of a}} year, which was the longest period the band had spent on making an album. It was recorded at Avast! Recording Company in Seattle, Washington in July 1998.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scenes in}} Inside Man {{required}} multiple-camera setups, {{which meant that}} Libatique had to instruct and work with multiple camera operators. Lee {{wanted to create a}} visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control. Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, [...] "I said, 'We want {{to create a sense of}} control and largely centered frames with Clive’s character, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> movement with Denzel’s.' Having three operators on the same character, I’d watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady. It was the first time I’d worked with so many operators where I wasn’t one myself." [...] Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios. [...] Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses.|$|E

2500|$|The German {{ambassador}} to Israel, Andreas Michaelis, told Israeli lawmakers that Germany was working {{to resolve the}} issue and that it doesn't apply at a national level, but instead only to the local jurisdiction of the court in Cologne. The Council of the Coordination of Muslims in Germany condemned the ruling, stating that it is [...] "a serious attack on religious freedom." [...] Ali Kizilkaya, a spokesman of the council, stated that, [...] "The ruling does not take everything into account, religious practice concerning circumcision of young Muslims and Jews has been carried out over the millennia on a global level." [...] The Roman Catholic archbishop of Aachen, Heinrich Mussinghoff, said that the ruling was [...] "very surprising", and the contradiction between [...] "basic rights on freedom of religion and the well-being of the child brought up by the judges is not convincing in this very case." [...] Hans Ulrich Anke, the head of the Protestant Church in Germany, said the ruling should be appealed since it didn't [...] "sufficiently" [...] consider the religious significance of the rite. A spokesman, Steffen Seibert, for German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated that Jewish and Muslim communities will be free to practice circumcision responsibly, and the government would find a way around the local ban in Cologne. The spokesman stated [...] "For everyone in the government it is absolutely clear that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Jewish and Muslim religious life in Germany.

2500|$|Frequently in interviews, Maus {{advocates for}} [...] "truth" [...] in music. Flavorwires Tom Hawking argues that [...] "he's an {{interesting}} case because his music doesn’t necessarily discuss {{the ideas that}} seem to inform it" [...] unless one considers that the [...] "relative simplicity of his songs, both lyrically and musically, {{is a way of}} getting at fundamental truths." [...] Jordan Redmond of Tiny Mix Tapes writes that Maus [...] "bristles at the sort of obfuscated discourse often created and upheld by, as he would have it, the sophisticated and exclusionary contemporary art world," [...] and that rather than aspiring to be [...] "anti-intellectual," [...] his music [...] "only seeks to be the pinnacle of inclusion, and by embracing a form that has stroked the ears of the general populace {{for the better part of}} three decades, Maus looks to not only generate enjoyment but also discussion." [...] Slant Magazines Matthew Cole dismissed Maus' philosophical writings as [...] "a parody of post-structuralist social theory" [...] and his music as [...] "obviously some kind of art-school mindfuckery". According to Maus, he does not think about aesthetic theory when [...] "working over the keyboard, or musing over musical ideas in my head. But when discussing it, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some new thought about this new music. I wouldn't claim that my music is new, but generally speaking pop music begs for some kind of radical new way of talking about it."

2500|$|Guns N' Roses headlined the Friday {{night at}} Reading Festival 2010 and closed Leeds Festival two days later. Guns N' Roses was 58 minutes late {{coming on to}} the stage, and because of a curfew issued by Reading Council the band's set ended at midnight. The band was {{therefore}} not able to complete its set, but nevertheless attempted to play [...] "Paradise City" [...] without amplification while the audience sang along. Rose orchestrated fan frustration toward the organizers, telling fans that the group would not play at the Leeds Festival. However, two days later the band played the final night of the Leeds Festival, coming onto stage 30 minutes late, and cutting part of the encore, with Rose stating to the crowd, [...] "We come here to play for you but the cops and the promoters wanna fuck us in the ass. We would like to play a few more songs for you but we'll just play one." [...] During a concert on September 1, in Dublin, the band was over an hour late arriving on stage. Rose stopped the band {{in the middle of}} the second song, [...] "Welcome to the Jungle" [...] after multiple bottles were thrown on stage, warning the crowd [...] "One more bottle and we go home. It's up to you. We would like to stay. We want to stay. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some fun." [...] After another bottle was thrown, the band left the stage during the fourth song of the set. The band returned to the stage an hour later to finish the show.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2007, Jane's Information Group {{reported}} that the Typhoon was the favourite to win the contest for Japan's next-generation fighter requirement. The other competitors then were the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle. On 17 October 2007, Japanese Defence Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed that Japan may buy the Typhoon. Although the F-22 Raptor was in his words [...] "exceptional", it was not [...] "absolutely necessary for Japan", and the Typhoon was the best alternative. The F-22 is currently unavailable for export per US law. During a visit to Japan in June 2009, Andy Latham of BAE pointed out that while F-22 exports were restricted to keep advanced military technology from falling into the wrong hands, selling the Typhoon would take a [...] "no black box approach", that is that even licensed production and integration with Japanese equipment would not carry the risk of leakage of restricted military technology. In July 2010, it was {{reported that}} the Japan Air Self-Defense Force favoured acquiring the F-35 ahead of the Typhoon and the F/A-18E/F to fulfill its F-X requirement due to its stealth characteristics, but the Defense Ministry was delaying its budget request to evaluate when the F-35 would be produced and delivered. David Howell of the UK Foreign Office has suggested that Japan could partner with Britain in the continuing development of the Eurofighter. On 20 December 2011, the Japanese Government announced its intention to purchase 42 F-35s. The purchase decision was influenced by the F-35's stealth characteristics, with the Defence Minister Yasuo Ichikawa saying, [...] "There are changes in the security environment and the actions of various nations and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a fighter that has the capacity to cope".|$|E
