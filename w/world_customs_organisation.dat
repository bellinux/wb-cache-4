40|$|Interoperability between {{systems and}} {{adequate}} operational transparency may help stem {{some of the}} frustration of businesses dealing with customs. On the other hand, customs must remain vigilant to ensure security through tracking and tracing of goods to prevent disenfranchised individuals from {{taking advantage of the}} movement of objects between geographic boundaries. There are no easy “one shoe fits all” solutions to these problems. There is also room for debate regarding the depth to which customs should aspire to gain visibility of the supply chain. The investment necessary to gain visibility and transparency both in terms of cost as well as change management must be a collaborative venture between businesses and customs. Both parties must be equally determined to securely speed the operational efficiency. However, even for pre-agreed issues, the ability to generate a bird’s eye view of the process is plagued by the lack of interoperability between customs and business systems as well as country-specific rules.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{awareness}} of terror attacks has increased all over the world. The terror attack of September 11 th also put focus on security in the supply chains {{and a number of}} security initiatives were implemented for trade to and from the United States. Moreover, international organisations such as the <b>World</b> <b>Customs</b> <b>Organisation</b> (WCO) and the International Organisation of Standardisation (ISO) have strengthened the security issues in their agreements. It has become more important to increase security, not only against terrorism but also against smuggling and theft. Besides, the demand for transport is growing and it has put pressure on the transport providers. The challenge is therefore to increase security without disturbing the efficiency, or at least to create more secure supply chains without increasing the transport costs. The {{purpose of this study is}} to map one supply chain of containerised goods between China and Sweden, to identify possible problem areas regarding security and to analyse the impact the same would have on trade efficiency. The studied supply chain with a focus on security and efficiency consists of containerised flat painted glass for wardrobe doors from a manufacturer in China to a buyer in Sweden. The data is collected from all relevant actors in the supply chain; common to almost all of them is that they joined security initiatives because of market requirements and/or authority demands. The findings show that companies experience the effects of the implementation of security initiatives differently; for some of them it represents only an additional cost as well as longer lead-time, while some see this as a competitive advantage. However, there is a need for standardisation of security initiatives since there are too many different initiatives on the market today...|$|E

40|$|Agri-food Import and Export flows {{similarity}} between Italy and France - During {{the last twenty}} years world agri-food commerce shows an important growth owing to traded quantities increase and also to economic development of competitors on the world scene. This article is about agrifood commerce in European Union market. The aim of the paper is to compare the agri-food trade flows of Italy and France, two Mediterranean countries with very intense trade relations. For Italian agri-food system, in fact, France is the top import market and the second export market. On the basis of eurostat data, the paper focuses on import and export flows between Italy and the other European Union countries, on one side, and, on the other side, in the same way, between France and EU countries. The purpose is to value if - and at what extend - exchanged products are similar, to know if trade relationships between Italy and France are complementary rather then competitive. The first part of the paper consists of a brief introduction that is about the main trends of agrifood trade in the countries we examined. The most important data of agrifood balance are reported and discussed, and their trends examined over the period 1999 - 2006. The second part concerns more specifically the analysis of similarity. The analysis is based on three different kind of index: 1. the similarity and specialization indexes make possible the value the level of specialization and complementarity of Italy and France agri-food trade relations and their evolutional trend; 2. Finger-Kreinin and Hirshmann indexes measure structural changes in trade patterns over the period 1999 - 2006; 3. Balassa index gives information on compared advantages of competitors. As said above, we use eurostat external trade statistics, all data are related to intra European Union flows. In the database, for trade purposes, goods are classified according to Combined nomenclature in the European Union. The classification is based on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (hs) managed by the <b>World</b> <b>Customs</b> <b>Organisation</b> (wco); the hs uses a six digit numerical code for the coding of products. This article is part of a work in progress whose object is wider.

40|$|This note reviews US {{maritime}} security measures, outlines work {{carried out by}} international organisations and then frames {{maritime security}} within the wider context of maritime trade. Finally, it suggests {{the development of a}} Global Agreement linking security and other maritime trade-related issues. The initiative for such an agreement should be undertaken by the EU only if current International Maritime Organisation (IMO) efforts fail to produce a maritime security framework with binding requirements and after the wider impact of US security measures has been properly assessed (Flynn, 2002). The September 11 events have revealed the soft underbelly of globalisation. The liberalisation of markets and the resulting facilitation of trade and travel allow terrorists to do their worst. Existing border-management architectures provide no guarantees that terrorists can be prevented from reaching their targets. Furthermore, market pressures are now forcing transport companies to embrace higher standards and adopt technologies and processes that can make border control less relevant. Preoccupation with the urgency of domestic security issues has encouraged the US to develop security standards and urge {{the rest of the world}} to adopt their approach or to engage in direct negotiations with them. The US approach is two-fold: it is based on the early detection and interception of terrorists (by moving control away from borders to points-of-origin) who seek to exploit or target the international transport networks coupled with cooperation on data gathering and information sharing. fn 1 These two aspects have shaped US initiatives and legislations such as the Container Security Initiative (CSI) (US Customs 2002), the ‘Port and Maritime Security Act of 2001 ’ and the ‘Maritime Transportation Antiterrorism Act of 2002 ’. fn 2 These two legislative Acts and the CSI initiative aim at enhancing security, while at the same time furthering US strategic interests in security-related trade issues and strengthening the US maritime industry's position in order to make it more competitive (Lloyd's List, February 2002). There is a need to study the wider implications of US maritime security initiatives and assess US intentions within the context of international maritime trade. US-driven maritime security initiatives and the current fragmentation of efforts of international organisations such as IMO, <b>World</b> <b>Customs</b> <b>Organisation,</b> International Labour Organisation, and International Standards Organisation, if are not checked by the international maritime community (through a global agreement), may ultimately enable the US to impose its requirements on the rest of the world and affect the operations of international shipping. There is no doubt that current efforts to secure new maritime security consensus through the IMO is a step in the right direction. The amended Chapter XI of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention and the Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) although fundamental to a global security do not cover containers. However, given the multiplicity of actors involved, existing arrangements may not guarantee the required coordination in particular with the WCO. Furthermore, it is not certain that input from the various organisations with varying degrees of expertise will dovetail with IMO work already underway. In order to deal with the consequences and pitfalls of the US initiatives and cope with the fragmentation of international efforts, the development of a Global Agreement should be considered to weld all the stakeholders in a legally binding international framework. A Global Agreement may prove to be a much more cost-effective way of enhancing maritime security globally and restraining US ‘hegemonic’ ambitions and unilateralism in maritime trade.

40|$|The South African Revenue Service {{has since}} 2009 {{introduced}} “reference pricing” {{as a tool}} to detect undervaluation of customs values of imported clothing and textiles. The term “reference pricing” is not defined in the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 which is the legislation that governs the importation of goods into the Republic of South Africa. The mandate of the South African Revenue Service, amongst others, is to facilitate legitimate trade. By applying the reference pricing guidelines the South African Revenue Service will target all importers who declare customs values which are less than the reference price for a targeted tariff heading associated with an item of clothing or textile. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 is clear in that the transaction value which is the price paid or payable for the imported goods shall be the value used for customs duty purposes. The Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 also requires that the interpretation of the sections 65, 66 and 67 of the said Act shall be subject to the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (Valuation Agreement). Part I of the Valuation Agreement deals with the rules for customs valuation. Article 17 of part 1 allows for customs administrations to satisfy themselves as to the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented for customs valuation purposes. The Technical Committee on Customs Valuation of the World Trade Organisation decided the following in so far as Article 17 of the aforesaid agreement is concerned: “ 1. When a declaration has been presented and where the customs administration has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the particulars or of documents produced in support of this declaration, the customs administration may ask the importer to provide further explanation, including documents or other evidence, that the declared value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, [...] ” It would appear that the South African Revenue Service is using reference prices {{as a tool to}} support its reason for doubting the truth or accuracy of the declared customs values. The indiscriminate use of reference pricing, it is submitted, affects legitimate trade adversely. This treatise provides an understanding of how the customs value should be determined in terms of the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964 and the Valuation Agreement. It then provides a background to reference pricing and how reference pricing will be used to detect undervalued imports of clothing and textiles, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using reference pricing and a comparative analysis of the approach adopted by the Mexican Tax Administration Service in so far as the use of reference pricing is concerned. It was established that the reference price cannot replace the customs value of an imported clothing item as the customs value is based on the price actually paid or payable for it and not on some arbitrary or fictitious value. The reference price can only be used as a tool to identify importers that are possibly undervaluing the customs values. The disadvantages far outweigh the advantages of using reference pricing. The treatise further provides a background to the use of a valuation database as a risk assessment tool and compares this to the use of reference pricing. The use of reference pricing and its impact on trade facilitation is then discussed as well as whether the use of reference pricing is consistent with the risk management principles as discussed in the <b>World</b> <b>Customs</b> <b>Organisation</b> Risk Management Guide. It was established that the South African Revenue Service has not disclosed the basis of arriving at the reference price per tariff heading that it targets and the use of reference pricing is not sanctioned by any international guideline or agreement. It was also established that the use of reference pricing targets compliant importers unnecessarily and this practice goes against the principles of trade facilitation. The use of reference pricing can be used as a tool to detect undervalued imports of clothing but should not be used as a basis to stop every consignment of clothing simply because the customs value declared is less than the reference price. It should not be used as a stand-alone tool but rather enhanced further with the recommendations provided. In the final analysis, recommendations are provided which seek to enhance the reference pricing mechanism and to further identify and exclude compliant importers and limit the use of reference pricing to target non-compliant importers who undervalue the customs value of imported clothing and textile items...|$|E
