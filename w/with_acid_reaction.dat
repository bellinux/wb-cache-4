Ultisol contains {{a high concentration of}} Al at a level that can interfere plant growth. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of lime and crop residue composts application on the activities of exch-Al and the soybean yield. A greenhouse experiment using Vertic Hapludult from Gajrug, Banten was conducted in a completely randomized design. Liming treatments with 0. 0 and 20. 7 tons/ha (equals to 1 x exch-Al) were combined with the application of different crop residue compost from upland rice, corn, soybean and peanut. The dose of the compost at 0, 1 and 2 % organic-C. In this study, soybean was used as the indicator plant. The results of this experiment indicated that the application of lime equal 1 x exch-Al significantly decreased exch-Al and resulted in good plant growth and soybean yield. Application of different types of crop residue compost decreased exch-Al. On the unlimed and limed soils the application of upland rice residue compost at dose of 2 % organic-C (D 2) increased soybean yield (23. 21 g/pot and 25. 67 g/pot), 72. 53 % and 1. 87 % respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to search the {{evolution}} of the amino nitrogen (mg AN %) and nitrogen from aminoacids (g NAA %) in four fish species during 36 hours of slow thawing (at + 20 [...] + 22 °C) to see which species have a higher spoilage speed in this conditions. The biological material was represented by frozen fishes (Norwegian herring, mackerel and salmon, and Romanian trout) which were subjected to slow thawing at room temperature (+ 20 [...] + 22 °C), analyzing, at certain intervals, amino nitrogen (mg NA %), nitrogen from aminoacids (g NAA %) and pH values. The amino nitrogen was determined by the difference between the nitrogen content of volatile bases, and the nitrogen content of the ammonia and primary amines. The nitrogen from aminoacids was evaluated according to Sörensen method, based on blocking the amino group of the aminoacids with formaldehyde, forming methylene- derivatives <b>with</b> <b>acid</b> <b>reaction</b> which were determined titrimetrically, and the pH was determined with a digital pH-meter type Hanna. The evolution of nitrogen compounds in frozen fishes during 36 hours of thawing at + 20 [...] + 22 °C, has shown differences between these species. So, the amino nitrogen values have indicated: fresh fish at 3 hours of thawing, fish with relative freshness at 6 hours of thawing, with lower values (and close) in herring, mackerel and salmon, and much greater in trout; an altered state of all fishes after 9 hours of thawing. The evolution of nitrogen from aminoacids values during the thawing fish has highlighted the beginning of alteration: at 3 hours only in trout; at 6 hours in herring, salmon and trout, and after 9 hours in all examined fishes...|$|E

According to the acropetal coefficient N is accumulated mainly in the acorns, K – in the annual phytomass fractions and Ca – in the perennial fractions. The leaves and the acorns fraction accumulate Mn, and cupolas Fe. The litter – mulch coefficient vary from 1, 6 (Mn) to 4, 2 (Pb). The tendencies of Zn and Ca turnovers acceleration are discovered, while the turnover of more investigated elements is inhibited. The litter – mulch coefficient for Zn and Ca is 0, 8 and 1, 4 accordingly, i. е. corresponding to the intensive type of turnovers which is not typical for the broadleaved forest communities.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of isomeric benzothienopyran- 4 -ones has been investigated. 2 -Methoxybenzo[bthiophene {{has been used}} to prepare 2, 2 -dimethyl- 2, 3 -dihydrobenzothieno[2, 3 -b] pyran- 4 -one via acylation with 3, 3 -dimethylacryloyl chloride. 2 -Acetyl- 3 -hydroxybenzo[bjthiophene, readily available in a single step from thiosalicylic acid, {{has been used to}} obtain a range of 2, 2 -disubstituted 2, 3 -dihydrobenzothieno[3, 2 -bjpyran- 4 -ones by direct condensation with an aliphatic or alicyclic ketone under pyrrolidine catalysis. A greatly improved route was developed which relied upon formation of the dianion of 2 -acetyl- 3 -hydroxybenzo[b]thiophene. The dianion was intercepted {{with a wide range of}} ketones to give the corresponding / 3 -hydroxy ketones. Cyclisation to the benzothieno[3, 2 -b]pyranones results on treatment <b>with</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Reaction</b> of the dianion with tetraphenylcyclopentadienone gave a fulvene derivative that was resistant to cyclisation. With 2, 5 -diethyl- 3, 4 -diphenylcyclopentadienone, stereospecific 1, 6 -addition occurred. The structure of the product was elucidated using X-ray crystallography. Reduction of the benzothienopyranones follows the expected course, as does their reaction with Grignard reagents. However, with PhMgBr, 2, 2 -diphenyl- 3 -methyl- 2, 3 -dihydrobenzothieno[3, 2 -b]pyran- 4 -one underwent a novel reaction sequence to give a 3 -phenylbenzo[b]thiophene derivative, the structure of which was established by X-ray crystallography. The benzothienopyranones are readily cleaved by alkoxide under mild conditions. Reactions of the resulting 2 -alkenoyl- 3 - hydroxybenzo[b] thiophenes with hydrazine derivatives afford novel pyrazolidines. The preparation of 2, 2 -disubstituted benzothieno[2, 3 -b]- and [3, 2 -b]- pyrans has been investigated. The [2, 3 -b] isomers exist preferentially as their dienone valence tautomers. In the latter series, the pyran form predominates and the compounds exhibit photochromism providing that an aryl substituent is present at C- 4. Attempts to effect acid catalysed dehydration of the benzothieno[3, 2 -b]pyran- 4 -ols failed. However, treatment with N,N-dimethylcarbamyl chloride effects a novel acylative ring cleavage to give 2 -(alka- 1, 3 -dien- I -yl) - 3 (dimethylaminocarbamyloxy) benzo[b]thiophenes. Electrocyclisation of these carbamates has been accomplished and developed as a new approach to dibenzothiophenes and fused-ring derivatives. The {{synthesis of}} chroman- 4 -ones possessing C- 2 spiro-annulated 9 -(9 Hfluorene), 1 '-indane, 3 '-(2, 3 -dihydrobenzofuran), and 3 '-(2, 3 -dihydrobenzo-[b]thiophene) units has been accomplished and their oxidative ring expansion by organoiodine(Ill) reagents e. g. PhI(OH) OTs has been investigated. The indane derivative afforded 1 2 H-benzo[a]xanthen- 12 -one and its 5, 6 -dihydro derivative together with 5, 6 -dihydro- 7 H-benzo[c]xanthen- 7 -one, whilst the benzofuran affords a ring cleaved product together with the tetracyclic rotenoid core, rotoxen- 12 (611) -one. Conjugate reduction of these systems provided both the cis and trans tetrahydrobenzoxanthones, and the trans-B/C fused rotenoid, respectively. Treatment of the spiro benzo[b]thiophene derivative with PhI(OH) OTs in methanol initiated a novel Pummerer-type reaction and rearrangement products were not observed...|$|E
