The MCCR {{was formed in}} 1958 {{by a group of}} Memphis city leaders, with a goal of ending segregation in a non-violent way. Individual committees worked to desegregate various public facilities in Memphis. The MCCR also worked to get blacks representation in government (both elected and appointed officials), and created programs to improve economic conditions and job opportunities for blacks. Wax served as the MCCR's secretary from its formation until its dissolution in the 1970s. Several other Temple Israel members worked with the MCCR, and, as owners of large Memphis companies, were able to implement desegregation in their own workplaces. Other Temple Israel members supported the civil rights movement: senior business executives convinced stores to hire black salespeople, Herschel Feibelman chaired the Memphis <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Poverty</b> Committee, and Marvin Ratner left a partnership at a prominent local law firm to form, along with two white and two black lawyers, Memphis's first integrated law firm.|$|E

50|$|Many {{observers}} {{point out}} that the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Poverty's</b> attention to Black America created the grounds for the backlash that began in the 1970s. The perception by the white middle class that it was footing the bill for ever-increasing services to the poor led to diminished support for welfare state programs, especially those that targeted specific groups and neighborhoods. Many whites viewed Great Society programs as supporting the economic and social needs of low-income urban minorities; they lost sympathy, especially as the economy declined during the 1970s.|$|R

40|$|In the {{references}} invoked {{by a large}} number of social projects to achieve their goals, one can find rights and justice as central discursive units in a frequently recurring thought model. In several of these projects the result, time after time, is lack of success. But the same right thought model continues to be taken for granted as a point of departure. The repeated <b>wars</b> <b>on</b> <b>poverty</b> in the USA exemplify this kind of project. There may be several factors that render these projects unable to achieve the goal: obstructive bureaucracy, incompetence, unfavourable economic circumstances, and the complexity of political processes. But these factors belong to the realization phase, which ignores the repeated use of the same right thought model in which I am interested. I have studied a conceivable implementation problem which can be found before the application starts. The aim of this dissertation has been to analyse what rights and justice, as central discursive units in a repeated thought model, can entail for the potential to achieve the goal/the improved state in social projects. The dissertation is characterized by exposition of concepts and problematization of different ways of thinking. I have used a philosophical and a social-science perspective. The methodological design is textual analysis. My analysis shows that rights and justice have a structure made up of two components: a supra-individual meaning which comprises transhistorical basic assumptions and a negotiable meaning which is established through normative discussions. It is the unit's own built-in basic assumptions that I have pinpointed in order to find out what these can bring out in social projects. I have analysed the type of rights and justice that occur in the projects to which I refer: civil rights and social justice. The conclusion is that rights and justice bring effective opportunities but can also impede and even counteract the reformer's aim even before the project starts. Rights and justice rest on basic assumptions which generate precisely the kind of problems that social projects are intended to overcome. One can happen to bring out what one wants to get rid of, regardless of one's own working method and irrespective of organizational, political, and economic circumstances. The practical usefulness of the results have been discussed primarily in relation to the practice of social work...|$|R

Moynihan later became known as a noted U.S. Senator from New York. In addition, Mitchell defended the State of Israel during its war of 1967 against Arab states and was criticized by some.

25|$|The new {{president}} thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy's primary legislative goals—a tax cut. Johnson {{worked closely with}} Harry F.

Congressional approval followed at the end of February, and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights. In late 1963 Johnson also launched the initial offensive of his <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Poverty,</b> recruiting Kennedy relative Sargent Shriver, then head of the Peace Corps, to spearhead the effort. In March 1964, LBJ sent to Congress the Economic Opportunity Act, which created the Job Corps and the Community Action Program, designed to attack poverty locally. The act also created VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps.|$|E

The full chronology of the creation of the poem is unclear, but consensus is that Stanford worked on the manuscript sporadically over many years until late 1974 or 1975, by which time the book was finished.|$|E

Indeed, his heart was on his Great Society agenda, and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Poverty.</b> The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional Viet Minh attacks on US ships in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as an attack on Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam.

25|$|Government {{safety net}} {{programs}} {{put in place}} since the <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Poverty</b> have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself {{has done little to}} reduce poverty. According to the 2013 Columbia University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty, without such programs the poverty rate would be 29% today. An analysis of the study by Kevin Drum suggests the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the elderly but provides relatively little assistance to the working-age poor. A 2014 study by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that without social programs like food stamps, social security and the federal EITC, the poverty rate in the U.S. would be much higher. Nevertheless, the U.S. has the weakest social safety net of all developed nations. Sociologist Monica Prasad of Northwestern University argues that this developed because of government intervention rather than lack of it, which pushed consumer credit for meeting citizens' needs rather than applying social welfare policies as in Europe.|$|E

Thomas Merton lived most of his life and wrote most of his books during his time as a monk at the Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani near Bardstown, Kentucky. Hunter S.
