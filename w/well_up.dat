5|$|US 131 {{was moved}} to its freeway north of Grand Rapids in 1969. The Northland Drive segment of US131/M-44 was redesignated as only M-44, and the Plainfield Avenue segment became Conn. M-44. M-37 was rerouted as <b>well</b> <b>up</b> East Beltline from M-11 {{concurrently}} with M-44 to I-96. In 1977, this junction at I-96 became the official western terminus of M-44, with the M-44 signs along East Beltline Avenue removed. Then in 2003, the signs along the East Beltline were restored and the route extended back to its former terminus.|$|E
25|$|Clergy were {{deprived}} of any social security rights as <b>well.</b> <b>Up</b> until 1929, the Church could insure their clergy {{for medical care}} and for pension by paying required sums, but after this date all such sums were to be kept {{by the state and}} no insurance or pension would be issued including to clergy who were already retired. This caused clergy to be only served by doctors who could charge as much as they wanted.|$|E
25|$|Global exit {{activity}} totalled $252bn in 2011, practically unchanged {{from the}} previous year, but <b>well</b> <b>up</b> on 2008 and 2009 as private equity firms sought {{to take advantage of}} improved market conditions {{at the start of the}} year to realise investments. Exit activity however, has lost momentum following a peak of $113bn in the second quarter of 2011. TheCityUK estimates total exit activity of some $100bn in the first half of 2012, well down on the same period in the previous year.|$|E

25|$|The RAAF had not {{performed}} <b>well</b> <b>up</b> {{until this}} time, with {{their involvement in}} the Far East campaign consisting {{of a series of}} devastatingly quick defeats, and a humiliating flight down the Malay Peninsula to Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies before final defeat or capture. On the 19 February 1942 the Japanese bombed Darwin, and the Darwin Air Station was not well prepared. Several Australian and American aircraft were destroyed on the ground or shot down, and large numbers of the RAAF deserted their posts with 278 personnel still missing four days after the attack.|$|E
25|$|During a {{long and}} varied career, Patsy Burt won many British national-level competitions, {{and was the first}} female driver ever to win the Brighton Speed Trials and the RAC National Sprint Championship. Her run at Brighton in 1968 set a new {{outright}} course record, which went unbeaten until 1975. She was also, in 1961, the first British driver of either sex to participate in a full season of the European Mountain Championship. For nearly three decades, Patsy Burt's powder-blue racing cars were a familiar sight, usually placed <b>well</b> <b>up</b> the leader board, at most British hillclimb and sprint races.|$|E
25|$|Gervas's second {{marriage}} was to Elspeth Grant (19071997) in 1931; {{she had grown}} up in Kenya and was a friend of Joy Adamson. After the marriage she wrote White man's country: Lord Delamere and the Making of Kenya. Her life and work are the subject of a 2002 biography. As an author, Elspeth Huxley was <b>well</b> <b>up</b> to Huxley standards, {{and one of the few}} wives who was better-known than her husband. The Flame Trees of Thika (1959) was perhaps the most celebrated of her thirty books; it was later adapted for television. They had one son, Charles (19442015).|$|E

25|$|As with orientation, {{movement}} arrows distinguish two planes: Movement in {{the vertical}} plane (up & down) {{is represented by}} arrows with double stems, as {{at the bottom of}} the diagram at left, while single-stemmed arrows represent movement parallel to the floor (to & fro). In addition, movement in a diagonal plane uses modified double-stemmed arrows: A cross bar on the stem indicates that the motion is away as <b>well</b> <b>up</b> or down, and a solid dot indicates approaching motion. To & fro movement that also goes over or under something uses modified single-stemmed arrows, with the part of the arrow representing near motion thicker than the rest. These are iconic, but conventionalized, and so need to be learned individually.|$|E
25|$|John Moss {{was taken}} as umpire and also played in some minor matches. None of the players {{had been in the}} earlier touring sides to the West Indies. The {{inclusion}} of the two professionals considerably strengthened the team. Thompson had played for Northamptonshire in 1904, their last season as a minor county. He was, however, <b>well</b> <b>up</b> to first class standard. The amateurs were of mixed standard, including a number of useful players like Simpson-Hayward, Somerset and Wynyard together with a number of borderline first class standard including the captain himself. G. Bellamy accompanied the team as scorer and played in a first class match against Jamaica. S. Beton played in a minor match.|$|E
25|$|New England {{was good}} on defense as <b>well.</b> <b>Up</b> front, linemen Bobby Hamilton (7 sacks, 1 fumble recovery) and rookie Richard Seymour excelled at {{pressuring}} quarterbacks and stuffing the run. Behind them, the Patriots had three outstanding linebackers: Mike Vrabel (2 interceptions, 3 sacks), Willie McGinest (5 sacks), and Tedy Bruschi (2 interceptions). The secondary also featured outstanding talent such as defensive back Otis Smith, {{who led the}} team with 5 interceptions for 181 yards and 2 touchdowns. Cornerback Ty Law intercepted 3 passes, returning them for 91 yards and 2 touchdowns. Safety Lawyer Milloy had 2 interceptions during the season, and was selected along with Law to represent the New England defense in the Pro Bowl. The defense ended the season ranked 6th in scoring, but 24th in total yards allowed.|$|E

25|$|In Formula Two, Regazzoni {{had found}} the ideal partner in Tecno. His hard-charging style {{perfectly}} matched the forward thinking Tecno ambitions, and Regazzoni quickly developed {{a reputation as a}} tough competitor. Regazzoni was implicated in the death of young British driver Chris Lambert at the 1968 Formula Two Dutch Grand Prix. Some observers accused Regazzoni, who was running <b>well</b> <b>up</b> the field, of deliberately running Lambert's Brabham off the track while lapping him. Lambert lost control and crashed into a bridge. Regazzoni was fully exonerated at the subsequent inquest, although rumours persisted for many years afterward. Lambert's father pursued a private action against Regazzoni, which dragged on for five years before finally being abandoned. Regazzoni remained with Tecno throughout his three years in Formula Two (although he drove most of the 1969 season for the Ferrari Formula Two team.) and in 1970 they took the European Formula Two Championship together.|$|E
25|$|Following dredging, {{in areas}} of the canal where {{contamination}} has permeated the underlying sediment, EPA will cap with multiple layers of clean material. The multi-layer cap consists of an “active” layer made of a specific type of clay that will remove contamination that could <b>well</b> <b>up</b> from below, an “isolation” layer of sand and gravel that will ensure that the contaminants are not exposed, and an “armor” layer of heavier gravel and stone to prevent erosion of the underlying layers from boat traffic and canal currents. Finally, sufficient clean sand will be placed on top of the “armor” layer to fill in the voids between the stones and to establish sufficient depth in order to restore the canal bottom as a habitat. In the middle and upper segment of the canal where the native sediment is contaminated with liquid coal tar, the EPA will stabilize that sediment by mixing it with concrete or similar materials. The stabilized areas will then be covered with the multiple layer cap as described above.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, Portugal {{joined in}} the Revolutionary Wars, when it sent an expeditionary army to aid Spain against the Revolutionary French in the War of the Pyrenees (Roussillon campaign). However, Spain made a {{separate}} peace with France and turned itself against Portugal. In 1801, the Spanish Army invaded Portugal with the aid of France, with the Portuguese Army facing the invaders in the War of Oranges. The refusal from Portugal to antagonize Britain, its old ally, and to adhere to the Continental System, led {{to the start of the}} Peninsular War, with the French Army invading Portugal in 1807. The French invasion obliged the strategic transference of the Portuguese Crown to Brazil and put the Portuguese Army in disarray. Under French occupation, the Army was disbanded and its most important units are integrated in the Portuguese Legion raised by order of Napoleon and that would fight for him in the campaigns of Germany, Austria and Russia. Reconstituted and integrated in the Anglo-Portuguese Army, led by the British General Arthur Wellesley, the Portuguese Army performed well in the remainder of the Peninsular War. The first major battle of the Anglo-Portuguese Army was the Battle of Bussaco in 1810, the success of which gave the inexperienced troops confidence in their abilities. The infantry and artillery went on to perform <b>well</b> <b>up</b> until the final Battle of Toulouse in 1814 when news arrived of Napoleon's abdication.|$|E

500|$|Asplenium bradleyi {{is a small}} fern {{with dark}} green, pinnate-pinnatifid to bipinnate fronds. These form evergreen, {{perennial}} tufts. Notable characteristics are the dark stem, whose color extends <b>well</b> <b>up</b> the axis of the leaf blade, a deeply cut [...] lobe or pinnule {{at the base of}} each pinna, and toothed pinna edges. However, some of these characteristics are variable, and may not be observed in all individuals of A.bradleyi. Some specimens have rounded, rather than toothed edges and others lack dark coloration throughout most of the stem. The fronds are monomorphic, the sterile and fertile fronds appearing the same size and shape.|$|E

George's date Carol (Tory Polone) asks George to come up to her place for some coffee, but George tells her that he can't drink coffee at night because it [...] "keeps [...] up". Once she leaves his car he realizes he made a mistake, as [...] "coffee" [...] is a {{euphemism}} for sex. Jerry's date Donna (Gretchen German) remarks that she likes a cotton Dockers commercial that Jerry absolutely hates, and with that ends his interest in her.|$|E

500|$|Matthew Uffindell of Crash {{praised the}} game overall, despite {{thinking}} it was overshadowed by Ultimate's Tranz Am, which was bundled with Cookie during its initial release. Uffindell stated the gameplay was addictive and challenging, despite {{thinking it was}} similar to its predecessor, Pssst. Lloyd Mangram of Crash considered the game to be overlooked and underrated, despite him suggesting {{that it was the}} most difficult of all games developed by Ultimate. Mangram praised the graphics as detailed, fast and [...] "amusing", owing to the game's sentient ingredients. Reviewers of Home Computing Weekly similarly praised the graphics and sound, stating that they [...] "are <b>well</b> <b>up</b> to Ultimate's standards".|$|E
500|$|The Scottish Terrier is a small, compact, short-legged, sturdily-built terrier of good {{bone and}} substance. They have a hard, wiry, {{weather-resistant}} {{coat and a}} thick-set, cobby body which is hung between short, heavy legs. These characteristics, joined with his very special keen, piercing, [...] "varminty" [...] expression, and his erect ears and tail are salient features of the breed. The Scottish Terrier's bold, confident, dignified aspect exemplifies power in a small package. The eyes should be small, bright and piercing, and almond-shaped not round. The color should be dark brown or nearly black, the darker the better. The ears should be small, prick, set <b>well</b> <b>up</b> on the skull and pointed, but never cut. They should be covered with short velvety hair.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 17, 1911. The film received favorable reviews from Billboard, The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. Billboard would write, [...] "The adventures of the unfortunate Bertie are such as will make the usual motion picture audience chuckle with appreciation. The film is, of course, a farce essentially. The photography is <b>well</b> <b>up</b> to the Thanhouser standard." [...] Walton of the Moving Picture News, would quip, [...] "This beats the brainstorm in Les Miserables. It is a Doré nightmare." [...] The comedic farce of the dim-witted fop proved to be successful if ultimately singular release of an expected series of films. The film is presumed lost because the film is not known {{to be held in}} any archive or by any collector.|$|E
