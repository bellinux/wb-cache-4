5|$|Although {{the civil}} war was over, Gia Long decided {{to add to the}} two citadels that had been built under the {{supervision}} of French officers. Gia Long was convinced of their effectiveness and during his 18-year reign, a further 11 citadels <b>were</b> <b>built</b> throughout the country. The majority <b>were</b> <b>built</b> in the Vauban style, with pentagonal or hexagonal geometry, while a minority, including the one in Huế, <b>were</b> <b>built</b> in a four-sided traditional Chinese design. The fortresses <b>were</b> <b>built</b> at Vinh, Thanh Hóa, Bắc Ninh, Hà Tĩnh, Thái Nguyên and Hải Dương in the north, Huế, Quảng Ngãi, Khánh Hòa and Bình Định in the centre, and Vĩnh Long in the Mekong Delta. Construction was at its most intense in the early phase of Gia Long's reignonly one of the 11 <b>were</b> <b>built</b> {{in the last six years}} of his rule. De Puymanel and Lebrun left Vietnam before the end of the war, so the forts were designed by Vietnamese engineers who oversaw the construction. The position of Citadel Supervision Officer was created under the Ministry of War and made responsible for the work, underlining the importance that Gia Long placed on fortifications. Gia Long's fortifications program was marred by accusations that the people labored all day and part of the night in all weather conditions, and that as a direct consequence, land went fallow. Complaints of mandarin corruption and oppressive taxation were often levelled at his government. Following his coronation, Gia Long drastically reduced his naval fleet and by the 1810s, only two of the European-style vessels were still in service. The downsizing of the navy was mainly attributed to budgetary constraints caused by heavy spending on fortifications and transport infrastructure such as roads, dykes and canals. However, in 1819, a new phase of shipbuilding was launched, with Gia Long personally supervising the dockyards.|$|E
