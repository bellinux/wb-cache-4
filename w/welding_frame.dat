40|$|Abstract. The {{buckling}} {{resistance of}} orthogonally stiffened cylinders is investigated for elastic critical buckling and non-linear elasto-plastic buckling tests. The effects of residual stresses arising from cold forming the cylinder and <b>welding</b> <b>frame</b> components are {{considered in the}} analysis of two stiffened cylinder models with similar material weights and different geometric spacings. A static axial load is applied to the models to represent loading from the supported structure followed by a non-linear elasto-plastic buckling step representing a wave loading combined with hydrostatic pressure, producing large displacement compartment buckling. Residual stress is shown to cause a reduction in buckling resistance of approximately 25 % in the stiffened cylinder segments. 1...|$|E

The press machine chamber is made of stainless steel, because of food (dough) processing. But the strengthened part of the press machine consists of a carbon steel frame with a hydraulic cylinder.

Based on the UIC 615 - 4 (Motive power units- Bogies and running gear-Bogie frame structure strength tests) and IIW standard (Recommendations for fatigue design standard of welded joints and components-IIW document XIII- 1965 - 03 / XV- 1127 - 03), fatigue test process of bogie frame is simulated by means of finite element method. Using Miner cumulative damage theory, {{on the basis of}} IIW welded joints S-N data, fatigue life of the <b>welded</b> <b>frame</b> is predicted, and the virtual fatigue test of <b>welded</b> <b>frame</b> is completed.

Before manufacturing a product the demands for finite element model is more between the manufacturers.

40|$|Detection of a {{fatigue crack}} in a <b>welded</b> <b>frame</b> {{structure}} 2 ̆ 7 is studied {{in this paper}} using coupled response measurements. Similarity to real engineering structures is maintained in the fabrication of the test frame with hollow section chords and branch members. The fatigue crack was created by a special reciprocating mechanism that generates cyclic stress on a beam member of the structure. The methodology of coupled response measurements is first demonstrated on a single hollow section beam by analytical simulation and experimental validation. The issues of using this approach for fatigue crack detection in real structures are then examined. Finally, the experimental results of the frame under different scenarioes are presented. The existence of the crack is clearly observable from the FRF plots. It is suggested that this approach offers the potential to detect cracks in <b>welded</b> <b>frame</b> structures and is {{a useful tool for}} routine maintenance work and health assessment...|$|R

It is more labor-intensive, and consequently {{is less likely to}} be used for production frames. As with TIG <b>welding,</b> Fillet <b>frame</b> tubes are precisely notched or mitered and then a fillet of brass is brazed onto the joint, similar to the lugged construction process.

Simulation of the welding process with thermal and mechanical analysis was prepared by means of welding GUI implemented in LS-PrePost. The welding simulation is a computer intensive operation with high CPU time.
