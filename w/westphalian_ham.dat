6000|$|Mrs. March {{had decided}} not to go to the Posthof for breakfast, where they had already taken a lavish leave of the 'schone' Lili, with a sense of being {{promptly}} superseded in her affections. They found a place in the red-table-cloth end of the pavilion at Pupp's, and were served by the pretty girl with the rose-bud mouth whom they had known only as Ein-und-Zwanzig, and whose promise of [...] "Komm' gleich, bitte schon!" [...] was like a bird's note. Never had the coffee been so good, the bread so aerially light, the <b>Westphalian</b> <b>ham</b> so tenderly pink. A young married couple whom they knew came by, arm in arm, in their morning walk, and sat down with them, like their own youth, for a moment.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the meat}} market's {{popularity}} grew, it expanded its storefront {{and participated in}} sponsoring local events including the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. By 1900, the company had 43 employees and Chicago-wide delivery service. In 1904, Oscar Mayer began branding its meats to capitalize on their popularity, beginning an industry-wide trend. Early company specialties were [...] "Old World" [...] sausages and <b>Westphalian</b> <b>hams,</b> soon followed by bacon and wieners. In 1906, Oscar Mayer & Co. {{was among the first}} to volunteer to join the newly created federal meat inspection program. In 1919, the company made its first major expansion, with the purchase of a processing plant in Madison, Wisconsin. The plant quickly proved to be a profitable, efficient operation and in 1919 Madison became the corporate headquarters.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{sat down}} to a poorly-equipped luncheon-table on board the Austro-Orient liner Franz Joseph, I mourned in my heart (and I may say {{incidentally}} in other portions of my internal economy) the comfort and gastronomic luxury of the King and Emperor Hotel at Trieste. A brief comparison between the menus of to-day's lunch and yesterday's will afford to the reader a striking object-lesson: Trieste. [...] Steamer. Eggs a la cocotte. [...] Scrambled eggs on toast. Stewed chicken, with paprika. [...] Cold chicken. Devilled slices of <b>Westphalian</b> [...] Cold <b>ham.</b> ham (boiled in wine). Tunny fish, pickled. [...] Bismarck herrings. Rice, burst in cream. [...] Stewed apples. Guava jelly. [...] Swiss cheese. Consequence: Yesterday I was well and happy, and looked forward to a good night's sleep, which came off. To-day I am dull and heavy, also restless, and I am convinced that at sleeping-time my liver will have it all its own way.|$|R

50|$|<b>Westphalian</b> <b>ham</b> (German: Westfälischer Schinken) is a ham {{produced}} from acorn-fed pigs {{raised in the}} forests of Westphalia, Germany. The resulting meat is dry cured and then smoked over a mixture of beechwood and juniper branches.|$|E
5000|$|Ham is pork {{that has}} been {{preserved}} through salting, smoking, or wet curing. It was traditionally made only from the hind leg of swine, and referred to that specific cut of pork. Ham is made around the world, including a number of highly coveted regional specialties, such as <b>Westphalian</b> <b>ham</b> and some varieties of Spanish jamón. Technically a processed meat, [...] "ham" [...] may refer to a product which has been through mechanical re-forming.|$|E
50|$|Beech wood is an {{excellent}} firewood, easily split and burning for many hours with bright but calm flames. Slats of beech wood are washed in caustic soda to leach out any flavor or aroma characteristics and are spread around the bottom of fermentation tanks for Budweiser beer. This provides a complex surface on which the yeast can settle, {{so that it does}} not pile up, preventing yeast autolysis which would contribute off-flavors to the beer. Beech logs are burned to dry the malt used in some German smoked beers, giving the beers their typical flavour. Beech is also used to smoke <b>Westphalian</b> <b>ham,</b> various sausages, and some cheeses.|$|E
