5|$|Although {{his career}} as an artist was fleeting, Gibson's career as a patron and lover of art was lifelong. In the 1950s and 1960s Gibson made major {{contributions}} to the arts in Australia, both as a collector and a patron of arts organisations. He acquired the works of some of Australia's most highly regarded artists, such as Russell Drysdale, Albert Tucker and John Brack. Other artists <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> in his collection included Noel Counihan, John Passmore, Clifton Pugh and Clive Stephen.|$|E
5|$|Antananarivo was {{historically}} {{the capital}} of the Merina people, who continue to form the majority of the city's estimated 1,300,000 (2013) inhabitants, as well as the surrounding urban areas which in all have a total metropolitan population approaching three million. All 18 Malagasy ethnic groups, as well as residents of Chinese, Indian, European and other origins, are <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> in the city.|$|E
5|$|Bronze age {{archaeology}} is to {{be found}} in abundance in the surrounding area. Examples include the short-cist burials found near West Newbigging, about a mile to the North of the town. These burials included pottery urns, a pair of silver discs and a gold armlet. Iron Age archaeology is also <b>well</b> <b>represented,</b> for example in the souterrain nearby Warddykes Cemetery and at West Grange of Conan, as well as the better-known examples at Carlungie and Ardestie.|$|E

One example is a Quranic page of North African origin written with gold lettering in the Kufic script – {{it is more than}} 1,000 years old. Prince Sadruddin's Persian roots are <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> in calligraphic as well as pictoral specimens reflecting a range of periods and dynastic patrons. Also included are several examples of Ottoman callgraphies, manuscripts and paintings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{a number of}} {{additional}} styles developed from the already eclectic base of industrial music. These offshoots include fusions with noise music, ambient music, folk music, post-punk and electronic dance music, {{as well as other}} mutations and developments. The scene has spread worldwide, and is particularly <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> in North America, Europe, and Japan. Post-industrial subgenres include dark ambient, power electronics, Japanoise, neofolk, electro-industrial, electronic body music, industrial hip hop, industrial rock, industrial metal, industrial pop, martial industrial, power noise, and witch house.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon {{species are}} {{extremely}} <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> in the fossil record, allowing for {{detailed descriptions of}} their anatomy and analysis of their life history. Over 1,000 specimens have been identified, though less than half are complete enough to give researchers good information on the anatomy of the animal. Still, this is more fossil material than is known for any other pterosaur, and it includes {{both male and female}} specimens of various age groups and, possibly, species.|$|E

They are first known to occur in the Cretaceous period, the earliest being the Hesperornithiformes, like Hesperornis regalis, a flightless loon-like seabird that could dive in a fashion similar to grebes and loons (using its feet to move underwater) but had a beak filled with sharp teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{second reason}} the {{district}} is significant is its collection of buildings and their architectural styles (Criterion C). Most of these buildings were constructed during the Indiana Gas Boom in the late 19th century or early 20th century, and have many of their original features. Three styles of architecture, Italianate, Renaissance Revival, and Romanesque Revival are all <b>well</b> <b>represented,</b> and additional styles can also be found.|$|E
5|$|The swans, {{ducks and}} geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic {{existence}} with webbed feet and bills which are flattened {{to a greater or}} lesser extent. In many ducks the male is colourful while the female is dull brown. The diet consists of a variety of animals and plants. The family is <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> in the counties, especially in winter when large numbers visit from further north.|$|E

The surface outside the well is shown as relatively flat to represent the heterogeneity of the random coil state. The theory's name derives from an analogy between the shape of the well and a physical funnel, in which dispersed liquid is concentrated into a single narrow area.|$|R
5|$|This {{is a list}} of the mammal species {{recorded}} in Canada. There are approximately 200 mammal species native to Canada. Its large territorial size and variety of ecosystems, ranging from mountains to plains to urban housing, mean that Canada can harbour a great variety of species, including nearly half of the known cetaceans. The most <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> order is that of the rodents, and the smallest that of the Didelphimorphia (common opossums).|$|E
5|$|Walton and Ivythorn Hills {{are covered}} {{by a variety of}} {{semi-natural}} habitats. These include unimproved calcareous grassland, scrubland and coppiced woodland including field maple and Ash. The range of habitats are home to many species of invertebrate. Butterflies, Leafhoppers, Spiders and Soldier Flies are particularly <b>well</b> <b>represented.</b> There is also a population of Great Green Bush Cricket (Tettigonia viridissima).|$|E
5|$|Although far rarer {{than their}} prank cousins, {{exploding}} cigars {{used as a}} means to kill or attempt to kill targets in real life has been claimed, and is <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> as a fictional plot device. The most famous case concerning the intentionally deadly variety was an alleged plot by the CIA of the US in the 1960s to assassinate Fidel Castro. Notable real-life incidents involving the non-lethal ilk include an exploding cigar purportedly given by Ulysses S. Grant to an acquaintance and a dust-up between Turkish military officers and Ernest Hemingway after he pranked one of them with an exploding cigar.|$|E

5|$|As {{the first}} group of Chinese people to settle in large numbers, the Hokkien of {{southern}} Fujian became the dominant immigrant group until the middle of the 19th century. Their maritime-mercantile culture comes from their trade occupations whilst in Indonesia. Descendants of Hokkiens are the dominant group in eastern Indonesia, Central and East Java, and the western coast of Sumatra. Teochews, southern neighbors of the Hokkien, are found throughout the eastern coast of Sumatra, in the Riau Archipelago, and in western Borneo. They were preferred as plantation laborers in Sumatra, but have become traders in regions where the Hokkien are not <b>well</b> <b>represented.</b>|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{was one of}} many dinosaurs to {{have lived}} in the Lourinhã Formation during the Late Jurassic. Many theropods, sauropods, and {{especially}} ornithischians are also from the Lourinhã Formation, which contains a similar fauna to the North American Morrison Formation. Many theropods are known including an unnamed genus of abelisaurid; the allosaurid Allosaurus europaeus; the ceratosaurid Ceratosaurus dentisculatus; the coelurosaurians Aviatyrannis jurassica, and cf. Richardoestesia; an intermediate theropod; and the megalosaurid Torvosaurus gurneyi. Sauropods are less common, with only an intermediate diplodocid as well as Dinheirosaurus; the camarasaurid Lourinhasaurus alenquerensis; the turiasaur Zby atlanticus; and the brachiosaurid Lusotitan known. Ornithischians are <b>well</b> <b>represented,</b> with identified remains persisting to Trimucrodon cuneatus; Alocodon kuehnei; the stegosaurians Dacentrurus armatus, Miragaia longicollum, and Stegosaurus ungulatus; the ankylosaurid Dracopelta zbyszewskii; the ornithopods Draconyx loureiroi, Camptosaurus sp., Phyllodon henkelli, and cf. Dryosaurus sp.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{had long}} wanted {{to develop a}} book of nursery rhymes, but such a project left Warne cold. Rhymes were already <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> in the firm's catalogue, and Warne felt Potter's {{unbridled}} enthusiasm for the genre would make the project a headache for him. In the past, {{he had tried to}} discourage Potter's interest in rhymes, believing her own stories superior, but she persisted. He reluctantly agreed to a book of rhymes for 1905, but Potter did not have it ready at the end of 1904, so he accepted the tea party tale instead. Early in 1905, it was decided the book would be published {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

40|$|Water {{levels were}} {{monitored}} in 28 wells in the Yucca Mountain area, Nevada, during 1994. Twelve <b>wells</b> <b>representing</b> 13 intervals were monitored periodically, generally {{on a monthly}} basis, 6 <b>wells</b> <b>representing</b> 10 intervals were monitored hourly, and 10 <b>wells</b> <b>representing</b> 13 intervals were monitored both periodically and hourly. All wells monitor water levels in Tertiary volcanic rocks, except one, that monitors water levels in Paleozoic carbonate rocks. Water levels were measured using calibrated steel tapes, a multiconductor cable unit, and pressure transducers. Water-level altitudes in the Tertiary volcanic rocks ranged from about 728 to about 1, 034 meters above sea level during 1994. The mean-annual water-level altitude in the well monitoring the Paleozoic carbonate rocks was about 753 meters above sea level during 1994. Water levels were only {{an average of about}} 0. 01 meters lower than 1993 water levels.

5|$|The North {{is known}} for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the {{earliest}} example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E

The two commanders of the BEF during the First World War, Field Marshals John French and Douglas Haig, came from the 19th Hussars and 7th Hussars respectively. William Robertson, 3rd Dragoon Guards, who rose in rank from private to field marshal, was the Quartermaster General, then Chief of Staff of the BEF before becoming the Chief of the Imperial General Staff in December 1915.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known American lodges were in Pennsylvania. The Collector for {{the port}} of Pennsylvania, John Moore, wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, {{two years before the}} formation of the first Grand Lodge in London. The Premier Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania. Other lodges in the colony obtained authorisations from the later Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was particularly <b>well</b> <b>represented</b> in the travelling lodges of the British Army. Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any Grand Lodge, applying and paying for their authorisation only after they were confident of their own survival.|$|E
