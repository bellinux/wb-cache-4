40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} trends in fatigue results from the Montana State University program on the fatigue of composite materials for wind turbine blades for the period 2005 - 2009. Test data {{can be found in}} the SNL/MSU/DOE Fatigue of Composite Materials Database which is updated annually. This is the fifth report in this series, which summarizes progress of the overall program since its inception in 1989. The primary thrust of this program has been research and testing of a broad range of structural laminate materials of interest to blade structures. The report is focused on current types of infused and prepreg blade materials, either processed in-house or by industry partners. Trends in static and fatigue performance are analyzed for a range of materials, geometries and loading conditions. Materials include: sixteen resins of three general types, five epoxy based paste adhesives, fifteen reinforcing fabrics including three fiber types, three prepregs, many laminate lay-ups and process variations. Significant differences in static and fatigue performance and delamination resistance are quantified for particular materials and process conditions. When blades do fail, the likely cause is fatigue in the structural detail areas or at major flaws. The program is focused strongly on these issues in addition to standard laminates. Structural detail tests allow evaluation of various blade materials options in the context of more realistic representations of blade structure than do the standard test methods. Types of structural details addressed in this report include ply drops used in thickness tapering, and adhesive joints, each tested over a range of fatigue loading conditions. Ply drop studies were in two areas: (1) a combined experimental and finite element study of basic ply drop delamination parameters for glass and carbon prepreg laminates, and (2) the development of a complex structured resin-infused coupon including ply drops, for comparison studies of various resins, fabrics and pry drop thicknesses. Adhesive joint tests using typical blade adhesives included both generic testing of materials parameters using a notched-lap-shear test geometry developed in this study, and also a series of simulated blade <b>web</b> <b>joint</b> geometries fabricated by an industry partner...|$|E

To study the seismic performance of Moment Resisting RC frames retrofitted at joints by FRP, experimental and numerical investigations are carried out on a scaled-down frame of weak-beam, strong-column type, retrofitted by applying the FRP laminates at the <b>web</b> of the <b>joints.</b> Representing constitutive models are used to introduce the behaviour of concrete, steel and fibre-reinforced polymers in the numerical investigation. Full post-peak behaviour of the joints is captured considering strain softening of concrete. Finite element results show good agreement with the experimental findings. It is found that the maximum load carrying and displacement capacities of the joint after strengthening are increased and that the first steel yielding and development of crack occur at higher loads, further away from the joint, into the beam. The effects of different values of fracture energies on the behaviour of the reinforced concrete joint are also investigated. Nonlinear pushover analyses are also carried out to predict the seismic performance of an eight-storey and two additional low-rise frames retrofitted by steel braces and FRP.

Referancing to the {{connection}} characteristic and mechanical behavior {{as well as}} the defects in application of joints on concrete-filled steel tube between columns and beams, a new connection type of steel beam throughout joints model is proposed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} interaction of ultrasonic guided waves with delamination in the web-flange interface of a co-cured, co-bonded composite T-joint. A complex interaction of waves is induced, first, by one, and, later, by two piezoceramic wafer(s) bonded on the inner surface of the flange. The flange surface velocity distributions are reconstructed from the scanning laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) measurements to study {{the effect of a}} delamination overlapping the web-flange interface. The surface-bonded piezoelectric actuator(s) placed remotely on the flange produce primarily anti-symmetric wave incidence to the delamination. A two-stage wave mode conversion process, one due to the <b>web</b> and <b>joint</b> filler, and the other due to the delamination underneath the flange is observed. First, we address the problem of identification of delamination by ultrasonic contrast imaging of the web-flange interface using a single actuator. This study is extended further to enhance the ultrasonic contrast imaging at the web-flange interface using a standing wave. A quantitative methodology based on mode conversion strength is developed to monitor different structural features like free-edge, web-flange interface and delamination. The results show the complex nature of the conversion of flexural waves to in-plane waves through the deltoid and along the web-flange interface. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mechanically {{fastened}} {{splice joints}} like spar splice joints are essential {{in a large}} aircraft structure like wing to join inboard and outboard pieces spar members. Typically in a spar splice joint the inboard and outboard pieces of the spars are mechanically joined using splice plates. Such a splice joint often transfers large shear loads associated with bending moment and the joint behaviour is complex. In this paper the design procedure of a spar splice joint in a Carbon Fibre Composite (CFC) wing for a light transport aircraft is presented. The methodology of design in the preliminary design stage and the design validation with an element level test are discussed. Conventional strength of materials approach of the mechanically fastened joints is quite extensively used in the design. The fastener configuration at the splice joint location is decided based on standard design practices of <b>web</b> splice <b>joints</b> that are subjected to bending and shear loads. The fastener loads at different levels along height or span are then computed based on the linear distribution of bending strain and parabolic distribution of shear stress at the splice joint. The distribution of forces among the fasteners at each level is estimated based on fairly reasonable considerations of fastener pattern. This approach is quite novel compared to the conventional way of equally distributing the shear force and bending force. The design has bee...|$|R
40|$|Composite T-joints are {{commonly}} used in modern composite airframe, pressure vessels and piping structures, mainly to increase the bending strength of the joint and prevents buckling of plates and shells, and in multi-cell thin-walled structures. Here we report a detailed study on the propagation of guided ultrasonic wave modes in a composite T-joint and their interactions with delamination in the co-cured co-bonded flange. A well designed guiding path is employed wherein the waves undergo a two step mode conversion process, one {{is due to the}} <b>web</b> and <b>joint</b> filler on the back face of the flange and the other is due to the delamination edges close to underneath the accessible surface of the flange. A 3 D Laser Doppler Vibrometer is used to obtain the three components of surface displacements/velocities of the accessible face of the flange of the T-joint. The waves are launched by a piezo ceramic wafer bonded on to the back surface of the flange. What is novel in the proposed method is that the location of any change in material/geometric properties can be traced by computing a frequency domain power flow along a scan line. The scan line can be chosen over a grid either during scan or during post-processing of the scan data off-line.
