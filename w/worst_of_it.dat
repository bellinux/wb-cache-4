In the first round, both fighters collided heads, and Hughes got the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Despite this, Serra could not finish {{the fight and}} Hughes recovered rapidly. In the second stanza, Hughes controlled his opponent {{on the ground with}} his wrestling skills. The final round saw the former champions taking each other down and exchanging punches. The back and forth action rewarded both competitors with Fight of the Night honors. After the fight Hughes and Serra embraced each other and ended their feud. Hughes posted on his blog: [...] "When the fight was over, I was pretty confident I was going to get my hand raised. Some people have asked why I raised his hand at the end. Actually I didn't, he raised mine. He also told me that, no matter what the decision was, he was done with the rivalry".

The refusal of Aegina was in the diplomatic guise of [...] "sending the Aeacidae."

That Athens had the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in this war is certain. Herodotus had no Athenian victories to record after the initial success, and the fact that Themistocles was able to carry his proposal to devote the surplus funds of the state to the building of so large a fleet seems to imply that the Athenians were themselves convinced that a supreme effort was necessary.|$|E

2500|$|The {{observers}} disagreed on {{who fired}} first. They did {{agree that there}} was a three-to-four-second interval between the first and the second shot, raising difficult questions in evaluating the two camps' versions. Historian William Weir speculates that Hamilton might have been undone by his own machinations: secretly setting his pistol's trigger to require only a half pound of pressure as opposed to the usual 10pounds. Burr, Weir contends, most likely had no idea that the gun's trigger pressure could be reset. Louisiana State University history professors Nancy Isenberg and Andrew Burstein concur with this. They note that [...] "Hamilton brought the pistols, which had a larger barrel than regular dueling pistols, and a secret hair-trigger, and were therefore much more deadly," [...] and conclude that [...] "Hamilton gave himself an unfair advantage in their duel, and got the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> anyway." ...|$|E

In 1780, Bet prevented Hannah from striking a servant girl with a heated shovel; Elizabeth shielded the girl and received a deep wound in her arm. As the wound healed, Bet left it uncovered as evidence of her harsh treatment.

2500|$|In The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, sports {{historian}} Bill James {{wrote that}} McGuire was called Deacon, [...] "because he didn't drink and carouse", like other players of his era. [...] To the contrary, a biographical sketch of McGuire published in 1901 stated that McGuire {{had been a}} heavy drinker {{for much of his}} career, though he did later become a [...] "teetotaler." [...] The sketch noted:"McGuire's career, as will be noted, has been a somewhat checkered one and not without its ups and downs. [...] His downs, for the most part, were due to an acquaintance he early formed with the Hon. John Barleycorn, and his association [...] with this noted gentleman led to frequent and divers bouts with one Ben Booze who invariably gave Mac the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and came near causing his downfall.

[...] They were mean, vicious, ready at any time to maim a rival player or an umpire, if it helped their cause. [...] The things they would say to an umpire were unbelievably vile, and they broke the spirits of some fine men. [...] I’ve seen umpires bathe their feet by the hour after McGraw and others spiked them through their shoes. [...] The club never was a constructive force in the game. [...] The <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was they got by with much of their browbeating and hooliganism.

Murder on the Nile (sic) was entirely brilliant; Appointment with Death, while lacking the single stroke of murderer's genius which provided the alibi in the former story, must be counted mathematically nearly twice as brilliant, since the number of suspects is reduced by nearly half. Indeed, though we begin our story in Jerusalem and meet our murder in Petra, the Red Rose City, {{we might as well}} be in a snowbound vicarage as far as the limitation of suspicion is concerned.

2500|$|From February 1943 onward, the F4U {{operated}} from Guadalcanal {{and ultimately}} other {{bases in the}} Solomon Islands. A dozen USMC F4U-1s of VMF-124, commanded by Major William E. Gise, arrived at Henderson Field (code name [...] "Cactus") on 12 February. The first recorded combat engagement was on 14 February 1943, when Corsairs of VMF-124 under Major Gise assisted P-40s and P-38s in escorting a formation of Consolidated B-24 Liberators on a raid against a Japanese aerodrome at Kahili. Japanese fighters contested the raid and the Americans got the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> with four P-38s, two P-40s, two Corsairs and two Liberators lost.

Despite the debut, the Marines quickly learned how to make better use of the aircraft and started demonstrating its superiority over Japanese fighters.

2500|$|General Murray survived two plane crashes in his lifetime. The {{first was}} before the {{ejection}} seat and took place when he was instructing a student {{that was one of}} The Tuskeegee Airmen. They were flying in a single-engine, two-seater trainer with a slide-back canopy over Florida. An oil hose broke and they lost engine power. Murray was able {{to take control of the}} plane and land it in a swampy field, causing severe damage to the engine and belly of the plane. They were not injured. The second plane crash was when General Murray was an executive for an aerospace company and was aboard the company's business jet as a passenger. The plane began its descent for landing on a very cold winter day in Michigan. General Murray, concerned about an ice buildup, looked out the window over the wing and noticed large sheets of ice on the wings. He quickly notified the pilots, but it was too late. General Murray then observed the ice breaking off of the wings and being sucked into the jet engine intakes. The engines shut down, and the plane had to make an emergency landing on a partially iced-over lake. Upon the plane crashing, it immediately burst into flames. General Murray quickly opened the door and ushered out the pilots and the other executives he was traveling with. The water was now covered in aircraft fuel. The fuel ignited, leaving General Murray no escape. His only option was to dive into the flames that were on top of the water. He suffered burns that were, fortunately, not serious. He said that swimming in the icy waters was the <b>worst</b> <b>of</b> <b>it!</b> ...|$|E
