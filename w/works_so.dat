25|$|The great {{explosion}} of 1898 {{started in the}} smokeless powder plant at 5:15 PM on April 26. Santa Cruz was rocked {{by a series of}} heavy explosions which killed 13 men at the powder works and injured 25 more. Windows were broken in Santa Cruz, and flaming debris fell on Mission Hill. Many buildings used to house company employees were set afire and a community effort was required by residents of Santa Cruz to prevent fires from reaching powder magazines closer to the city. The explosion caused apprehension among Santa Cruz residents about the safety of operating the powder <b>works</b> <b>so</b> close to the city. Santa Cruz County closed the powder works school and required powder works employee housing facilities to be vacated.|$|E
25|$|There could thus be {{spectacular}} {{differences in}} pay {{within a particular}} group, with the most valued workers sometimes receiving as much as fives {{times more than the}} least valued. Even Roach's best paid workers, however, were usually paid little better, and sometimes worse, than comparable tradesmen at other yards, and Roach's overall wage rates were on average lower than his competitors. His business though did not suffer more industrial action, which Roach, who had spent many years as a tradesman himself, attributed to his rapport with his employees. A more concrete reason may have been the fact that Roach still operated his old New York shipyard, the Morgan Iron <b>Works,</b> <b>so</b> that when there was a strike at one plant he could readily defeat it by simply transferring his operations to the other.|$|E

25|$|The Star Wars saga has {{inspired}} many fans {{to create their}} own non-canon material set in the Star Wars galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan-fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan-fiction films set in the Star Wars universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries. Lucasfilm, for the most part, has allowed but not endorsed the creation of these derivative fan-fiction <b>works,</b> <b>so</b> long as no such work attempts to make a profit from or tarnish the Star Wars franchise in any way. While many fan films have used elements from the licensed Expanded Universe to tell their story, they are not considered an official part of the Star Wars canon.|$|E
25|$|The company's new cahier des charges (license) was liberal. It {{called for}} new French operas with spoken {{dialogue}} (opéra comique) or sung recitative, prose or verse librettos, and {{with or without}} ballets. No single composer could have more than six new acts presented in one season (acts were counted rather than works). Preference was {{to be given to}} Prix de Rome winners up to two years after the award. In addition, up to two translated foreign works were permitted, as well as French works ten years after their premiere, and any number of public domain <b>works,</b> <b>so</b> long as these did not exceed 33% of the number of new acts presented over a two-year period. The company had the right to revive any works it had already produced, to encourage the company to establish its own repertory. As the company did not receive any state subsidy before 1864, revivals of popular, established works were critical to its financial survival.|$|E
25|$|In June 1791 Lavoisier made a loan of 71,000 livres to Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours {{to buy a}} {{printing}} <b>works</b> <b>so</b> that du Pont could publish his newspaper, La Correspondance Patriotique.

He also chaired the commission set up to establish a uniform system of weights and measures which in March 1791 recommended {{the adoption of the}} metric system.The new system of weights and measures was adopted by the Convention on 1 August 1793. Lavoisier himself was removed from the commission on weights and measures on 23 December 1793, together with Laplace and several other members, for political reasons. One of his last major works was a proposal to the National Convention for the reform of French education. He also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign-born scientists including mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange, which helped to exempt them from a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom.|$|E

500|$|In particular, Fodor {{criticizes the}} instrumentalism of Daniel Dennett. Dennett {{maintains}} {{that it is}} possible to be realist with regard to intentional states without having to commit oneself to the reality of mental representations. Now, according to Fodor, if one remains at this level of analysis, then there is no possibility of explaining why the intentional strategy works:There is ... a standard objection to instrumentalism ...: it is difficult to explain why the psychology of beliefs/desires <b>works</b> <b>so</b> well, if the psychology of beliefs/desires is, in fact, false.... As Putnam, Boyd and others have emphasized, from the predictive successes of a theory to the truth of that theory there is surely a presumed inference; and this is even more likely when ... we are dealing with the only theory in play which is predictively crowned with success. It is not obvious ... why such a presumption should not militate in favour of a realist conception ... of the interpretations of beliefs/desires.|$|E
500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really <b>works</b> <b>so</b> hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the hell out of the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} well received. Joe Rybicki of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine celebrated that [...] "for {{the first time}} I can remember, an extreme-sports game {{actually}} has a real story [...] honest-to-goodness characters". IGN's Douglas Perry called it [...] "a kick, albeit relatively lightweight in nature". He especially praised the pervasive sense of humor in the narrative and in the portrayal of real-world skaters. Knutson called the story [...] "unique" [...] and stated, [...] "I really like that Neversoft {{had the guts to}} try something this radical and ditch the formula that they know <b>works</b> <b>so</b> well." [...] Ben Silverman of Game Revolution described the game's plot as a [...] "silly" [...] cross between those of the 1980s films North Shore and Gleaming the Cube, but he praised it for giving context to the level goals and keeping distance between the skill unlocks. Bramwell called it [...] "hackneyed". Rybicki found that the plot hurt the game's replay value and caused missions to be overly simplistic.

500|$|Like Berardinelli, USA Todays Mike Clark thought Bale {{performed}} {{the role of}} Batman {{as well as he}} did Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, but that the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Rachel Dawes was [...] "frustratingly underdeveloped". Kyle Smith thought Bale exhibited [...] "both the menace and the wit he showed in his brilliant turn in American Psycho", and that the film <b>works</b> <b>so</b> well because of the realism, stating, [...] "Batman starts stripping away each layer of Gotham crime only to discover a sicker and more monstrous evil beneath, his rancid city simultaneously invokes early '90s New York, when criminals frolicked to the tune of five murders a day; Serpico New York, when cops were for sale; and today, when psychos seek to kill us all at once rather than one by one." [...] In contrast, Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek felt Nolan did not deliver the emotional depth expected of [...] "one of the most soulful and tortured superheroes of all"; she thought Bale, unlike Michael Keaton whom she compared him to, failed to connect with the audience underneath the mask, but that Gary Oldman succeeded in [...] "emotional complexity" [...] where the rest of the movie failed.|$|E
500|$|Hail to the Thief has a {{score of}} 85 out of 100 on review {{aggregate}} site Metacritic, indicating [...] "universal acclaim".

[...] Chris Ott of Pitchfork wrote that Radiohead had [...] "largely succeeded in their efforts to shape pop music into as boundless and possible a medium as it should be," [...] assigning it a [...] "Best New Music" [...] designation. Writing for New York, Ethan Brown said that Hail to the Thief [...] "isn't a protest album, and that's why it <b>works</b> <b>so</b> well. As with great Radiohead records past, such as Kid A, the music – restlessly, freakishly inventive – pushes politics far into the background." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that [...] "despite the fact that it seems more like a bunch of songs on a disc rather than a singular body, its impact is substantial", concluding that the band [...] "have entered a second decade of record-making with a surplus of momentum. In Mojo, Peter Paphides wrote that Hail to the Thief [...] "coheres as well as anything else in their canon".|$|E

500|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939 did not initially cause much disruption in Gibraltar, as Spain and Italy were neutral at the time. The situation changed drastically after April 1940 when Germany invaded France, with Italy joining the invasion in June 1940. The British Government feared that Spain would also enter the war and {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire civilian population of Gibraltar in May 1940. Most went to the United Kingdom and others to Madeira and Jamaica, while some made their own way to Tangier and Spain. An intensive programme of tunnelling and refortification was undertaken; over [...] of tunnels were dug in the Rock, and anti-aircraft batteries were installed in numerous locations in the territory. A new and powerful naval group called Force H was established at Gibraltar to control the entrance to the Mediterranean and support Allied forces in North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The airfield, which was now designated RAF North Front, was also extended using soil from the tunnelling <b>works</b> <b>so</b> that it could accommodate bomber aircraft being ferried to North Africa. The garrison was greatly expanded, reaching a peak of 17,000 in 1943 with another 20,000 sailors and airmen accommodated in Gibraltar at the same time.|$|E

[...] Digital Spy's Nick Levine also gave Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded {{four out of five}} stars, but was skeptical about the choice to re-release the album, writing that [...] "it isn't worth forking out for Good Girl Gone Bad twice just to hear the new songs". Despite that, he praised the newly added songs especially [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again"; he called the song [...] "superior". Levine further wrote, [...] "if Reloaded encourages a few hesitant pop fans to invest in this album, {{the closest thing to a}} Thriller that 2007/8 is likely to produce, this rather cynical reissue should be let off the hook... just." [...] Among other achieved awards and nominations, [...] "Disturbia" [...] and [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again" [...] received nominations for Best Dance Recording and Pop Collaboration with Vocals respectively at the 2009 Grammy Awards.|$|E
500|$|Early {{settlers}} on Réunion {{referred to}} the bird as [...] "huppe", due to the similarity of its crest and curved bill {{with that of the}} hoopoe. Little was recorded about the hoopoe starling during the next 100years, but specimens began to be brought to Europe during the 18th century. Although the species was first scientifically described by French naturalist Philippe Guéneau de Montbeillard in the 1779 edition of Comte de Buffon's Histoire Naturelle, it did not receive its scientific name until its designation by Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert for the book's 1783 edition. Boddaert named the bird Upupa varia; its genus name is that of the hoopoe, and its specific name means [...] "variegated", describing its black-and-white colour. Boddaert provided Linnean binomial names for plates in Buffon's <b>works,</b> <b>so</b> the accompanying 1770s plate of the hoopoe starling by François-Nicolas Martinet is considered the holotype or type illustration. Though the plate may have been based on a specimen in the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, this is impossible to determine today; the Paris museum originally had five hoopoe starling skins, some which only arrived during the 19th century. The possibly female specimen MNHN 2000-756, one of the most-illustrated skins, has an artificially trimmed crest resulting in an unnaturally semi-circular shape, unlike its appearance in life; the type illustration has a similarly shaped crest.|$|E
