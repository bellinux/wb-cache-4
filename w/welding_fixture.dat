40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to examine the effect of <b>welding</b> <b>fixture</b> used to prevent the distortions duringcooling process {{utilizing}} a robot controlled gas metal arc welding method on cooling rate and distortions ofwelded structures. Design/methodology/approach: Using a specially designed <b>welding</b> <b>fixture</b> for a welded steel structure, sixdifferent types of AISI 1020 steel specimens are tested in three different welding speeds and two differentcooling conditions either at fixture or without using fixture.

Increase in distortions is directly proportional to theincrease in welding speed which affects the weld heat input.

Robotized welding is rarely utilized, although it is commonly considered as {{the most effective way to}} reduce costs and increase compe-titiveness. A reason for the under-exploitation of robotics can be found in the construction of aluminum boats; boat models and their detailed structures are almost without exception individual pieces.

40|$|The welding of {{austenite}} {{stainless steel}} {{often results in}} large amount of welding distortion due to its high thermal expansion coefficient and low thermal conductivity. This has created great difficulty in the dimensional control of the welded stainless steel structure, ending up with high manufacturing cost. Researches on the welding distortion of stainless steels were very limited, especially for large weld structures with complex component shapes. The studies of this thesis were initiated with focus on the stainless steel nozzle-to-shell-can weld structures, a very typical structural configuration for pressure vessels used in petrochemical and nuclear power generation industries. Both the experimental and the FEA (finite element analysis), i. e. computational simulation, approaches were taken in the studies which addressed the influences of the <b>welding</b> <b>fixture,</b> the welding sequence, and the welding process on the distortion caused by stainless steel nozzle-to-shell welding. The investigations employed single and multi-nozzle weld test models (called mockups in the thesis) or FEA models. Manual GTAW (gas tungsten arc welding) and SMAW (shielded metal arc welding) processes were selected to represent the most common practice for stainless steel nozzle welding. The FEA simulations were conducted with ABAQUS program using sequentially coupled transient analysis method with lumped weld passes to achieve high computing efficiency. The investigations {{on the effect of}} the <b>welding</b> <b>fixture</b> concluded that the contour fixtures introduced in the thesis be effective for reducing the welding distortion for both the single and the multi-nozzle welding. The contour fixtures tend to localize the welding distortion, hence yield less impact on the global distortion of the whole weld structure. The rib-bar fixture, a more common fixture type for multi-nozzle welding, was found resulting in a big jump in the shell plate distortion when the fixture was removed. The studies on the influence of the welding sequence revealed that a progressive approach was more favorable for distortion control under the given nozzle-to-shell weld structure configurations. The best sequence suggested is to start welding at one nozzle, firstly on shell OD (outside diameter) side then on ID (inside diameter) side, then proceed to next neighboring nozzle. The effect of the welding direction of each weld pass was found affecting only the nozzle angular distortion. The experimental data showed that the manual GTAW process developed much higher shell plate distortion than the SMAW process. The reason would be that a higher percentage of the welding heat had been consumed on the base metal. The influence of the weld bead size didn’t appear to be significant. In the FEA study on the effect {{of the size of the}} lumped weld pass, the increase in weld bead size even resulted in a decrease in weld distortion. From the FEA simulation point of view, using large lumped pass would be a highly efficient choice without compromising too much in the precision of the distortion prediction. The FEA study confirmed that a decrease in cooling time after welding would result in more welding distortion. The large scale multi-nozzle mockup with rib-bar fixture demonstrated a maximum out-of-plane shell distortion of 16. 4 mm after the welding of 10 nozzles with GTAW+SMAW process, which suggests that additional measures should be developed to further control the welding distortion. 1 yea...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of case based reasoning (CBR) to <b>welding</b> <b>fixtures</b> in a computer aided design (CAD) environment. Modular fixtures have become more popular in previous years due {{to the creation of}} flexible manufacturing systems. Modular fixtures, since they are composed of many standardized parts, require much iteration to produce a full fixture design. This process is made more complicated when it is applied to more complex parts such as welding assemblies. In an effort to simplify fixture design for such complicated parts, researchers have been working on integrating fixture design into CAD packages. These efforts, generally known as computer aided fixture design (CAFD), do not focus on the transition of experience from more experienced designers but only provide a structure and a virtual environment to create fixtures. The research presented in this thesis will apply to this area. Case based reasoning (CBR) is a method of using previous cases to help aid the development of solutions to new problems. Applied to CAFD, this method is reduced to the application of a database and a retrieval and adaptation system. Current research on CAFD and CBR is limited to only proposing systems for machining fixtures.

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} {{assembly}} by laser welding, metal fit-up {{is an important}} specification for achieving <b>welding</b> quality. The <b>fixture</b> {{plays an important role}} in satisfying the intimate metal fit-up that laser <b>weld</b> requires. The <b>fixturing</b> quality for sheet metal laser welding is directly related to the assembly weld patterns used (weld location, weld length, etc.). The design of assembly weld patterns is a critical phase in the fixture design cycle. Traditionally, the determination of the weld pattern is based on the designer's experience. Because of this it is quite easy to cause unexpected deviations from the assembly weld quality requirements. In this study, a new computer-aided design approach for the assembly weld pattern is developed, where the sources of variation in the weld areas of the parts are considered in detail. Using this approach, the weld location and the weld length obtained are much more reasonable and cost-justified. A simple example and a case study show that the approach presented for assembly weld pattern design can reasonably meet the fixturing quality requirements. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this project}} are to present an {{understanding}} in what happens when aluminium-(Al) alloys are welded, and to investigate how the Mg-, Si- and Cr-contents in AA 6005 A influence the weld strength and cracking susceptibility. It is known that heat from welding affects the mechanical properties (strength) of the material. Different heat cycles during welding {{are one of the}} main reasons that the strength varies. Welding can cause various phenomena such as decreased strength, porosity, deformation, cracks and corrosion. To minimize these phenomena one has to have a balance between the welding parameters, alloy composition and <b>welding</b> <b>fixture</b> setup. Al alloys are sensitive to heat from welding because they have high heat conductivity and high thermal expansion coefficient. They also deform easily when the material is heated locally. If the material is deformed too much then cracking easily occurs. This project has examined how the Mg-, Si- and Cr-contents in AA 6005 A, affect the welded material. A V-joint with MIG welding is used for producing weld samples. For evaluation Vickers micro-hardness, tensile testing, radiography (X-ray), LOM and SEM with EBSD and EDS was used. The evaluation focuses on mechanical properties and microstructure. The results show that small variations of Mg-, Si- and Cr-content do not have any clear effects on the welded material. The results from tensile testing show that all samples have failed in the heat affected zone (HAZ). The tensile strength of all samples are higher than standard but the yield strength are lower than standard (EN ISO 10042 : 2005). The lowering in hardness and tensile strength in the HAZ are believed to be a result from beta-phase (AlFeSi), lead to transformation and coarsening of the strengthening and metastable precipitate. The HAZ is wide, ranging about 20 mm from the fusion line in 5 mm thick plate. The microstructure evaluation has shown that the grain size in the HAZ has been influenced while welding.   The EDS analysis shows that a small amount of AlFeSi particles occur in the base material and HAZ but not in the weld seam.
