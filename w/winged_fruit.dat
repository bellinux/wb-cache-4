25|$|Tropaeolum was {{previously}} {{placed in the}} family Tropaeolaceae along with two other genera, Magallana Cav. and Trophaeastrum. The monotypic genus Magallana was characterised by having <b>winged</b> <b>fruit,</b> and the two species of Trophaeastrum lacked spurs. The genus Tropaeolum was diagnosed only {{by the absence of}} the characteristics of the other two genera. A molecular study undertaken in 2000 found Tropaeolum to be paraphyletic when the other two genera are segregated, so Magallana and Trophaeastrum were reduced to synonyms of Tropaeolum. Tropaeolaceae was thus rendered monogeneric, a family of only one genus.|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} name pseudoplatanus {{refers to the}} superficial similarity of the leaves and bark of the sycamore to those of plane trees in the genus Platanus, the prefix pseudo- (from Ancient Greek) meaning [...] "false". [...] However, the two genera are in different families that are only distantly related. Acer and Platanus differ in the position in which leaves {{are attached to the}} stem (alternate in Platanus, paired or opposite in Acer) and in their fruit, which are spherical clusters in Platanus and paired samaras (<b>winged</b> <b>fruit)</b> in Acer.|$|E

The small <b>winged</b> <b>fruit</b> contains shiny brown seeds.|$|E
5000|$|The plant bears {{attractive}} neatly rounded {{heads of}} small, bright golden flowers. The individual flowers have no petals; rather, they {{are composed of}} yellow bracts forming a trumpet-shaped calyx about the stamens. It bears a small, <b>winged</b> <b>fruit.</b> The plant grows in succulent mats on sand or other coastal substrate. The roots are stout, fusiform and often several feet long. These roots are edible, traditionally eaten by the Chinook Indians.|$|E
50|$|Halothamnus somalensis is a thorny shrub 30-90 cm high, with olive-green branches, that partly turn black when drying. The semiterete, tiny {{leaves are}} appressed to the branches, and only 0,5-3 mm long. The flowers are 3,0-4,7 mm long. The <b>winged</b> <b>fruit</b> is 8-12,5 mm in diameter, their wings never turning black even on {{blackened}} plants. The {{bottom of the}} fruit tube has very small linear grooves located near the periphery, lacking any prominent radial veins.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species was}} first {{formally}} described in 1904 by William Vincent Fitzgerald in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The specific epithet pterocarpa {{is from the}} Ancient Greek πτερόν (pterón) meaning “wing" [...] or [...] "feather” and καρπός (karpós) meaning “fruit" [...] or [...] "grain” referring to the <b>winged</b> <b>fruits.</b>|$|R
50|$|D. viscosa can {{be grown}} from seeds. However, {{pre-treatment}} of the seed in very hot water may be needed. The plant can also be cultivated by taking cuttings.

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to teaching botany, with {{their emphasis on}} preserved specimens, prepared slides, and slow-to-develop physiological experiments tend to lead students to one conclusion—plants are boring (Uno, 1994). Surveys have also shown that students have a strong preference for hands-on experiments which utilize living material and generate fast results. The incorporation of such experiments into botany or ecology exercises is especially difficult in the “dead ” of winter in northern climes. We present here a fun, inexpensive, and pedagogically useful laboratory exercise which involves indoor studies of the dispersal properties of the <b>winged</b> <b>fruits</b> (samaras) of boxelder (Acer negundo L.) trees. The exercise engages students in the processes of hypothesis testing, experimental design, and data analysis, as well as introducing them to some important concepts relating to functional ecology, succession, and plant reproductive biology. Boxelder Samaras Samaras are <b>winged</b> <b>fruits</b> morphologically adapted for wind dispersal because they autorotate when falling. The functional significance of autorotation {{is to increase the}} distance the fruit may be transported by horizontal winds (Augspurger, 1986). The longer a samara i...|$|R
50|$|Phaeoptilum spinosum (Brosdoring) is a shrub {{that occurs}} in central Namibia. It is a {{valuable}} drought-resistant fodder plant, browsed by goats and kudu. The bush bears <b>winged</b> red <b>fruits</b> in October.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{and discuss the}} distribution of a new, naturalized alien species, Maireana brevifolia (R. Br.) Paul G.

50|$|Halothamnus beckettii is a sub-shrub only 20-40 cm high, {{strongly}} branched and densely foliated. The whole {{surface of}} the plant is covered with small white pustules. The half-terete leaves with concave upper side are narrowly triangular, with dense tufts of long curly hairs in their axils, about 11 mm long, and with a cartilaginous spiny apex. The flowers are 7,5-8,5 mm long (longer than other Halothamnus species). The <b>winged</b> <b>fruit</b> is 11-13 mm in diameter, their wings inserting at 1/5 of the fruit height, the tepal lobes with prominent mid rib.|$|E
50|$|The silvery-grey {{foliage and}} <b>winged</b> <b>fruit</b> are {{attractive}} {{features of this}} shrub as are the dusky pink to red flowers. It is a hardy plant and some in cultivation are more than 30 years old. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting onto Myoporum species and will grow {{in a wide range}} of soils, including saline, alkaline, or clay soils. In nature it is subject to long droughts and occasional flooding and this watering regime will encourage its flowering. It is also tolerant of frosts and of hard pruning when mature.|$|E

40|$|Paliurus favonii Unger is {{recognized}} and described based on fruits from the Oligocene Ningming flora of Guangxi, South China. Characteristics {{of the present}} specimens include circular <b>winged</b> <b>fruits</b> that are 10. 0 - 11. 5 mm in diameter with a central endocarp at 3. 0 to 4. 0 mm in diameter. The specimens fall into the morphological range of the fossil species P. favonii, which has been observed in other Cenozoic sites in the Northern Hemisphere. The present discovery represents the lowest latitude distribution of P. favonii in the world, and we are presenting the first P. favonii fossil described with detailed cuticular characteristics from China. Further, this finding demonstrates that the genus existed in the Oligocene Ningming region, South China, and provides new information for understanding the fossil history. The dispersal mode for winged fossils demonstrates that wind dispersal is well-represented in the Oligocene Ningming flora...|$|R
40|$|The family Malpighiaceae {{presents}} {{species with}} different habits, fruit types and cytological characters. Climbers {{are considered the}} most derived habit, followed, respectively, by the shrubby and arboreal ones. The present study examines the relationship between basic chromosome numbers and the derivation of climbing habit and fruit types in Malpighiaceae. A comparison of all the chromosome number reports for Malpighiaceae showed a predominance of chromosome numbers based on x= 5 or 10 in the genera of sub-family Malpighioideae, mainly represented by climbers with <b>winged</b> <b>fruits,</b> whereas non-climbing species with non-winged fruits, which predominate in sub-family Byrsonimoideae, had counts based on x= 6, which is considered the less derived basic number for the family. Based on such data, confirmed by statistic assays, and on the monophyletic origin of this family, we admit the hypothesis that morphological derivation of habit and fruit is correlated with chromosome basic number variation in the family Malpighiaceae...|$|R
