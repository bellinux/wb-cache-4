500|$|Fieldy {{has said}} of the album [...] "Right now, I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this...</b> we've done {{something}} we've never done before. Normally if we do a new Korn record, we'll normally put 12 or 13 songs and that's how many we make. This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put {{the best of what}} we have on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's {{going to be a little}} extra special this time." [...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E
2500|$|Women {{with larger}} breasts (cup size greater than D) {{can have a}} {{difficult}} time finding a correctly sized bra because many stores do not offer a sufficient range of bras in greater sizes. Many salespeople are not trained in how to properly fit a bra, and when the customer can not find what they want, will sell the customer the next largest or smallest size. Some salespeople measure customers over their shirt and bra, adding errors to every measurement. Elisabeth Squires, an author of a breast-health and bra guide, says [...] "Most really good fitters <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> is an art, not a science." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, {{what sort}} of issue might be fairly {{expected}} from all <b>this</b> self-denial? <b>You</b> would ask that. It is right that your eyes should be open to it. I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> truthfully. <b>This</b> issue would be uncertain, and, most probably, would not be worth much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{nothing on}} <b>this</b> matter, Lord Lufton, whether true or false. It {{is a subject}} on which it does not concern me to speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you'll {{be glad to}} hear, Tatham writes me, that he {{has sold}} three of my fields at Fairoaks to the Railroad Company, at a great figure. I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this,</b> and more when we meet; and am always your affectionate,--A. P." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} said so. I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> truth, though perhaps you {{will say it}} is not feminine. I would fain marry some one. To be as I {{have been for the}} last two years is not a happy condition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} what I thought. Well, I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> Use your warrant: Arrest Mr. Inglethorp. But it will bring you no kudos--the case against him will be {{dismissed}} at once! Comme ca!" [...] And he snapped his fingers expressively.|$|E
6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN. The fact is, I {{have been}} {{behaving}} very recklessly {{for some time}} past {{under the impression that}} my life would be so short that it was not worth bothering about.

"I {{have always}} understood," [...] he observed, [...] "that things were managed like <b>this.</b> <b>You</b> may have {{confidence}} in me, Monsieur the Commissioner, and you, Monsieur Picard. I shall not tell the world what I suspect. But for your private information I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> man was probably murdered by an assassin who sought my life.

6000|$|... "Because--I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> after. But <b>this</b> I say, my {{curse on}} the {{grandson}} of mine who shall try to seize that fatal crown, which cost the life of my fairest, my noblest, my wisest, my bravest!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> much now," [...] he said. [...] "I had {{rather that}} we Strangeweys died out, that the roof dropped off Peak Hall {{and the walls}} stood naked to the sky, than that this woman should be your wife {{and the mother of}} your children!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I {{was sure}} of it. Yet you have done well to tell me.

Now here; do <b>you</b> see <b>this</b> narrow belt of fine sediment That was deposited while the water was higher. You see the driftwood begins to strand, too. The bank helps in other ways.

6000|$|... "Your judgment, Mr. Trent," [...] she {{answered}} quietly, [...] "is of no importance to me! It does not interest me in any way. But I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> If I {{did not disclose}} myself, it was because I distrusted you. I {{wanted to know the}} truth, and I set myself to find it out." ...|$|E

"I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> much, citizen Tournefort," [...] {{broke in}} Chauvelin with some acerbity, [...] "that {{though we have}} traced the {{diamonds}} and the thief so far, we have, through your folly last night, lost complete track of the ci-devant Comtesse de Sucy and of the man Bertin. We want Rateau to show us where they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thou makest {{question}} of {{me on my}} coming, a Goddess of a God, and I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>this</b> my saying truly, at thy command. 'Twas Zeus that bade me come hither, by no will of mine; nay, who of his free will would speed over such a wondrous space of sea whereby is no city of mortals that do sacrifice to the gods. He saith that thou hast with thee a man most wretched beyond his fellows, beyond those men that round the city of Priam for nine years fought, and in the tenth year sacked the city and departed homeward. Yet on the way they sinned against Athênê, and she raised upon them an evil blast and long waves of the sea. Then {{all the rest of}} his good company was lost, but it came to pass that the wind bare and the wave brought him hither. And now Zeus biddeth thee send him hence with what speed thou mayest, for it is not ordained that he die away from his friends, but rather it is his fate to look on them even yet, and to come to his high-roofed home and his own country.' ...|$|R

Now I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> how <b>this</b> {{constitutional}} nervousness on his part arose. He told me the story; but as at that time {{there had been no}} occasion for him to show whether he was brave or otherwise, I considered my lips sealed. Now that his weakness has been exhibited, I consider myself more than justified in explaining its origin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Any one in Merida, and, in {{fact the}} English histories, <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> {{wonderful}} city is in the vast tract of marshy land situated between here and Merida, known as the Black Swamp. It {{is a fact that}} no white man has ever seen it, since the only approach is across the swamp on the south side, and the way so closely guarded that a person must have special sources of information in order to get through the labyrinth of narrow water courses on the banks of which are sentinels ready to salute the visitor with a shower of poisoned arrows.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{know that}} a paper was stolen by your cousin, and handed over to a person whom we will not name, but {{who is now in}} Europe. I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> much--I am going across so as {{to keep in touch with}} that person.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this.</b> The {{two young}} men concerned, Bidlake and Fairfax, were both guests of mine {{recently}} at my country house.

"Well, my lad, I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> {{much for}} the {{gratification}} of yourself and friends: When it comes, if it ever does, that I am convinced, {{because of lack of}} food, ammunition, or any other contingency, that we cannot hold the fort, I will lead as many of the garrison as choose to follow me in an attempt to cut our way through the enemy's lines. I, like you, prefer to die fighting, rather than at the stake." ...|$|E
60|$|The Irishman and {{the native}} Californian in their hours of discontent use the revolver, not once, but six times. The press records the fact, and asks in the next column whether the world can {{parallel}} the progress of San Francisco. The American who loves his country <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> that <b>this</b> sort of thing is confined to the lower classes. Just at present an ex-judge who was sent to jail by another judge (upon my word I cannot tell whether these titles mean anything) is breathing red-hot vengeance against his enemy. The papers have interviewed both parties, and confidently expect a fatal issue.|$|R

You can only imagine."( [...] „Will Dir noch mitteilen, wie das ganze kam: hier waren sehr viele Juden, die vom litauischen Militär zusammengetrieben und auf einer Wiese außerhalb der Stadt erschossen wurden, immer so 2000 - 3000 Menschen.
