5|$|Meanwhile, a young roguish prince, Fiyero, {{has arrived}} at Shiz. Galinda is charmed when Fiyero shares his life {{philosophy}} ("Dancing Through Life"). They all decide {{to have a}} party that evening. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to invite her to the party, but she convinces him instead to ask Nessarose out of pity, leaving her free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose is delighted and tells her sister how she and Boq {{are meant to be}} together and how Galinda helped it happen. When Galinda offers Elphaba a hat to wear to the party, Elphaba begins to wonder if she <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> her roommate.|$|E
5|$|The second book, Thunder Rising, {{takes place}} {{a couple of}} months after The Sun Trail. Turtle Tail returns to Gray Wing's group {{pregnant}} by an aggressive kittypet tomcat named Tom, and becomes Gray Wing's mate. A fire breaks out in the forest, forcing Clear Sky's group to take shelter with Gray Wing. While taking shelter with Gray Wing, Clear Sky realizes that he <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> Thunder and invites him to join his group. Thunder quickly accepts the offer, but soon realizes that his father is too power-hungry and concentrated on the needs of the group over the individual and leaves.|$|E
25|$|From early on, the Hurd was {{developed}} to use GNU Mach as the microkernel. This was a technical decision made by Richard Stallman, who thought it would speed up the work by saving {{a large part of}} it. He has admitted that he <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> that. Other Unix-like systems working on the Mach microkernel include OSF/1, Lites, and MkLinux. macOS and NeXTSTEP use hybrid kernels based on Mach.|$|E

25|$|Requiring the isotope tritium to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry {{to demand}} it. Harry agrees in {{exchange}} for Spider-Man's life. He tells Octavius to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with Spider-Man, but requests Octavius not harm him. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Her endangerment leads to Peter's powers resurfacing. Just as Jameson admits he <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> Spider-Man, Peter steals his costume back from the Bugle and goes after Octavius.|$|E
25|$|Livingstone <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the Nile, but he {{identified}} numerous geographical features for Western science, such as Lake Ngami, Lake Malawi, and Lake Bangweulu, {{in addition to}} Victoria Falls mentioned above. He filled in details of Lake Tanganyika, Lake Mweru, and the course of many rivers, especially the upper Zambezi, and his observations enabled large regions to be mapped which previously had been blank. Even so, the farthest north he reached was {{the north end of}} Lake Tanganyika – still south of the Equator – and he did not penetrate the rainforest of the River Congo any further downstream than Ntangwe near Misisi.|$|E
25|$|Pichegru {{and three}} other {{deportees}} escaped from French Guiana by boat on 3 June 1798, but Willot and François Aubry fell desperately ill with fever and were unable to join them. Aubry soon died but Willot recovered and got away that same month. In 1799, Pichegru and Willot actively plotted to stir up Royalist revolts in France. On 1 June 1799, Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino wrote to the French army commander André Masséna that Pichegru, Willot and Carnot were traveling with Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, {{the commander of the}} Habsburg Austrian army. Ferino <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> Carnot but correct about the others. Pichegru planned to lead the rebellion in Franche-Comté, Willot in Marseilles and Louis François Perrin de Précy in Lyon. Their efforts came to nothing because Masséna won his masterly victory at the Second Battle of Zurich on 25 September 1799.|$|E
60|$|The ornithologists <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the chough, just as {{they had}} <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the goldfinch, during the late years of the nineteenth century, and as they <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the {{swallows}} and martins in later years. Of the goldfinch, they said, and solemnly put it down in their books, that owing to improved methods of agriculture the thistle had been extirpated and the bird, deprived of his natural food, had forsaken this country. But no sooner did our County Councils begin to avail themselves of the powers given them by the Bird Act of twenty years ago to protect the goldfinch from the bird-catcher, than it began to increase again and is still increasing, year by year, all over the country.|$|R

[...] However he is less impressed with Bates's remarks about the [...] "intellectual inferiority" [...] of the natives, and observes that Bates <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the fertility of tropical soils, which are often poor: the luxuriant growth results from rapid recycling of nutrients. He celebrates the [...] "famous closing passage" [...] of the book, where Bates expresses his [...] "deep misgivings" [...] about returning to England, and writes that recent [...] "progress" [...] in the Amazon is just as shocking.|$|E
500|$|When Pembleton {{begins to}} read Hal his rights, Felix stops him {{and refuses to}} let him arrest his son. Later, prosecuting {{attorney}} Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek) [...] says because the confession is inadmissible, they have no evidence to arrest Hal, and he refuses to issue an arrest warrant against {{a member of a}} prominent family without a solid case. The Wilsons decide to move to San Diego, and Felix tells Pembleton he will do everything he can to continue protecting his son. Pembleton and Ballard make a reluctant peace and, although Pembleton remains cold with her, he admits he <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the Wilsons and that Ballard's instincts about the case were correct. Gee tells Pembleton he too let his personal feelings cloud his judgment, and the two agree they will bring Hal back to Baltimore when they get enough evidence against him.|$|E

500|$|Jamestown has {{now been}} built and Walter tells his wife Alice about Powhatan’s victory over Miami. They then discuss a banquet hosted by Powhatan that Smith, Rolfe and Percy will attend. Meanwhile, Pocahontas and Nima witness Grimosco and Miami {{plotting}} to kill the European settlers. [...] When Grimosco coerces Powhatan into believing he should kill all the White men, by casting doubt about their intentions, creating fear about how they will act in the future, and invoking religious imagery, Pocahontas runs to warn the settlers about the danger. Back in Jamestown, a comic bit ensues in which Larry’s wife Kate has arrived disguised as a male page, and teases him before revealing herself. [...] She says she has come with Percy’s lover, Geraldine, also disguised as a page, who has come to convince Percy he <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> her infidelity. Pocahontas arrives and convinces the settlers to go to Powhatan’s palace to rescue their colleagues from Grimosco’s plot. They arrive {{just in time to}} prevent the disaster. [...] Grimosco is taken away, and Miami stabs himself in shame. [...] Everyone else has a happy ending: Pocahontas is with Rolfe, Walter is with Alice, Larry is with Kate, Percy is with Geraldine, and even Robin is with Nima. Smith forgives Powhatan, and gives the play's final speech, predicting a great future for the new country that will form in this land.|$|E

In this paper, I (i) criticize the pessimistic inductions over scientific theories, scientists, and realists, (ii) introduce a pessimistic induction over antirealist theories, and then (iii) construct two new pessimistic inductions. One is a pessimistic induction over antirealists according to which the author of the latest antirealist proposal cannot see hidden problems with his proposal just as his antirealist predecessors could not see hidden problems with their proposals. The other is the pessimistic induction over pessimists according to which since past pessimists have <b>been</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> their present scientific theories from the early 20 th century to the early 21 st century, future pessimists will also <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> their present scientific theories from the early 21 st century to the early 22 nd century. clos...|$|R

In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss.
