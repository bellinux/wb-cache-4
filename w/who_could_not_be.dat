5|$|She {{was known}} for her honesty and {{moderate}} life style. Having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 {{as soon as she}} began earning her keep. She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. In an unusual decision, Curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered. She insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. She and her husband often refused awards and medals. Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> corrupted by fame.|$|E
5|$|Students were {{enrolled}} {{from throughout the}} city. Often the school was used to reassign students <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> enrolled into other high schools. As of the 2006-2007 school year, Arlington enrolled 1,825 students. The plurality were Asian, at 48%, with Black, 35% and Hispanic, 11% being the other major ethnic groups. 5% of students identified as White. The school has {{the highest rate of}} poverty in high schools from the Saint Paul Public School system with 89% of students qualifying for Free and Reduced Price Lunch. Free and Reduced Price Lunch is the measure of poverty for the district. The school has a large percentage of students who have limited English proficiency (58%). 14% of students qualify for special education. The school has an Adequate Yearly Progress graduation rate of 83% while roughly three out of five students who initially enroll graduate within 4 years. 35% of students had grade level reading proficiency and 13% of students had proficiency in mathematics. Enrollment dropped considerably in the last years with only 875 students enrolled in 2010 and projections of only 650 for 2011.|$|E
25|$|Of {{particular}} importance were the crippling losses of the Spanish fleet in experienced personnel: 600 skilled mariners (oficiales) and 2,400 arquebusier marines were lost, men <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> quickly replaced.|$|E

60|$|We do {{not intend}} to drag our readers through bog and brake during the whole of this day's expedition; {{suffice it to say that}} the {{collection}} of specimens made, of all kinds, far surpassed the professor's most sanguine expectations, and, as for the others, those <b>who</b> <b>could</b> more or less intelligently sympathise did so, while those <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>were</b> content with the reflected joy of the man of science.|$|R
60|$|The man, {{though not}} very courageous, as his pale face betrayed, {{happened}} to be a good swimmer, and at once leaped into the sea. He was followed by all <b>who</b> <b>could</b> swim. Those <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> <b>were</b> encouraged to make the attempt with planks and oars to aid them. As for Bladud, he busied himself like the captain in giving heart to the non-swimmers and showing them how best to use their floats.|$|R
25|$|When the German Operation Barbarossa started {{against the}} Soviet Union, about 34,000 young Estonian men were {{forcibly}} {{drafted into the}} Red Army, fewer than 30% of whom survived the war. Political prisoners <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> evacuated were executed by the NKVD.|$|E
25|$|In Enclosure 3 {{there are}} cenotaphs to 15 {{men who are}} known or {{believed}} to be buried on the site, plus other memorials recording 5 men who {{were known to be}} buried in another cemetery but <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> found when that cemetery was concentrated to the Voormezeele Enclosures after the Armistice.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, after voters {{rejected}} a $390 million bond package, Paige contracted with The Varnett School, River Oaks Academy, and Wonderland School to house 250 students <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> placed in HISD schools. The schools were paid $3,565 per student. This was 10% {{lower than the}} district's own per pupil cost.|$|E

50|$|After {{many schools}} {{tried and failed}} to insist on only admitting {{students}} <b>who</b> <b>could</b> already read, a different approach to education came about. Schools focused on sponsoring literacy at all levels of student knowledge. Students <b>who</b> <b>could</b> read were taught more difficult materials, while students <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>were</b> given elementary reading instruction. The bulk of literacy centered on reading, but, while many early schools focused on reading skills alone, increased literacy ability was soon desirable.|$|R

25|$|Charges {{were brought}} against 23 German persons and others <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> located for the crimes against the seven United States airmen. While 23 {{individuals}} {{were accused of}} wrongdoing, only 15 could be identified by name and tried in court. Of the crowd that abused the soldiers, not all could be identified, named, and brought before the court.|$|E
25|$|POWs {{operated}} a system whereby {{newcomers to the}} camp were vetted, to prevent German agents from infiltrating their ranks. Any POW <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> vouched for by two POWs who knew the prisoner by sight was severely interrogated and afterwards escorted continually by other prisoners, {{until such time as}} he was deemed to be a genuine Allied POW. Several infiltrators were discovered by this method and none is known to have escaped detection in Luft III.|$|E
25|$|The {{marriage}} of Miss Jean Reid, daughter of Whitelaw Reid, American Ambassador to Great Britain, to the Hon. John Hubert Ward {{took place at}} the Church Chapel Royal, St. James Palace, this afternoon. Not since the Prince of Wales was married has a wedding ceremony taken place in circumstances of such pomp and majesty. After the wedding a reception was held at Dorchester House, to which all fashionable London and many Americans <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> accommodated at the chapel were invited.|$|E

25|$|During early June, 2,856 {{deportees}} {{were transferred}} to smaller settlements upstream the Nazina River, leaving just 157 deportees <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> moved for health reasons on the Nazino Island. Several hundred of the deportees died during the transfer; 1,500 – 2,000 deportees had died on the island, and hundreds of escapees had disappeared. People who survived the transfer found themselves with few tools, and little food in their new settlements, {{and there was an}} outbreak of typhus. Most deportees refused to work in the new settlements.|$|E
25|$|If {{the exact}} {{confidence}} intervals are used, then {{the margin of}} error takes into account both sampling error and non-sampling error. If an approximate confidence interval is used (for example, by assuming the distribution is normal and then modeling the confidence interval accordingly), then {{the margin of error}} may only take random sampling error into account. It does not represent other potential sources of error or bias such as a non-representative sample-design, poorly phrased questions, people lying or refusing to respond, the exclusion of people <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> contacted, or miscounts and miscalculations.|$|E
25|$|St Pancras Cemetery has a {{war graves}} plot {{containing}} over 100 graves from both world wars, {{together with a}} number of headstones retrieved from graves that were scattered elsewhere in the cemetery and could not be maintained. A memorial bears the names of 27 casualties whose graves could not be marked individually, and of six First World War casualties buried in adjacent Islington Cemetery <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> commemorated there. In total 299 First World War Commonwealth service casualties - including one unidentified Royal Navy sailor - and 207 Second World War casualties are commemorated or buried here. John Ross who gained the Victoria Cross is also buried here.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, this {{property}} {{was given to}} the state government to be used as an asylum for the blind. It gave shelter to the many poor blind in the south. Here they were taught skills that could help them support themselves in the future. In other instances those <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> rehabilitated were given a home and free meals thus keeping them from the streets where they could be in danger. The social functions carried out in this building continued until the mid-1970s when the structure was closed. The people of Ponce consider this structure to be important to the community's history for its role as hospital and asylum.|$|E
25|$|Charles Nungesser {{was born}} on 15 March 1892 in Paris and, as a child, was very {{interested}} in competitive sports. After attending the École des Arts et Métiers, where he was a mediocre student who nonetheless excelled in sports such as boxing, he went to South Americafirst to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to search for an uncle <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> located and then to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he worked as an auto mechanic before becoming a professional racer. His interest in racing soon led him to flying airplanes; Nungesser learned to fly by using a Blériot plane owned by a friend. After he eventually found his missing uncle, he worked on his sugar plantation in the Buenos Aires province.|$|E
25|$|One of Zhou's agents {{working in}} Nanjing, Qian Zhuangfei, intercepted a {{telegram}} requesting further instructions from Nanjing {{on how to}} proceed, and abandoned his cover to personally warn Zhou of the impending crackdown. The two days before Gu arrived in Nanjing to meet with Chiang gave Zhou time to evacuate Party members and to change the communication codes used by Teke, {{all of which were}} known to Gu. After meeting briefly with Chiang in Nanjing, Gu arrived in Shanghai and assisted the KMT secret police in raiding CCP offices and residences, capturing members <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> evacuated in time. The summary executions of those suspected of Communist sympathies resulted in the largest death-toll since the Shanghai massacre of 1927.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact Estonia was illegally annexed by the Soviet Union on 6 August 1940 and renamed the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1941, some 34,000 Estonians were drafted into the Red Army, of whom less than 30% survived the war. No {{more than half of}} those men were used for military service. The rest perished in Gulag concentration camps and labour battalions, mainly in the early months of the war. After {{it became clear that the}} German invasion of Estonia would be successful, political prisoners <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> evacuated were executed by the NKVD, so that they would not be able to make contact with the Nazi government. More than 300,000 citizens of Estonia, almost a third of the population at the time, were affected by deportations, arrests, execution and other acts of repression. As a result of the Soviet takeover, Estonia permanently lost at least 200,000 people or 20% of its population to repression, exodus and war.|$|E
25|$|After {{a chance}} meeting at which Edward Carson learnt of Law and Lansdowne's {{acceptance}} of possible resignation, he was spurred to ask Edward Goulding to beg Law and Lansdowne to compromise over {{the policy and}} remain as leaders. The compromise, known as the January Memorial, was agreed by Carson, James Craig, Law and Lansdowne at Law's house between 6–8 January 1913, affirming {{the support of the}} signatories for Law and his policies, and noting that his resignation was not wanted. Within two days 231 of the 280 Conservative MPs had signed it; 27 frontbenchers had not been invited, neither had five who were not in London, seven who were ill, the Speaker and a few others <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> found– only eight MPs actively refused to sign. Law's official response took the form of an open letter published on 13 January 1913, in which Law offered a compromise that food duties would not be placed before Parliament to vote on until after a second, approving election took place.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{dealing with}} unexploded {{ordnance}} {{dropped from the}} air, since the Second World War 5131 have been deployed {{to most of the}} major theatres that the UK armed forces have been involved in (Falkland Islands, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan). During the beach landings on the 27 May 1982 at San Carlos in the Falklands Conflict, one of the officers of 5131 (BD) Squadron, needed to assess some unexploded ordnance that was lodged in the walls of the field hospital, but had to wait until daylight to do so. To alleviate the worry for the patients <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> moved to safer medical care, he opted to sleep that night alongside the unexploded ordnance. In the Afghanistan conflict, members of 5131 (BD) Squadron were part of the Joint Force Counter-IED Task Force alongside the British Army bomb disposal experts although 5131 themselves are keen to point out that it is not their primary task. Counter IED operations remain the mainstay of the Royal Logistic Corps bomb disposal technicians.|$|E
25|$|The last {{eleven years}} of Pound's life accentuated his eccentricities, {{including}} a self-imposed vow of near-silence, with which Rudge coped while completely arranging {{his life and}} acting as his secretary. Many scholars and students sought Pound out and would arrive at the small house. Rudge devised a test to distinguish the genuine from the merely curious. She would ask the prospective visitor to recite a line from one of Pound's works; those <b>who</b> <b>could</b> gained admittance, those <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>were</b> shown out. For Rudge, life with Pound <b>was</b> <b>not</b> easy; yet, her belief in him was absolute.|$|R

5000|$|Europeans {{were struck}} by the Naga {{practice}} of headhunting. Ursula Graham Bower described the Naga hills as the [...] "paradise of headhunters." [...] "Most villages had a skull house and each man in the village was expected {{to contribute to the}} collection.
