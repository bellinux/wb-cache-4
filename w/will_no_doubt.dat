5|$|Fellow {{citizens}} & compatriots—I am besieged, by {{a thousand}} {{or more of}} the Mexicans under Santa Anna—I have sustained a continual Bombardment & cannonade for 24 hours & have not lost a man. The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion, otherwise, the garrison are to be put to the sword, if the fort is taken—I have answered the demand with a cannon shot, & our flag still waves proudly from the walls. I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism & everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid, with all dispatch—The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily & <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> increase to three or four thousand in four or five days. If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible & die like a soldier who never forgets what is due to his own honor & that of his country—'Victory or Death.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
25|$|It {{would have}} been easy, in regard to every statement, to allow the text to bristle with {{footnotes}} and references. In some chapters {{there is not a}} sentence but would have clamoured for these; and the letterpress {{would have been}} swallowed up by vast masses of comment, like one of those dreadful books we hated so much at school. There is a short bibliography {{at the end of the}} volume which <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> serve the same purpose.|$|E

25|$|VA {{disability}} {{benefits for}} PTSD have evolved over time, {{in response to}} legislation, scientific advances, political pressure, revised diagnostic classification schemes, regulatory changes, case law, and administrative decisions. Veterans advocacy organizations, researchers, clinicians, politicians, administrators, and citizens <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> continue to influence how the United States evaluates, adjudicates, and administers the program. For example, current efforts at change or reform include urging the VA to place more emphasis on vocational rehabilitation and treatment versus cash payments; revising the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders to better reflect problems experienced by veterans with PTSD; establishing a balance between efforts to decrease claims processing time (productivity) {{with the need for}} consistency and accuracy of examination results and rating decisions (quality); and considering a veteran's quality of life as a factor in determining the disability rating.|$|E

500|$|Sense and Sensibility has {{received}} overwhelmingly positive reviews from film critics, and was included {{on more than}} a hundred top-ten of the year lists. Writing for Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy observed that the film's success was assisted by its [...] "highly skilled cast of actors," [...] as well as its choice of Lee as director. McCarthy clarified, [...] "Although [...] previously revealed talents for dramatizing conflicting social and generational traditions <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> be noted, Lee's achievement here with such foreign material is simply well beyond what anyone could have expected and may well be posited as the cinematic equivalent of Kazuo Ishiguro writing The Remains of the Day." ...|$|E

[...] However, he argued that players who [...] "accept Hodj 'n' Podj in the spirit {{in which it is}} offered" [...] will derive [...] "considerable delight in playing it — {{especially}} if you have kids." [...] Computer Gaming Worlds Charles Ardai found the game's use of traditional games [...] "downright baffling", given their presence in past compilations, as well as in [...] and the Dr. Brain series. Although he enjoyed the game's graphics and humor, he summarized, [...] "You've seen all the puzzles before, often done better than they're done here. How jazzed can you get about Life or Solitaire, anyway?" ...|$|E
500|$|TJ of Neon Limelight gave a mixed review, {{calling it}} [...] "sassy" [...] but [...] "would work better {{for an artist}} {{at least a decade}} younger than Aguilera", with its [...] "painfully {{adolescent}} lyrics". Becky Bain of Idolator wrote, [...] "It's one of those pandering songs that <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> have young girls singing along, particularly the chorus, but it's a lazy one that leaves rubs us the wrong way." [...] Bradley Stern from MuuMuse named it a [...] "filler, including the noisy, childish chant." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commented that [...] "it's the kind of trite glitter-disco might've dispensed", while comparing it to Spice Girls' songs. Eric Henderson gave to the song a negative review, writing, [...] "Considering 'I Hate Boys' is closer than I ever thought Christina would ever come to recording a Daphne Aguilera track, it's ironically also one of many tracks on Bionic that sound tailor-made to accompany the opening credits of Johnny Weir's forthcoming reality show." ...|$|E
500|$|In contrast, {{the film}} {{gathered}} positive reviews from top critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times enjoyed {{the film and}} gave it {{three out of four}} stars, stating that [...] "Final Destination <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> be a hit and inspire the obligatory sequels. Like the original Scream, this movie is too good {{to be the end of}} the road. I have visions of my own". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying [...] " [...] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing". Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film, saying [...] " [...] generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong". Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film [...] "fitfully thrilling", while Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide defined the film as [...] "serviceable enough, if you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations".|$|E

500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the film to}} its predecessor, Dr. No, Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, said that From Russia with Love [...] "didn't seem quite so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving." [...] He {{went on to say}} that [...] "...the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. But it sure is fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most of us feel we might be doing..." [...] The critic thought that overall, [...] "the nonsense is all very amiable and tongue-in-cheek and <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> make a fortune for its devisers".|$|E
500|$|... "Rumors" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, however {{it has become}} one of Lohan's most recognized songs and has now been labeled as [...] "cult pop treasure". Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine thought that [...] "Rumors" [...] was not a good choice for a single, stating, [...] "in fact, for a girl, that has been tagged as America’s next sweetheart by some media outlets, it might be the worst choice of subject matter for the opening statement from a girl that automatically has more to prove to audiences because of her stature as an actress. Unfortunately, 'Rumors' is about as good as it gets." [...] Erik Missio of ChartAttack thought that the song [...] "presented potential for a semi-palatable debut effort", but further added that it is a [...] "crap of a spectularly unspectacular level." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Nicholas Fonseca, however, considered [...] "Rumors" [...] a guilty pleasure, while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic selected the song a Track Pick in the review of Speak. IGN's Spence D. described it as [...] "pervasively infectious, the kind of track that <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> keep the dance floors sweaty and steamy for a few months to come." [...] John Murphy of musicOMH praised [...] "Rumors" [...] as a departure from Speaks soft rock genre.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{commented that}} this episode {{might have been}} the [...] "best Tracy [...] episode of the season" [...] {{explaining}} that Tracy Morgan [...] "delivered one genius non sequitur after another describing the comically over-the-top horrors of his childhood. [...] The insane, eminently quotable one-liners were flying so fast and so furious that I could barely keep up with them." [...] In regards to Jack's love triangle, Rabin opined that this arc [...] "could easily have worn out its welcome long ago" [...] but that Alec Baldwin, Julianne Moore, and Elizabeth Banks [...] "have kept lively and vibrant." [...] In conclusion, he gave it an A− grade rating. Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive about Liz getting engaged, noting that she has become a woman, and concluded that [...] "it <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> be one of television's most memorable weddings" [...] if Liz and Wesley get married. Nick Catucci of New York magazine said that [...] "Emanuelle Goes to Dinosaur Land" [...] was good, [...] "aybe the best episode ever." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel said that Banks played her role [...] "perfectly", but that he was still not convinced that Sheen's Wesley is the right man for Liz.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} positive reception from critics. In the Blender magazine {{review of}} the album, critic Andy Greenwald, wrote: [...] "The title track , bursting with buzzing distortion, builds into a satisfying anti-glitz rant." [...] Tom Beajour of Entertainment Weekly reported that the song [...] "crams all of the genre's essential tropes — distorted power chords, abrupt dynamic shifts, and singsong melodies — into {{three and a half}} minutes of radio-friendly fire." [...] Chris Saunders of MusicOMH noted that the song is laden with [...] "memorable hooks, quiet/loud dynamics and emotive lyrics which <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> cut through to many a disenchanted youth: 'They gave you the end but not the where to start / not how to build, how to tear it apart.'" [...] Saunders concluded that the song [...] "is as lively and rousing as most of their best tracks." [...] Sputnikmusic wrote: [...] "The adventure is only on the second track [...] and the guys of Yellowcard are just getting started. This is by far the best tune on the album." [...] Bart Gottula of The Clarion wrote: [...] "The album's single and title cut, 'Light's and Sounds', follows with an amazing performance by every band member. The song provides a quick, hard-hitting beat that brings back Yellowcard's hybrid punk and emo music that the band explored in its previous single, 'Way Away'." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for his appearance on Question Time, Griffin researched the first appearance of Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams. In {{an e-mail to}} BNP supporters, Griffin said [...] "Never before have we {{had the chance to}} present our patriotic, common sense solutions to Britain's nightmare situation to the public at large in such prominent fashion ... I am relishing this opportunity, and I [...] know that ... the ordinary members, supporters and voters of the BNP will [...] be in the studio with me as I take on the corrupt, treacherous swine [...] destroying our beautiful island nation." [...] Contrasting to Griffin's earlier 2001 appearance on HARDtalk and later appearances on Newsnight with Jeremy Paxman, Griffin claimed that he was non-combative in his Question Time appearance in order to gain sympathy from the viewers via a [...] "root-for-the-underdog mentality". He had expected to salvage his reputation in expected a later 12 episodes of the programme with him appearing as a panellist, which did not occur. However, he also stated in a letter on the BNP website: [...] "I <b>will,</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> be interrupted, shouted down, slandered, put on the spot, and subjected to a scrutiny that would be a thousand times more intense than anything directed at other panellists. It will, in other words, be political blood sport. But I am relishing this opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|Music critics {{generally}} {{welcomed the}} video as {{for most of}} her time in the spotlight, Beyoncé has been a strictly private celebrity. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that it was pleasant to see Beyoncé unguarded as it is a rare occurrence. He added that though the clip is a more professional-looking than most people's home movies, it remains the closest thing that fans have seen so far to [...] "Bey just being Bey". Similarly, Brent Woodie of The Christian Post commented about how the 2008 wedding of Beyoncé to Jay-Z was kept very private; there were no photographs or videos released from the event, leaving media and gossip columnists to speculate on the nuptials. He welcomed the clip for being the first behind-the-scenes footage of Beyoncé on her wedding day. Luchina Fisher of ABC News described it as [...] "a home movie featuring highlights from Beyonce's decorated life" [...] and felt that it's [...] "the personal moments [...] the singer's fans <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> devour". Samantha Cortez of Daily News felt that the content of the video which included Beyoncé's most personal moments and the lyrics of the song, [...] "add even more sentiment to the video". At the 43rd NAACP Image Award presented on February 17, 2012, the video for [...] "I Was Here" [...] was nominated in the category for Outstanding Music Video.|$|E

50|$|I {{happen to}} feel that the book would have been {{infinitely}} better had it been edited down to say, 500 pages, but there speaks the harassed daily reviewer as well as the would-be judicious critic.

500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph {{stated that}} [...] "Wolverine is an {{artificial}} stimulus package {{of the most}} unsatisfying kind. Aggressively advertised and hyped to the hills, it <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> attract full houses at first; after that though, when word-of-mouth buzz-kill goes into overdrive, there’s bound to be widespread deflation and a palpable feeling of being conned." [...] Similarly, Orlando Parfitt of IGN (UK) praised the performances of the actors and the action scenes, but stated that the film felt underdeveloped: [...] "There's an enjoyable time to be had with Wolverine, but it's also somewhat unsatisfying." [...] Furthermore, Scott Mendelson of The Huffington Post gave the film a grade of [...] "D", noting that [...] "Wolverine was the lead character of [...] films, and we've already learned everything {{we need to know}} from the films in said franchise," [...] adding that [...] "the extra information given here actually serves to make the character of Logan/Wolverine less interesting." [...] Steven Rea also felt that the film injured the character by proving that [...] "how the hero acquired his special powers {{turns out to be a}} whole lot less interesting than what he does with them", while also being [...] "a mash-up of meaningless combat sequences (meaningless because Logan/Wolverine is just about unstoppable), sub-par visual effects, template backstory, and some goofy Liev Schreiber-as-a-villain thespianizing".|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} mixed reviews. Richard Lautens from Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "Madonna is a thorough, if slightly workmanlike, retelling of its namesake's well-documented slog from lowly Midwestern beginnings to squeaky-voiced sex kitten to professional button-pusher to mother and respected, vaguely Bowie-esque, chameleonic figure, a cultural bloodhound {{always on the}} scent of the fresh, cool and credible." [...] Helen Bushby from BBC commented that [...] "he book is certainly detailed, and <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> keep Madonna fanatics happy, although it is perhaps more of a reference book than a page-turner. But Morton is a good businessman, and is canny in his choice of subjects." [...] Michael Sneed from Chicago Sun-Times gave a negative review of the book and felt that Morton's previous works had been better. George Rush from New York Daily News commented: [...] "Despite her best efforts to discourage friends from cooperating with him, Andrew Morton has come forth with a book that portrays Madge as an insecure manipulator so ravenous for affection that she scared off some boyfriends, cheated on most of them and made a lot of foolish choices." [...] In another review, Sherryl Connelly from the same publication was of the opinion that Madonna was mostly similar to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography on her, [...] She added, [...] "At least, it's the story made familiar by Madonna, a woman who has always taken for granted the world's interest in her life." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{said that}} [...] "Saw VI is the thinnest, draggiest, and most tediously preachy of the Saw films. It's {{the first one}} that's more or less {{consumed}} by backstory—which is to say, it's one of those hollow franchise placeholders in which far too many fragments from the previous sequels keep popping up in flashbacks." [...] He said, [...] "If {{your goal is to}} do a quick study for a round of Saw Trivial Pursuit, then this may be the movie for you. If you're looking to be jolted into fear or queasy laughter, skip this sequel and hope that the producers get their sick act together next time." [...] Rob Nelson of Variety wrote, [...] "Squeezing another pint of blood from its torture-porn corpus, Lionsgate slays again with Saw VI, a film so frighteningly familiar it could well be called 'Saw It Already'. At least the requisite moralism is more playful than pious in this edition", but added, [...] "Presumably owing to director Kevin Greutert's work as editor of all five previous Saw pics, the film's juggling of chronology is the franchise's best...." [...] Christopher Monfette of IGN Movies rated Saw VI three out of five and wrote that [...] "while Saw VI certainly offers a redemption for the series and the promise of a coming power struggle for Jigsaw's legacy, Saw Ⅶ <b>will</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> mark the time to either shake things up or watch this franchise get the ax".|$|E
