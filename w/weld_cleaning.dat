By processing the steel through ESR with inoculation a marginal increase in strength and further increase in ductility and notch toughness can be obtained. The strength of the steel is inadequate for its use in fabrication of rocket motor casing in the Indian Space Programme. By increasing both carbon and chromium content of the AFNOR 15 CDV 6 steel strength can be increased, primarily as a cost effective for space launch vehicle applications.

40|$|Abstract — Glass lined {{reactor vessel}} for mixing and storage {{has a unique}} {{advantage}} of higher corrosion resistance, retention of product flavour and purity, improved heat transfer and less frequent <b>cleaning.</b> <b>Welding</b> close to the glass-lined surface is at times the unavoidable need. However, such needs are to be dealt critically as {{the rise in the}} temperature of the glass-lined surface can lead to a failure of glass-lining. This failure results in considerable delay as rework in lining the glass takes 5 - 7 days and it involves considerable extra cost of reworking. The glass lined reactor vessels are provided with jacket for thermal insulation. The jacket is welded to main vessel by a closure ring. CO 2 welding in the root run and Sub-merged Arc Welding (SAW) process for subsequent passes. The cooling time of 15 to 20 minutes is provided between the successive SAW passes so that the shell surface cools down and temperature does not exceed the failure limit of glass-lining. The temperature measurements were initially measured with infrared pyrometer and Results are compared with thermal analysis by FEA. We see in the final pass of SAW process the temperature exceeds 100 ˚C though the cooling time of 15 - 20 minutes is provided between the successive passes and temperature does not exceeds the failure limit of 150 ˚C as well as the 3 - 4 ˚C/min temperature difference in heating and cooling rates...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} was mainly concerned with characteristics of autogeneous laser butt welding of 2 [*]mm thickness nonheat treatableAA 5052 -H 12,AA 5083 -H 12 and 2 [*]mm, 3 [*]mm thickness heat treatableAA 6061 -T 6 aluminum alloys. The effect of laser <b>welding</b> parameters, surface <b>cleaning,</b> filler wire addition, and backing strip on quality of laser welded joints was clarified using 5 [*]kW CO 2 laser machine. It {{was found that}} all the investigated alloys showed tendencies for porosity and solidification cracking, particularly, at high welding speed (≥ 4 [*]m/min). Porosity was prevented by accurate cleaning of the base metal prior to welding and optimizing the flow rate of argon shielding gas. Solidification cracking was avoided through two different approaches. The first one {{is based on the}} addition of filler metal as reported in other research works. The other new approach is concerned with autogeneous welding using a backing strip from the same base metal, and this could be applicable in production. Preventing solidification cracking in both cases was related mainly to a considerable decrease in the stress concentration at the weld metal center as a result of improving the fusion zone profile. The implementation of the new approach could help in producing weldments with a better quality due to the absence of the filler metal, which is known as a source for hydrogen-related porosity. It can also have a positive economic aspect concerning the manufacturing cost since welding is done without the addition of filler metal. Not only quality and economic positive aspects could be achieved, but also high productivity is another feature since high quality autogeneous weldments were produced with high welding speed, 6 [*]m/min. Hardness measurements and tensile test of AA 6061 alloy welds indicated a remarkable softening of the fusion zone due to dissolution of the strengthening precipitates, and this was recovered by aging treatment after welding.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive, degenerative, {{neurological}} disease. The progressive disability {{associated with}} PD results in substantial burdens {{for those with}} the condition, their families and society in terms of increased health resource use, earnings loss of affected individuals and family caregivers, poorer quality of life, caregiver burden, disrupted family relationships, decreased social and leisure activities, and deteriorating emotional well-being. Currently, no cure is available and the efficacy of available treatments, such as medication and surgical interventions, decreases with longer duration of the disease. Whilst the cause of PD is unknown, genetic and environmental factors are believed to contribute to its aetiology. Descriptive and analytical epidemiological {{studies have been conducted}} in a number of countries in an effort to elucidate the cause, or causes, of PD. Rural residency, farming, well water consumption, pesticide exposure, metals and solvents have been implicated as potential risk factors for PD in some previous epidemiological studies. However, there is substantial disagreement between the results of existing studies. Therefore, the role of environmental exposures in the aetiology of PD remains unclear. The main component of this thesis consists of a case-control study that assessed the contribution of environmental exposures to the risk of developing PD. An existing, previously unanalysed, dataset from a local case-control study was analysed to inform the design of the new case-control study. The analysis results suggested that regular exposure to pesticides and head injury were important risk factors for PD. However, due to the substantial limitations of this existing study, further confirmation of these results was desirable with a more robustly designed epidemiological study. A new exposure measurement instrument (a structured interviewer-delivered questionnaire) was developed for the new case-control study to obtain data on demographic, lifestyle, environmental and medical factors. Prior to its use in the case-control study, the questionnaire was assessed for test-retest repeatability in a series of 32 PD cases and 29 healthy sex-, age- and residential suburb-matched electoral roll controls. High repeatability was demonstrated for lifestyle exposures, such as smoking and coffee/tea consumption (kappas 0. 70 - 1. 00). The majority of environmental exposures, including use of pesticides, solvents and exposure to metal dusts and fumes, also showed high repeatability (kappas > 0. 78). A consecutive series of 163 PD case participants was recruited from a neurology clinic in Brisbane. One hundred and fifty-one (151) control participants were randomly selected from the Australian Commonwealth Electoral Roll and individually matched to the PD cases on age (± 2 years), sex and current residential suburb. Participants ranged in age from 40 - 89 years (mean age 67 years). Exposure data were collected in face-to-face interviews. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated using conditional logistic regression for matched sets in SAS version 9. 1. Consistent with previous studies, ever having been a regular smoker or coffee drinker was inversely associated with PD with dose-response relationships evident for packyears smoked and number of cups of coffee drunk per day. Passive smoking from ever having lived with a smoker or worked in a smoky workplace was also inversely related to PD. Ever having been a regular tea drinker was associated with decreased odds of PD. Hobby gardening was inversely associated with PD. However, use of fungicides in the home garden or occupationally was associated with increased odds of PD. Exposure to <b>welding</b> fumes, <b>cleaning</b> solvents, or thinners occupationally was associated with increased odds of PD. Ever having resided in a rural or remote area was inversely associated with PD. Ever having resided on a farm was only associated with moderately increased odds of PD. Whilst the current study’s results suggest that environmental exposures on their own are only modest contributors to overall PD risk, the possibility that interaction with genetic factors may additively or synergistically increase risk should be considered. The results of this research support the theory that PD has a multifactorial aetiology and that environmental exposures are some of a number of factors to contribute to PD risk. There was also evidence of interaction between some factors (eg smoking and welding) to moderate PD risk...|$|R
40|$|Wall-climbing robots {{have been}} widely used in fields of inspection, {{building}} <b>cleaning,</b> <b>welding,</b> and so on. These robots can freely move on surfaces with various inclinations, e. g. vertical walls and ceilings. In addition to fundamental locomotion (e. g. wheels, tracks and legs) for robot mobility, a wall-climbing robot must counter the force of gravity for firmly adhering to the inclined work surface by employing adhesion mechanisms (e. g. vacuum suction, magnetic adhesion, etc). In the past decades, various adhesion and locomotion mechanisms have been developed for wall-climbing robots. In practical applications, one of the greatest challenges for wall-climbing robots is to develop optimum adhesion and locomotion mechanisms which enable wall-climbing robots to freely move on various types of complex shaped structure surfaces with various inclined walls, such as milk tanks, ventilation ducts, and so on. This study aims to design and develop a compact and reliable wall-climbing robot with high mobility on complex shaped walls, such as passing 90  convex and concave obstacles with any inclination regarding the gravity, for the inspections of ducts, tanks, bridges, etc. Firstly an overview of the state-of-the-art of the research and development of wall-climbing robots around the world is given. The advantages and disadvantages of various adhesion and locomotion mechanisms are comprehensively discussed for wall-climbing robots for different applications. A modular wall-climbing inspection robot is proposed. The modular design allows the robot to be easily scaled by changing the number of wheeled modules to be joined together. The active joint is able to fold the robot modules to pass various obstacles. General-purpose vacuum suction is employed to enable robot to adhere to various (e. g. metal, wood, glasses, concrete and plastics) structure surfaces. A two-module wall-climbing robot prototype was developed by using SolidWorks. Mechanic design and kinetics analysis of a two-module robot are presented. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed wall-climbing robot is capable of freely moving on complex shaped walls. Furthermore, for ferromagnetic structures (such as ships, bridges, steel tanks, and so on), the modular wall-climbing robot with magnetic adhesion is investigated. Compared with general-purpose vacuum suction, magnetic adhesion offers an energy-saving and reliable adhesion solution. Mechanical design and kinetics analysis of a two-module robot with built-in electromagnetic adhesion are given. Simulations validate such an alternative robot design. The major contributions of this thesis include: A modular wall-climbing inspection robot is proposed. The advantages of the proposed robot include high mobility on complex shaped walls, simple structure, easy control, good reliability, low cost, and being scalable. Two types of two-module wall-climbing robot prototypes with different adhesion mechanisms are designed and developed. The robot with general-purpose vibration adhesion mechanism is applicable to the climbing of various structure walls, while the robot with electromagnetic adhesion mechanism offers an optimal climbing device for ferromagnetic walls. Comprehensive design, kinematic analysis and simulations of the two-module wall-climbing robots are successfully completed...|$|R
40|$|Automakers are {{increasingly}} using aluminum for structural applications {{in order to}} reduce vehicle weight and improve fuel efficiency. However, aluminum bodied cars have largely been confined to lower-volume, niche markets {{due in part to the}} number of challenges associated with welding of aluminum in comparison with steel. Therefore, a need exists for new joining processes which can produce high-quality welds in thin aluminum sheet at high production rates and low cost. The recently invented double-sided arc welding (DSAW) process is one such joining process. It has been shown to be capable of producing high quality butt-joint configuration welds in thin aluminum sheet and thick steel plate. In DSAW, an arc is initiated across two torches that are mounted on either side of the workpiece, allowing it to be welded from both sides. The objective of this research was to determine the feasibility and merits of using the DSAW process to produce seam and spot welds in thin aluminum sheet in the lap-joint configuration. The double-sided arc welding (DSAW) apparatus used in the present study was powered by a single square wave alternating current variable polarity power supply to produce an arc across two liquid cooled, plasma arc welding torches. This equipment was used to produce a series of conduction-mode DSAW seam and spot welds in 1 mm thick and 1. 5 mm thick AA 5182 -O and AA 6111 sheet in the lap-joint configuration. Metallographic analysis was used to characterize the microstructure of the welds, while microhardness and tensile tests were used to characterize the mechanical properties. Since hydrogen is easily absorbed by molten aluminum, all weld specimens must be cleaned prior to welding in order to produce high quality, pore-free welds. Although previous studies had shown that the specimens could be sufficiently cleaned by degreasing and wire brushing them prior to <b>welding,</b> this <b>cleaning</b> procedure was not found to be adequate for the specimens used in this study and a more aggressive cleaning technique was required. A number of different specimen pre-cleaning techniques were examined, and a combination of degreasing, deoxidizing, and manual wire brushing was found to produce the least amount of porosity in bead-on-plate welds produced in 1. 5 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheet. Further reductions in porosity were accomplished by redesigning the shielding gas cup of the top Thermal Arc torch to promote more laminar gas flow and generate a more evenly distributed shielding gas plume. Using the redesigned shielding gas cup, a shielding gas flow rate of 10 lpm was found to provide good coverage of the weld pool and produce virtually pore-free welds. The feasibility of using the DSAW process to produce spot welds in 1 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheet in the lap-joint configuration was examined by producing a series of spot welds over a range of welding powers and weld times. Weld nuggets were produced using a welding current as low as 50 A with a cycle time of one second. However, all of the welds exhibited a pinhole at the centre of the nugget which penetrated through the entire thickness of the specimen, regardless of welding current and cycle time used. Solidification shrinkage porosity and crater cracking were also observed near the centerline of the welds. Hydrogen gas porosity and oxide tails were also observed in the welds. These defects were found to decrease the strength and quality of the spot welds made between 1 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheets in the lap-joint configuration. A series of welds were made to determine if the DSAW process could be used to produce seam welds in 1 mm thick AA 5182 -O sheet in the lap-joint configuration. Visually acceptable, crack-free welds were produced using welding powers ranging from 2. 0 kW to 5. 1 kW, at welding speeds between 10 mm/s and 70 mm/s. Welds produced within this range of welding conditions were found to possess excellent cathodic cleaning on both sides of the workpiece, a smooth weld bead, and a columnar-to-equiaxed grain transition. However, transverse cross-sections of the specimens revealed varying amounts of oxide entrainment in the weld metal which was seen most frequently as unbroken interface oxide sheets or tails at the fusion boundaries. Often times, small clusters of porosity were found to nucleate along the oxide tails. This suggested that there was insufficient fluid flow in the weld to disrupt the pre-existing oxide sheets at the interface between the sheets. Careful specimen pre-cleaning using a combination of degreasing, deoxidizing, and manual stainless steel wire brushing was found to reduce, but not eliminate the oxide tails. Microhardness testing revealed that the microhardness was relatively consistent across the weld metal, heat-affected zone (HAZ), and base metal. In a series of tensile-shear tests, all of the welded specimens were observed to fail in the weld metal, within 1 mm of the fusion boundary. Another series of seam welds were produced between 1 mm thick AA 6111 and 1 mm thick AA 5182 sheets in the lap-joint configuration to explore the nature and intensity of fluid flow in the molten weld pool responsible for breaking oxide tails. The difference in magnesium content between the two alloys produces a different microstructure and response to chemical etching, thereby revealing any effects of fluid motion in the weld pool. Relatively weak buoyancy driven fluid flow was observed when the AA 6111 sheet was placed on top of the AA 5182 sheet, and some minor stirring was seen between the two sheets. When the slightly less dense AA 5182 sheet was placed above the AA 6111 sheet, very little fluid flow was observed and the two alloys remained unmixed. Overall, the weld pool formed during DSAW was found to be very quiescent. This suggests that the normally strong Marangoni and Lorentz force induced flow seen in other arc welding processes does not occur in the double-sided arc weld pool. This leaves only a very weak buoyancy driven fluid flow which is incapable of disrupting the pre-existing oxide at the interface between the sheets immediately adjacent to the fusion zone boundary. Overall the DSAW process was found to be capable of producing visually acceptable lap-joint configuration seam welds in AA 5182 -O sheet over a wide range of welding speeds and welding powers, provided that the pre-existing oxide and any other surface contaminants were chemically removed prior to welding...|$|R
