The outer ring, which is built of load-bearing brick, includes all four exterior {{walls and the}} library carrel spaces immediately inside them. The middle ring, which is built of reinforced concrete, holds the heavy book stacks. The inner ring is a dramatic atrium <b>with</b> <b>enormous</b> circular openings in its walls that reveal several floors of book stacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{legend of}} Sharabha as an {{incarnation}} of Shiva is narrated in many Hindu scriptures and each presents a different version to suit one’s religious beliefs. But one common refrain {{in all these}} depictions is that Sharabha {{is a combination of}} a huge animal-bird beast <b>with</b> <b>enormous</b> strength manifested with the purpose of pacifying similar ferocious avatars of Vishnu such as Narasimha (man-lion) or Varaha (the boar).|$|E
5|$|He {{was a most}} {{delightful}} man, {{a bizarre}} hidalgo <b>with</b> <b>enormous</b> moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style, and button boots which he used to rap my shins when I didn't change the pedalling enough.... I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, {{he was the only}} virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I owe him everything... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.|$|E

5|$|In Greek folklore, a stikhio (στοιχείο) was {{a spirit}} that {{protected}} his territory against the adverse stikhio spirits from other territories. In Albanian tradition, a dragoi was a dragon-man <b>with</b> <b>enormous</b> {{strength and the}} power to fly; he was born with a caul. He saved his region from a kuçedra or kulshedra, a female serpentine demon. In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could be controlled by an evil sorcerer called a şolomonar, who was able to ride on that demon. The notion of a şolomonar named a vîlva, who protected his village against attacks of vîlvas from other villages, was marginally encountered in some places of Romanian Banat.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{initially}} {{formed in}} a neighborhood {{just south of the}} downtown area; after demolishing a section of the downtown area, it moved on to the schools. The tornado then continued northeast crossing the Holly Hill and Dixie Drive areas. A quarter-mile-wide (400m) swath was devastated, <b>with</b> <b>enormous</b> damage reported to many houses and businesses, some of which were flattened. Several other schools and the local YMCA were among the damaged buildings. According to the Red Cross, 239 homes were destroyed, 374 sustained major damage, 529 sustained minor damage, and 251 homes were affected.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Algeciras on 9 July, the {{combined}} squadron {{was ready to}} sail again on 12 July, departing Algeciras to the westwards during the evening. The British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir James Saumarez, having effected its own hasty repairs, set off in pursuit. Finding that his ships were falling behind, Saumarez instructed his captains to separate and attack {{the combined}} squadron as best they were able to. The fastest ship was HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, which sailed through the Spanish rearguard as a moonless night fell. Superb fired on the rearmost ships, setting the 112-gun Real Carlos on fire and capturing the Saint Antoine. Unable to determine friend from foe in the darkness, Real Carlos inadvertently engaged the Spanish ship San Hermenegildo, spreading the fire to its compatriot. Both ships subsequently exploded <b>with</b> <b>enormous</b> loss of life. A second stage of the battle then developed, as HMS Venerable took {{the lead of the}} British line, attacking the rearmost French ship Formidable under Captain Amable Troude. In a furious and protracted engagement, Venerable suffered heavy damage and was driven ashore, allowing the remainder of the French force to return to Cadiz without further fighting.|$|E

5|$|The Abbasid victory near Hama did not {{yet fully}} {{eradicate}} the Qarmatians from the area. Taking advantage {{of the absence of}} the local governor, Ahmad ibn Kayghalagh, who went to suppress a revolt in Egypt, in 906, a part of the Banu Kalb Bedouin rose up in rebellion, led by the Qarmatian Abu Ghanim, called Nasr. They raided the Hawran and Tiberias, and launched an attack on Damascus. Although they defeated its garrison, they could not take the city itself, and moved onto Tiberias, which they pillaged. Al-Husayn ibn Hamdan was sent to pursue them, but they withdrew to the desert and poisoned the water holes behind them and escaped. On 16 June 906, they attacked Hit on the Euphrates. The generals Muhammad ibn Ishaq ibn Kundajiq and Mu'nis al-Khadim marched against them from Baghdad, while al-Husayn ibn Hamdan moved against them from the west, trying to encircle them. To escape their predicament, the Bedouin killed Nasr and received a pardon by the caliphal authorities. The remaining Qarmatians moved south to Kufa, on the orders of the chief missionary Zikrawayh ibn Mihrawayh. On 2 October they launched an attack on the city, but although repulsed, they defeated a relief army sent from Baghdad to aid Kufa. Zikrawayh then marched to attack the caravans returning from the pilgrimage to Mecca. In November, three caravans where overwhelmed; the Qarmatians massacred indiscriminately—some 20,000 were reportedly killed in the second caravan alone—and carried off women and children as slaves, along <b>with</b> <b>enormous</b> booty. Finally, in early January 907, caliphal troops under Wasif ibn Sawartakin caught the Qarmatians near al-Qadisiyya and destroyed them. With these defeats, the Qarmatian movement virtually ceased to exist in the Syrian Desert, although their counterparts in Bahrayn remained an active threat for several decades to come.|$|E

25|$|Critics often cite certain {{works by}} García Márquez, such as A Very Old Man <b>with</b> <b>Enormous</b> Wings and One Hundred Years of Solitude, as {{exemplary}} of magic realism, {{a style of}} writing in which the supernatural is presented as mundane, and the mundane as supernatural or extraordinary.

25|$|Although Garrick {{restored}} {{a considerable}} amount of Shakespeare's text in 1756, it was by no means a complete return to Shakespeare, and he continued to play Tate's Lear in some form {{to the end of his}} career.

When the magazine blamed the theatrical team of Klaw & Erlanger for Chicago's grisly Iroquois Theater Fire in 1903, a national uproar ensued. Life drama critic, James Stetson Metcalfe, was barred from the 47 Manhattan theatres controlled by the Theatrical Syndicate. Life published caricatured cartoons of Jews <b>with</b> <b>enormous</b> noses.|$|E

25|$|Alford’s most {{speculative}} idea is {{that the}} King’s Chamber generated low frequency sound via its ‘airshafts’, the purpose being to re-enact the sound of the earth splitting open at the time of creation. This theory is an attempt to explain the builders’ use of stacked roofs <b>with</b> <b>enormous</b> granite beams above the chamber’s ceiling. Egyptologists, however, do not see a mystery in these roofs and would therefore reject this as an unnecessary hypothesis.|$|E
