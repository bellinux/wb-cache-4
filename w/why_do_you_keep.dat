500|$|In September 1510, a {{group of}} Dominican friars arrived in Santo Domingo led by Pedro de Córdoba; appalled by the injustices they saw {{committed}} by the slaveowners against the Indians, they decided to deny slave owners the right to confession. Las Casas was among those denied confession for this reason. In December 1511, a Dominican preacher Fray Antonio de Montesinos preached a fiery sermon that implicated the colonists in the genocide of the native peoples. He {{is said to have}} preached, [...] "Tell me by what right of justice do you hold these Indians in such a cruel and horrible servitude? On what authority have you waged such detestable wars against these people who dealt quietly and peacefully on their own lands? Wars in which you have destroyed such an infinite number of them by homicides and slaughters never heard of before. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> them so oppressed and exhausted, without giving them enough to eat or curing them of the sicknesses they incur from the excessive labor you give them, and they die, or rather you kill them, in order to extract and acquire gold every day." [...] Las Casas himself argued against the Dominicans in favour of the justice of the encomienda. The colonists, led by Diego Columbus, dispatched a complaint against the Dominicans to the King, and the Dominicans were recalled from Hispaniola.|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, Clough recounts a {{dressing}} down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was}} going to gay bars. [...] "'Where do you go if you want a loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you go if you want a leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> going to that bloody poofs' club?"' ...|$|E
2500|$|Clough's time at Forest {{saw him at}} {{odds with}} Justin Fashanu, whose goals and then {{confidence}} dried up as he failed {{to fit in with}} Clough's playing and lifestyle demands after signing for them in 1981. When Clough learned of Fashanu's homosexuality (which was not made public until 1990), he barred Fashanu from training with the side. In his autobiography, Clough recounted a dressing down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was going to}} gay bars. [...] "'Where do you go if you want a loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you go if you want a leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> going to that bloody poofs' club?'" [...] It was also in this book that he admitted his one regret was leaving Derby County.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> it from me?" [...] And that gnashing of {{the teeth}} took place {{which was so}} {{specially}} objectionable to Mrs George.|$|R
6000|$|ELIZABETH. God's death! and {{wherefore}} spake you not before? We dally {{with our}} lazy moments here, And hers are number'd. Horses there, without! I am much beholden to the King, your master. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> me prating? Horses, there! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> {{on working}} {{at such a}} place as this?" [...] Frank asked. [...] "Why didn't you go on wages? There are plenty of men here who {{would be glad to}} take on an extra hand if they could get him." ...|$|R
2500|$|In August 1944, {{some of the}} arrested {{perpetrators}} of the failed assassination of Adolf Hitler were taken before Freisler for punishment. [...] The proceedings were filmed {{to be seen by}} the German public in cinema newsreels, portraying how Freisler ran his court, showing him alternating between cerebral questioning of the defendants, with clinical interrogations to prove their guilt of the charges, and verbally and psychologically toying with them to the point of enraged hysterical screaming of personal abuse at them from the bench. At one point he yelled at Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben, who was trying to hold his trousers up after being given old oversized and beltless clothing, [...] "You dirty old man, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> fiddling with your trousers?" [...] Nearly all were sentenced to death by hanging, the sentences being carried out within 2 hours of the verdicts.|$|E
2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll forget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do you say this to me? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> saying these things to me every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E
2500|$|Justin Fashanu, {{the first}} black £1 million footballer, was the first footballer to be openly gay. In his autobiography, Brian Clough recounts a {{dressing}} down he gave Fashanu after hearing rumours {{that he was going}} to gay bars. [...] "'Where do you go if you want a loaf of bread?' I asked him. 'A baker's, I suppose.' 'Where do you go if you want a leg of lamb?' 'A butcher's.' 'So <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> going to that bloody poofs' club?"' Fashanu committed suicide in 1998 after he was questioned by police when a seventeen-year-old boy accused him of sexual assault, and it has been suggested that the tragedy and hostility that struck his life after publicly coming out persuaded other gay footballers that coming out would not be a good idea. The coroner said the prejudices he experienced, plus the sexual assault charge he was facing at the time of his death, probably overwhelmed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give {{me a few}} minutes," [...] I said, [...] "and {{you shall}} hear it all. I can't talk of myself, yet--I can only talk of <b>you.</b> Oh, Lucilla, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> away from Grosse? Come with me to him to-day. Let him try what he can do. At once, my love--before it is too late!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{had known}} you were living, Susan! But there was {{every reason to}} suppose you and the child were dead and gone. I took every {{possible}} step to find you--travelled--advertised. My opinion at last was that you had started for some colony with that man, and had been drowned on your voyage. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> silent like this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not warn me of this?" [...] he demanded. [...] "And <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> such a {{precious}} power {{in an old}} shoe? And why didn't you put the shoe under a pillow? You were very wrong, my lad, in not confiding to me, your faithful friend, the secret, for in that case the shoe would not now be lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{beautiful}} they are," [...] whispered Eva, [...] "but, dear Rose-Leaf, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> them here, and why {{call you}} this your fairest sight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BARBARA. Then <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> {{thinking}} about it? Why does it keep coming up against {{you in your}} mind? You're not getting converted, are you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope to God she'll come, or {{this night}} {{will be nothing}} but misery to me! Oh my darling, my darling, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> me in {{suspense}} like this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MICH. Ay, you! You knew it, none better. Such {{weapons as}} these are not forged in a day. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not tell us of it? A week ago there had been time [25]to lay the mine, to raise the barricade, to strike one blow at least for liberty.[25] But now the hour is past. It is too late, [26]it is too late![26] <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> it a secret from us, I say? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The question,' {{returned}} Wegg, {{with a sort}} of joyful affability, 'why I didn't mention sooner, that I {{had found}} something. Says your speaking countenance to me: [...] "Why didn't you communicate that, when I first come in this evening? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> it back till you thought Mr Boffin had come to look for the article?" [...] Your speaking countenance,' said Wegg, 'puts it plainer than language. Now, you can't read in my face what answer I give?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These {{toys are}} wonderfully bright and pretty. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>keep</b> them for yourself? It's a pity {{to give them}} to those noisy boys and fretful girls, who break and destroy them so quickly." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Ramsey: [...] "They will {{when they}} find how nice it is. But <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> standing? Sit down, if it's only for a moment. There is {{something}} I {{would like to talk}} with you about. What were you saying when you came in? I didn't catch it quite." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Angel retreated {{a step or}} so as the Vicar came nearer and nearer in {{his attempt}} to be {{diplomatic}} and confidential. The beautiful face grew perplexed. [...] "I don't quite understand. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> making these noises in your throat? Is it Die or Eat, or any of those...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{are you so}} cruel? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> me dansing on the stepps {{before them}} gurls at the windows? Was it that stuckup Saint, Miss Brooks, that you were afraid of, my deer? Oh, you faithless trater! Wait till I ketch you! I'll tear your eyes out and hern!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank goodness! <b>Why</b> {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> him gossiping all that time? Now then--'Who can number the clouds in wisdom----'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} gone to him when he called me!" [...] Isabel answered. [...] "Then I would have been there--when it happened. Oh, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> me from going?" [...] For the first time Dr. Judkin felt unable to control his patient's wife. She was like another woman refusing to accept either advice or sympathy. Even the boy was now forgotten. But remembering the long {{previous}} strain to which she had been subjected, he forgave her. He realized the strength of her love, while he considered every available means for reaching the burning city at once. Finally he could no longer resist Isabel's mute pleading. Outside of professional obligation he seemed to see that she had suffered enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "You very foolish person," [...] she repeated. [...] "Stop, though. Why {{all this}} mystery? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> try to <b>keep</b> that letter from me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Throw away, Huron," [...] he cried, [...] "or your {{tomahawk}} {{will forget}} its ar'n'd. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> loping about like a fa'a'n that's showing its dam {{how well it}} can skip, when you're a warrior grown, yourself, and a warrior grown defies you and all your silly antiks. Throw, or the Huron gals will laugh in your face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know I care {{little for}} carnal weapons," [...] he said quietly. She DID know it; {{but it is}} the {{privilege}} of the sex to invent its facts and then to graciously abandon {{them as if they were}} only arguments. [...] "Then <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> off from me? Why do you look the other way when I pass?" [...] she said quickly.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-night," [...] she said, {{looking up}} into his face and {{dropping}} her voice a little, [...] "I am feeling so much happier--happier than I have felt for a long time. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> us both, Mr. Thew, {{in such a state}} of uneasiness? You give us so little of your real confidence, so little of your real self. Sometimes it seems as though you deliberately try to make yourself out a harder, crueller person than you really are. Why do you do that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He was as obstinate as ever. [...] "I say, Yes! If you're not afraid, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> wish to <b>keep</b> our {{engagement}} from my mother's knowledge?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{this the}} sort of justice you were sent to Middelburg to {{administer}} in my name? Is this how you dishonour me? If you conceived him guilty, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> sign this and upon what terms? Bah, I know the terms. And having made such foul terms, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>keep</b> your part of the bargain, evil as it was?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Charley, my boy!" [...] he exclaimed, [...] "you've come at last--God bless you! Let's look at you. Quite changed: six feet; no, {{not quite}} changed--the old nose; black as an Indian. O Charley, my dear boy! I've {{been waiting for}} <b>you</b> for months; <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> me so long, eh? Hang it, where's my handkerchief?" [...] At this last exclamation Mr Kennedy's {{feelings}} quite overcame him; his full heart overflowed at his eyes, {{so that when he}} tried to look at his son, Charley appeared partly magnified and partly broken up into fragments. Fumbling in his pocket for the missing handkerchief, which he did not find, he suddenly seized his fur cap, in a burst of exasperation, and wiped his eyes with that. Immediately after, forgetting that it was a cap, he thrust it into his pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack, I {{am getting}} heartily tired of this. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> on harking {{back to the}} subject when I have spoken so plainly? Whether I shall ever feel towards any other man as I did towards you, to my sorrow, I cannot say; but this I can say, even if that dead feeling I once had for you should come to life again, it would avail you nothing. I shall say no more--except one thing, which you had better know. I shall always be friendly, and shall never think about the past unless you {{yourself}} remind me of it, as you did just now. This much you owe to Fan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Princess {{was such}} a {{wonderful}} Princess {{that she had the}} power of knowing secrets, and she said to the tiny woman, <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> it there? This showed her directly that the Princess knew why she lived all alone by herself spinning at her wheel, and she kneeled down at the Princess's feet, and asked her never to betray her. So the Princess said, I never will betray you. Let me see it. So the tiny woman closed the shutter of the cottage window and fastened the door, and trembling from head to foot for fear that any one should suspect her, opened a very secret place and showed the Princess a shadow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, fear not," [...] she continued, [...] "fear {{not that}} I should {{entertain}} hope! Yet tell me, {{have you found}} him? To have him once more in my arms, to see him, however changed, is all I desire. Though Constantinople be heaped above him as a tomb, yet I must find him--then cover us with the city's weight, with a mountain piled above--I care not, so that one grave hold Raymond and his Perdita." [...] Then weeping, she clung to me: [...] "Take me to him," [...] she cried, [...] "unkind Lionel, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> me here? Of myself I cannot find him --but {{you know where he}} lies--lead me thither." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not feel}} better, thank you. And why should I wish to <b>do</b> so? <b>You</b> all take too much trouble about me; <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>keep</b> me here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] he said, [...] "you {{are out of}} temper, {{and that}} is a bad thing. Now listen to me! You are in my power. I have only to go into the City to-morrow and breathe here and there a word about a certain old gentleman who shall be nameless, and you would be a ruined man in {{something}} less than an hour; added to this, my friend, you would most certainly be arrested for conspiracy and fraud. That Syndicate of yours was a very smart stroke of business, no doubt, and it was clever of <b>you</b> to <b>keep</b> me in ignorance of it, but as things have turned out now, that will be your condemnation. They will say, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> me in ignorance of this move, and the answer--why, it is very clear! I knew you were selling what was not yours to sell!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{gazed at}} her with a curious glance. [...] "Then <b>why,</b> dear lady, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> telling me he is cruel?" [...] I inquired, {{toasting}} my feet on the fender. [...] "It seems contradictory." ...|$|R
