500|$|Andrew Stanton {{conceived}} WALL-E {{during a}} lunch with fellow writers John Lasseter, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft in 1994. Toy Story was near completion and the writers brainstormed ideas {{for their next}} projects—A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc., and Finding Nemo—at this lunch. Stanton asked, [...] "What if mankind had to leave Earth and somebody forgot {{to turn off the}} last robot?" [...] Having struggled for many years with making the characters in Toy Story appealing, Stanton found his simple Robinson Crusoe-esque idea of a lonely robot on a deserted planet strong. Stanton made WALL-E a <b>waste</b> <b>collector</b> as the idea was instantly understandable, and because it was a low-status menial job that made him sympathetic. Stanton also liked the imagery of stacked cubes of garbage. He did not find the idea dark because having a planet covered in garbage was for him a childish imagining of disaster.|$|E
500|$|The album's second parody, [...] "Trash Day", is {{a parody}} of [...] "Hot in Herre" [...] by Nelly. In this song, the narrator {{discusses}} the filthiness of his house and bemoans the titular day wherein people place their garbage outside of their living quarters {{to be picked up}} by a <b>waste</b> <b>collector</b> and brought to a landfill. [...] "A Complicated Song" [...] is spoof of [...] "Complicated" [...] by Avril Lavigne. The song is composed of three vignettes: in the first, the singer laments that he ate too much pizza and has thus become constipated, in the second, he discovers that his girlfriend is actually his cousin, and in the third, he expresses regret that he recently was decapitated after he stood up on a roller coaster ride. [...] "Ode to a Super Hero" [...] is a play on Billy Joel's song [...] "Piano Man", and recounts to the plot to the 2002 Spider-Man film.|$|E
500|$|The Monster was Crane's {{first story}} to feature the fictional town of Whilomville; it would {{eventually}} {{serve as the}} setting of 14 stories, 13 of which would appear in the 1900 anthology Whilomville Stories. [...] The town was based on Port Jervis, New York, where the author lived {{from the age of}} six to eleven. [...] Although Crane and his mother relocated to Asbury Park, New Jersey in 1880, until 1896 he frequently stayed with his older brother and Port Jervis resident William Howe Crane. Crane admitted to his publishers that while he readily used Port Jervis as inspiration while writing The Monster, he was anxious to ensure that the residents of his previous hometown did not recognize themselves in the fictional Whilomville. While Crane biographer Thomas Beer claimed to trace the prototype of Henry Johnson to a Port Jervis teamster named Levi Hume, Crane's niece, Edna Crane Sidbury, believed the character and his disfigurement were influenced by a local <b>waste</b> <b>collector</b> whose face was damaged by cancer. [...] In Black Frankenstein: The Making of an American Metaphor, author Elizabeth Young theorized that Crane may also have been inspired by popular freak show attractions such as Zip the Pinhead, whose real name was William Henry Johnson, and Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man. It is also possible that Crane found thematic inspiration in Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People; although first published in 1882, the play—about a physician who finds himself ostracized by his community—first became popular in the United States in the mid-1890s.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{collection}} of recyclable waste materials {{is a widespread}} activity among the urban poor. Today, this occupation attracts an increasingly large number of individuals. Despite its economic and environmental importance, this activity is associated with unsafe and unhealthy working conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the seroepidemiological profile of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a population of recyclable <b>waste</b> <b>collectors</b> in central Brazil. Methods: Recyclable <b>waste</b> <b>collectors</b> from all 15 recycling cooperatives in Goi&# 226;nia City were invited to participate in the study. The participants (n = 431) were interviewed and screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs) and hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HBsAg- and anti-HBc-positive samples were tested for HBV DNA and genotyped. Results: The overall prevalence of HBV infection (HBsAg- and/or anti-HBc-positive) was 12. 8 %. An age over 40 years and illicit drug use were associated with HBV infection. HBV DNA was detected in 2 / 3 HBsAg-positive samples and in 1 / 52 anti-HBc-positive/HBsAg-negative samples (an occult HBV infection rate of 1. 9 %), in which the genotypes/subgenotypes A/A 1, D/D 3 and F/F 2 were identified. Only 12. 3 % of the recyclable <b>waste</b> <b>collectors</b> had serological evidence of previous HBV vaccination. Conclusions: These findings highlight the vulnerability of recyclable <b>waste</b> <b>collectors</b> to HBV infection and reinforce the importance of public health policies that address the health and safety of this socially vulnerable population...|$|R

40|$|M. A. This {{research}} {{investigates the}} contribution of informal <b>waste</b> <b>collectors</b> in the Johannesburg Metropolitan city to solid waste collection and disposal and the local economy. The areas examined were Braamfontein, Killarney and Newtown. Notwithstanding the negative health effects associated with informal waste collection {{and the fact that}} informal <b>waste</b> <b>collectors</b> are neglected by many governments and stakeholders in developing countries in general and in South Africa in particular, evidence from elsewhere has shown that this activity fosters considerable social, environmental and economic benefits that should be preserved. Informal waste collection also contributes to reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) through recycling processes. Despite this, they are harassed by the Metro Police and stereotyped as {{the poorest of the poor}} by the public. Thus, the role that they play in the waste management system and in alleviating urban poverty is often disregarded by the public. The method used for this research study made use of qualitative and quantitative research results. A literature review of international research relating to informal waste collecting was conducted. Primary and secondary sources of information were consulted, with particular attention being directed to relevant and credible articles about informal waste collection written by various scholars worldwide, published journals, books and the outcomes of interviews with key informants. A survey, as well as first-hand information gleaned through focus group discussions with informal <b>waste</b> <b>collectors</b> operating in the above-mentioned areas, also proved to be valuable sources of information. Much of the research undertaken in South Africa on informal waste collection has not focused on case studies or intensive first hand research; nor has it concentrated on sustainability. This mini-dissertation attempts to establish the respective correlations between urban poverty, informal waste collection, recycling industries and sustainability. The geographical profile of 150 <b>waste</b> <b>collectors</b> interviewed revealed that 5. 6 % are from South Africa, 12. 6 % are from Lesotho, 10. 6 % are from Zimbabwe, 10. 6 % are from Botswana and 9. 3 % are from Mozambique.

We analyzed 325 cases of injuries and 36 cases of illnesses according to the workers' age, length of employment, size of workplace, injured part of body, day and month of injury, type of accident, agency of accident, and collection process. Results: There were {{significant differences in the}} effect of workers' length of employment, injured part of body, type of accident, agency of accident, and collection process.

40|$|Background <b>Waste</b> <b>collectors</b> have a {{potential}} risk of infectious diseases. The {{aim of the}} study was to assess; the prevalence of hepatitis B (HBV), risk factors for infection and possible ways of virus transmission among municipal solid waste workers (MSWWs) in a municipality of central Greece. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among the employees of a municipality in Central Greece. The prevalence of an HBV infection biological marker (anti-Hbc) and its association with exposure to waste, socio-demographic factors, and history of occupational injuries with sharp objects/needle sticks was examined among 208 employees. Results The prevalence of HBV infection among the municipal <b>waste</b> <b>collectors</b> was 23 %. Logistic regression analysis showed that exposure to waste (OR?=? 4. 05; 95 %CI?=? 1. 2313. 33) and age (OR?=? 5. 22; 95 % CI?=? 1. 3520. 1) were independently associated with the anti-Hbc positivity. Moreover, <b>waste</b> <b>collectors</b> who reported occupational injuries with needle sticks were at higher risk of HBV infection (RR?=? 2. 64; 95 % CI?=? 1. 016. 96). Conclusions Occupational exposure to waste is a possible risk factor for HBV infection. Occupational injury with sharp instruments could be a means of hepatitis B virus transmission. Immunization of MSWWs and adoption of more safe ways for waste collection could be considered in order to control the risk of HBV infection. Am. J. Ind. Med. 55 : 650655, 2012.
