500|$|Naturally, {{the absurd}} sight of an {{elephant}} sitting atop a tree makes quite a scene - Horton {{is exposed to}} the elements, laughed at by his jungle friends, captured by hunters, forced to endure a terrible sea voyage, and finally placed in a traveling circus. However, despite his hardships and Mayzie's clear intent not to return, Horton refuses to leave the nest because he insists on keeping his word, often repeating, [...] "I meant what I said, and I said <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> An elephant's faithful, one hundred per cent!" ...|$|E

The book tells the story of Horton the Elephant, who is tricked into sitting on a bird's egg while its mother, Mayzie, takes a permanent vacation to Palm Beach. Horton endures a number of hardships but persists, often stating, [...] "I meant what I said, and I said <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant.</b> An elephant's faithful, one hundred percent!" [...] Ultimately, the egg hatches, revealing an elephant-bird, a creature with a blend of Mayzie's and Horton's features.|$|E

500|$|In 1951 Adeline died, aged eighty. In {{the same}} year Vaughan Williams's last opera, The Pilgrim's Progress, was staged at Covent Garden {{as part of the}} Festival of Britain. He had been working {{intermittently}} on a musical treatment of John Bunyan's allegory for forty-five years, and the 1951 [...] "morality" [...] was the final result. The reviews were respectful, but the work did not catch the opera-going public's imagination, and the Royal Opera House's production was [...] "insultingly half-hearted" [...] according to Frogley. The piece was revived the following year, but was still not a great success. Vaughan Williams commented to Ursula, [...] "They don't like it, they won't like it, they don't want an opera with no heroine and no love duets—and I don't care, it's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant,</b> and there it is." ...|$|E

500|$|Bedingfield began {{recording}} {{her debut}} album in mid-2003, following {{the signing of}} a recording contract with Sony BMG earlier that year. She {{was determined not to}} be shaped into [...] "some music biz pigeonhole" [...] and wanted to write songs that were [...] "organic, different and real". Bedingfield began collaborating with Steve Kipner, Andrew Frampton and Wayne Wilkins in London and Los Angeles, but their sessions were largely unproductive due to Bedingfield's writer's block and the pressure that she felt to produce a hit song. Frustrated, she began to sing [...] "I love you, I love you, I love you" [...] over and over. She was at [...] "wit's end and just wanted to say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> in a simple way, without using all those flowery words." [...] The line that Bedingfield sang out of frustration became the song's hook and its subject matter inspired by her real life difficulty writing a love song.|$|E
500|$|While {{working in}} the studio for her fifth studio album, Beyoncé demanded from Miguel to write a song in which nothing was [...] "off-limits" [...] and where he could push the {{envelope}} creatively. He recalled that they collaborated soon after she had had her first baby. Inside the studio, she told him, [...] "'Listen I feel so empowered at this time and place. You'll have to put me on a pedestal, like, never mind that it's Beyoncé. I wanna make music {{that makes me feel}} or shows that I feel hot and I'm confident and I wanna feel empowered because that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> in my life'". For the opening lines of the song, Miguel was inspired by the singer herself: [...] "What's the first thing I'd want Beyoncé to say to me, as a man? What have I not heard her say? That's where the song came from." [...] He further noted that [...] "Rocket" [...] managed to showcase a new part of the singer which was confident, sexual and liberating at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{responded to}} Cannon's {{comments}} sarcastically, clarifying that {{the song was}} really [...] "wishing the couple the best", {{and that it was}} a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well: [...] "There's a line on there that was a little harsh. It's a harsh line. But it's like this, the way I look at it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected him to do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song. What I actually meant to say is, I wish them the best.

2500|$|The {{journalist}} Nick Cohen {{was among}} those who responded on Twitter: [...] "Even if Hopkins knows nothing of Nazism – which I doubt – her [...] "final solution" [...] can only mean ethnic cleansing". Others, such as Owen Jones called for a boycott of the LBC radio station while they employ her. Interviewed later on Fox News by Tucker Carlson, she called for people to insist on deportations among other responses to terrorist acts. She said: [...] "I used the word 'final solution' in a tweet, and I would not in any way want to use that term and the inference other people lay on that. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> was, we need a lasting solution, a resolution to this".

Nevertheless, the tweet offended many members of our community and beyond, and I understand the hurt and frustration they feel." [...] USA Today said that Reynolds had violated the newspaper’s standards and suspended his column for one month. Reynolds issued an apology at the request of USA Today saying:Wednesday night one of my 580,000 tweets blew up. I didn’t live up to my own standards, and I didn’t meet USA TODAY’s standards.

2500|$|In August 2016, Fox News host Greg Gutfeld {{injected}} {{himself into}} the Chili Peppers/Patton feud taking shots at the Chili Peppers and Kiedis after Flea posted video of him and Koko the gorilla. Gutfeld said, [...] "As most musicians know, this is a vast improvement over the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the worst band on the planet. The ape is better than Anthony Kiedis. By the way, the ape is 45, which is half the age of Anthony Kiedis. Red Hot Chili Peppers, poor man's Faith No More, don't ever forget it." [...] After receiving major backlash from fans, Gutfeld decided to take further shots by saying [...] "Two days ago I said that Red Hot Chili Peppers were the worst band on the planet. I {{received a lot of}} flack from fans all over the world. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>meant</b> to say was the Red Hot Chili Peppers [...] the worst band in the universe. I’d like to apologize for that confusion. I want to explain {{that we live in a}} binary universe," [...] he continued. [...] "You're either a Faith No More fan, or a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. You cannot love Mike Patton and Anthony Kiedis, because they are two different people. You have to love Mike Patton, you cannot love Anthony Kiedis. So that is why the Red Hot Chili Peppers are the worst band in the universe, because Faith No More is the greatest band in the universe." [...] Flea responded to Gutfeld's comments a few days later saying [...] "I remember seeing a poll recently that said people who watch Fox News knew less about world affairs than people who watch no news at all.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent papers have {{examined}} measures of intra-industry trade (IIT) and related indicators such as matched and unmatched changes In trade (MCIT and UCIT) as indicators of adjustment costs associated with trade expansion or contraction. We make three contributions to this literature. First, we clarify <b>what</b> <b>Is</b> <b>meant</b> by adjustment costs {{in the context of}} these IIT-related measures. Second, we present new measures of MCIT and UCIT. Third, we compare our measures with existing measures using some simple numerical examples and data on Irish chemicals trade. We find that previous IIT-related measures tend to overestimate the extent of MCIT, and underestimate UCIT. We also And that the extent of the bias in these measures can be substantial. Thus, they are unreliable as indicators of adjustment costs. Our measures overcome these limitations...|$|R
