5|$|After the 2014 season, Banister interviewed {{with the}} Houston Astros as a {{candidate}} to fill their managing vacancy, following the firing of Bo Porter. The Astros instead hired A. J. Hinch. He also interviewed with the Texas Rangers, and was {{a finalist for the}} position along with Rangers' interim manager Tim Bogar and pitching coach Mike Maddux. On October 16, 2014, the Rangers named Banister their new manager. He signed a three-year contract with an option for a fourth season. Jon Daniels, the Rangers' general manager, indicated that Banister <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> Rangers to incorporate analytics into their baseball decisions.|$|E
5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> global economy.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{their arrival}} at Chennai, Aras {{delivers}} Nalla's cheque {{to the union}} workers. He invites Nalla to his wedding, where, to his utter astonishment, Nalla sees that Aras's bride is Bala. Padayatchi spots Nalla and asks him {{what he is doing}} there, to which Nalla replies that he was invited by Aras to the wedding. Nalla then persuades Padayatchi to sign the papers which <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> workers obtain a raise. To prevent the disruption of Bala's wedding and avoid damaging his own reputation, Padayatchi yields to Nalla's demands. After signing the papers, Padayatchi instructs his assistant (Santhana Bharathi) to eliminate Nalla. Padayatchi's assistant, however, has a change of heart as he is about to kill Nalla. Padayatchi's assistant believes that the misdeeds he committed for Padayatchi resulted in the death of the assistant's daughter. Padayatchi's assistant requests Nalla to leave Chennai and stay as far away from Padayatchi as possible; Nalla assents and walks away.|$|E

25|$|There {{are other}} {{essential}} aspects of emergency psychiatry: observation and collateral information. The {{observation of the}} patient's behavior is {{an important aspect of}} emergency psychiatry inasmuch as it allows the clinicians working with the patient to estimate prognosis and improvements/declines in condition. Many jurisdictions base involuntary commitment on dangerousness or the inability to care for one's basic needs. Observation {{for a period of time}} may help determine this. For example, if a patient who is committed for violent behavior in the community, continues to behave in an erratic manner without clear purpose, this <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> staff decide that hospital admission may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Sex is a {{basic form}} of {{communication}} in bonobos’ life. It seems to infuse everything from simple expressions of affection {{to the establishment of}} dominance. Female bonobos have been observed to engage in sexual activities to create bonds with dominant bonobos. Having created this bond with the male, they will share food with each other and not compete with each other. All members of the group are potential sex partners, males participate in sexual activity with other males, as do females with other females. These bonds made between females are for protection against male bonobos. If a male bonobo attempts to harass a female bonobo, the other females <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> female defend herself because of the strong bonds they have with each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{deliberations}} for {{the enactment}} of the national budget were opposed by several representatives from the Visayas and Mindanao as they contended that their allocation in the budget, 7.7% for the Visayas and 10% for Mindanao, were not enough. Appropriations Committee chair Joseph Emilio Abaya said while that there will be realignments done, there will be no major realignments. Another point of contention was the conditional cash transfer program, which, Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> country in halving poverty, {{which is one of the}} Millennium Development Goals. The inclusion of the conditional cash transfer program caused the budget for the Department of Social Welfare and Development to increase 123% from PHP15.4 billion to PHP34.3 billion.

25|$|Following {{the end of}} the {{currency}} peg, the ringgit appreciated to as high as 3.16 to the US dollar in April 2008. The ringgit had also enjoyed a period of appreciation against the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) (from 0.49 to 0.44 to the MYR) and the renminbi (CNY) (0.46 to 0.45 to the MYR) as recently as May 2008. The initial stability of the ringgit in the late-2000s had led to considerations to reintroduce {{the currency}} to foreign trading. In a CNBC interview in September 2010, Najib Tun Razak, the then Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Malaysia, was quoted in stating that the government was planning the reentry of the ringgit into off-shore trading if the move <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> economy, with the condition that rules and regulations were put in place to prevent abuses.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the likelihood of a good outcome after surgery, multiple weeks of physical therapy is necessary. In these weeks, the therapist <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>the</b> patient return to normal activities, as well as prevent blood clots, improve circulation, increase range of motion, and eventually strengthen the surrounding muscles through specific exercises. Treatment includes encouraging patients to move early after the surgery. Continuous Passive Motion machines also known simply as CPM Often range of motion (to the limits of the prosthesis) is recovered over the first two weeks (the earlier the better). Over time, patients are able to {{increase the}} amount of weight bearing on the operated leg, and eventually are able to tolerate full weight bearing with the guidance of the physical therapist.
