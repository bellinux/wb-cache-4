He still retained his rangership, and in 1666 <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> like a reprimand from Colbert suggesting that he should look into some malpractices at Chateau Thierry. In the same year appeared the second book of the Contes, and in 1668 the first six books of the Fables, with more of both kinds in 1671. In this latter year a curious instance of the docility with which the poet lent himself to any influence was afforded by his officiating, at the instance of the Port-Royalists, as editor of a volume of sacred poetry dedicated to the Prince of Conti.|$|E

Though initially skeptical she has since stated [...] "I think it's really important to acknowledge that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> called the herd immunity, where {{there are people that}} cannot get immunizations because of autoimmune diseases or cancer treatments," [...] and that [...] "If we don't get the vaccinations to keep them safe, then they're screwed." [...] Citing scientific research, she shares her belief that it is her duty to not only protect her children, but other children, too—especially those who may suffer from autoimmune diseases or cancer.|$|E

[...] The song ends with the {{repeated}} line [...] "I'll probably never see you again" [...] {{which is also a}} reference to A Taste of Honey. The intro to the song uses the chords F major (sus2), Eb major and Bb major. The verse uses the chord G minor 7, F7 (sus2) and Eb major.

2500|$|Michael Cavanagh, the {{chairman}} of Commonwealth Games Scotland, said a decision to stay away would be a joint one, as he insisted a possible knock on effects for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow {{would not be a}} factor. [...] He said [...] "In terms of withdrawal we don't see this as simply a Team Scotland decision, any decision to withdraw we would see as being a collective decision amongst the countries who are already there and already concerned. We can't allow ourselves to be influenced by thoughts of how it may impact on 2014, not when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> as important as the safety of our athletes to consider."

The comet was given the formal name Comet 1995 O1, and three days later its full title C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp), designating the first comet found during the second half-month of July 1995. Hale's name precedes Bopp's because his was the first report to arrive. It is uncertain {{who was the first}} to discover it, as they both spotted it at around the same time. The following day Hale phoned Bopp to introduce himself with the words, [...] "I think that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> in common."

2500|$|Guitarist Wacław [...] "Vogg" [...] Kiełtyka {{commented on}} the album, [...] "Extreme and groove — I think that's {{the best way to}} {{describe}} our new album. This time we feel that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> totally crushing and huge. Blood Mantra is the most heavy and mature album we ever did in our career. I cannot wait to start to play songs live because riffs are soo deep and powerful." [...] He also stated, [...] "We flirt with various tempos mixing death metal with grindcore and almost outright black metal atmosphere together with more, so to speak, 'crowd-puller' beats verging on groovy, almost stoner-rock climates. There are also a few more modern metal rhythmic riffs where we return to the climate of Organic Hallucinosis album. I'm certain that the very fact we are again, after 9 years, in Hertz studio will evoke the spirit of that album. The vocals sound very promising. Rasta [...] is a much more experienced vocalist compared to the Carnival Is Forever album times. And his voice sounds more powerful and deeper." ...|$|E
2500|$|The men {{and their}} teams {{generally}} credited {{with the creation of}} the original Thunderbird are: Lewis D. Crusoe, a retired GM executive lured out of retirement by Henry Ford II; George Walker, chief stylist and a Ford vice-president; Frank Hershey, chief stylist for Ford Division; Bill Boyer, designer Body Development Studio who became manager of Thunderbird Studio in spring of 1955, and Bill Burnett, chief engineer. Ford Designer William P. Boyer was lead stylist on the original 1955 two-seater Thunderbird and also had a hand in designing the future series of Thunderbirds including the 30th Anniversary Edition. Hershey's participation {{in the creation of the}} Thunderbird was more administrative than artistic. Crusoe and Walker met in France in October 1951. Walking in the Grand Palais in Paris, Crusoe pointed at a sports car and asked Walker, 'Why can’t <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> like that?' Some versions of the story claim that Walker replied by telling Crusoe, [...] "oh, we're working on it"...although if anything existed at the time beyond casual dream-car sketches by members of the design staff, records of it have never come to light.|$|E
2500|$|Catharine Bond Hill, {{president}} of Vassar College argued that, [...] "many {{of us in}} higher education dislike popular college rankings such as the annual academic beauty pageant from US News & World Report. But expecting them to go away is naive, and attempting to undermine them is unwise since students and families could perceive that as petulant and paternalistic. Worse, it could seem as if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> to hide." [...] Rather than not sending in the reputation survey, she argued, it would be of value to focus on, [...] "a third-party non-profit or foundation", sending them [...] "the same data that we already submit to US News and other rating organizations." [...] On this point, she argues, [...] "a one-size ranking does not fit all, because students and families care about different things [...] What if a school doesn't use the SAT in making admissions decisions and therefore doesn't collect or report these data? In a new system, that school couldn't be ranked if a student chose a positive weight for the SATs. Students would know that the school doesn't value that piece of information. They could then run the rankings with other information (maybe class rank and other indicators of academic achievement), excluding the SAT, and see what those rankings look like. Alternatively, they could decide they actually do care about the average SATs {{of the student body}} and decide to look at other schools. Fair enough." ...|$|E
