5|$|A {{reference}} to The Simpsons appearance in The Tracey Ullman Show is made when the Griffins are shown as {{characters in the}} show. Family Guy producer David A. Goodman comments that, contrary to what some think, the show <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> criticize The Simpsons, but rather trying to show the differences in voices and character appearance.|$|E
5|$|David {{begins by}} sending poison pen letters to Nick's wife Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), which state that Nick {{is having an}} affair. Nick realises David is behind the letters. Price told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) his {{character}} panics and becomes annoyed. Nick is arrogant to his actions and believes David will just forgive him because they are related. He then tells David that they should discuss the affair with Kylie and move on. Price explained that David is worried that Kylie will feel betrayed he knew all along and does not want her to leave him. He decides he must stop Nick and grabs {{the steering wheel and}} causes a car crash. Price believed David <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> murder Nick, just prevent him from contacting Kylie.|$|E
5|$|The gender-based {{criticism}} has also affected younger male {{fans of the}} show, such as with Michael Morones above. Another story that gained national attention was that of Grayson Bruce, a nine-year-old fan who was told to stop bringing a Rainbow Dash backpack to school to prevent bullying that he was receiving. An online campaign to show support for Grayson gained over 32,000 supporters on its Facebook page, and the brony fanbase, the show's creators and voice actors, and various news commentators like Glenn Beck, Ronan Farrow and Eugene Volokh have stood up for the boy's actions. The school later revised its decision after speaking to the family and clarifying it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> blame the student for the incident.|$|E

This must be clear.|$|R

5|$|While still {{popular with}} the Rhodesian Front members, he was criticised at the 1972 Party Congress for his lack of success in {{improving}} Rhodesia's image around the world; however, he retained the confidence of Ian Smith and was kept on in a government reshuffle on 24 May 1973. That winter saw him promote a new Broadcasting Bill to transfer control of the monopoly Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation. Allan Savory, then the lone white opposition MP, criticised the Bill for {{the composition of the}} proposed board, which was dominated by strong supporters of the Rhodesian Front. Van der Byl insisted, somewhat unsuccessfully to foreign observers, that the government <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> take over broadcasting.|$|E
25|$|The SNP {{insisted that}} as the leading {{political}} party in Scotland in the latest opinion poll, it {{should be included in}} any debate broadcast in Scotland. On 22 December 2009, the UKIP leader, Lord Pearson stated that his party should also be included. Following a decision by the BBC Trust not to uphold a complaint from the SNP and Plaid Cymru over their exclusion from the planned BBC debate, the SNP announced on 25 April that they would proceed with legal action over the debate scheduled for 29 April. The party said it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> stop the broadcast but it wanted an SNP politician included for balance. The SNP lost the case, in a judgement delivered on 28 April.|$|E
25|$|Under President Carter, the CIA was {{conducting}} covertly funded pro-American opposition against the Sandinista. In March 1981, Reagan told Congress that the CIA would protect El Salvador by preventing the shipment of Nicaraguan arms {{into the country}} to arm Communist rebels. This was a ruse. The CIA was actually arming and training Nicaraguans Contras in Honduras in hopes that they could depose the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Through William J. Casey's tenure as DCI little {{of what he said}} in the National Security Planning Group, or to President Reagan was supported by the intelligence branch of the CIA, so Casey formed the Central American Task Force, staffed with yes men from Covert Action. On December 21, 1982, Congress passed a law restricting the CIA to its stated mission, restricting the flow of arms from Nicaragua to El Salvador, prohibiting the use of funds to oust the Sandinistas. Reagan testified before Congress, assuring them that the CIA <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> topple the Nicaraguan government.|$|E

25|$|Empedocles {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results– heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of double sex. But most of these products of natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts {{were found to be}} adapted to each other did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited each other as if this had been intended. Soon various influences reduced creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life. It is possible to see this theory as an anticipation of Darwin's theory of natural selection, although Empedocles <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> explain evolution.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{ultimate}} objectives behind {{the making of}} the film, Morgan said he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> blame just a single company nor the fast fashion industry as [...] "it did not invent a very irresponsible way of manufacturing, it did not invent overmarketing the consumption of things." [...] The director said the film was intended to be a caution on the [...] "incessant consumption of mediocre stuff" [...] and an incentive to view shopping as something more than a hobby, adding that buying is [...] "a moral act and there is a chain reaction of consequences". He commented he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "anti-business or anti-market" [...] but was just reaffirming basic human rights and showing the limits of natural resources.|$|E

500|$|In the 82nd Congress, Senator Bricker {{introduced}} {{the first version}} of his amendment, S.J. Res. 102, drafted by Bricker and his staff. [...] The American Bar Association was still studying the issue of how to prevent an abuse of [...] "treaty law" [...] when Bricker introduced his resolution on July 17, 1951, without the ABA's involvement, but the Senator wanted to begin immediate debate on an issue he considered vital. [...] Bricker <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> reverse the Yalta Agreement, in contrast to the goals of some of his conservative colleagues; he was worried most about what might be done by the United Nations or under an executive agreement. A second proposal, S.J. Res 130, was introduced by Bricker on February 7, 1952, with fifty-eight co-sponsors, including every Republican except Eugene Millikin of Colorado.|$|E
500|$|Mulder's {{dream and}} {{decisions}} in [...] "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" [...] heavily allude to {{the actions of}} Jesus in Nikos Kazantzakis's novel The Last Temptation of Christ. Duchovny, {{a fan of the}} book, found parallels between its central story and Mulder's ordeal, and incorporated many of the novel's concepts into the episode. In The Last Temptation of Christ, Jesus is torn between his higher calling as the son of God and his desire towards his own humanity. Duchovny was drawn to the fact that Christ's struggle in the novel was [...] "not only godlike, but also profoundly human" [...] and used this template for Mulder; in the series, Mulder is destined towards greater things—in this case, stopping the oncoming alien invasion—but he also desires to have a personal life. Duchovny noted that [...] "Mulder is a guy who's been given the same problem [...] What I'm doing is using the very human model of Christ". Duchovny cautioned that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make Mulder into a Christ-like savior figure but rather [...] "an everyman". Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described the concept as a risk, but Duchovny felt that this exploration of Mulder's character was important to the series.|$|E
500|$|From {{the late}} 1960s onward, {{many of the}} Yale School of critics {{describe}} the poem as a reworking of John Milton's poetic diction, but, they argued, that poem revealed that Keats lacked the ability of Milton as a poet. The critics, Harold Bloom (1965), Leslie Brisman (1973), Paul Fry (1980), John Hollander (1981) and Cynthia Chase (1985), all focused on the poem with Milton as a progenitor to [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] while ignoring other possibilities, including Shakespeare who was emphasised as being the source of many of Keats's phrases. Responding to the claims about Milton and Keats's shortcomings, critics like R. S. White (1981) and Willard Spiegelman (1983) used the Shakespearean echoes to argue for a multiplicity of sources for the poem to claim that Keats <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> respond just to Milton or escape from his shadow. Instead, [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] was an original poem, as White claimed, [...] "The poem is richly saturated in Shakespeare, yet the assimilations are so profound that the Ode is finally original, and wholly Keatsian". Similarly, Spiegelman claimed that Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream had [...] "flavored and ripened the later poem". This was followed in 1986 by Jonathan Bate claiming that Keats was [...] "left enriched by the voice of Shakespeare, the 'immortal bird'".|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's development, it was {{promoted}} as an album of [...] "high-energy hip-hop." [...] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as [...] "aggressive rock" [...] in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar. That's what happens when you've got the same guy producing them.

500|$|Ramírez {{was traded}} to the Kansas City Royals on March 26, , for a player to be named later (Jorge de la Rosa). He posted a 0.66 ERA through his first 13 games with the Royals, but his ERA rose to 3.49 after he posted a 6.14 ERA in his next 13 games. Over his final 45 games, he had a 2.08 ERA. On June 25, in a 73 victory over Colorado (his former team), Ramírez threw two pitches behind Yorvit Torrealba of the Rockies. Ramírez said he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> hit Torrealba, and he was not ejected from the game or disciplined, but some of the Rockies players claimed that Ramírez had thrown at Torrealba intentionally. On July 20, he got his first win since May 21 of the {{previous}} year in an 87 victory over the Chicago White Sox, despite blowing the lead by giving up two runs in [...] innings. Ten days later, he pitched [...] scoreless innings and was charged with the win in a 43 victory over the Oakland Athletics, helping the Royals sweep the Athletics in Oakland {{for the first time since}} 1988. By September, he had replaced Ron Mahay as Joakim Soria's setup man. He pitched in 71 games for the Royals with a 2.64 ERA. On September 4, in the second game of a doubleheader, Ramírez notched his first career save against the Athletics in a 96 victory. Ramírez finished the year with a 32 record, a 2.64 ERA, one save, 70 strikeouts, and [...] innings pitched in 71 games. He was one of three major league pitchers to give up two or fewer home runs in over 70 innings (along with Roy Corcoran and Jason Grilli), and he was one of the American League (AL) pitchers to have an ERA under 3.00 with at least 70 innings pitched and 70 strikeouts (along with Francisco Rodríguez and Matt Thornton).|$|E
