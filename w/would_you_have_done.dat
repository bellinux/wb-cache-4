2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the campaign, Dion had an {{interview}} with CTV Halifax's anchor Steve Murphy, where Dion asked the host three times to restart the interview because he didn't understand the mixed tense and timing of a question about the economy: [...] "If you were Prime Minister now, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> about the economy and this crisis that Mr. Harper has not done?" [...] Murphy initially agreed not to air it but network executives decided to release it, generating controversy. On election night, Dion angrily refused to speak to the CTV reporters scrumming around him, saying [...] "The last one I want to speak first [...] is CTV - you understand that?".|$|E
2500|$|On 27 August 2006, Nasrallah denied in an {{interview}} with New TV that the capture of the two soldiers was the cause of the war. It only advanced a long planned war for a few months. But he added: [...] "If there was even a 1 percent chance that the July 11 capturing operation would have led to a war like the one that happened, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it? I would say no, absolutely not, for humanitarian, moral, social, security, military, and political reasons. [...] What happened is not an issue of a reaction to a capturing operation… what happened was already planned for. The fact that it happened in July has averted a situation {{that would have been a}} lot worse, had the war been launched in October." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A-huh! You know a {{lot about}} wimmen now, don't you? But thet did my heart good. Jim, what 'n earth <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>did</b> if thet 'd been you instead of Riggs?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The footage shows {{interviewer}} Steve Murphy asking Dion the question: [...] "If {{you were}} the Prime Minister now, what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> about the economy, and this crisis, that Mr. Harper has not done?". [...] Dion had difficulty in understanding the question, repeatedly asking Murphy to clarify if he meant if Dion was Prime Minister now, next Tuesday on election day, last week, last month, 60 weeks ago, or {{two and a half}} years ago. [...] Eventually, after three start overs to the interview, Dion responded with what he would do if elected Prime Minister in the future. CTV initially agreed to restart the interviews and not air the false starts but changed their minds and announced that they felt it was their responsibility to show it. Harper responded to the clips by saying that [...] "When you're running a trillion-and-a-half-dollar economy you don't get a chance to have do-overs, over and over again" [...] and [...] "What this incident actually indicates very clearly is Mr. Dion and the Liberal Party really don't know what they would do on the economy", and when told that the difficulties were in part due to English being Dion's second language, Harper said: [...] "I don't think this is a question of language at all. The question was very clear. It was asked repeatedly".|$|E
60|$|And now, 'you {{gentlemen of}} England, who sit {{at home at}} ease,' what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in like case?--Your last die thrown; your last stake lost; your honour, as you fancy, stained for ever; your eldest son dead in battle--What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>done?</b> What Walter Raleigh did was this. He kept his promise. He had promised Lord Arundel to return to England; and return he did.|$|E
