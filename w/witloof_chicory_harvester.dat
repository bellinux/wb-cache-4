40|$|Introduction: Chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) {{belongs to}} Asteraceae family is {{commonly}} known as <b>witloof</b> <b>chicory.</b> The leaves and the roots of this medicinal plant are edible and commonly used as salad. Some varieties are also cultivated as coffee substitute after roasting the roots. All parts of the plant contain these volatile oils, with the majority of the toxic components concentrated in the plant's root. In folk medicine, the plant is used for the treatment of diarrhea, spleen enlargement, fever, and vomiting. Antihepatotoxic activity on damaged rat’s liver sections and anti-bacterial activity of this crop has been recently reported. In vitro regeneration from leaf explants with various hormonal combinations has been reported previously. Moreover, in vitro regeneration of Chicory from cotyledon explants using different combinations of plant growth regulators has been studied. Also, a protocol for the regeneration of plantlets from leaf and petiole explants of <b>witloof</b> <b>chicory</b> has been developed. The aim of the present investigation was optimization of callus induction and shoot regeneration from leaf and petiole tissues of Chicory (Esfahan genotype). Materials and Methods: In this investigation, Esfahan genotype was used for callus induction and direct shoot regeneration. Seeds were first washed with running tap water for 30 min then seeds were surface sterilized by dipping in 70...|$|R
40|$|Field {{observations}} in central Belgium indicate a significant soil degradation process which has hitherto not been considered in assessments of soil erosion rates: i. e., soil losses due to root crop harvesting (SLRH). The objectives {{of this study}} were: (1) to assess SLRH for two commonly grown root crops in Belgium, i. e. chicory roots and sugar beet, (2) to investigate some factors controlling the spatial and temporal variation of SLRH, and (3) to evaluate the contribution of this sail degradation process to overall soil loss in the study area. Soil losses due to harvesting of <b>witloof</b> <b>chicory</b> roots were assessed by measuring dirt tare from 43 root samples whereas SLRH for inuline chicory roots and sugar beet were calculated from dirt tare data provided by factories processing these roots. Mean soil loss was 11. 8 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for <b>witloof</b> <b>chicory</b> roots, 8. 1 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for inuline chicory roots and 9. 1 ton ha(- 1) harvest(- 1) for sugar beet. Assuming that root crops are grown once in 2 years in the study area, mean annual SLRH equals 5. 0 ton ha(- 1) year(- 1) (0. 33 mm/year). Since these root crops have been grown {{over a period of}} at least 200 years in Belgium, this implies a mean sail profile truncation of 66 mm. However, important spatial and temporal variability in SLRH data was observed, depending on soil texture, soil moisture at harvest time and harvesting technique. Given the importance of SLRH, it needs to be incorporated into future assessments of soil degradation processes and sediment budgets. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|In {{a related}} study, it was {{established}} {{that the use of}} an ebb-and-flood irrigation method during forcing of the taproots of <b>witloof</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L) could be used to increase lateral root formation. In this study, five irrigation treatments were used and lateral root formation as well as chicon yield and quality were monitored. Leaf yield was not significantly affected by the irrigation treatments. Standard EU grades were used to develop a parametric chicon quality index (Ql). Taking into account that all conditions except for the irrigation treatments, were controlled and identical for all experimental units, a tendency of an inverse relationship between lateral root formation and chicon quality was found. An aeroponic irrigation system significantly increased lateral root development but produced the lowest QI. Since potential income is dependent on both chicon quality and leaf yield, these parameters were combined and showed that the best potential income was obtained with the ebb-and-flood irrigation method, a promising alternative to be further investigated.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{vernalization}} treatment on bolting of root chicory were investigated and compared in four varieties. Experiments where plants were initially cultivated in controlled growth rooms, before transplanting {{in the field in}} late April or in early May, strongly suggested that low temperatures were responsible for the high percentages of bolting and flowering recorded in early-sown plants in the field. Effectiveness of a treatment at a constant 4 degrees C in inducing bolting depended on its duration, on the variety, and on plant age when vernalization started. Greatest sensitivity to cold occurred soon in plant's life, during seed imbibition. Fluctuating temperatures (16 h at 4 degrees C followed by 8 h at 15 degrees C) were also able to cause bolting. Vernalization effectiveness was affected by climatic variations after vernalization and the transfer of the plants in the field. The results are discussed in relation to information coming from studies on radicchio and <b>Witloof</b> <b>chicories.</b> (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} protocol for in vitro shoot regeneration from storage root explants of <b>witloof</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L.) {{has been used}} to study the effect of colchicine at different concentrations, and colchi-cine in combination with kinetin or 2, 4 -D or with 2, 4 -D and kinetin, in comparison with kinetin and control (no treatment), upon this type of morphogenic event. The results demonstrated a strong stimulatory effect of colchicine at low concentration on shoot regeneration frequency when compared to the number of shoots formed in the con-trol. This effect was comparable to that of kinetin, a growth regulator that induces shoot differentiation. By contrast, the presence of 2, 4 -D completely inhibited shoot regeneration. Colchicine at high concentration did not induce shoots, and caused the complete death of the explants. A carefully histological analysis of the explants during the in vitro culture period showed the formation of numerous meristematic zones (precursors of adventitious bud and shoot development) in the parenchyma mass; these meris-tems were present only in the explants subjected to the colchicine and to the other treatments able to stimulate shoot differentiation. Nuclei of different sizes were observed in the explants treated with colchicine at low dose, the largest, probably, polyploids. Polyploid nuclei, in fact, were found in the regenerated plants.

40|$|<b>Witloof</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum cv. Flash) was sown in acid-washed {{vermiculite}} in {{a controlled}} growth chamber, After 1 month of growth, {{one half of the}} chicory plants were defoliated whereas the intact chicory plants remained as a control. Twenty-four hours after defoliation, a very sharp decrease in hexose, sucrose, and total fructan concentration was observed in the roots. This coincided with a strong decrease in sucrose:sucrose 1 -fructosyl transferase (1 -SST; EC 2. 4. 1. 99) activity and a strong increase in fructan 1 -exohydrolase (1 -FEH; EC 3. 2. 1. 80) activity. After day 5, 1 -SST activity increased and 1 -FEH activity decreased. However, from day 5 to 15, both the activities of 1 -SST and acid invertase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) remained significantly lon;cr than in the control plants. From 10 days after defoliation, fructan synthesis resumed and hexose and sucrose concentrations increased. Up to now, 1 -FEH activity was believed to occur only in mature tissues (end of the growing season, storage, forcing, or sprouting). Therefore, the rather unexpected finding that 1 -FEH can also be induced in very young chicory roots after defoliation suggests that 1 -FEH can be considered a 'survival' enzyme that can be induced at any physiological stage when energy demands increase. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|During forcing of chicory tap roots (Cichorium intybus L. var, foliosum cv. Final) for witloof {{production}} in hydroponics {{a large number}} of thin feeder roots is formed. An inulin pattern of fructans (up to DP 20) accumulated in these roots. The roots were also subjected to osmotic stress by addition of 0. 2 mol/L NaCl or a PEG 6000 solution with the same water potential. Both addition of NaCl or PEG resulted in an increase of internal browning in the heads of <b>witloof</b> <b>chicory,</b> the most important disorder considerably reducing the market value of the chicon. The 0. 2 mol/L NaCl treatment resulted in an important reduction in lateral root and chicon growth; a slightly increased fructan concentration in these feeder roots was also observed. PEG treatment was equally inhibitory on chicon growth, but feeder root growth was nearly not affected. Much lower fructan concentrations were found in these roots but the fructose, glucose and sucrose concentrations were much higher, apparently increasing the osmotic contribution of the stored carbohydrates in the feeder roots. It was demonstrated that this PEG-mediated drought stress effect {{has nothing to do with}} hypoxia. The dynamics of carbohydrates during forcing are discussed based both on the determination of enzymatic activities (invertase, I-SST, 1 -FFT and 1 -FEH) and the composition of the feeder root phloem exudate. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Rising {{research}} costs, broadening goals, {{intellectual property}} rights, and other concerns increase {{the need for}} robust management of crop improvement data. The data model of the International Crop Information System (ICIS) allows breeding processes to be recorded unambiguously in a relational database. This paper describes this model, which underlies the Genealogical Management System (GMS) of ICIS. The model recognizes three classes of methods by which genetic material is advanced. Generative methods such as crossing or mutagenesis increase variation. Derivative methods usually involve selection, and maintenance methods conserve the genetic makeup of germplasm, such as in seed multiplications. Unlike systems that only track pedigrees, the model describes steps of selection. Applications are illustrated for self-pollinating, outcrossing, and clonally propagated crops. The ICIS GMS is in use for species including rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), lesquerella [Lesquerella fendleri (Gray) S. Wats. ], and <b>witloof</b> <b>chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L.). The International Rice Information System, based on ICIS, holds more than 2. 6 million unique identifiers for germplasm accessions, crosses, populations, and lines, requiring about 900 megabytes of storage space, which can easily be managed on a personal computer. The GMS model appears suited for widespread use in managing data on crop improvement. © Crop Science Society of America...|$|R
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France, herewith {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Syngenta AGRO S. A. S. to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance difenoconazole {{in a wide range of}} crops. In order to accommodate for the intended European uses on quinces, several root crops, bulb vegetables, cucurbits (inedible peel), <b>witloof</b> <b>chicory,</b> globe artichokes, rice and chicory roots and to accommodate the authorized use in Brazil on papaya, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for difenoconazole in all these crops. The EMS drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals for all the crops considered. The applicant has not submitted data on TDM residues in the crops under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended use of difenoconazole on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values for difenoconazole and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern. The consumer risk assessment regarding the TDMs was not undertaken in the framework of the current application and has to be performed as soon as the confirmatory data for triazole pesticides are available and a suitable risk assessment methodology has been developed, taking into account the contribution of the TDMs present in primary crops, rotational crops, processed commodities and products of animal origin resulting from different triazole pesticides...|$|R
40|$|<b>Witloof</b> <b>chicory</b> seeds (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum cv. Flash) were sown in acid-washed {{vermiculite}} in {{a controlled}} environment growth chamber. Plants received a nitrogen poor ("N-poor": 0. 2 mM NH 4 NO 3) but otherwise complete medium, or a nitrogen rich ("N-rich": 2 mM NH 4 NO 3) medium. After 1 month of growth the fructan concentration in the "N-poor" plants was about five times higher and also the activity of sucrose:sucrose 1 -fructosyl transferase (1 -SST; EC 2. 4. 1. 99) was {{twice as high as}} in "N-rich" plants. The activities of the catabolic enzymes fructan 1 -exohydrolase (1 -FEH; EC 3. 2. 1. 80) and acid invertase (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) were higher in the "N-rich" plants where significant energy was invested in root and leaf growth. After one month of growth, part of the "N-poor" plants were switched to the "N-rich" medium. One day after this switch, a sharp decrease in sucrose and glucose concentration was observed in the roots. During the following days, both the activities of 1 -SST and fructan:fructan 1 -fructosyl transferase (1 -FFT; EC 2. 4. 1. 100) decreased and the 1 -FEH and invertase activities increased. These changes were correlated with a decrease in fructan concentration. Ten days after the switch, glucose and sucrose concentrations increased again and fructan synthesis resumed. During this period 1 -SST activity increased and 1 -FEH activity decreased. Apparently 1 -SST, 1 -FFT and 1 -FEH simultaneously control fructan in young chicory roots. The rather unexpected finding that 1 -FEH activity, which was believed to occur only in older material, can be induced in very young roots indicates that this enzyme can be induced at any physiological stage. status: publishe...|$|R

The leaf chicories comprised cultivars corresponding to the Radicchio, Sugarloaf and Catalogne subgroups. The latter has not been previously included in any genetic diversity study. Subsequently, 1297 individuals from the 15 modern root chicory cultivars at {{the origin of the}} breeding of the current industrial root chicory cultivars were analyzed. Although the accessions of C. endivia and C. intybus were clearly separated from each other, seven wild C. intybus individuals were genetically closer to C. endivia than to C. intybus, revealing complex genetic interrelationships between these species.

40|$|<b>Chicory</b> (<b>witloof)</b> is a {{typically}} Belgian vegetable appreciated for its slightly bitter taste. Up until now no measurements exist to objectively quantify the sensory characteristics of chicory. Taste {{and texture of}} nine different chicory hybrids were analyzed by sensory and instrumental analysis (three-point bending test, high performance anion exchange with pulsed amperometric detection, high performance liquid chromatography and visible/near infrared spectroscopy). The main objective {{of the study was}} to correlate and predict the sensory attributes and consumer acceptance of chicory with destructive physico-chemical measurements and non-destructive Vis/NIR data, to avoid time- and money-consuming sensory profiling in the future. A univariate analysis showed that glucose and sucrose concentrations in chicory leaves were highly correlated with the attributes crunchiness and bitterness. The fructose concentrations however were Correlated with the sweetness score of the panel. When performing partial least squares on all destructive instrumental parameters and Vis/NIR data for the major sensory attributes of chicory, satisfactory prediction models (ratio of standard deviation to Foot mean square error of cross-validation (RPD) > 2) could be established for all attributes but sweetness using all physico-chemical parameters. Using Vis/NIR data improved the prediction capacity of the sweetness model, and this technique proved to be useful in predicting the sensory quality of chicory. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Quality {{has always}} been the main focus for Belgian endive {{producers}} in Flanders to hold its comparative advantage with respect to the mass production in our neighbouring countries. To maintain its position in <b>witloof</b> <b>chicory</b> production, investments in quality improvement are inevitable, judging by the constant decrease of both, the acreage for chicory root production and the trade balance for Belgian endives, which dropped from 11. 7 million EUR in 2000 to 2. 7 million EUR in 2008. So, the main focus in the doctoral research project was exploring the possibilities for quality improvement in chicory production by focusing on the maturation process {{at the end of the}} field phase. In this respect, on line measurements of changes in soil matric potentials in the root zone are related to plant development, maturation and quality of the chicory heads produced. Given that most problems encountered in the forcing period are the consequence of inferior root quality at the start of the forcing period, research emphasis was on correlating postharvest characteristics of chicons with the root quality at harvest, and to use this information to define the most optimal moment for root harvesting. The logic behind this is that the quality and related postharvest characteristics of chicons are mainly determined by the quality of the root at the start of the forcing period and the forcing and storage conditions. More specifically the physiological behavior of the roots during forcing, which ultimately determines the overall quality of the produced chicons, is intrinsically connected with its previous history in the field. The chicory supply chain commences with growing plants from seeds in the field. During the vegetative development, from spring till autumn, tuberized roots are formed and the foundation of high quality chicons is laid. Through field management growers attempt to provide roots with a superior quality containing the optimal amounts of carbohydrates, nitrogen compounds and mineral nutrients. For the growth process and physiological homeostasis, water uptake and hence soil water availability in the root zone are of crucial importance. In this respect changes in soil matric potential at two depths (30 and 60 cm below surface) measured near the tap root were related to the chicory plant development of Cichorium intybus L. throughout the growing season. The soil parameter &# 916;p (diel difference in soil matric potential) was found to be a good estimator of root activity, evolving throughout the growing season in accordance to crop developmental stages. Given that this methodology allows separation of the different stages during plant development non-destructively, makes it an ideal tool for decision making in field and harvest management. Since yield and quality of chicory heads highly depends on the physiological status of the roots at harvest, determination of the optimal root harvesting time is critical. Based on chemical and physical measurements the physiological events occurring in the chicory plants during the second phase of the growing season were monitored. A new concept of potential gradients in the root tissue, expressed in terms of root water, solute and pressure potentials was derived to determine the most optimal field harvest date of chicory. The influence of physiological maturity on the forcing results was investigated for the early hybrid Mont Blanc. The focus was explicitly on the characterization of chicon quality since the financial benefit for endive growers mainly depends on the quality as defined by the Belgian auction guidelines. Based on the produced chicory heads meeting the internal and external quality characteristics and preserved from red discoloration, a particular harvest range was defined, matching the right physiological state of the roots. In this period the dry weight of the leaves decreased, LAI was minimal and an adequate fructan reserve had built up, together with a sufficient but restricted amount of sucrose. In addition, the declining amplitude of the diel variation in soil matric potential at 60 cm was found a non-destructive method for prediction of the maturity stage. During postharvest storage and commercialization of chicory heads, several physiological disorders might develop. One kind of physiological defects occurring both at harvest and during storage is red discoloration in the chicory heads (reddening). The origin of this disorder is complex with different possible triggers throughout the whole production chain. Morpho-anatomical analyses revealed that red discoloration mainly manifests as scattered red spots, parallel stripes or a red film in the basal part of the outer leaves of the chicory head and different types of tissue (e. g. sub-epidermal and vascular tissue) in the etiolated leaf. In addition to the identification of the most optimal harvest moment, storage time of the roots and temperatures during forcing have all been examined with respect to the occurrence of red discoloration. Moreover, chemical analyses showed that the amount of amino acids that were remobilized from the roots during the forcing process and the abundance of free amino acids in the chicory heads correspond well with the appearance of red discoloration during post harvest storage of the chicory heads. Immediate cooling of the chicory heads at harvest and a solid cold chain are essentially to reduce the hazard of reddening. status: publishe...|$|R
