25|$|While {{the primary}} {{registries}} are the Horse Breeders' Associations of Saxony-Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia, this studbook {{has proven to}} be the most liberal, accepting heavy warmbloods registered in Westphalia, Baden-Wurttemberg, <b>Weser-Ems,</b> Bavaria, and Berlin-Brandenburg. The goal of this policy is to identify and promote any and all remaining heavy warmblood horses. The heavy warmblood makes up 15-25% of the horse population in Saxony and Thuringia, which attests to the program's efficacy. As of 2005 there were 51 stallions and 1140 mares.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-eighties {{the stock}} of {{purebred}} mares had dwindled to just a handful, though there were some mares only {{a generation or two}} removed. In 1983 a group of supporters formed a special breed association {{under the jurisdiction of the}} <b>Weser-Ems</b> Studbook, approving stallions that were half-Hanoverian, half-Ostfriesen or Alt-Oldenburg. However, as the mares themselves were typically only halfbred, the foals did not have the desired type, and furthermore the genepool was simply too small. To replenish it, the breeders looked to the studs where Ostfriesen/Alt-Oldenburger stallions had stood for generations, picking up a few horses here and there. More horses came from greater strongholds: Silesian Heavy Warmbloods of Poland, the Danish Oldenbourgs, and the Groningen horse of the Netherlands. But the efforts of Dr. Herta Steiner, Moritzburg State Stud Equerry, were the keystone to saving the breed. She had championed for the last remaining heavy warmbloods in Saxony and Thuringia. Soon the old type was revived.|$|E
