40|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>wind</b> on <b>bridges</b> produces static and dynamic loading {{that must be}} adequately addressed when designing bridges. Dynamic loading is the primary concern, as the amplitude of the structures response to the applied loading may be greatly amplified. Ideally, the bridge 2 ̆ 7 s properties should be designed to avoid dynamic loading. Previous investigations of <b>wind</b> loading on <b>bridges</b> consisted of measuring forces produced on scaled models of <b>bridges</b> within <b>wind</b> tunnels. However, these wind tunnel tests are costly and time consuming due to cost to fabricate and instrument the bridge cross sections. Recent advancements in computational power of computers allow realistic simulation of <b>wind</b> flow over <b>bridges</b> via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It is advantageous to study <b>wind</b> forces on <b>bridge</b> decks via computer simulation because parameters of the <b>bridge</b> and the <b>wind</b> field around it can be modified to evaluate their influences on the forces produced on the bridge. The present study introduces a new computer model {{that is used to}} simulate two-dimensional flow of <b>wind</b> around a <b>bridge</b> deck. This program is in parallel format, which substantially reduces computational time compared to time required for similar simulations on a single computer. Minimum grid refinement to adequately resolve the boundary layer is identified. A user manual is developed so that the program can be operated by a designer with minimal training. Finally, the model is validated by comparing the force coefficients that it predicts with force coefficients from wind tunnel experiments.

Wind load {{have a great}} influence on bridge vibration acceleration under low wind velocity. Vehicle vertical dynamic response is influenced evidently by <b>wind</b> induced <b>bridge</b> vibration, its lateral response is controlled by <b>wind</b> load and <b>bridge</b> response. The effect on system dynamic response of wind load is remarkable. For other type large span bridges the method also can be referred and have important application value in interrelated research.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model for dynamics of wind-vehicle-bridge (WVB) systems {{is presented in}} this paper in the time domain with wind, rail vehicles and bridge modeled as a coupled vibration system. The {{analytical model}} considers many special issues in a WVB system, which include fluid-solid interaction between <b>wind</b> and <b>bridge,</b> solid contact between vehicles and <b>bridge,</b> stochastic <b>wind</b> excitation on vehicles and bridge, time dependence of the system due to vehicle movement, and effect of bridge deck on vehicle wind load and vice versa. The models of <b>wind,</b> vehicles and <b>bridge</b> are presented with wind velocity fluctuations simulated using the simplified spectral representation method, with vehicles modeled as mass-spring-damper systems, and with bridge represented by a finite element model. The interactions between <b>wind</b> and <b>bridge</b> are similar to those considered in conventional buffeting analysis for long span bridges. In considering difficulties in measuring aerodynamic coefficients of moving vehicles on bridge deck, the cosine rule is adopted for the aerodynamic coefficients of moving vehicles to consider yaw angle effect, and expressions of wind forces on moving vehicles are then derived for engineering application. To include mutual effects of wind loads, aerodynamic parameters of vehicles and bridge deck are measured, respectively, using a composite section model test and a specially designed test device. The dynamic interaction between vehicle and bridge depends on both geometric and mechanical relationships between wheels of vehicles and rails on the bridge deck. The equations of motion of the coupled WVB system are derived and solved with a nonlinear iterative procedure. A cable-stayed bridge in China is finally selected as a numerical example to demonstrate dynamic interaction of the WVB system. The results show the validity of the present model as well as wind effects on the rail vehicles and the bridge. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
