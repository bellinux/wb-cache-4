25|$|The {{first was}} an {{experimental}} low aspect ratio flying wing. The aircraft used <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> construction {{and was an}} early example of cantilever wing design. The internally braced wing {{was also one of}} the first American aircraft designed without drag-producing struts.|$|E
25|$|The wings {{were covered}} with a 3 ply <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> only 1/20th of an inch thick. The {{internal}} bracing consisted of hundreds of spruce struts. Nine spars tested to 1 ton of load each. Like encountering a Junkers F.13, Bill Stout abandoned wood construction for metal corrugated skinning over a metal frame.|$|E

Internal fit-out {{was done in}} Inchicore, and was {{quite different from the}} original BR design, using bench seating rather than individual seats and with extensive use of <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> panelling.|$|E
30|$|Taken together, these {{findings}} indicate that both methods can decrease the hygroscopicity of poplar veneers and thus improve the interfacial compatibility between <b>wood</b> <b>veneers</b> and plastic film. Thermal treatment is better able to reduce the polarity of <b>wood</b> <b>veneers,</b> while chemical reaction allowed silane modifications.|$|R

Some more traditional materials like <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> were used as highlights throughout the ship, especially in passenger corridors and staterooms. There was also an Observation Bar on Quarter Deck, a successor to its namesake, located in a similar location, on both previous Queens, which offered views through large windows over the ship's bow. This room was lost in QE2s 1972 refit, becoming galley space with the forward-facing windows plated over.|$|E
25|$|Marine plywood is {{manufactured}} from durable {{face and}} core veneers, with few defects so it performs longer in both humid and wet conditions and resists delaminating and fungal attack. Its construction {{is such that}} it can be used in environments where it is exposed to moisture for long periods. Each <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> will be from tropical hardwoods, have negligible core gap, limiting the chance of trapping water in the plywood and hence providing a solid and stable glue bond. It uses an exterior Water and Boil Proof (WBP) glue similar to most exterior plywoods.|$|E
25|$|The {{receivers}} {{took control}} on 8 July 1923 and discontinued freight service north of Perham Junction {{on the former}} P from 24 November 1923 until 1 June 1924, but passenger train service was continued over the entire system through that winter. For the next five years, winter freight and passenger service on the former P north of Phillips was discontinued from December through May. The former F remained in service for receiver Wing's mill in Kingfield, and for a Carrabasset <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> mill built by the Lawrence Plywood Company in 1924. The veneer mill used surplus World War I tanks to haul logs out of the woods.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the colour changes that occurred on <b>wood</b> <b>veneers</b> when subjected to heat treatment by using the CIELab colorimetry technique and NIR spectroscopy. In the present study, colour changes in black alder (Alnus glutinosa L. Gaertn.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) <b>wood</b> <b>veneers</b> were investigated. The two wood species are differently set within the Romanian hardwood classification, namely: black alder is a less valuable wood resource but a fast growing species, while beech represents one of the most common wood species in wood industry. When applied to such veneer species, heat treatment could therefore enhance their use for value added products in furniture manufacturing as an alternative to expensive tropical species.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that of itself Florida Maple is not {{employed}} as a commercial timber species, it is used with associated commercial species when the products are pulpwood, sawtimber, or <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> stock. It is considered a hard maple and as high quality individuals are suitable for producing furniture, flooring, paneling, and shoe lasts. However, its relative scarcity, small size, and fairly poor shape generally confine its use to only factory and box lumber, and even this is only an occasional occurrence. It has, however, been experiencing growing popularity as an ornamental or shade tree, especially in the southern United States due to its high heat resistance. It is also a source of maple syrup, though again its size and rarity limit its use in this regard, {{especially in light of}} the Sugar Maple's established popularity within the business.|$|E

500|$|The AK {{was not the}} {{commercial}} breakthrough that Longren would have liked, but it featured a design innovation that would burnish his reputation greatly. Improving upon the day's standard airplane bodyform – essentially a wooden frame with a fabric skin – Longren designed the first semi-monocoque fuselage. The AK body was formed by joining two mirroring halves into a simple but aerodynamic shape. The two halves formed a hard shell, made of strong vulcanized fibrous material and reinforced {{on both sides with}} <b>wood</b> <b>veneer.</b> The advanced design of the AK was remarkable for its day, and presents what Air & Space/Smithsonian calls [...] "the world's first semi-monocoque, truly composite shell fuselage".|$|E
5000|$|Phenolic backed veneer is {{less common}} {{and is used}} for composite, or {{artificial}} <b>wood</b> <b>veneers.</b> Due to concern for the natural resource, this is becoming more popular.

50|$|The Pace Collection line of desks, {{tables and}} {{cabinets}} was distinguished by the unique Rosen style employing rich, exotic <b>wood</b> <b>veneers</b> having high-gloss finishes with {{polished stainless steel}} trim.

50|$|Historically veneers {{were also}} sawn, {{but this is}} more {{wasteful}} of wood. Veneering is an ancient art, dating back to at least the ancient Egyptians who used expensive and rare <b>wood</b> <b>veneers</b> over cheaper timbers to produce their furniture and sarcophagi. During the Roman Empire, Romans also used veneered work in mass quantities.|$|R
2500|$|Hughes {{continued}} {{the program on}} his own under the designation H-4 Hercules, signing a new government contract that now limited production to one example. Work proceeded slowly, and the H-4 was not completed until well after the war was over. It was built by the Hughes Aircraft Company at Hughes Airport, location of present-day Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California, employing the plywood-and-resin [...] "Duramold" [...] process – a form of composite technology – for the laminated wood construction, which was considered a technological tour de force. [...] The specialized <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> was made by Roddis Manufacturing in Marshfield, Wisconsin. Hamilton Roddis had teams of young women ironing the (unusually thin) strong birch <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> before shipping to California.|$|E
2500|$|Plywood is a sheet {{material}} manufactured from thin layers or [...] "plies" [...] of <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> that are glued together with adjacent layers having their wood grain rotated up to 90 degrees to one another.

2500|$|Initially {{much of the}} {{specialised}} {{yellow birch}} <b>wood</b> <b>veneer</b> and finished plywood used for the prototypes and early production aircraft was brought in Liberty Ships from firms in Wisconsin, US.

50|$|To cater for its {{intended}} market {{the interior was}} luxurious, featuring <b>wood</b> <b>veneers</b> and cloth headlining (but leather upholstery was not available, being replaced with a good-quality vinyl) and the boot was longer {{than that of the}} 1800, contributing to an overall length of 186 in (the 1800 was 167 in long).|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, colour changes in black alder (Alnus glutinosa L. Gaertn.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) <b>wood</b> <b>veneers</b> {{subjected}} to heat treatment at 190  °C for different time spans were investigated. The potential of CIELab system and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy {{were used to}} evaluate the colour changes. The changes in colour appeared mostly by the reduction in lightness which is related to the degradation of hemicelluloses during heat treatment in both wood species. It was found that black alder discoloured much more than beech veneers under same treatment conditions. NIR spectra revealed that the dark colour that <b>wood</b> <b>veneers</b> get under heat exposure is due to the chemical decomposition of lignin and hemicelluloses. Heat treatment could, therefore, enhance the use of such veneers for value added products in furniture manufacturing as an alternative to expensive tropical species.|$|R
