5|$|Constant {{problems}} for Colt were {{the provisions of}} the Militia Act of 1808 which stated that any arms purchased by a State militia had to be in current service in the United States Military. This Act prevented state militias from allocating funds towards the purchase of experimental <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> foreign weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all the toes are straight and blunt, and are thus more adapted to walking than gripping. This is more similar to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, which use their feet as <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> organs of prehension.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no limit}} {{in the law}} on number of owned guns. The law {{specifies}} safe storage requirements for those owning more than two <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> more than 500 rounds of ammunition. The safe storage requirements are further exacerbated for those owning more than 10 and more than 20 firearms.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, Australia has no {{nuclear power}} {{stations}} but ex-Prime Minister Tony Abbott supported nuclear power for Australia. As of 2015, Australia has five uranium mines, four {{of which are}} located in South Australia. Olympic Dam (Roxby Downs) is a large underground mine, Beverley, Four Mile and Honeymoon are in-situ leach mines and Ranger in an open pit mine in the Northern Territory. Uranium mined in Australia is mainly for export. Australia has no nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> nuclear-powered vessels.|$|E
5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other items are found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to a range of}} free-fall nuclear bombs, later Victor B.2s operated as missile carriers for standoff nuclear missiles such as Blue Steel; it had been intended for the American Skybolt missile to be introduced; however, development of Skybolt was cancelled. Target information for Blue Steel could be input during flight, as well in advance of the mission. It was reported that, with intensive work, a B.2 missile carrier could revert to carrying free-fall nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> conventional munitions within 30 hours.|$|E

5|$|LARP {{events have}} {{a wide variety of}} styles that often overlap. Simple distinctions can be made {{regarding}} the genre used, the presence of simulated <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> abstract rules, and whether players create their own characters or have them assigned by gamemasters. There is also a distinction between scenarios that are only run once and those that are designed to be repeatable. A number of other common classifications follow.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{has created}} many works for young audiences. He has {{prepared}} scripts for ten works for The Bell Shakespeare Company's Actors at Work program, a travelling community and schools theatrical education initiative. Other plays {{for young people}} have included Alice Dreaming, {{which is one of}} the Australian Script Centre's anthology of large cast plays. In 2012 he contributed to a Federation Press anthology of monologues for drama students, No Nudity, <b>Weapons</b> <b>or</b> Naked Flames. His play Romeo and Juliet Intensive was nominated for a 2011 AWGIE Award.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1942, the 718th Infantry Division issued {{orders to}} both its regiments that defined the {{following}} groups as hostile: all non-residents and residents {{that had been}} absent from their localities until recently; all identifiable Chetniks or communists with or without <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> ammunition; and anyone concealing, supplying or providing information to those groups. Any captured Partisans were to be briefly interrogated and summarily shot, as were any other insurgents that had attacked the Germans, been caught carrying ammunition or messages, or who resisted or fled. Also, any houses from which shots were fired at German troops were to be burned.|$|E

5|$|Some LARP rules {{call for}} the use of {{simulated}} weapons such as foam <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> airsoft guns to determine whether characters succeed in hitting one another in combat situations. In Russian LARP events, weapons made of hard plastic, metal or wood are used. The alternative to using simulated weapons is to pause role-play and determine the outcome of an action symbolically, for example by rolling dice, playing rock-paper-scissors or comparing character attributes.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Airborne Division had the {{required}} airlift capacity to deliver all three parachute brigades with their glider borne anti-tank <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> {{two of the}} parachute brigades and the airlanding brigade on day one. However, instead {{the vast majority of}} the division's vehicles and heavy equipment, plus 1st Parachute Brigade, most of 1st Airlanding Brigade and divisional troops would be on the first lift. The airlanding brigade would remain at the landing grounds and defend them during the following day's lifts, while the parachute brigade set out alone to capture the bridges and ferry crossing on the River Rhine.|$|E
5|$|The hero, {{who comes}} from a land beyond Alefgard, is a {{descendant}} of the legendary Erdrick. When the hero arrives, he {{does not appear to}} be a warrior – he arrives without <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> armor – and is ignorant of the situation. The populace thinks his claim of the ability to defeat the Dragonlord are preposterous; however, King Lorik sees this ability, which give him hope and he aids the hero on his quest.|$|E

5|$|The {{middle toe}} is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking, and are of little use as <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> organs of prehension as in birds of prey and Old World vultures. The beak is hooked, and adapted to tear rotting meat. The irises of the male are brown, while those of the female are deep red. The eyelids lack eyelashes. Contrary to the usual rule for sexual dimorphism among birds of prey, the female is smaller than the male.|$|E
5|$|A character's {{performance}} in battle {{is determined by}} numerical values ("statistics") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are strength, the effectiveness of physical attacks; defense, the ability to reduce damage received; agility, the effectiveness of ranged <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> skills and at avoiding attacks; and mana, the effectiveness of magical attacks. A character's health is measured in hit points (HP), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are dependent on their sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.|$|E
5|$|A {{subcommittee}} of the S-1 Executive Committee, chaired by James B. Conant, and consisting of himself, Arthur Compton and Harold Urey, was appointed {{to look into the}} issue, and it similarly assessed the danger as low, but still sufficient to warrant taking some precautions. A program was initiated by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Victoreen Instrument Company in Cleveland to develop radiation detection devices suitable for use in the field. Some 48 portable detection meters were built in 1943, half of which were capable of detecting 0 to 10 roentgens per day, while the other half could detect from 0 to 100 roentgens per day. Instruments sets were stored at Manhattan District offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and the area engineer and some other officers were instructed in their use. A special team of scientists was created at the Metallurgical Laboratory who could respond to any reports of the use of nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> radioactive poisons.|$|E

5|$|As they progress, players gain {{experience}} points through defeating {{enemies and}} completing quests for non-player characters (NPCs) scattered around environments: these raise a character's experience level, which grant access to fresh skills and points {{that can be}} used to upgrade character attributes such as health and energy levels, dexterity, intelligence, or strength. If the player dies, they respawn at rebirth fountains scattered through the world, although they lose some accumulated experience points. Quests are divided into Main Quests related to the central narrative, and side quests unique to particular areas of the world. Other NPCs can be found in towns and cities that act as Merchants selling equipment and items: these can be both bought and sold. Player characters have multiple equipment slots, which can take armor for limbs and torso, <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> shields, and accessories that grant passive boons.|$|E
5|$|Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, {{meaning that}} they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, leading to {{applications}} in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Plutonium-240 exhibits {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade (weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles. It is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power some spacecraft. Plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.|$|E
5|$|Survival horror {{games are}} a subgenre of horror games, where the player {{is unable to}} fully prepare or arm their avatar. The player usually {{encounters}} several factors to make combat unattractive as a primary option, such as {{a limited number of}} <b>weapons</b> <b>or</b> invulnerable enemies, if weapons are available, their ammunition is sparser than in other games, and powerful weapons such as rocket launchers are rare, if even available at all. Thus, players are more vulnerable than in action games, and the hostility of the environment sets up a narrative where the odds are weighed decisively against the avatar. This gameplay shifts away from direct combat, and players must learn to evade enemies or turn the environment against them. Games try to enhance the experience of vulnerability by making the game single player rather than multiplayer, and by giving the player an avatar who is more frail than the typical action game hero.|$|E
