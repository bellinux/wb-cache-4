5|$|In October 2012, {{new details}} emerged in her murder investigation. Charges were brought against Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva (alias El Silva) and José Adrián Hernández Domínguez (alias El Jarocho), {{two men who}} were alleged to have murdered Martínez Pérez. Silva, who had already been arrested, confessed to the murder. According to Silva's confession, the {{reporter}} knew Domínguez and therefore allowed both of them into her house {{on the night of}} her murder. After some conversation, Domínguez grew angry and started beating Martínez Pérez with the intention of forcing her to reveal where she hid her money and other valuable possessions. Silva then joined his accomplice in the beating until they killed her. Investigators said that the attackers had plunged the journalist's head into a toilet bowl, hit her on the head several times with brass knuckles, and threw her against a tub, where she cracked her skull. Martínez Pérez unsuccessfully tried to defend herself by grabbing a kitchen knife and stabbing one of the attackers in the forearm, but they managed to outweigh her because she only weighed 108lbs (48.9kg). Both men then stole a plasma TV, two cellphones, a laptop computer, a camera and a small box, and the journalist's <b>wristband</b> from her home before leaving the crime scene.|$|E

40|$|Having {{good balance}} is a facilitating {{factor in the}} {{performance}} of everyday activities. Good balance is also essential in various sport activities in order to both get results and prevent injury.

There are several companies marketing <b>wristbands</b> whose intended function is to improve balance, strength and flexibility. Randomized controlled trials have shown that <b>wristbands</b> with holograms have no effect on balance but studies on <b>wristbands</b> with minerals seem to be lacking...|$|R

25|$|Specializing in climbing, Rasmussen {{showed a}} {{propensity}} for attempting spectacular wins in mountain stages {{in which he}} {{broke away from the}} peloton early and rode alone for most of the stage. Michael Rasmussen was known for his care for detail when considering weight. With a low weight (60kg) he was usually one of the lightest riders in his class. He was known for peeling off unnecessary stickers from his bike, not wearing the Livestrong <b>wristband</b> which was common among many Tour de France riders, due to the additional grams. He used to count each grain of rice before eating and had water with his breakfast cereal, instead of milk. He only carried one water bottle holder and his Colnago Extreme-C bike weighed 6.81kg, only 10g more than the minimum limit.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this is mouse gesture trackings, where the motion of the mouse is {{correlated}} to a symbol being drawn by a person's hand, as is the Wii Remote or the Myo armband or the mForce Wizard <b>wristband,</b> which can study changes in acceleration over time to represent gestures. Devices such as the LG Electronics Magic Wand, the Loop and the Scoop use Hillcrest Labs' Freespace technology, which uses MEMS accelerometers, gyroscopes and other sensors to translate gestures into cursor movement. The software also compensates for human tremor and inadvertent movement. AudioCubes are another example. The sensors of these smart light emitting cubes can be used to sense hands and fingers as well as other objects nearby, and can be used to process data. Most applications are in music and sound synthesis, but can be applied to other fields.|$|E

25|$|After {{winning the}} gold medal in the 2010 FIBA World Championship, Gordon was geared towards a {{breakout}} season. Gordon was on a scoring tear earlier in the season but was slowed down in his game against the Golden State Warriors, with a hard foul committed by Andris Biedriņš, which forced Gordon (who was averaging 24.1 points per game before the injury) to be sidelined for 18 games. It was later revealed that Gordon had a sprained wrist with a bone chip fracture. Returning from an 18-game absence, Gordon had a solid performance with a win against the Houston Rockets with 24 points. Gordon re-aggravated his sprained wrist the second game back against the Denver Nuggets, this time a hard foul committed by Timofey Mozgov, which gave Gordon a 6-game absence. Gordon's breakout season was hampered by injuries and he had to wear a <b>wristband</b> {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E
25|$|Amos {{started off}} with a special one-off show at The Jazz Cafe in London on December 2, 2009 in {{promotion}} for the album.

An estimated 400 people waited outside in the rain for a chance to see Amos perform. The free show was solo-based, with Amos accompanied only by her piano. On December 8, 2009, Amos held a private invitation-only set in which a hundred or so music insiders and personnel gathered at Spin Magazine's office headquarters as part of their SPINHouse Live series. On December 9, 2009 WNYC, due to popular demand, moved their show to the Jerome L. Greene Performance Space and dedicated its one-hour show to a special concert by Amos, followed by an interview. On December 11, 2009 at 3:00pm Amos gave a free live concert via Livestream, followed by an interview, both of which were watched by over 4,000 visitors.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP <b>wristband</b> and accompanying app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems like a big departure, but once we start talking about the things {{it takes to make}} this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all stuff we do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift in the way we approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E
