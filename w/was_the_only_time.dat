5|$|Among Combs' other accomplishments as {{governor}} were requiring voting machines in state elections and {{passage of a}} law making the assessment of state employees for political campaign funds a felony. At {{the end of his}} term, Combs backed Edward T. Breathitt to succeed him {{as governor}}. Breathitt defeated Happy Chandler in the Democratic primary, then went on to defeat Republican Louie B. Nunn in the general election. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> in the 20th century that a Kentucky governor's preferred successor won election.|$|E

5|$|In retirement, the Goodmans {{enjoyed a}} rich family life, visiting often with son Theodore ("Ted") {{and his wife}} Carol, and {{daughter}} Lydia Ann ("Ann") and son-in-law Bob. To his unabashed delight, Urner and Louise Goodman had nine grandchildren. Their son George was killed in action in France during World War II, however.

5|$|Like {{many people}} of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} {{with the president on}} issues such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that he {{thought he was going to}} die that night. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> she ever saw Ochs cry.|$|E

5|$|On 31 May, Ajax, {{under the}} command of Captain George Baird, was the second ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. She fired one salvo of six common pointed, capped shells at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group shortly after 19:00, but had to cease fire {{immediately}} afterwards when her view was obstructed by the ships of the 4th Light Cruiser Squadron. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that the ship fired her weapons during the battle.|$|E

5|$|Ángel Nieto has won {{the most}} championships, with seven. Loris Capirossi is the {{youngest}} to win the championship; he was 17 years and 165 days old when he won in 1990. Italian riders have won the most championships; 14 riders have won a total of 23 championships. Spaniards have won the second most; 6 riders have won a total of 12 championships. Riders from Great Britain have won the third most, as four riders have won {{a total of four}} championships. Nello Pagani won the inaugural championship in 1949. Nicolas Terol was the last rider to win the 125cc championship in 2011. Rupert Hollaus' 1954 title <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> a posthumous World Champion was crowned in any class in Grand Prix motorcycle racing as he was killed before the 1954 season is over. Emilio Alzamora's 1999 title <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> in Grand Prix motorcycle racing that a rider wins the championship without winning a race in a season. Sandro Cortese was the first rider to win the Moto3 championship in 2012. Joan Mir is the current champion.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{preliminary}} report on the hurricane, neither track forecasts or intensity forecasts panned out for the storm. The track forecasts called for a path more northward than the actual track whereas following {{the development of the}} eye, intensity forecasts called for further strengthening until it became clear the cyclone was weakening. When it was upgraded to a hurricane on August 8, Cora became the second hurricane to have been upgraded to that intensity based solely on satellite presentation after 1975's Hurricane Doris. The hurricane was also the second of three storms in the season to reform or be reclassified as East Pacific storms. The other two were Tropical Storm Bess (which became Hurricane Iva), and Hurricane Greta-Olivia. Of these, only Greta maintained its circulation over land. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> an Atlantic hurricane was named Cora.|$|E
5|$|During her tour to Europe, Eva Perón was {{featured}} in a cover story for Time magazine. The cover's caption–"Eva Perón: Between two worlds, an Argentine rainbow"–was {{a reference to the}} name given to Eva's European tour, The Rainbow Tour. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Perón.) However, the 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.|$|E
5|$|Even before {{retiring}} from the Corps, Butler began developing his post-Corps career. In May 1931, he {{took part in a}} commission established by Oregon Governor Julius L. Meier. The commission laid the foundations for the Oregon State Police. He began lecturing at events and conferences and after his retirement from the Marines in 1931, he took this up full-time. He donated much of his earnings from his lucrative lecture circuits to the Philadelphia unemployment relief. He toured the western United States, making 60 speeches before returning for his daughter's marriage to Marine aviator Lieutenant John Wehle. Her wedding <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that he wore his dress blue uniform after he left the Marines.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to operational flying in early 1941 in 616 Squadron, which was forming {{part of the}} Tangmere Wing. Johnson often found himself flying alongside Wing Commander Douglas Bader and Australian ace Tony Gaze. On 15 January 1941, Johnson, the recently appointed Squadron Leader Burton and Pilot Officer Hugh Dundas, who arrived back at the squadron on 13 September 1940, took off to offer cover for a convoy off North Coates. The controller vectored the pair onto an enemy aircraft, a Dornier Do 17. Both attacked the bomber and lost sight of it and each other. Although the controllers intercepted distress signals from the bomber Johnson did not see it crash. They were credited with one enemy aircraft damaged. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> Johnson was to engage a German bomber. By the end of January, Johnson had added another 16.35 flying hours on Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were operating, and in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{was then}} {{overhauled}} and passed by Nancy Simons. With 25 metres left, Morgan took {{her head out}} of the water, and seeing the American a body length in front, dug deep to re-establish a lead of 0.7 of a second going into the final changeover. Crapp then extended the lead over the United States to 2.2 seconds to secure gold in a world record time of 4 minutes 17.1 seconds. The Melbourne Olympics <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that Australia has made a clean sweep of the 100-metre freestyle and the relay events for both men and women. This feat has only been equalled by the Americans at the 1920 Summer Olympics. The victory was Australia's only victory in a female swimming relay at the Olympics until the 2004 Summer Olympics.|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{dominance}} in the IIHF World Championships, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union or Russia won a multinational [...] "best-on-best" [...] hockey tournament involving active NHL players (Canada Cup, World Cup or Olympics).|$|R
50|$|As Wellington {{held the}} Ranfurly Shield their pre season games would also double as Ranfurly Shield games. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>time</b> that <b>the</b> shield <b>is</b> taken on <b>the</b> road. Both the Ranfurly Shield games were won.|$|R
