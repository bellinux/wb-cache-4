5|$|Joseph W. Osborne {{may have}} made the first <b>wine</b> <b>from</b> Zinfandel in California. He planted Zinfandel from Macondray at his Oak Knoll {{vineyard}} just north of Napa, and his wine was much praised in 1857. Planting of Zinfandel boomed soon after, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century it was the most widespread variety in California.|$|E
5|$|Though most provinces {{were capable}} of {{producing}} wine, regional varietals were desirable and wine was a central item of trade. Shortages of vin ordinaire were rare. The major suppliers {{for the city of}} Rome were the west coast of Italy, southern Gaul, the Tarraconensis region of Hispania, and Crete. Alexandria, the second-largest city, imported <b>wine</b> <b>from</b> Laodicea in Syria and the Aegean. At the retail level, taverns or speciality wine shops (vinaria) sold wine by the jug for carryout and by the drink on premises, with price ranges reflecting quality.|$|E
5|$|While Jesus {{is portrayed}} as an impassioned person for his love for all (even for shopping), Buddha tends to be calm and thrifty, and also likes manga. The comedy often {{involves}} visual gags and puns, as well as jokes in reference to elements of Christianity and Buddhism; for example, Jesus creates <b>wine</b> <b>from</b> water in a public bath and Buddha shines when excited.|$|E

50|$|The <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Sainte-Croix-du-Mont {{are similar}} in style to the more famous <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Sauternes {{on the other side}} of the Garonne. In {{similarity}} to Sauternes, they can be kept for several decades.|$|R
5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} <b>wine</b> <b>from</b> Napa Valley vintners at {{low prices}} (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase <b>wine</b> <b>from</b> the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell <b>wine</b> <b>from</b> a New Jersey winery by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the winery. Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E
5|$|Watchet {{developed}} as a town thanks to its closeness to the minerals within the Brendon Hills, and its access to the River Severn for onward shipping. Aside from local ships plying trade across the river, from 1564 onwards the port was used for import of salt and <b>wine</b> <b>from</b> France. In 1643 during the English Civil War, a Royalist ship was sent to Watchet to reinforce for the siege of Dunster Castle. Parliamentarian (Roundhead) Captain Popham ordered his troops into the sea with the tide on the ebb, and with the ship unable to move, attacked the ship with fire from their carbines. Taken by surprise and under heavy attack, the Royalist commander surrendered the ship, resulting in a ship technically at sea being captured by troops on horseback.|$|E
50|$|Valladolid {{is also a}} {{producer}} of wines. The ones that fall under the Designation of Origin Cigales are very good. White <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Rueda and red <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Ribera del Duero {{are known for their}} quality.|$|R
2500|$|During the Middle Ages, <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> {{questionable}} origins {{were often}} passed off as <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> more prestigious regions. In London, local authorities established laws for tavern owners prohibiting French, Spanish, and German <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> being cellared together {{so as to}} prevent the potential for mixing the wines or falsely representing them to the consumer. If a producer or merchant was found selling fraudulent or [...] "corrupt wine", {{they were forced to}} drink all of it. In medieval Germany, the penalty for selling fraudulent <b>wine</b> ranged <b>from</b> branding to beating to death by hanging.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that it was the ancient Romans who first introduced grape growing and wine making in this region. The <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Monterrei were renowned during the Middle Ages. As Federico Justo Méndez stated in his book Brotes de Raíces Históricas: “The <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> the Monterrei valley, due to their excellent quality, were {{on a par with the}} <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Porto, and for a time were sold all over Latin America”.|$|R
5|$|While {{most of the}} {{employees}} are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the male employees a tour of his massive home, spending {{most of the time}} mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild, uninhibited parties. He offers those present on the tour a free bottle of <b>wine</b> <b>from</b> his wine cellar and the staff proceed to get drunk. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay {{for the duration of the}} tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their brown-nosing battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} terroir on {{volatiles}} of Vitis vinifera cv Albariño was studied. Twelve commercial Albariño <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Galicia, Spain, were analysed. The content of varietals and fermentative volatile compounds {{was determined by}} gas chromatography. The numerous significant differences found {{for most of the}} aromatic compounds studied show the influence of the terroir. The Albariño <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> northern Galicia showed the highest total concentration of volatiles analysed. The volatile components showing the greatest differences in Albariño <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> different areas were terpenes and higher alcohols. Among the terpenes found, geraniol was markedly abundant in the north, while nerol and linalool were most abundant in the south. Among the alcohols, 2 -phenyl ethanol and benzyl alcohol showed the highest concentrations in the south and in the north, respectively. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis revealed two clearly defined main groups of Albariño <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> different terroirs. Albariño <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> the south were more heterogenic than those of the north. Copyright © 2007 Society of Chemical IndustryPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|We examine British Columbia (BC) wine consumers’ {{valuation}} of <b>wine</b> imported <b>from</b> emerging suppliers (Argentina, Bulgaria, Chile, Croatia and Hungary) through {{the estimation of}} a hedonic price function. Retail sales data employed in this study comes from the BC Liquor Distribution Branch and covers weekly sales of table wine that was imported from all five countries into the province of British Columbia. The {{results indicate that the}} grape variety is an important factor influencing consumers’ willingness to pay. In particular, white and red <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Chile are associated with larger price premia while <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Argentina command a premium only among red <b>wines.</b> <b>Wines</b> <b>from</b> Bulgaria, Croatia and Hungary, although sold in large quantities in the BC market, are associated with significant price discounts compared to <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> New World suppliers. hedonic pricing, objective characteristics, New World countries, wine, Consumer/Household Economics, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R
50|$|These <b>wines</b> {{are made}} <b>from</b> the classic {{sparkling}} wine grape varieties.

25|$|Chianti Classico are premium Chianti wines {{that tend}} to be medium-bodied with firm tannins and {{medium-high}} to high acidity. Floral, cherry and light nutty notes are characteristic aromas with the wines expressing more notes on the mid-palate and finish than {{at the front of}} the mouth. As with Bordeaux, the different zones of Chianti Classico have unique characteristics that can be exemplified and perceived in some <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> those areas. According to Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, Chianti Classico <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> the Castellina area tend to have a very delicate aroma and flavour, Castelnuovo Berardegna wines tend to be the most ripe and richest tasting, <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Gaiole tend to have been characterised by their structure and firm tannins while <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> the Greve area tend to have very concentrated flavours.|$|R
