500|$|For a brief period, McDonald and Melton {{performed}} {{together as}} a duo at college campuses in the Northwest on behalf of Students for a Democratic Society before returning as regulars at the Jabberwock cafe. The two were joined by local jug band musicians, including Melton's roommates, bass player Bruce Barthol and guitarist Paul Armstrong, and bluegrass guitarist David Bennett Cohen, with whom Melton played in another jug band. The addition of drummer John Francis-Gunning rounded out the six-piece ensemble. It was during their residency at the Jabberwock that Country Joe and the Fish learned to play as a group and expand their repertoire. Within months, based on McDonald and Melton's interest in the live performances of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, the recordings on Bob Dylan's album, Highway 61 Revisited, and {{their use of the}} mind-altering drug LSD, the group began equipping themselves with electric instruments and delving more into psychedelia. As a result, Cohen was moved over to the organ. Cohen's experience with keyboards was limited to having played piano at a semiprofessional capacity at the Jabberwock, but, nonetheless, he quickly adapted to the qualities of the instrument. Melton describes the change of the group: [...] "Once we hit into the electric medium and into the rock medium, we were pandering to the public taste. We became extraordinarily popular. The little folk club where <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> once every two weeks, we played every single night for a month, or something like that, and filled it. And after a while we filled two shows every single night".|$|E

Vaughan recalled: [...] "We changed {{the name of the}} place in the video. Four years ago I got married in a club where <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> all the time called the Rome Inn.

That's where the title came from. And then as <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> 7 nights a week, we were battling for material, we'd go for very long jams on that song, {{sometimes}} 20minutes at a time. And during the long outros, I would hear {{and come up with}} different passages, so I would often jot them down and rehearse them and add or take out a bit here and there.

5000|$|Valayangal (Rings), two rings each of 1-inch {{thickness}} {{are made}} from the plank of wood of a mango tree or a jackfruit tree. Each ring will have a diameter of about 8-8 ? inches. Six holes are made in these rings for tying the strings. Once the holes are made the skin should be stuck on the rings {{in such a manner}} that it covers and reaches out of the circumference of the rings. This skin, which is known as 'ulloori' or 'chavvu', is made from the outer wall of the cow's intestine. This thin layer of skin in cleaned and purified by members of a community named 'chakliar' This skin is stuck onto the rings with a paste made from a special kind of boiled rice mixed with ash obtained by burning dried cow dung.

60|$|I am {{the son of}} a missionary. My {{father was}} {{originally}} curate in charge of a small parish in Oxfordshire. He had already been some ten years married to my dear mother when he went there, and he had four children, of whom I was the youngest. I remember faintly the place where we lived. It was an ancient long grey house, facing the road. There was a very large tree of some sort in the garden. It was hollow, and <b>we</b> children <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> about inside of it, and knock knots of wood from the rough bark. We all slept in a kind of attic, and my mother always came and kissed us when we were in bed. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> wake up and see her bending over me, a candle in her hand. There was a curious kind of pole projecting from the wall over my bed. Once I was dreadfully frightened because my eldest brother made me hang to it by my hands. That is all I remember about our old home. It has been pulled down long ago, or I would journey there to see it.|$|R
5000|$|The Orb {{have always}} {{primarily}} been composed of one individual, Alex Paterson, along with numerous and varied individuals assisting throughout the group's recording career. Paterson began his music {{career in the}} 1980s as a roadie for the post-punk band Killing Joke before eventually leaving in 1986 to pursue his own musical interests, influenced by {{the growing popularity of}} Chicago house music in England during the decade, and shortly thereafter began working with another ambient house pioneer, Jimmy Cauty, who had been involved in the Killing Joke side-project Brilliant. Paterson also performed chillout DJ sets in Paul Oakenfold's Land of Oz night in the club Heaven, which included collaborations with Cauty. Paterson said of these events: [...] "We'd build melodies up by overdubbing and mixing multiple tracks and then take an eight-track, or was it a twelve-track, into Heaven, just linking it up to three decks, loads of CD players, loads of cassettes... <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> keep it very, very quiet. <b>We</b> never <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> any drums in there. It'd be, just like, you know, BBC sound effects, really... four or five hours playing really early dub reggae... For All Mankind. We had white screens so we could put up visuals as well. We had home movies of ducks in the park. We'd go for everything. It was all layering on top of each other." ...|$|R
50|$|Today, in {{this modern}} period {{when there are}} many kinds of modern {{technology}} makes our young generation is not interesting enough <b>to</b> <b>play</b> a traditional game for example Sepak Tekong. This happens {{because there are many}} modern games which are more simple and easier <b>to</b> <b>use</b> for the young generation. This kind of situation makes the existence of Sepak Tekong start to extinct. We can see with our own eyes that only few children that know and play this game. Another reason why it happens is because when we want <b>to</b> <b>play</b> this game we need a large yard. Then we also know {{that it is difficult to}} find a free large land that <b>we</b> can <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it because most of land was already changing to be big buildings, houses, and others. Besides the technology factor also becomes another reason why this game starts to extinct and young generations start to forget this game. In this globalization era, most of young generation think that play this game is not cool and they choose <b>to</b> <b>play</b> modern game <b>to</b> make them look like more impressive. We know that playing this traditional game has many advantages for our children, so we should find a way how to make this game exist and our children still can know and play this game forever. When we are doing nothing there are big chance for this game to get lost and finally our grandchild cannot find this game and cannot feel how great this game is.|$|R

Gertrude just dropped there among the golden young ferns {{as if she had been}} shot. The fright it gave me ought to make me sensible--in this respect at least--for the rest of my life. I thought I had killed her--I remembered that her mother had died very suddenly from heart failure when quite a young woman. It seemed years to me before I discovered that her heart was still beating. A pretty time I had! I never saw anybody faint before, and I knew there was nobody up at the house to help, because everybody else had gone to the station to meet Di and Nan coming home from Redmond. But I knew--theoretically--how people in a faint should be treated, and now I know it practically. Luckily the brook was handy, and after I had worked frantically over her for a while Gertrude came back to life. She never said one word about my news and I didn't dare to refer to it again. I helped her walk up through the maple grove and up to her room, and then she said, 'Rob--is--living,' as if the words were torn out of her, and flung herself on her bed and cried and cried and cried. I never saw anyone cry so before. All the tears that she hadn't shed all that week came then. She cried most of last night, I think, but her face this morning looked as if she had seen a vision of some kind, and we were all so happy that we were almost afraid.|$|E
500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just {{the three of us}} in my bedroom or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise.

40|$|A core {{topic for}} {{landscape}} architecture education {{is how to}} deal with ordinary places, renewing perception and invention tools. <b>We</b> propose <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>playing</b> as a design method. In Italian, paesaggio is a noun of action derived from a verb. <b>To</b> <b>play</b> is <b>to</b> act, in a creative and adaptive way, mixing visible and hidden, actual and imaginary items. To image landscape could be a serious game of civic arts based on simulation, on the "as if" stratagem, taking city by surprise. Stressing on the idea of landscape as result of actions (material a/o intangible) and producing landscape by playful in situ artistic interventions, we can feed awareness of the inventive potential of our eyes (how to look) and hands (how to transform). Among the open spaces of the city, car parks exemplify more than others the potential of imaginative new practices to activate ordinary landscapes of our cities...|$|R
40|$|In {{representing}} {{the most common}} (first-order influence, and gravity induced) acoustic anisotropy, transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry direction (VTI) medium, with the P-wave normal moveout velocity, delta, and eta, we obtain a perturbation radiation pattern that has limited tradeoff between the parameters. Since delta is weakly resolvable from the kinematics of wave propagation, <b>we</b> can <b>use</b> it <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the role that density plays in improving the data fit for an imperfect physical model that ignores the elastic nature of the Earth. An FWI scheme that starts from diving waves would benefit from {{representing the}} acoustic VTI model with the P-wave horizontal velocity, eta, and epsilon. In this representation, the diving waves will help us first resolve the horizontal velocity, and then reflections, if the nonlinearity is properly handled, could help us resolve eta, while epsilon comes at the end to improve the amplitude fit (instead of the density). The model update wavelength for acoustic anisotropic FWI is very much similar to that experienced for the isotropic case. Copyright © 2014 by the European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.
