25|$|So I think {{individual}} {{women will}} react differently; some will not cook that day, some will engage {{in dialog with}} their husband, some will be out at the rallies and demonstrations that will be taking place all over the country. Others will be writing things {{that will help them}} to define where they want to go. Some will be pressuring their Senators and their Congressmen to pass legislations that affect <b>women.</b> <b>I</b> don't think {{you can come up with}} any one point, women will be doing their own thing in their own way.|$|E
25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of <b>women.</b> <b>I</b> think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old <b>women.</b> <b>I</b> don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E

25|$|I am {{ashamed of}} what I tell them: {{that they should}} indeed worry about making an {{accusation}} because what they fear is likely to come true. Not one of the <b>women</b> <b>I</b> have heard from had an outcome that was not worse for her than silence. One, I recall, was drummed {{out of the school}} by peer pressure. Many faced bureaucratic stonewalling. Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.|$|E

I want to write roles that service <b>women.</b> <b>I</b> want to tell stories from a female perspective. I want to create good parts for actresses where they're not just accessories to men." [...] Addressing [...] "the male-dominated" [...] horror genre, Cody said [...] "a key reason for writing the film was {{to bring to the}} screen a new way of expressing the intensity of female bonds" [...] and that the adolescent female friendships she experienced were unparalleled in their intensity. She wanted to show the [...] "almost horrific" [...] aspect of such devotion and its relation to parasitism.|$|E

She commented, [...] "I've never met anyone who has been sensitive about Donna throwing herself at men. The <b>women</b> <b>I</b> meet seem to appreciate her tactics." [...] In the aftermath of the Donna/Mickie storyline, the BBC banned its actresses from appearing in raunchy photo-shoots, after Jacobs and Adams were photographed in intimate poses while dressed in nurses uniforms for various [...] "lads' mags".|$|E

He was {{surrounded}} by <b>women.</b> <b>I</b> went in and slammed a table. A glass broke. The bouncer came, and I punched Caymmi's face. Then I left cussing.

Unlike her previous material from her 2014 EP Opulence, Candy does not rap during the song and instead sings the verses. Mike Wass of Idolator felt that Candy was making a conscious move away from [...] "the twisted white-girl rap" [...] present in her past songs [...] "Opulence" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Fuck Right Now". Wass also called the track [...] "unusually restrained" [...] for the artist. According to Nylon's Yasmeen Gharnit, [...] "Paper or Plastic" [...] revolves around issues relating to [...] "commercialism, superficiality, and selling out". A writer from Hungertv.com viewed the song as focusing on [...] "the capitalist agenda and societal exclusion".

She commented on the disease: [...] "Like many <b>women,</b> <b>I</b> assumed heart disease was a man's disease and cancer was what we would fear the most.

[...] She has undertaken a signature personal element of traveling around the country and talking to women at hospital and community events featuring the experiences of women who live, or had lived, with the condition.

Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of <b>women</b> <b>I</b> had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome.
