5|$|The Metacomet Ridge is {{the result}} of {{continental}} rifting processes that took place 200 million years ago during the Triassic and Jurassic periods. The basalt (also called traprock) crest of the Metacomet Ridge {{is the product of a}} series of massive lava flows hundreds of feet thick that <b>welled</b> <b>up</b> in faults created by the rifting apart of the North American continent from Eurasia and Africa. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric rift valley which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that became the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

25|$|Virtually coeval with {{oldest of}} the flows, the Imnaha basalt flows <b>welled</b> <b>up</b> across northeastern Oregon. There were 26 major flows over the period, one roughly every 15,000 years. Although {{estimates}} are that this amounts to about 10% of the total flows, they have been buried under more recent flows, and are visible in few locations. They can be seen along the lower benches of the Imnaha River and Snake River in Wallowa county.|$|E
25|$|Mount Holyoke, {{like much}} of the Metacomet Ridge, is {{composed}} of basalt, also called trap rock, a volcanic rock. The mountain formed {{near the end of}} the Triassic Period with the rifting apart of the North American continent from Africa and Eurasia. Lava <b>welled</b> <b>up</b> from the rift and solidified into sheets of strata hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent faulting and earthquake activity tilted the strata, creating the dramatic cliffs and ridges of Mount Holyoke. Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt talus produce a combination of microclimate ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Massachusetts. (The Metacomet Ridge article has more information on the geology and ecosystem of Mount Holyoke).|$|E

500|$|Saint Fintan {{founded a}} monastery at Clonenagh, Ireland, {{in the sixth}} century {{and it had a}} spring beside it. This was {{considered}} holy and was visited by pilgrims. In the nineteenth century, a Protestant land owner, annoyed at people visiting the site, filled the well in, whereupon the water started to flow into the hollow interior of a sycamore tree {{on the other side of}} the road. Filled with amazement, people hung rags on the tree and pressed coins into its trunk as votive offerings and it became known as the [...] "Money Tree". Some years later, it fell down, but new shoots appeared from its base, and the water still <b>welled</b> <b>up.</b> It remains a place of veneration on St Fintan's day, February 17.|$|E
500|$|The overall impression, as critic Alex Ross {{writes in}} his book The Rest is Noise, was that [...] "Copland {{was no longer in}} an ingratiating mood; some sudden rage <b>welled</b> <b>up</b> in him, some urge to confront the gala Lincoln Center {{audience}} with an old whiff of revolutionary mystique." [...] Copland himself remembers, [...] "The acidulous harmonies of my score... upset a good many people, especially those who were expecting another Appalachian Spring." [...] Jacqueline Kennedy was left unable to say anything other than [...] "Oh, Mr. Copland" [...] when taken backstage during intermission to meet with the composer. When Copland later asked Verna Fine, wife of American composer Irving Fine, what this meant, Fine answered, [...] "Oh, Aaron, it's obvious. She hated your piece!" [...] In Variety, Robert J. Landry called Connotations [...] "an assault on [...] nervous systems" [...] and added, [...] "Seldom has this reviewer heard such outspoken comment in the lobbies after such dull response. It is strictly accurate to declare that an audience paying $100 a seat and in mood for self-congratulation and schmaltz hated Copland's reminder of the ugly realities of industrialization, inflation and cold war—which his music seems to be talking about." ...|$|E

Subsequent erosion wore away the weaker sedimentary layers a faster rate than the lava layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the lava sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today along the Metacomet Ridge.|$|E

The Prophet began to say, ‘O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!’” Her son Abdullah remembered: “He said, ‘O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja’far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!’” Then Muhammad told his daughter Fatima, “Prepare food for the family of Ja’far, for they are preoccupied today.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 2, 2013, {{two more}} controversies <b>welled</b> <b>up</b> at a city council hearing. The first {{was more than}} $97,000 in {{overtime}} payments to 10 DCFEMS mechanics in fiscal 2012. Ellerbe blamed front-line managers, who allowed too many workers to take leave and then approved too much overtime. He promised new protocoals to ensure it did not recur. The second were accusations of sexual harassment made by two female cadets at the DCFEMS fire training academy against male colleagues. Ellerbe said management [...] "reacted quickly" [...] to the incident, but committee on public safety chair Tommy Wells asked for a D.C. inspector general investigation. Ellerbe spent part of his testimony at the hearing discussing much improved ambulance response times. But a week later, on March 9, Ellerbe was forced to admit that ambulance response times were poor.|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussing}} his artistic career at age 86 he reminisced {{that he never}} intended to be an artist. His wife reported to the newspaper interviewer that [...] "it just <b>welled</b> <b>up</b> out of him". Mulford recalled that his first paintings were done on frosted windowpanes in New Jersey. Then {{in his early twenties}} he started experimenting with photography. This led directly into his early formal painting. A Graflex camera became his constant companion on field trips exploring for snakes, the primary subject on his film of those early days. It was at this time that he inevitably he saw the wildflowers in fields and forests. He experienced the light and shadow of the open and sheltered places. He wasn't able to always capture what he saw and felt on film. He eventually found the answer in painting.|$|E

2500|$|The Metacomet Ridge was {{the product}} of several massive lava flows {{hundreds}} of feet deep that <b>welled</b> <b>up</b> in faults created by the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia and Africa. The basalt floods of lava occurred over a period of 20 million years. Erosion occurring between the eruptions deposited deep layers of sediment between the lava flows, which eventually lithified into sedimentary rock. The resulting [...] "layer cake" [...] of basalt and sedimentary sheets eventually faulted and tilted upward. Subsequent erosion wore away the weaker sedimentary layers a faster rate than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today. The best way to imagine this is to picture a layer cake tilted slightly up with some of the frosting (the sedimentary layer) removed in between. The sedimentary rock of the Metacomet ridge is well known for its fossils, especially dinosaur tracks.|$|E
2500|$|East Rock is a fault-block ridge formed 200 {{million years}} ago during the Triassic and Jurassic periods and is {{composed}} of trap rock, known as basalt, if extrusive, or diabase, if intrusive. East Rock, being intrusive, is diabase. Diabase is a dark colored rock, but the iron within it weathers to a rusty brown when exposed to the air, lending the ledges a distinct reddish appearance. Diabase frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique [...] "postpile" [...] appearance. Huge slopes made of fractured diabase scree are visible beneath many of the ledges of East Rock. These diabase cliffs {{are the product of}} lava intrusions hundreds of feet deep that <b>welled</b> <b>up</b> through faults creating sills during the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia and Africa over a period of 20 million years. Erosion and glacial abrasion over the subsequent 200 million years wore away the weaker sedimentary layers, under which the sill had intruded, at a faster rate than the diabase, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the diabase sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today.|$|E
2500|$|Frank Battaglia also {{draws on}} the term [...] "ides" [...] by pairing it with [...] "dis." [...] He notes that the [...] "dis" [...] were [...] "female {{guardian}} spirit" [...] with [...] "power over the dead and choosing who would die. In this capacity [...] might be feared." [...] Battaglia thus suggests that Grendel's mother is the Early Germanic goddess Gefion (whom he states was also a form of Nerthus and Freyja). He also argues that: [...] "in scaldic poetry the word dis means goddess [...] Freyia herself is called Vanadis, that is, dis of the Vanir, the Scandinavian chthonic, fertility deities." [...] Battaglia then notes that Gefion is referenced five times in the poem: l.49 (géafon on gársecg – [...] "Gefion on the waves"), l.362 (ofer geofenes begang – [...] "over Gefion's realm"), l.515 (geofon ýþum – [...] "Gefion <b>welled</b> <b>up</b> in waves"), l.1394 (né on gyfenes grund – [...] "Ground of Gefion"), and l.1690 (gifen géotende – [...] "Gefion gushing"). In addition, he indicates that [...] "in Old English poetry, geofon is a word for ocean which has been seen since Jakob Grimm (1968, 198) as related to the name Gefion of the Danish Earth Goddess ... power to divide land and sea is shown by representations of Gefion in Norse literature." ...|$|E
