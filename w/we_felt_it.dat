500|$|Blige further {{revealed}} that the song would be released as a single but was delayed due to Beyoncé's pregnancy at that time adding that, [...] "whenever she's ready, if she's ever ready, I'm ready and it'll be great." [...] During an interview with Rap-Up magazine, Garrett further spoke about the collaboration, saying, [...] "I initially did the record for Beyoncé and then we just felt {{it would be an}} even bigger record with Beyoncé and Mary J. Blige... Both these women are two iconic female figures in the world, and what would be better than putting those two on a record? <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would be a really iconic move." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, {{the game}} was refused {{classification}} by the Australian Classification Board due to [...] "violence that exceeds strong in impact". Warner Bros. unsuccessfully appealed the decision to the Classification Review Board, who ruled [...] "the impact of the violence in Mortal Kombat is higher than strong and thus could not be accommodated within the MA15+ classification." [...] The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service listed the game as a prohibited item and the Australian Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor asked to be briefed on the Mortal Kombat decision, citing [...] "public disquiet on the issue". In 2012, the Vita version of Mortal Kombat was banned in Australia as well. A spokesperson for Warner Bros. commented: [...] "We felt {{that because of the}} Vita's size, the smaller screen would minimise the impact of the violence in the game and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> might fit within the MA15+ category. Obviously, the Classification Board of Australia did not agree." [...] In 2013, however, following the introduction of an R18+ classification, Mortal Kombat was released uncensored on May 1, 2013, with the R18+ rating.|$|E

500|$|The {{content of}} Illmatic is also {{informed}} by notions of artistic authenticity. The promotional press sheet {{that accompanied the}} album's release implied Nas’s refusal to conform to commercial trends, stating: “While it's sad that there's so much frontin' in the rap world today, this should only make us sit up and pay attention when a rapper comes along who's not about milking the latest trend and running off with the loot.” At {{the time of the}} album's release, the hip hop community was embroiled in a debate about artistic authenticity and commercialism in popular music. Rapper Common, describes in the preface to Born to Use Mics: Reading Nas's Illmatic the concerns that were felt by him and his contemporaries: “It was that serious for so many of us. We didn’t just grow up with hip hop; we grew up with hip-hop as hip-hop was also growing, and so that made for a very close and intimate relationship that was becoming more and more urgent – and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it.</b> Our art was being challenged in many ways as the moneymen began to sink their teeth into us.” ...|$|E
500|$|On September 2, 2014, {{during the}} ABC airing of , Walt Disney Animation Studios' chief {{creative}} officer John Lasseter {{announced that a}} Frozen short film with a new song would be released in the future. On the same day, Variety announced that the short would be released in early 2015 under the title Frozen Fever, with Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee returning as co-directors, Peter Del Vecho returning as producer and a new song by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Olaf the snowman would also make an appearance in the short. On December 3, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Aimee Scribner would be a co-producer and that Frozen Fever would debut in theaters alongside Walt Disney Pictures' Cinderella on March 13, 2015. In late December, the co-directors told the Associated Press [...] "There is something magic about these characters and this cast and this music. Hopefully, the audiences will enjoy the short we're doing, but <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> again. It was really fun." [...] Around the same time, Dave Metzger, who worked on the orchestration for Frozen, disclosed he was already at work on Frozen Fever.|$|E
500|$|Co-creator and {{executive}} producer Roberto Orci explained {{in an interview that}} the big reveal {{at the end of the}} episode, in which Olivia meets Bell in the parallel universe, was actually planned for a fourth season, but the writers decided [...] "let's actually answer something instead and not get, not just rely on that mystery forever. And so we actually chose to give kind of a big answer and have to come with a different show than we ever intended". The writers wanted to use an iconic image [...] for the scene, leading to staff writer Andrew Kreisberg's suggestion of the Twin Towers. Wyman first thought it was [...] "the greatest idea in the world" [...] before having doubts that its use would [...] "sensationalize" [...] it. He explained, [...] "But then, when we started thinking about it, we thought collectively America really understood 9/11 is such a monumental moment so <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> wasn’t exploited but indicative of the times we’re living in right now. We used it and that was the end of the first season and then we were all really thrilled with where it was going." [...] The cast would later recollect on the series, and for Jackson, considered that the show has never [...] "had a better visual or a better cliff-hanger" [...] as this finale.|$|E

2500|$|Lostprophets {{cancelled}} {{their show}} at Reading and Leeds Festival in 2003 {{to continue their}} work on the album.

2500|$|Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top) {{has used}} several {{different}} Gibson models {{over the course}} of his career including Goldtop Les Pauls, Flying Vs, Explorers, ES-5 Switchmasters and Les Paul Juniors. His main guitar is a 1959 Les Paul Standard nicknamed [...] "Pearly Gates". [...] "Pearly has such an unmistakable character that <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to find another instrument with a similar sound to use as a spare guitar. We accumulated dozens of guitars, but nothing quite matched her. But instead of tossing these other acquisitions away, they kept accumulating. It's an ongoing saga that never ends." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band officially began {{recording}} their tenth studio {{album with}} producer Rick Rubin in September 2010. According to Rubin, the band recorded enough material {{to release a}} second double album, following Stadium Arcadium but ultimately decided not to. Rubin notes, [...] "it was painful not to share all of the material that we had, but <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> would be too much. We really {{wanted it to be}} twelve songs but it ended up being fourteen just because nobody could agree on which twelve." [...] The recording process lasted until March 2011. Many of the songs were written between October 2009 and August 2010 and according to Flea around 60–70 songs were written in the ten months prior to entering the studio to record the album.|$|E

2500|$|Garbage's {{intention}} is to make pop-like songs which mixed a variety of genres, with Steve Marker saying that the band wanted to [...] "take pop music and make it as horrible sounding as we can." [...] These genres include trip hop, grunge, 1980s rock music, techno, power pop and shoegazing. Shirley Manson has stated that the band itself [...] "used to describe [...] as sci-fi pop, because <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was taking a futuristic approach." [...] Vig has said the crossover-heavy sound {{was inspired by the}} band's background with remixes, where songs would be rearranged to every musical style to which they held interest, and also that he [...] "grew up listening to everything from pop radio and opera to country music and polka, so I really thought that Garbage would be an interesting and eclectic thing to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Big Black's first {{release for}} Touch and Go was the Headache EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited {{original}} {{edition of the}} EP {{was a pair of}} forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic [...] "body bag" [...] to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers. A sticker on the EP's cover read [...] "Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your hopes up, cheese!" [...] According to Durango, [...] "We didn't want to sit there and screw people. If <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> wasn't as good, then we should just be honest about it." [...] Indeed, Headache recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on Atomizer, showing signs that the band was lagging creatively. Durango later remarked that [...] "I was feeling tapped out ideawise. At that point I think we had tried everything that we wanted to try, musically and in the studio." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, guitarist/vocalist David Davidson, drummer Phil Dubois-Coyne and bassist Anthony Buda, who {{attended}} {{a high school in}} Boston, Massachusetts, formed Cryptic Warning, influenced by Guns N' Roses and Metallica. The band recorded its first demo in 2002 and gained an underground following in Boston, also performing outside of Massachusetts. A second demo, Internally Reviled, was recorded in 2004. In 2005, Cryptic Warning recorded its debut studio album, Sanity's Aberration, but was not content with the quality of the album's production. Remembering those recordings, Davidson said: [...] "We didn't record the album with a metal guy, so we didn't get the sound we wanted. The heaviest reference in our producer's discography was The Cult. A lot of people still love that record—our old-school fans who used to show up for all of the shows—but to us, we weren't really satisfied with the production of that. <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was one of the mistakes we made." ...|$|E
500|$|Jim Seavey, {{associate}} director of athletics stated: [...] "Twelve years ago, the college discarded the logo that depicted the Indian with the headdress and feathers and stuff. We really did {{not have anything to}} represent our identity that we were comfortable with. <b>We</b> <b>felt...</b> that <b>it</b> wasn't appropriate to have a physical representation of a Native American as our mascot".|$|R
5000|$|Loretta Young {{said she}} found Jeff Chandler very {{attractive}} {{and he told}} her that he was falling in love with her. She says the relationship never progressed beyond hand-holding outside their love scenes, [...] "but I think until he died, <b>we</b> both <b>felt</b> <b>it.</b> If I'd see him on the street I'd walk the other way because I didn't want to spark anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} he was grown angry, and said he, [...] "I have no engagement," [...] and he put his back to the shop-window.

2500|$|The {{film was}} shot and edited in a cinéma vérité style, to look like it was taped with one {{hand-held}} camera, including jump cuts similar to ones found in home movies. T.J. Miller, who plays Hud, has said in various interviews that he taped {{a third of the}} movie and almost half of it made it into the film. Director Matt Reeves described the presentation, [...] "We wanted this to be as if someone found a Handicam, took out the tape {{and put it in the}} player to watch it. What you're watching is a home movie that then turns into something else." [...] Reeves explained that the pedestrians documenting the severed head of the Statue of Liberty with the camera phones was reflective of the contemporary period. According to him: [...] "Cloverfield very much speaks to the fear and anxieties of our time, how we live our lives. Constantly documenting things and putting them up on YouTube, sending people videos through e-mail– <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was very applicable to the way people feel now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The release date, {{title and}} artwork were {{disclosed}} on 17 January 2012 {{as well as}} the news that it would also be available on Blu-ray, CD and LP ({{as well as the}} aforementioned DVD format, released in standard and special [...] "steel book" [...] editions). In addition, the band confirmed that they had chosen their performance in Chile as the main basis for the release, with Harris commenting, [...] "After much consideration, we chose the Santiago show as <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was one of our best performances of the entire tour and to play at the prestigious Estadio Nacional was a landmark moment for us." [...] Furthermore, the press release reported that the video will include the use of split screens, with director Andy Matthews later commenting that [...] "Split screens are a way of showing several pieces of action at the same time. With Maiden, you have a dramatic wide shot of the stage, as well as six bandmembers, Eddie and an amazing crowd! We used this technique as so much is going on." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 10 August in Washington, U.S. colonels Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel III were tasked with {{dividing}} the Korean Peninsula into Soviet and U.S. occupation zones and proposed the 38th parallel. This was incorporated into the U.S. General Order No. 1 which responded to the Japanese surrender on 15 August. Explaining {{the choice of the}} 38th parallel, Rusk observed, [...] "even though it was further north than could be realistically reached by U.S. forces, in the event of Soviet disagreement... <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> important to include the capital of Korea in the area of responsibility of American troops". He noted that he was [...] "faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area". As Rusk's comments indicate, the U.S. doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this. Stalin, however, maintained his wartime policy of co-operation, and on 16 August the Red Army halted at the 38th parallel for three weeks to await the arrival of U.S. forces in the south.|$|E
5000|$|Talking {{about the}} project Lowery has {{explained}} that [...] "It all has a dark spooky twist to it; kind of Nine Inch Nails meets Foo Fighters. ... <b>We</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>it</b> was time to explore a little bit beyond Sevendust.", and also that {{the sound of the}} band is [...] "...a lot different from Sevendust, it's hard but it’s not the same type of heavy that Sevendust is.".|$|R

A camp-fire was speedily kindled, and the two parties mingled together, and sat down amicably to discuss roast monkey and venison steaks together.|$|R

2500|$|Ed Roberts had {{designed}} and manufactured programmable calculators and {{was familiar with}} the microprocessors available in 1974. He thought the Intel 4004 and Intel 8008 were not powerful enough (in fact two microcomputers based on the Intel 8008 were already on the market: The Micral marketed in January 1973 by the French company R2E and the MCM/70 marketed in 1974 by the Canadian company Micro Computer Machines); the National Semiconductor IMP-8 and IMP-16 required external hardware; the Motorola 6800 was still in development. So he chose the 8-bit Intel 8080. At that time, Intel's main business was selling memory chips by the thousands to computer companies. They had no experience in selling small quantities of microprocessors. When the 8080 was introduced in April 1974, Intel set the single unit price at $360 (About $1,700 in 2014 dollars). [...] "That figure had a nice ring to it," [...] recalled Intel's Dave House in 1984. [...] "Besides, it was a computer, and they usually cost thousands of dollars, so <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was a reasonable price." [...] Ed Roberts had experience in buying OEM quantities of calculator chips {{and he was able to}} negotiate a $75 price (about $350 in 2014 dollars) for the 8080 microprocessor chips.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} {{songs from the}} new album were played live was on 17 August 2003 at Newport, the first gig of three {{alongside}} a Birmingham date and a Manchester date, {{in preparation for the}} Reading and Leeds festival at the end of August. For these gigs We Still Kill The Old Way became the regular opener, whilst sets closed with Burn Burn, with tracks from their previous album interspersed in between. Kerrang noted in a live review from Manchester that We Still Kill The Old Way and To Hell We Ride were [...] "well received" [...] but that [...] "the surfeit of new material leads to a comparatively muted response". At the end of July though it was announced that the band had cancelled their appearance at Reading and Leeds, whilst still promising to play the three warm-up shows, citing that they wanted the recording of Start Something to take precedence. Ian Watkins said [...] "Unfortunately these shows are at the final stages of making the record and <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was more important not to short change anyone." [...] The band did however support Linkin Park at Wembley Arena in London on 22 November 2003 playing eight tracks, including five from the soon to be released new album. Therefore, the band played four dates altogether in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|To {{commemorate the}} 20th anniversary of Achtung Babys {{original}} release, U2 reissued {{the record in}} several formats in October 2011. Leading up to the anniversary, the band was unsure how much attention to pay to a past album while still actively writing and recording new material. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "How big a deal do we make of an anniversary when we're {{in the middle of}} what we're doing now? We had a hard time figuring that out. We're not a heritage act. We're still very active. But this record was so pivotal that <b>we</b> <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> was OK to revisit it." [...] Director Davis Guggenheim was subsequently commissioned by the band to make a film about Achtung Baby in six months. As a fan of U2 since his youth and having previously collaborated with The Edge for the 2008 documentary It Might Get Loud, Guggenheim agreed to the project. His goal for the film was to explain how U2 managed to remain together for so long, in contrast to other rock groups that have been undone by internal conflict; he described the band's longevity as [...] "fighting against that law of physics". Guggenheim also sought {{to tell the story of}} how the band transformed themselves musically over the course of Achtung Babys recording sessions.|$|E
