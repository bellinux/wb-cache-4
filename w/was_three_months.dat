5|$|Unable to {{definitely}} {{prove to}} the court where their money had come from, Daniel and Wilson were eventually found guilty, and sentenced to 14 years' hard labour. However, the maximum term the Magistrate could legally impose <b>was</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> and in 1896 they were released at {{the order of the}} High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Henry Brougham Loch. The High Commissioner's legal team subsequently quashed the convictions altogether, saying that the evidence against Daniel and Wilson was not sufficiently conclusive. The existence of Lobengula's box of sovereigns was never proven either way, and the incident never explained beyond doubt.|$|E
5|$|O. G. S. Crawford {{was born}} on 28 October 1886 at Breach Candy, a suburb of Bombay in British India. His father, Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, was a civil servant who had been educated at Marlborough College and Wadham College, Oxford before moving to India, where he became a High Court judge at Thane. The Crawford family came from Ayrshire in Scotland, and the child's great-uncle was the {{politician}} Robert Wigram Crawford. Crawford's mother, Alice Luscombe Mackenzie, {{was the daughter of}} a Scottish army doctor and his Devonshire wife. Alice died a few days after her son's birth, and so when he <b>was</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> old, Crawford was sent to England aboard the P liner Bokhara. During the journey he was entrusted to the care of his paternal aunt Eleanor, an Anglican nun who {{was the head of the}} Poona Convent of the Community of St Mary the Virgin.|$|E
5|$|When Britten <b>was</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> old he {{contracted}} {{pneumonia and}} nearly died. The illness {{left him with}} a damaged heart, and doctors warned his parents that he would probably never be able to lead a normal life. He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer. To his mother's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, while his brother, though musically talented, was interested only in ragtime. Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five. He started piano lessons when he was seven years old, and three years later began to play the viola. He {{was one of the last}} composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house.|$|E
