50|$|From August 20, 2010, to April 13, 2011, McKinley was {{suspended}} from practicing medicine by an executive committee with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. During this period McKinley, who was experiencing problems with alcohol, received {{treatment at the}} Homewood Health Centre in Guelph, Ontario, which specializes in addiction treatment. In January 2011, McKinley was arrested for violating a bail condition and obstructing justice by attempting to dissuade a witness from giving evidence. He later admitted to sending the witness two e-mails on January 8, 2011, threatening her with a public mischief charge and suggesting he would endanger her job by complaining to the organization overseeing her profession. He also urged her to make the Crown's office <b>withdraw</b> <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> against him. However, the same month McKinley's assault charges were stayed by Superior Court Justice Paul Rivard because the district Crown's office had prejudiced his right to a fair trial. The Crown's office could not show it had responded to seven written requests from McKinley's lawyer to disclose evidence on the assault charges.|$|E

50|$|Until July 2014, the Section 498a of the Indian Penal Code {{allowed the}} police to arrest the persons {{mentioned}} in the <b>complaint</b> without <b>a</b> warrant or without any investigation. The crime was non-bailable, so chances of getting a bail are low and husbands usually lost their jobs while in custody. On 2 July 2014, the Supreme Court of India in an order stopped automatic arrests under the Section 498a. The Court directed {{the police to}} use the Section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which contains a checklist, to decide whether an arrest is necessary. The Court also stated that in all arrests the magistrate must examine whether further detention was necessary. There is also no provision of <b>withdrawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> {{in case of a}} reconciliation. However, an amendment to rectify this has been proposed.|$|R

25|$|Kopp ran {{as a more}} {{conservative}} candidate than Traylor, criticizing her positions on spending and immigration. During the race, {{a supporter of the}} Kopp campaign filed, and later <b>withdrew,</b> <b>a</b> campaign finance <b>complaint</b> against Traylor regarding a donation from a teachers' union that Traylor refused to accept. Kopp received endorsements from former U.S. Senator Bill Armstrong and former Colorado Senate President John Andrews. Kopp achieved a narrow victory, taking 45 percent of the vote over Traylor's 44 percent, with and Everett receiving 8 percent. Citing tactics used by Kopp and his supporters, Traylor refused to endorse fellow Republican Kopp in the general election, even after a request from Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez.|$|R

5000|$|On January 29, 2014, Matthew Barrett {{represented}} by GLAD filed <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination against Fontbonne Academy, a Catholic secondary school in Milton, Massachusetts, because in July 2013 the school <b>withdrew</b> <b>an</b> {{offer of employment}} as food service manager when officials learned {{he was in a}} same-sex marriage. After accepting the job offer, Barrett completed paperwork and provided as his emergency contact the name Ed Suplee, whom he identified as his [...] "husband". A few days later the school withdrew its offer of employment and explained that his status as a spouse in a same-sex marriage was inconsistent with the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} study highlights {{the lack of}} {{public awareness of the}} role of the Advertising Standards Board (ASB) in the process of handling complaints about unacceptable advertising in Australia. Results show that only a small proportion of Australian adults know that the ASB are the appropriate complaints handling body. This lack of awareness is evident even among those who have made <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> about advertising (generally to a less appropriate body). This highlights the need for an education campaign to inform the general public how to make <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> about inappropriate advertising, and who to make <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> to. Empowering the general public in relation to this issue, has the potential to result in <b>a</b> <b>complaints</b> handling system that is accessible and equitable to all members of the community...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> is {{the first}} {{pleading}} filed by a plaintiff which initiates <b>a</b> lawsuit. <b>A</b> <b>complaint</b> sets forth the relevant allegations of fact {{that give rise to}} one or more legal causes of action along with a prayer for relief and sometimes a statement of damages claimed (an ad quod damnum clause). In some situations, <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> is called <b>a</b> petition, in which case the party filing it is called the petitioner and the other party is the respondent. In equity, sometimes called chancery, the initial pleading may be called either a petition or <b>a</b> bill of <b>complaint</b> in chancery.|$|R
