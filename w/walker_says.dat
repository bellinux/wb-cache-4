500|$|Liszt {{composed}} his symphonic poems {{during a}} period of great debate among musicians in central Europe and Germany, known as the War of the Romantics. While Beethoven's work was admired universally, conservatives that included Johannes Brahms and members of the Leipzig Conservatory considered it unsurpassable. Liberals such as Liszt, Wagner and others of the New German School saw Beethoven's innovations as a beginning in music, not an end. In this climate, Liszt had emerged as a lightning-rod for the avant-garde. Even with the innovative music being written by Wagner and Berlioz, it was Liszt, <b>Walker</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "who was making all the noise and attracting the most attention" [...] through his musical compositions, polemic writings, conducting and teaching.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{positive}} reaction of the studio audience during recordings, a second series was commissioned before the first had started to be transmitted. However, the show was, as Mark Lawson summarised, [...] "widely disliked". [...] The BBC's publicity department compared Chalk to Fawlty Towers in the publicity materials. Critics, though, took exception to a new show being compared to such a renowned and respected programme. The cast point out that Fawlty Towers and Chalk are completely different shows, while Nicola <b>Walker</b> <b>says</b> that the comparison is like being asked to be [...] "compared to a comedy God". Writing for the BBC Guide to Comedy, Mark Lewisohn observes that the critical reception was mixed, with [...] "its detractors pointing out that Eric Slatt was a carbon copy of John Cleese's Basil Fawlty [...] its supporters praising its non-PC, off-the-wall approach and the breathlessly paced plots that delivered moments of high farce." [...] Lewisohn also comments that while some elements of the show resemble Please Sir!, [...] "Chalk more closely resembled the ill-fated Hardwicke House with its concentration on the teachers rather than the pupils, dark themes and overall depiction of the teachers as ... nuts." [...] Tom Lappin for Scotland on Sunday derided the combination of Chris Barrie's [...] Gordon Brittas and Cleese's Basil Fawlty.|$|E

500|$|Franz Liszt, a Hungarian composer, had {{attempted}} to write a Revolutionary Symphony as early as 1830; however, his focus for {{the early part of}} his adult life was mostly on his performing career. By 1847, Liszt was famous throughout Europe as a virtuoso pianist. [...] "Lisztomania" [...] swept across Europe, the emotional charge of his recitals making them [...] "more like séances than serious musical events", and the reaction of many of his listeners could be characterized as hysterical. Musicologist Alan <b>Walker</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Liszt was a natural phenomenon, and people were swayed by him.... With his mesmeric personality and long mane of flowing hair, he created a striking stage presence. And there were many witnesses to testify that his playing did indeed raise the mood of an audience to a level of mystical ecstasy." [...] The demands of concert life [...] "reached exponential proportions" [...] and [...] "every public appearance led to demands for a dozen others." [...] Liszt desired to compose music, such as large-scale orchestral works, but lacked the time to do so as a travelling virtuoso. In September 1847, Liszt gave his last public recital as a paid artist and announced his retirement from the concert platform. He settled in Weimar, where he had been made its honorary music director in 1842, to work on his compositions.|$|E
500|$|In late 1977, {{while in}} {{rehearsal}} {{for their next}} album, and {{just days before the}} band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker, a longtime friend of the band, who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown, and informed him that Osbourne had left the band. Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath. On 8 January 1978, Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song [...] "Junior's Eyes" [...] on the BBC Television programme [...] "Look! Hear!" [...] Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and {{came to the conclusion that}} Osbourne was not fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath. [...] "The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me", Osbourne said. [...] "I was doing it for the sake of what we could get out of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out." [...] Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the [...] "Look! Hear!" [...] footage still exist, <b>Walker</b> <b>says</b> that he is not aware of them.|$|E
2500|$|Taine's {{influence}} on French intellectual culture and literature was enormous. He {{had a special}} relationship, in particular, with Émile Zola. As critic Philip <b>Walker</b> <b>says</b> of Zola, [...] "In page after page, including many of his most memorable writings, we are presented with {{what amounts to a}} mimesis of the interplay between sensation and imagination which Taine studied at great length and out of which, he believed, emerges the world of the mind." [...] Zola's reliance on Taine, however, was occasionally seen as a fault; Miguel de Unamuno, after an early fascination with both Zola and Taine, eventually concluded that Taine's {{influence on}} literature was, all in all, negative.|$|E

In the letter, she also rebukes Benjamin Netanyahu policies, and those in the US who back them. Fellow author Howard Jacobson criticized <b>Walker</b> <b>saying</b> that her concern for setting the children of Gaza over the children of Israel does not justify the flotilla, and that she gives no convincing reason for partaking.|$|R

2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have argued that}} the references to homosexuality in the NT, or the Bible in general, have to be understood in their proper historical context. Indeed, most interpreters come to the text with a preconceived notion of what the Bible has to say about normative sexual behaviors, influencing subsequent interpretations. For example, William <b>Walker</b> <b>says</b> that the very notion of [...] "homosexuality" [...] (or even [...] "heterosexuality", [...] "bisexuality" [...] and [...] "sexual orientation") is essentially a modern concept that would simply have been unintelligible to the New Testament writers. The word [...] "homosexuality" [...] and the concept of sexual orientation as being separate from one's perceived masculinity or femininity (i.e. gender identity) did not take shape until the 19th century. Moreover, although some ancient Romans (i.e. doctors, astrologers, etc.) discussed congenital inclinations to unconventional sexual activities such as homosexuality, this classification fails to correspond to a modern psychological, biological and genetic distinction between homosexual, heterosexual and bisexual orientations. However, according to Gagnon, the concept of homosexual orientation was not wholly unknown in the Greco-Roman milieu. Moreover, he asserts that there is absolutely no evidence that modern orientation theory would have had any impact on Paul changing his strong negative valuation of homosexual practice.|$|E

In a pre-season friendly against Heybridge Swifts on 15 July, Lewington took the unusual step of starting in goal for the Swifts after their regular goalkeeper Danny Sambridge arrived late for the game. Lewington kept a clean sheet until Sambridge was ready to join the game, in what was an eventual 8-0 win for Colchester. He also appeared in a friendly against his former club Dagenham & Redbridge, with the U's coming out on top in a 4-3 victory on 26 July.|$|R

5000|$|In 1967, Walker {{began working}} {{full-time}} with WRVR, {{the radio station}} of the Riverside Church. In 1969, Walker began performing as a stand-up comedian and was eventually discovered by the casting director for Good Times, after making appearances on Rowan & Martin's Laugh In and on the Jack Paar Show. He eventually released one stand-up comedy album {{during the height of}} his Good Times popularity: Dyn-o-mite on Buddah Records (5635). During Good Times 1974-75 season, Walker was 26 years old, though his character was much younger. John Amos, the actor who portrayed Walker's father on Good Times, was actually just eight years older than Walker. Walker credits producer/director John Rich for inventing [...] "Dy-no-mite!" [...] which Rich insisted <b>Walker</b> <b>say</b> on every episode. Both Walker and executive producer Norman Lear were skeptical of the idea, but the phrase and Walker's character caught on with the audience. Also, off- and on-camera, Walker did not get along with series' lead, Esther Rolle, who played Florida Evans, in the series, because she and Amos disapproved of Walker's increasingly buffoonish character and his popularity, and Walker felt hurt by their disdain.
