60|$|LOCKHART, &c., for the panel, {{denying the}} libel, or any guilt or {{accession}} of the panels {{to the murder}} charged, pled that the panels were persons of good fame and reputation, and that as no cause of malice in them against Serjeant Davies was alleged, so the circumstances founded on in the indictment, though they were true, were not in any sort sufficient to infer a proof of the panels' guilt. And further, the panels {{would be able to}} prove a true and warrantable cause for going to the hill libelled on in arms, and that they went openly and avowedly; and that in the circumstances they were in, it was impossible they could have any wicked design against, or expect to have an opportunity of executing such a design against Serjeant Davies: That they were not so much as suspected of murdering him {{at the time of his}} being amissing, or for several months thereafter, when many different accounts were given, and suspicions raised and entertained concerning that matter. THEY also objected and alleged for the panels, that as murder was the only crime charged against them in this indictment, no vague or general allegation of robbery, or other crime or accusation against their characters, could be allowed to go to the knowledge of an assize, though they were noways apprehensive of the consequences of it, other than from the false and malicious reports, raised and propagated against them, since their commitment for the foresaid crime; and the panels had great reason to complain of the undue delays in bringing them to trial for this offence: In so far as, after they were committed for the same in September last, and had taken out letters of intimation, and upon expiry of the days, had also obtained letters of liberation, they were again committed upon a new warrant for alleged theft, upon which new commitment they raised new letters of intimation, and when the sixty days were just expiring, they were served with an indictment for the theft, which was fixed to within a few days of the expiry of the forty days allowed by law, and then allowed to drop; and after all, there was again a new <b>warrant</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> obtained against them for wearing the Highland dress; and last of all they were served with this indictment; all which steps plainly show the oppression they have met with, which the panels do by no means lay to the charge of the prosecutor, but are willing to allow the same to be owing to the malicious information of some private informer, which they hope to be able to make appear if they were allowed an exculpatory proof, and that very undue means had been used both before and since the citation of the witnesses to influence them to give evidence against the panels in this matter; and the panels, amongst many other things for their exculpation, would be able to prove, that after they returned from the hill upon the day upon which the Serjeant is said to have been murdered, he, the Serjeant, was seen with his party in that hill. So that it is impossible the panels could be the perpetrators of the murder.|$|E

50|$|In 2002, the SIS {{reported}} that Ahmed Zaoui, an Algerian seeking asylum in New Zealand, was a security risk and recommended his deportation. However, this recommendation was challenged. The SIS issued a security risk certificate pursuant to section 114 of the Immigration Act 1987 and Zaoui was detained in a penal institution under a <b>warrant</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> The SIS refused to release some highly classified information which {{it used to}} determine Zaoui's status as a security risk. Alleged comments made by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who monitors the SIS, were considered {{by some to be}} openly biased against Zaoui. As a result of the resulting controversy, the Inspector General, Laurie Greig, resigned in March 2004. Former Solicitor General, Paul Neazor, was appointed to replace Greig. The security risk certificate on Zaoui has since been lifted by the SIS, and he has been allowed to stay in New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{there have}} even been a few rare {{occasions}} where a simulation was validated as it was being carried out. One notable such occurrence was just before the famous Ardennes offensive in World War II, when the Germans attacked allied forces {{during a period of}} bad weather in the winter of 1944, hoping to reach the port of Antwerp and force the Allies to sue for peace. According to German General Friedrich J Fangor, the staff of Fifth Panzerarmee had met in November to game defensive strategies against a simulated American attack. They had no sooner begun the exercise than reports began arriving of a strong American attack in the Hűrtgen area—exactly the area they were gaming on their map table. Generalfeldmarschall Walther Model ordered the participants (apart from those commanders whose units were actually under attack) to continue playing, using the messages they were receiving from the front as game moves. For the next few hours simulation and reality ran hand-in-hand: when the officers at the game table decided that the situation <b>warranted</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> reserves, the commander of the 116th Panzer Division was able to turn from the table and issue as operational orders those moves they had just been gaming. The division was mobilised in the shortest possible time, and the American attack was repulsed.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and measure the effects of Hofstede‟s cultural factors on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> for hospitality managers among American and Chinese managers. Typical cultural factors include power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism and collectivism, masculinity and femininity, and orientation. Escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> refers to making decisions in risky circumstances. First, the effect of cultural factors on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> was measured through antecedents (mediator variables). Second, the first effect of antecedents on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> was measured through agency and negative framing effects. Structural equation modeling (SEM) found significant relationships between cultural factors and mediator variables, mediator variables and escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and cultural factors and escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> The comparisons between American and Chinese managers showed that some of the cultural factors and antecedents (mediator variables) were found to have different significant impacts on escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Implication and discussion were discussed in terms of employee training, job assigning, and close monitoring based on employee tendency for escalation <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> Limitations and recommendations for future research were also discussed in terms of unsatisfactory level of measurement reliability and variance explained by the research model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{standard}} model of self-enforcing dynamic international environmental agreements by allowing {{the length of the}} period <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>of</b> such agreements to vary as a parameter. It analyzes the pattern of behavior of the size of stable coalitions, the stock of pollutant and the emission rate {{as a function of the}} length of the period <b>of</b> <b>commitment.</b> It is shown that the length of the period <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> can have very significant effects on the equilibrium. Three distinct intervals for the length of the period <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> are identified, across which the equilibrium and its dynamic behavior differ considerably. Whereas for sufficiently high values of the period <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> only self-enforcing agreements of two countries are possible, for sufficiently low such values full cooperation can be generated. Lengths <b>of</b> periods <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> between those two thresholds are characterized by an inverse relationship between the length <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> and the membership size of the agreement. This suggests that considerable attention should be given to the determination of the length of such international agreements.
