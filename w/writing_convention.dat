2500|$|In dictionaries, both {{words and}} {{individual}} characters have readings glossed, via various conventions. Native words and Sino-Japanese vocabulary are glossed in hiragana (for both kun and on readings), while borrowings (gairaigo) – including modern borrowings from Chinese – are glossed in katakana; {{this is the}} standard <b>writing</b> <b>convention</b> also used in furigana. By contrast, readings for individual characters are conventionally written in katakana for on readings, and hiragana for kun readings. Kun readings may further have a separator to indicate which characters are okurigana, and which are considered readings of the character itself. For example, in the entry for , the reading corresponding to the basic verb [...] may be written as [...] (ta.beru), to indicate that ta is {{the reading of the}} character itself. Further, kanji dictionaries often list compounds including irregular readings of a kanji.|$|E

40|$|This applied {{dissertation}} {{was designed}} to determine the impact of direct <b>writing</b> <b>conventions</b> instruction on second grade writing mechanics mastery at an independent school in southeast Florida. The research study utilized a nonexperimental quantitative method. The design was pretest-posttest with a control. The pretest-posttest assessment was the Children’s Progress Academic Assessment. The score utilized in the analysis was the Phonics/Writing subtest. De-identified data were collected and analyzed from two separate second grade classes from two consecutive school years (i. e., 2011 - 2012, 2012 - 2013). The control group consisted of 43 second graders who received <b>writing</b> <b>conventions</b> instruction {{in the context of}} student writing during individual and small group conferences. The control group received no direct <b>writing</b> <b>conventions</b> instruction. The treatment group consisted of 39 second graders who received direct <b>writing</b> <b>conventions</b> instruction through the use of mini-lessons during the writing workshop. An analysis of the de-identified data revealed that, although the treatment group mean change score had a positive change greater than the control group change score, the change was not statistically significant. The researcher failed to reject the null hypothesis relative to a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Recommendations were made for future research...|$|R

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that in many writing classes, the pedagogy can be somewhat generic, focusing mostly on the basics of essay writing, while simultaneously being somewhat narrow, in that composition textbooks often default to a style of writing more common within the discipline of literature. This article therefore discusses the results of several studies which analyze differences in <b>writing</b> <b>conventions</b> across several disciplines. Ultimately, the argument is made that, as the writing class serves {{to prepare students for}} their future academic writing needs, it is subsequently imperative to teach students discipline-specific <b>writing</b> <b>conventions,</b> in order to make them aware of what ‘good’ writing means beyond the writing class. ...|$|R
50|$|There is {{some debate}} amongst EAP {{teachers}} {{as to the}} best way to help students with academic English.

Together, they produced Dead Witch Walking, and her first book was published in paperback by HarperTorch in 2004. Since then, she has written twelve more books, two graphic novels, and extensive world book in the Hollows series, also called the Rachel Morgan series, (most with titles punning off Clint Eastwood movies) and contributed to multiple anthologies, with prequels to the Hollows books, and one with a young adult story.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of surviving Jurchen-language inscriptions, {{the overwhelming majority of}} primary documentary sources on the Jurchen people available to modern scholars are in Chinese. Therefore, when names of Jurchens, or Jurchen terms, are written in English, the same <b>writing</b> <b>convention</b> is usually followed as for Chinese words, that is, the English spelling is simply the Romanization (Pinyin or Wade-Giles, as the case may be) of the Modern Standard Mandarin pronunciation of the Chinese characters that were used to render the Jurchen name or word. This standard presentation does not attempt to reconstruct the original Jurchen pronunciation of the word, or even the 12th-century Chinese pronunciation of the Chinese characters (even though more-or-less hypothetical Middle Chinese pronunciation of Chinese characters can be looked up in specialized dictionaries and databases, and reconstructing pronunciation of some Jurchen words is attempted by some authors as well.) Thus, for example, the Jurchen name of the first Jin emperor is written in Chinese as , and appears in English scholarship as Wanyan Aguda (using Pinyin) or Wan-yen A-ku-ta (using the Wade-Giles system).|$|E
