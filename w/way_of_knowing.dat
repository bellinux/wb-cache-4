30|$|Indigenous <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> and {{learning}} {{are described as}} relational and interconnected because they are seen from a holistic perspective (Steinhauer 2002).

40|$|The radical subjectivism of the Austrian {{school of}} {{economics}} is a special case <b>of</b> Dewey’s <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing.</b> Austrian economists adopted an Aristotelian deductive approach to economic issues such as social behavior and exchange.

Alternative <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> which do not offer practical or intellectual benefits are to be rejected.

5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais.

Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{tells the}} story of a journey through the <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> which inform {{occupational}} therapy (OT) in mental health. A broad terrain was covered during this journey, and mental health occupational therapists use three different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> in their work: theory, evidence and practice. The purpose of this thesis was to integrate these <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> in mental health OT, within a unified professional identity which encompassed the diverse and multidimensional nature of practice. The overall research question guiding this thesis was: How do theoretical, evidentiary and practice <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> integrate and incorporate to guide evidence based practice for occupational therapists working in mental health? It was addressed through an examination of 1596 peer reviewed articles published over 13 years (2000 – 2012) by occupational therapists, clients and professional organisations. The intended outcome was to provide occupational therapists working in mental health with the means to integrate and incorporate theoretical, evidentiary and practice <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing,</b> in a manner that was congruent with their professional values...|$|R

5|$|With no <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> {{where the}} boy had been taken—Momolo found out only in early July—the Mortaras, {{supported}} by the Jewish communities in Bologna, Rome and elsewhere in Italy, initially focused on drafting appeals and trying to rally support from Jews abroad. The greatly expanded public voice wielded by Jews in western European countries following recent moves towards freedom of the press, coupled with Jewish political emancipation in the Kingdom of Sardinia, Britain, France and the United States, caused Mortara's removal to gain press attention far beyond anything previously given to such incidents. The papal government was initially disposed to simply ignore Momolo's appeals, but reconsidered after newspapers began reporting on the case; the pontifical state's many detractors seized on the episode {{as an example of}} papal tyranny.|$|E
5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s. The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene, {{comprising}} 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes. They initiated a head-on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3. A Hurricane and a Dornier collided, both going down. The Bf 109s {{did their best to}} break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation, putting up withering cross-fire. The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters. Time and again, they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream, allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process. Soon after, No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes. One fighter was hit by return fire, but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out. The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber. The German bomber crews had no <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> that the crashes were not premeditated. It seemed as if the British were desperate. Nevertheless, they thought the 'tactic' was devastatingly effective. Chastened by losses, the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the gaps and continued to their target.|$|E

"Research {{examining}} women’s personal epistemology {{found two}} beliefs {{that tend to}} be gender related, connected knowing and separate knowing. Connected knowing is characterized by empathizing and placing oneself within another person’s situation to see from the inside out.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} farmers’ <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> {{water quality}} and their encounters with the science used in policy to address the cumulative effects of agriculture. Drawing on constructivist theories of knowledge and discussions with farmers in two locations of New Zealand's South Island region of Canterbury, the research identifies a significant divergence between farmers’ conception of the water quality problem compared to the issue's policy framing. In theory, and increasingly in practice, <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> are assumed merely out-of-sync and their integration or coproduction possible and necessary. This paper poses the question: what if the <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>of</b> farmers and science have become incompatible?

40|$|This article {{examines}} the interaction between geographic scale and <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> {{in the context of}} collaborative stakeholder participation in ecosystem analysis and management. The examination uses data from a qualitative comparative case study of two watershed councils in western Oregon. The results tentatively support the proposition that geographic scale can significantly affect individual stakeholder <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing.</b> For small-scale places, stakeholder <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> tend to be particularistic and rely on diverse personal experiences and specific place features; for large-scale places, stakeholder <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowing</b> tend to be aesthetic and rely primarily on recreational experiences and scientific analyses. However, the results also indicate that geographic scale combines with at least three factors to affect the development <b>of</b> shared <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing: (1) tensions between experts and laypersons; (2) primacy of organizational representation in stakeholder interactions; and (3) discovery of common group identity based on long-term communication and shared on-the-ground experiences, such as field trips. This examination suggests that geographic scale in ecosystem management is likely an important factor affecting working relationships in a collaborative stakeholder participation process. These relationships, in turn, can affect the perceived credibility and legitimacy of outcomes. FOR. SCI. 49 (6) : 841 – 854...|$|R
