5|$|Baseball {{has had a}} broad {{impact on}} popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game {{is the source of}} a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. The first {{networked}} radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{were often}} first sketched by Oliver, before {{she moved to}} {{construction}} in three dimensions. When preparing commissions, she would draw on the ideas of clients or {{the nature of the}} site. For large works she created maquettes (or models), sometimes in plasticine, on other occasions using copper wire or, in the case of her 2002 sculpture Globe, wood and metal. Oliver would produce the more delicate works herself. Many were created by crafting and joining <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> create abstract forms. These were built around moulds, twisting the metal into place with pliers, before severing it with wirecutters. Joins were soldered or brazed (though in some pieces, the wire was woven). In Web (2002), copper pieces were sewn together using wire.|$|E

5|$|Sir Arthur Churchman bought Orford Castle in 1928, and in 1930 {{gave the}} {{property}} to the Orford Town Trust; an appeal for money to maintain and restore it began shortly afterwards. During the Second World War the castle was refortified with barbed <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> form what was originally intended to be an anti-aircraft emplacement, with Nissen huts erected around the keep. The castle was instead used as a radar emplacement, and a concrete floor was installed in the south-east tower to support the equipment. These buildings were removed {{at the end of}} the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The 42nd Division's {{participation}} in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive began on 14 October when it attacked with both brigades. That evening, a conference was called to discuss the attack, during which Charles Pelot Summerall, commander of the First Infantry Division and V Corps, telephoned and demanded that Châtillon be taken by 18:00 the next evening. An aerial photograph had been obtained that showed {{a gap in the}} German barbed <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> the northeast of Châtillon. Lieutenant Colonel Walter E. Bare—the commander of the 167th Infantry—proposed an attack from that direction, where the defenses seemed least imposing, covered by a machine-gun barrage. MacArthur adopted this plan. He was wounded, but not severely, while verifying the existence of the gap in the barbed wire.|$|E
5|$|The George III Fringe Tiara is a circlet {{incorporating}} brilliant diamonds {{that were}} formerly owned by George III. Originally commissioned in 1830, the tiara has been worn by many queens consort. Originally, {{it could be}} worn as a collar or necklace or mounted on a <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> form the tiara. Queen Victoria wore it as a tiara {{during a visit to}} the Royal Opera in 1839. In Franz Xaver Winterhalter's painting The First of May, completed in 1851, Victoria can be seen wearing it as she holds Prince Arthur, the future Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. In a veiled reference to the adoration of the Magi, the Duke of Wellington is seen presenting the young prince with a gift.|$|E

5|$|After a {{successful}} (8–1–1) football season in 1955, Tech {{was invited to}} play in the 1956 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against the University of Pittsburgh. It would be the school's fifth straight bowl appearance under renowned coach Bobby Dodd. Pittsburgh had a black starting player, fullback Bobby Grier, but as Tech had played a 1953 game against a desegregated Notre Dame team, and the University of Georgia had very recently played out-of-state games against desegregated opponents, president Van Leer and the Tech Athletic Association saw the game's contract as acceptable. However, racial tension in the South was high following the recent Brown v. Board of Education decision. Georgia Governor Marvin Griffin had privately given Dodd his support, but he surprised the campus and the state on Friday, December 2, 1955 by bowing to pressure from segregationists and sending a <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> the Georgia Board of Regents chairman, Robert O. Arnold, requesting not only that Tech not play the game, but that all University System of Georgia teams play only segregated games.|$|E
5|$|After {{covering}} up a murder that occurred at The Crazy Horse, Adriana is arrested and pressured by the FBI {{to wear a}} <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> avoid being charged as an accomplice. She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E
5|$|After regrouping, Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark, she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a harpoon, but the spear also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to reach a ceasefire, peacekeepers escorted Tshombe {{to the front lines}} where he was forced to agree that his own forces were attacking UN {{positions}} without provocation. He ordered his troops to cease firing but was ignored. Radio intercepts revealed to the UN that General Norbert Moke, the commander of the Katangese Gendarmerie, had ordered the Katangese Air Force to bomb the Élisabethville airport on the night of 29 December. With the failure to enact a ceasefire, Lieutenant General Dewan Prem Chand of India convinced Thant to authorise a strong, decisive offensive to pre-emptively eliminate Katangese forces. This brought relief to some of the UN peacekeepers, mindful that they now had justification to act forcefully against Katanga. Determined to avoid civilian casualties and widespread destruction, the secretary-general sent a <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> the UN Force Commander in the Congo to explain that napalm was to be prohibited from use in combat. Early on 28 December for unknown reasons, Tshombe quietly departed Élisabethville.|$|E
5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E

Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud going up {{the steps of the}} courthouse, knowing that while he is likely going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E

5|$|The realistic-looking {{effects of}} the astronauts {{floating}} weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached {{to the top of}} the set, and placing the camera underneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the suspension wires, creating a very believable appearance of floating. For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's rescue attempt, a stuntman replaced a dummy on the <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> realistically portray the movements of an unconscious human, and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space. The scene showing Bowman entering the emergency airlock from the E.V.A. pod was done in a similar way: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held the wire suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically configured airlock. At the proper moment, the stagehand first loosened his grip on the wire, causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding the wire firmly, he jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back up toward the hatch.|$|E
5|$|This {{was how he}} {{personally}} designed many of the Sagrada Família's sculptures. He would thoroughly study the anatomy of the figure, concentrating on gestures. For this purpose, he studied the human skeleton and sometimes used dummies made of <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> test the appropriate posture of the figure {{he was about to}} sculpt. In a second step, he photographed his models, using a mirror system that provided multiple perspectives. He then made plaster casts of the figures, both of people and animals (on one occasion he made a donkey stand up so it would not move). He modified the proportions of these casts to obtain the figure's desired appearance, depending on its place in the church (the higher up, the bigger it would be). Eventually, he sculpted the figures in stone.|$|E
5|$|Izzie {{appears in}} the first episode of Grey's Anatomy, meeting fellow interns Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley. She and George move in with Meredith and become best friends. Izzie's boyfriend, hockey player Hank (Jonathan Scarfe), struggles to accept her new role as a surgeon, and the two break up. Izzie is hurt when Alex exposes her past as a {{lingerie}} model. However, the two later go on to begin a friendship and then a romance. Alex experiences sexual dysfunction with Izzie and cheats on her with nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback). When Izzie finds out, she breaks up with him, though they briefly reunite following a bomb incident at the hospital. Izzie reveals while treating a pregnant teenager {{that she had a}} daughter at the age of 16 and gave up for adoption. Izzie falls in love with cardiothoracic patient Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and the two become engaged. When Denny's condition deteriorates, Izzie deliberately worsens his health further by cutting his LVAD <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> move him up the donor register. Although Denny receives a new heart, he has a stroke hours later and dies. Izzie is the sole beneficiary of Denny's will, inheriting $8.7million. She uses the money to open a free clinic at the hospital: the Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic.|$|E

5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the <b>wire</b> <b>to</b> melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
