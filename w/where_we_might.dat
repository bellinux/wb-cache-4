2500|$|The Basis steps {{demonstrate}} that the simplest provable sentences from [...] are also implied by , for any [...] (The proof is simple, since the semantic fact that a set implies any of its members, is also trivial.) The Inductive step will systematically cover all the further sentences that might be provable—by considering each case <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>might</b> reach a logical conclusion using an inference rule—and shows that if a new sentence is provable, it is also logically implied. (For example, {{we might have a}} rule telling us that from [...] "" [...] we can derive [...] " [...] or [...] ". In III.a We assume that if [...] is provable it is implied.

25|$|There {{exists a}} class of 'radiatively inefficient' {{solutions}} to the equations that govern accretion. The most widely known {{of these is the}} Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF), but other theories exist. In this type of accretion, which is important for accretion rates well below the Eddington limit, the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole. Radiatively inefficient accretion has been used to explain the lack of strong AGN-type radiation from massive black holes at the centres of elliptical galaxies in clusters, <b>where</b> otherwise <b>we</b> <b>might</b> expect high accretion rates and correspondingly high luminosities. Radiatively inefficient AGN would be expected to lack many of the characteristic features of standard AGN with an accretion disc.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} model free energy from an {{expansion}} that basically includes graphs without loops. From this calculation, we derive the temperature {{dependence of the}} density (or specific volume), the typical time scale of the α-relaxation, and the heat capacity. From this, we argue that the glass transition {{is dominated by the}} vicinity of a first order phase transition. The fluctuations, observable in principle as scattering, would support the findings and would increase in terms of amplitude close to the phase boundary (while the size stays constant). This amplitude is connected to the cluster size, also introduced in the cooperativity argument. Minor arguments about corrections from loops are discussed <b>where</b> <b>we</b> also <b>might</b> have found an argument for the "Boson Peak".
