5|$|Under federal law, private-party sellers are not {{required}} to perform background checks on buyers, <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> a gun show or other venue. They also are {{not required}} to record the sale, or ask for identification. This requirement is in contrast to sales by gun stores and other Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders who are required to record all sales and perform background checks on almost all buyers, regardless of whether the venue is their business location or a gun show. Access to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is limited to FFL holders and FFLs are not issued to persons that only sell firearms at gun shows.|$|E

25|$|Creighton was {{considered}} a prominent member of the cricket community, playing both amateur and professional. He performed for the American Cricket Club in both 1861and 1862, often playing against the all-England team, <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> the Elysian Fields or elsewhere. Though the English teams would dominate these matches, Creighton fared well. In an 1859match of 11Englishmen against 16Americans, he clean bowled five wickets out of six successive balls.|$|E
25|$|The South African {{government}} has introduced the Expanded Public Works Program (EPWP) {{to overcome the}} extremely high unemployment and accompanying poverty in that country.

They also recognise that the state (<b>whether</b> <b>at</b> the level of national or local government) has a major role to play in providing for employment guarantees.|$|E

25|$|In the era {{following}} the 16th-century Spanish {{conquest of the}} Aztec Empire, {{a number of sources}} were written that conflate Quetzalcoatl with Ce Acatl Topiltzin, a ruler of the mythico-historic city of Tollan. It is a matter of much debate among historians to which degree, or <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> all, these narratives about this legendary Toltec ruler describe historical events. Furthermore, early Spanish sources written by clerics tend to identify the god-ruler Quetzalcoatl of these narratives with either Hernán Cortés or Thomas the Apostle—an identification which is also a source of diversity of opinions about the nature of Quetzalcoatl.|$|E
25|$|After a full, painless {{range of}} motion is achieved, the patient may advance to a gentle {{strengthening}} program. Rockwood coined the term orthotherapy to describe this program which is aimed at creating an exercise regimen that initially gently improves motion, then gradually improves strength in the shoulder girdle. Each patient is given a home therapy kit, which includes elastic bands of six different colors and strengths, a pulley set, and a three-piece, one-meter-long stick. The program is customized, fitting {{the needs of the}} individual and altering when necessary.

25|$|We {{think of}} the {{proposed}} Harvard library transition {{as a manifestation of}} the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot be imagined in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can only serve to further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.|$|E

25|$|This diagram shows a {{productive}} {{use of space}} by West Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final which led to Gerd Müller's game-winning goal against the Netherlands. German midfielder Rainer Bonhof made a long diagonal run out {{to the right side}} of the field, putting put him clear of the Dutch opposition. Deep into the Dutch half, Bonhof received a ball from Jürgen Grabowski and beat Arie Haan. Bonhof sent a low cross in to Müller, who found the back of the net. Moving diagonally is one of the best offensive movements, <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> the near or far posts, or out to the wings farther back in midfield. Diagonal movement creates added space to maneuver, compared to simply running straight ahead or laterally. It also means that players must be willing to switch positions as the situation demands.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne Cup day is {{a public}} holiday for all working within {{metropolitan}} Melbourne and some parts of regional Victoria, but not for some country Victorian cities and towns which hold their own spring carnivals. For Federal Public Servants it is also observed as a holiday in {{the entire state of}} Victoria, and from 2007 to 2009 also in the Australian Capital Territory known as Family and Community Day replacing Picnic Day. The Melbourne cup captures the public's imagination to the extent that people <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> work, home, school, or out and about usually stop to watch or listen to the great race. Many people from outside of Melbourne take a half or full day off work to celebrate the occasion. Many people feel that the day should be a national public holiday as Sick leave is said to increase on the day and productivity wanes.|$|E
25|$|Anna plays only a {{very minor}} role {{in the story of}} the first game, {{appearing}} as a sub-boss character for Nina. Her story was further expanded in later games. In Tekken 2, as in the first tournament, the 20-year-old Nina was once again hired to assassinate the sponsor of the current tournament, Kazuya Mishima. <b>Whether</b> <b>at</b> Kazuya's discretion or Anna's own volition, Anna became a bodyguard for Kazuya, along with Ganryu and Bruce Irvin, who were all charged with Kazuya's protection. Nina was later captured by Mishima Zaibatsu forces and used in Dr. Bosconovitch's cryonics research. Learning about this, Anna volunteered to be another test subject, requesting that she be woken in the future {{at the same time as}} Nina. Her reason for doing this is unknown, but the two most reasonable explanations would be because she didn't want to feel lonely without Nina, and she didn't wanted her sister's age preserved in a cryonic sleep while she herself continues to age.|$|E

25|$|Part V of the Act {{provides}} that whenever the Minister for Home Affairs is satisfied that a person, <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> large or in custody, {{has been associated}} with activities of a criminal nature, the Minister may, with the consent of the Public Prosecutor, order that the person be detained for any period not exceeding 12 months if he is satisfied that the detention is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order; or order that the person be subject to police supervision for any period not exceeding three years if he is satisfied that this is necessary. Within 28 days of a detention order being made, the Minister must refer the order and a statement of the grounds upon which the order was made to an advisory committee. The advisory committee must submit a written report on the making of the order, with recommendations as it thinks fit, to the President of Singapore, who may cancel or confirm the order. The President may, from time to time, extend the validity of any detention order for periods not exceeding 12 months at any one time, and may at any time refer any such orders for further consideration by an advisory committee. Between 2008 and 2012, the average number of detention orders issued each year was 43, and as of 31 October 2013 there were 209 people detained under the CLTPA.|$|E

His drive and enthusiasm were overwhelming, <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> work, in charitable activities, or as a courageous hunter and fisherman. He had a warm {{family life and}} many friends." [...] According to JRT Wood, Wilson [...] "hated Beadle perhaps because Beadle was clever but spoke his mind"; the British Prime Minister described Beadle to Lord Alport shortly after UDI as combining [...] "the courage of a lion" [...] with [...] "the smartness of a fox". In Robert Blake's History of Rhodesia, Beadle is characterised as [...] "an irrepressible, bouncy extrovert, who does not always perceive the reaction which he causes in others."

She had found him recently confused, but otherwise an honest and admirable lodger. As she stood down, Alley informed the court that two more witnesses had arrived from Liverpool. However, when they saw Bellingham, they realised {{that he was not}} the man to whose derangement they had come to attest, and withdrew. Mansfield then began his summing up, during the course of which he clarified the law: [...] "The single question is <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> the time this act was committed, he possessed a sufficient degree of understanding to distinguish good from evil, right from wrong". The judge advised the jury before they retired that the evidence showed Bellingham to be [...] "in every respect a full and competent judge of all his actions".|$|E

500|$|The {{county court}} not only heard civil and {{criminal}} cases, but decided matters such as local taxes. Membership fell to most major landowners. Mason was a justice {{for much of the}} rest of his life, though he was excluded because of nonattendance at court from 1752 to 1764, and resigned in 1789 when continued service meant swearing to uphold a constitution he could not support. Even while a member, he often did not attend. Joseph Horrell, in a journal article on Mason's court service, noted that he was often in poor health, and lived the furthest of any of the major estateholders from the Fairfax County courthouse, <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> its original site near today's Tyson's Corner or later in newly founded Alexandria. Robert Rutland, editor of Mason's papers, considered court service a major influence on Mason's later thinking and writing, but Horrell denied it, [...] "if the Fairfax court provided a course for Mason's early training, he chiefly distinguished himself by skipping classes." ...|$|E
500|$|Employing {{citizens}} in construction and repairing works {{was done in}} ancient Sri Lanka {{as a form of}} tax payment. Such labour may also have been used {{in the construction of the}} Polonnaruwa Vatadage. However, the quality of the works indicate that most of the task may have been carried out by skilled craftsmen. Architecture of vatadage type structures was at its peak during the Polonnaruwa period, and the Polonnaruwa Vatadage is considered to be its [...] "ultimate development". Some of the most striking features of the structure are its elaborate stone carvings. The sandakada pahana (moonstone) at the northern entrance and the two muragalas (guard stone) at the eastern entrance are considered to be the best examples of such architectural features belonging to the Polonnaruwa period. These decorational elements were commonly placed at entrances to monastic buildings of ancient Sri Lanka, and historians believe that sandakada pahanas depict the cycle of Saṃsāra in Buddhism. According to Bell, the carvings on the sides of the upper platform are [...] "unrivalled, <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> Anuradhapura or Polonnaruwa, and probably in any other Buddhist shrine of Ceylon".|$|E
500|$|He and Albert {{were brought}} up and educated {{together}} {{as if they were}} twins. Though Albert was fourteen months younger, he surpassed Ernest intellectually. According to their tutor, [...] "they went hand-in-hand in all things, <b>whether</b> <b>at</b> work or at play. Engaging in the same pursuits, sharing the same joys and the same sorrows, they were bound to each other by no common feelings of mutual love". Perhaps the [...] "sorrows" [...] aforementioned related to their parents' marriage. It was not a happy one and Duke Ernest I was continually unfaithful. In 1824, Ernest I and Louise divorced; she subsequently left Coburg and was disallowed from seeing her sons again. She soon remarried to Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Pölzig and Beiersdorf, dying in 1831 at the age of thirty. The year after her death, their father married his niece Duchess Marie of Württemberg, who was his sister Antoinette's daughter. Their stepmother was thus also their first cousin. The duke and his new duchess were not close, and would produce no children; while the boys formed a happy relationship with their stepmother, Marie had little to no input in her stepsons' lives. The separation and divorce of their parents, as well as the later death of their mother left the boys scarred and in close companionship with each other.|$|E
