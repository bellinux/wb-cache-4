5|$|In 1937 Briskin was {{responsible}} for bringing Milton Berle to the screen. During a strike by the Federated Motion Picture Crafts union in 1937, there was concern {{that they would be}} joined by members of the Screen Actors Guild. Briskin was one of four producers chosen by the producers guild to negotiate with the actors' union to head off them joining the walkout. As the new film season started in the summer of 1937, Briskin announced that RKO <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> increase in their overall production budget from $14.5 million in the 1936–37 season, to $18 million for the 1937–38 season. In mid-July 1937, it was announced that Briskin had received a long-term extension on his contract, however, several months later it was revealed that the deal had never been finalized, and that Briskin was considering leaving RKO. In early November the change became official when Briskin resigned as RKO's head of production. Briskin had been offered a three-year deal by the studio, which he rejected. Rumors began to circulate about where Briskin was headed. In early December it was being reported that Briskin would be heading to Paramount, although he denied those reports.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{information}} from the SEC, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects that implementing H.R. 1105 <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> effect on the agency’s workload.

Further, the SEC is authorized to collect fees sufficient to offset its annual appropriation; therefore, the CBO estimates that the net budgetary effect of implementing H.R. 1105 would be negligible.

25|$|There are differing {{estimates}} of the total capital held by Iranian expatriates. One estimate places the number at $1.3 trillion US dollars. Whatever the actual number, {{it is clear that}} these funds are sufficiently large enough to buy significant stakes in all state companies. In Dubai alone, Iranian expatriates are estimated to have invested up to $200 billion. Even a 10 percent repatriation of capital <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> impact. In 2000, the Iran Press Service reported that Iranian expatriates had invested between $200 and $400 billion in the United States, Europe, and China, but almost nothing in Iran. FIPPA provisions apply to all foreign investors, and many Iranian expatriates based in the US continue to make substantial investments in Iran.|$|E
25|$|The club turned {{professional}} on 20 December 1895, and in {{the summer}} of 1896 they were admitted to the Division One of the Southern League. On 2 March 1898, the club also became a limited company, the Tottenham Hotspur Football and Athletic Company. Soon after, Frank Brettell became the first ever manager of Spurs, and he signed John Cameron, who took over as player-manager when Brettell left a year later. Cameron <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> impact on Spurs, winning the club its first trophy, the Southern League title. The following year, on 27 April 1901, Spurs won the FA Cup after beating Sheffield United 3–1 in a replay of the 1901 Cup final, and became the only non-League club to have ever achieved such a feat since the formation of The Football League in 1888.|$|E

25|$|In June 2008, Vueling and rival Spanish {{low cost}} airline Clickair {{announced}} {{their intention to}} merge. The merger was designed to create a carrier better able {{to compete in the}} competitive Spanish airline market and mitigate high fuel costs with Iberia as the main industrial partner. While the new company would trade under the Vueling name, Clickair's Alex Cruz was named as chief executive. The deal was subject to scrutiny and approval by European competition regulators, who were concerned that the merged airline <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> competitive advantage on around 19 routes. The regulators demanded the release of slots at Barcelona and other European airports as a condition of the merger. On 15 July 2009 the merger of Vueling and Clickair was completed. The new merged airline operates under the Vueling brand, with Clickair flights and aircraft re-branded under the Vueling name. It became the second largest Spanish carrier flying 8.2 million passengers in 2009, to almost 50 destinations.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{his return}} to the U.S., Lt. Colonel Ascani was {{transferred}} to the Flight Test Division at Wright Field where he was assigned chief of the bomber test section. He attended the Flight Performance School (now the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School) and graduated with class 46. In January 1946, Ascani met his new boss, Colonel Al Boyd, who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> impact on both USAF flight test and Ascani's career. Boyd and Ascani worked well together, and Ascani became Boyd’s deputy both at Wright Field and later at Edwards Air Force Base. One notable decision made by Boyd and Ascani was the pilot choice for who would first break the sound barrier. Although Ascani had initially recommended Major Ken Chilstrom, they eventually agreed that Chuck Yeager would pilot the Bell X-1, and Chilstrom would fly the performance, stability and control tests in the new XP-86. During his tour at Edwards AFB, Ascani flew a wide variety of research aircraft including the X-1, X-4, X-5, and the XF-92A. A highlight of his flying career occurred in 1951 when he flew an F-86E at the National Air Show in Detroit, Michigan, and established a new 100-kilometer closed course speed record of 635mph. In September 1951, Colonel Ascani was named vice commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB.|$|E
25|$|On revaluation, the {{multiplier}} is adjusted so {{that the}} overall increase in liability across {{the country is in}} line with the Retail Prices Index, a measure of inflation. A property whose rateable value changes exactly in line with the national average would see an inflation-only rise in liability. Conversely, properties with unusually large changes in rateable value <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> change in liability. To smooth these jumps in liability, schemes of transitional relief have been applied to each rating list. These operate by restricting the proportion by which liability may change per year, both upwards and downwards. The 1990 and 1995 transitional relief schemes required funding from the Treasury, while the 2000 list scheme was designed to be revenue-neutral over the lifetime of the list, albeit with Treasury funding at the beginning. The Local Government Act 2003 required that all revaluations in England feature a revenue-neutral scheme, beginning with the 2005 rating list. Transitional relief applies only to changes in liability between rating lists, not changes within lists. For example, under the 2005 transitional relief scheme in England, if a rateable value had risen by 20%, the rise in liability would be restricted to 12.5% in the first year, 17.5% in the second year, and the full 20% in the third year (different restrictions would apply for a small business). Transitional relief schemes have been applied to the 1990, 1995, and 2000 rating lists in England and Wales, and to the 2005 rating list in England.|$|E
