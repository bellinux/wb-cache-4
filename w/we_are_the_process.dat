40|$|This {{article is}} for Edward Casey. I {{write in the}} terms of my own {{philosophy}} about place and space as well as many other topics. I contrast two ways of thinking. We need both, and I will show exactly how we can use both. One way of thinking is narrow; the other much wider. Each is a way of thinking about what really exists, but the wider way can explain the narrow one, and can show how the narrow one is derived. I will derive it. The narrow way assumes that everything exists in the space that has things in it. That space seems to be the reality in front of us and all around us. According to the narrow way, only what is in that space really exists. The wider way begins from the activity <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> <b>the</b> <b>process,</b> the happening, not just things that are before and behind us...|$|E
