40|$|Population growth, {{economic}} development and higher standards of living lead to increased production of waste, but efficient waste management is becoming a major challenge faced by local communities in developing countries. The application of Geographic Information System (GIS) and mixed integer linear programming in planning of municipal waste management system {{is the subject of}} the work. The observed waste management system is based on the construction of <b>waste</b> <b>transfer</b> stations- facilities for temporary storage, preparation and reloading of waste for transport to a landfill. Problem of determining the optimal number and locations of <b>waste</b> <b>transfer</b> stations can be solved using two-stage methodology: Phase 1 - selection of suitable area and Phase 2 - determination of optimal number and micro-locations of <b>waste</b> <b>transfer</b> stations. This paper discusses Phase 1 and includes the development, adaptation and application of GIS in order to determine area suitable for the location of <b>waste</b> <b>transfer</b> stations from spatial, environmental and social point of view. The problem is solved by using MapInfo Professional 11. 0, cartographic software for visualization and analysis of the relationship between data and geographic space.

The gas release behavior of the waste in existing double-shell tanks has been well characterized, and the flammable gas safety issues associated with safe storage of waste in the current configuration are being formally resolved. However, waste is also being transferred between double-shell tanks and from single-shell tanks into double-shell tanks by saltwell pumping and sluicing that create new wastes and waste configurations {{that have not been}} studied as well. Additionally, planning is underway for various <b>waste</b> <b>transfer</b> scenarios to support waste feed delivery to the proposed vitrification plant.

40|$|This project, {{which began}} in FY 97, {{involves}} both the flow loop research on plugging and unplugging of <b>waste</b> <b>transfer</b> pipelines, and the large-scale industrial equipment test of plugging locating and unplugging technologies. In FY 98, the related work was performed under the project name ''Mixing, Settling, and Pipe Unplugging of <b>Waste</b> <b>Transfer</b> Lines. '' The mixing, settling, and pipeline plugging and unplugging are critical to the design and maintenance of a <b>waste</b> <b>transfer</b> pipeline system, especially for the High-Level <b>Waste</b> (HLW) pipeline <b>transfer.</b> The major objective of this work is to recreate pipeline plugging conditions for equipment testing of plug locating and removal and to provide systematic operating data for modification of equipment design and enhancement of performance of <b>waste</b> <b>transfer</b> lines used at DOE sites. As the waste tank clean-out and decommissioning program becomes active at the DOE sites, there is an increasing potential that the <b>waste</b> slurry <b>transfer</b> lines will become plugged and unable to transport waste slurry from one tank to another or from the mixing tank to processing facilities. Transfer systems may potentially become plugged if the solids concentration of the material being transferred increases beyond the capability of the prime mover or if upstream mixing is inadequately performed. Plugging can occur due to the solids' settling in either the mixing tank, the pumping system, or the transfer lines. In order to enhance and optimize the slurry's removal and transfer, refined and reliable data on the mixing, sampling, and pipe unplugging systems must be obtained based on both laboratory-scale and simulated in-situ operating conditions...|$|R

The purpose of the control decision meetings was to review and revise previously selected controls for the prevention or mitigation of <b>waste</b> <b>transfer</b> leak accidents. Re-evaluation of the controls is warranted due to revisions in the hazard and accident analysis for these Tank Farm events. In particular, calculated radiological consequences are significantly reduced from those currently reported in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR).
