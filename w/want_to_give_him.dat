500|$|Despite this, Thomas Leuluai {{replaced}} Tomkins for the team's next {{match against}} Warrington, meaning Tomkins {{would have to}} wait for his Super League debut. He played {{out the rest of the}} 2008 season in the reserves, some of his highlights including a hat-trick against Castleford and another five-try performance against [...] After scoring four tries against Hull's reserves, Tomkins was tipped to make at least ten Super League appearances in 2009 season by Shaun Wane, Wigan's reserve coach. He also received an endorsement from Ian Lenagan, the club's chairman, when he said, [...] "I think Sam is going to be a world-class half-back and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> his chance." [...] Tomkins was named Reserve Team Player of the Year at the Wigan inaugural awards evening.|$|E
500|$|Robben was {{selected}} by new manager Bert van Marwijk for the final 23-man Dutch squad for the 2010 World Cup. In the team's last friendly match against Hungary, just before its flight to South Africa on 4 June, Robben fell awkwardly {{and picked up a}} hamstring injury, causing concern over his fitness for the tournament. On 5 June, Van Marwijk announced that he had [...] "decided not to summon any substitute for Arjen. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> every chance to still participate in the World Cup". On 12 June, Robben arrived in South Africa to join the team. He was an unused substitute for the opening match against Denmark as they coasted to a 2–0 victory, and again in the 1–0 victory against Japan. He came on in the 73rd minute against Cameroon in their 2–1 victory, hitting the post from which Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored from the rebound.|$|E
2500|$|Samori's {{army was}} well {{equipped}} with European firearms and a complex structure of permanent units. [...] His army {{was divided into}} an infantry wing of sofa (Mandinka for infantry, usually slaves) and a cavalry wing. By 1887, Samori could field 30,000 to 35,000 infantry and about 3,000 cavalry, in regular squadrons of 50 each. But, the French did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> time to consolidate his position. Exploiting the rebellions of several of Ture's subject tribes, who were animist and resisted Islam, the French continued to expand into his westernmost holdings. They forced Ture to sign several treaties ceding territory to them between 1886 and 1889.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The News-Gazette, Allison said his mom <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> his first name because she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> “a unique name.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It ain't {{going to}} rain," [...] Morris replied. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a sharp reply, but {{concluded}} {{not to do}} so. This was evidently the husband. His romance was very short.|$|R
50|$|Although PSV <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{a chance}} in the reserve squad, Waalkens signed a two-year deal (with option) with Willem II. August 9, 2009 he made his {{professional}} debut in the awaymatch against FC Utrecht (1-0 loss).|$|R
2500|$|In November, Gillan {{revealed}} that the film was undergoing reshoots. That February, {{it was reported that}} the film had scored a perfect 100 in test screenings, the highest for any Marvel Studios film. The Hollywood Reporter noted this score could not necessarily be compared to any non-Marvel movies due to Marvel's specific testing process that selects its audience [...] "from a more select pool of recruits, what it terms 'friends and families screenings'". In March 2017, Gunn {{revealed that}} Michael Rosenbaum would appear in the film, and that Gunn would provide reference for Baby Groot's dancing [...] "in a much bigger way [...] I actually had to do like a full day's worth of dancing to get Groot's dance down this time. Last time it was me in front of an iPhone, and this time it's me dancing on a huge soundstage and shooting it from five different angles." [...] Fred Raskin and Craig Wood returned from the first film to serve as editors. On scenes that were cut from the film, Gunn said Nathan Fillion, who had had a voice cameo in the first film, was going to appear as Simon Williams in a sequence that would have shown several movie posters for films starring Williams, including films in which he portrays Arkon and Tony Stark. Gunn chose Williams for Fillion's cameo because he wanted Fillion to have a bigger role in the MCU at some point and so didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a role that could prevent him from taking a more substantial one later. Gunn still considered Fillion's cameo canon to the MCU, despite it being cut. He also confirmed that Close's scenes had been cut from the film, because it felt like he [...] "was trying to cram Nova Prime into the second movie as opposed to having it happen organically." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give {{him a good}} hot bath, {{and mind}} and dry him well. He'll have a good sleep then, and won't have any pain. Then, first thing to-morrow, you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{salicylate}} of soda." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a good thrashing--that's what I want to do!" [...] exclaimed Jack. [...] "And {{after that}} I might turn {{him over to}} the police, if there is any such thing in this town." ...|$|E
50|$|Yaozong meets {{a mysterious}} {{old woman who}} sells tissue paper. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> 3 wishes for him to fulfil what his heart desires. He does not believe her. Nevertheless, she leaves him with 3 coins for his wishes.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'd nearly {{forgotten}} what we came about!" [...] Sylvie interrupted. [...] "Would you please let us through into the road? There's a poor old beggar just gone out--and he's very hungry--and Bruno <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> his cake, you know!" ...|$|R
50|$|Wenceslaus II {{quickly became}} known by his {{forceful}} politics, standing invariably {{at the side}} of the Roman Papacy; at a reward for his loyalty in 1385, Pope Urban VI <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> the title of Cardinal. For unknown reasons, the Duke-Bishop refused.|$|R
6000|$|... "A friend o’ mine," [...] said Captain Walsh, favouring {{him with}} a hideous wink, [...] "a great friend o’ mine, {{is going to be}} married, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a wedding present before I go. I sail to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{more than}} his fare. So I shall slip my {{cigar-case}} {{into the pocket of}} this coat," [...] whispered Uncle Ben, as Joel was busy drawing up the boat and getting a stone or two to facilitate the ladies' landing dryshod.|$|E
6000|$|... "He knows right enough, he does. Came {{down here}} {{yesterday}} afternoon with a friend. Seemed, from what I could hear, to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{something to eat}} out of that room. I put him down as dotty, but my! you should have heard him {{when he found out}} that the stuff had been lifted!" ...|$|E
50|$|Another similar Roman {{story in}} which Valerius writes about {{compassion}} is where the Senate sent a quaestor to Alba (in Latium) in 167 BCE. There King Perseus of Macedonia was banished to and had just died there. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> honor and provided a state funeral for the king.|$|R
50|$|Azevedo {{spent the}} next four years {{fighting}} in Argentina and fought a total of 38 times. During this time he had a shocking 15 draws. His manager attributed the draws to Azevedo being a Brazilian in Argentina and the officials not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> the wins, while giving Argentine fighters losses.|$|R
50|$|At work, Michael {{plans on}} leaving early {{to seek out}} Jenna. On his way out, Kim visits his office unannounced, <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a mix CD.

6000|$|... "Dominique had to {{go round}} with me. The captain evidently did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a chance of {{speaking}} to anyone. The mate {{and two of the}} sailors posted themselves at the gangway, so that the two blacks should not {{be able to talk to}} the niggers on board. And now, sir, what is to be done next?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means. Still, I {{want to see}} him {{a little}} further. He's not in the least the case I supposed, he's quite another case. And it's as such that he {{interests}} me." [...] It was almost as if for his own intelligence that, deliberate and lucid, our friend thus expressed the matter. [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{went down}} the river to fetch him. The guvnor didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a special {{at this time of}} night, but he just handed him a note, and we made things hum up here. He was on his way in half an hour. We have had to upset the whole of the night traffic to let him through without a stop." ...|$|E
5000|$|On the Eastern Front, nineteen-year-old soldier Pvt. Alyosha Skvortsov (Vladimir Ivashov) single-handedly destroys two attacking German tanks, {{more out}} of self-preservation than bravery. His {{commanding}} general <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a decoration, but Alyosha asks instead for a leave to see his mother and to repair the leaking roof of their home. He is given six days.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{think of}} 'em some day--when you get thin," [...] {{returned}} Andy, encouragingly. [...] "You see, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a bouquet <b>to</b> remember me by;" [...] {{and at this}} remark {{there was a general}} snicker. Two or three of the passengers in the car had noticed Andy's action and all were smiling broadly over the incident.|$|R
60|$|Jill {{kissed him}} and moved away. She busied herself with some flowers, her back turned. The tension had been relieved, and she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> time <b>to</b> recover his poise. She knew him {{well enough to}} be sure that, sooner or later, the {{resiliency}} of his nature would assert itself. He could never remain long in the depths.|$|R
6000|$|... "To begin with, I'm by {{no means}} certain that I'll have to pay it. There's good stuff in him, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> an {{opportunity}} for becoming a useful citizen. In the next place, the line must be drawn somewhere, and the crop I'm putting in wouldn't stand {{the cost of a}} spring in Toronto, if it's to be anything like the winter in Montreal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you've ruther got {{the bulge}} on me. Or maybe we've both got the bulge, somehow. You don't smoke me and I don't smoke you. You see, {{one of the}} boys has passed in his checks and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a good send-off, and so the thing I'm on now is to roust out {{somebody}} to jerk a little chin-music for us and waltz him through handsome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We’ll {{be married}} in New Zealand," [...] he said, softly, [...] "and then we’ll {{come back and}} I’ll have my own again. Jack {{told me you were}} going out on her. Another man has got my craft; he lost the one he had before, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a chance for a few months, poor chap, to redeem his character. Besides, it’ll be a change. We shall see the world. It’ll just be a splendid honeymoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean to {{say nothing}} about myself. My {{dropping}} you or not dropping you won't alter your lot in life. I know very well what a poor man <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a start; and a fellow like you who has such quaint ideas on so many things requires all the assistance he can get. You should look out for money and connection." ...|$|R
6000|$|That evening I {{came down}} to dinner a monster of pride, for behold! I was a man. I felt myself the most {{wonderful}} and unprecedented of adventurers. It {{was hard to believe}} that any one in the world before had done as much. My mistress and I met smiling, we carried things off admirably, {{and it seemed to me}} that Willersley was the dullest old dog in the world. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> advice. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> derisive pokes. After dinner and coffee in the lounge I was too excited and hilarious to go to bed, I made him come with me down to the cafe under the arches by the pier, and there drank beer and talked extravagant nonsense about everything under the sun, in order not to talk about the happenings of the afternoon. All the time something shouted within me: [...] "I am a man! I am a man!"...|$|R
50|$|Eventually, Lassiter's wife {{asks him}} to dinner, {{something}} he thinks {{points to a}} reconciliation for them, but in truth she simply <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> divorce papers.

She tells him she will never stop loving him, even though they are divorced.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Mr. Tulliver, {{not looking}} at Mrs. Glegg, but at the male part of his audience, [...] "you see, I've {{made up my mind}} not to bring Tom up to my own business. I've had my {{thoughts}} about it all along, and I made up my mind by what I saw with Garnett and his son. I mean to put him to some business as he can go into without capital, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> an eddication as he'll be even wi' the lawyers and folks, and put me up to a notion now an' then." ...|$|E
6000|$|Such a weary search! But {{now some}} inexplicable {{instinct}} seemed {{to lead the}} anxious mother, for presently Dan uttered a cry, and caught up a little shining object lying in the path. It was {{the cover of the}} new tin pail, dropped in the first alarm of being lost. Mrs. Jo hugged and kissed {{it as if it were}} a living thing; and when Dan was about to utter a glad shout to bring the others to the spot, she stopped him, saying, as she hurried on, [...] "No, let me find them; I let Rob go, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> back to his father all myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now that I {{have found}} Uncle Lester, I don't {{want to leave}} him," [...] said Phil to Dave and Roger, as he drew his two {{particular}} chums to one side, out of hearing of the others. [...] "Uncle Lester may be all right in his mind--in fact I hope he is--but at the same time, he has acted so queerly that I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> any chance {{to get away from}} me.

50|$|In 1999, when A-Lin was 16 {{years old}} and taught {{children}} to sing the hymn “Amazing Grace” after the 921 earthquake in Nantou County, she was discovered by her former agency.
