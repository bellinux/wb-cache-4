5|$|The {{landline}} telephones in most residential {{homes are}} analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage. Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side <b>with</b> <b>data</b> from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).|$|E
5|$|The {{separation}} of static and dynamic data to reduce write amplification {{is not a}} simple process for the SSD controller. The process requires the SSD controller to separate the LBAs <b>with</b> <b>data</b> which is constantly changing and requiring rewriting (dynamic data) from the LBAs <b>with</b> <b>data</b> which rarely changes and does not require any rewrites (static data). If the data is mixed in the same blocks, as with almost all systems today, any rewrites will require the SSD controller to garbage collect both the dynamic data (which caused the rewrite initially) and static data (which did not require any rewrite). Any garbage collection of data that would not have otherwise required moving will increase write amplification. Therefore, separating the data will enable static data to stay at rest and if it never gets rewritten it will have the lowest possible write amplification for that data. The drawback to this process is that somehow the SSD controller must still find a way to wear level the static data because those blocks that never change will not get a chance to be written to their maximum P/E cycles.|$|E
30|$|The {{formulas}} of {{cost and}} allocative efficiencies {{of decision making}} units (DMUs) <b>with</b> positive <b>data</b> cannot be used for DMUs <b>with</b> negative <b>data.</b> On the other hand, these formulas are needed to analyze the productivity and performance of DMUs <b>with</b> negative <b>data.</b> To this end, this study introduces the cost and allocative efficiencies of DMUs <b>with</b> negative <b>data</b> and demonstrates that the introduced cost efficiency {{is equal to the}} product of allocative and range directional measure efficiencies. The study then intends to extend the definition of the above efficiencies to DMUs <b>with</b> negative <b>data</b> and different unit costs. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the proposed methods.|$|R

5|$|In England, the {{scientist}} Francis Galton {{heard of this}} work, {{as well as the}} pioneering weather forecasts of Robert Fitzroy. After gathering information from weather stations across the country for the month of October 1861, he plotted the data on a map using his own system of symbols, thereby creating the world's first weather map. He used his map to prove that air circulated clockwise around areas of high pressure; he coined the term 'anticyclone' to describe the phenomenon. He was also instrumental in publishing the first weather map in a newspaper, for which he modified the pantograph (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the map onto printing blocks. The Times began printing weather maps using these methods <b>with</b> <b>data</b> from the Meteorological Office.|$|E

5|$|Ka is the {{dissociation}} constant of a substituted compound, K is the {{dissociation constant}} when the substituent is hydrogen, ρ is a {{property of the}} unsubstituted compound and σ has a particular value for each substituent. A plot of log(Ka) against σ is a straight line with intercept log(K) and slope ρ.

Hammett originally formulated the relationship <b>with</b> <b>data</b> from benzoic acid with different substiuents in the ortho- and para- positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation. This and other studies allowed substituents to be ordered according to their electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing power, and to distinguish between inductive and mesomeric effects.|$|E

5|$|When an SSD {{is writing}} {{large amounts of}} data sequentially, the write {{amplification}} is equal to one meaning there is no write amplification. The reason is as the data is written, the entire block is filled sequentially <b>with</b> <b>data</b> related to the same file. If the OS determines that file is to be replaced or deleted, the entire block can be marked as invalid, {{and there is no}} need to read parts of it to garbage collect and rewrite into another block. It will need only to be erased, which is much easier and faster than the read-erase-modify-write process needed for randomly written data going through garbage collection.|$|E
