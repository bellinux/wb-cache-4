And in doing so, <b>we</b> <b>grow</b> in our respect for others whose differences we recognise and value. <b>We</b> <b>grow</b> in our understanding of subject matter, and <b>we</b> <b>grow</b> in our ability to demonstrate appropriate responses to the world around us. <b>We</b> <b>grow</b> as learners within our family, our school, our preparation for entering the world of work, and <b>we</b> <b>grow</b> in our ability to be contributing citizens within our community, nation and the world.

500|$|Kajol {{began dating}} fellow actor, Ajay Devgan, in 1994, while filming for Gundaraj. Members of the media, however, {{labelled}} {{them as an}} [...] "unlikely pair" [...] due to their contrasting personalities. Devgan explained their relationship by saying, [...] "We never resorted to the usual 'I Love you' routine. A proposal never happened. <b>We</b> <b>grew</b> with each other. Marriage was never discussed, {{but it was always}} imminent". They subsequently got married on 24 February 1999 in a traditional Maharashtrian style ceremony at the Devgan house. The wedding was subject to wide media scrutiny, as certain members of the media criticised Kajol's decision to settle down at the [...] "peak of her career". Kajol, however, maintained that she would not quit films, but would cut down on the amount of work that she did.|$|E
500|$|Cooper {{said the}} band members relied [...] "on each other instead of forcing each other to play something". Guitarist Eddie Reyes insisted on playing his own part, {{as opposed to a}} chord progression, on several occasions. Cooper said [...] "So instead of trying to force him to play one thing, he’ll go and do his own thing that’s way more cool and unique that any of us could imagine." [...] Lazzara {{mentioned}} there was [...] "an urgency and an energy and an excitement" [...] embedded into the material, which [...] "you can't create or fake". Nolan stated that Straylight Run helped Cooper and himself as musicians: [...] "We learned, <b>we</b> <b>grew</b> and were much more mature coming back to TBS." [...] Cooper mentioned that {{towards the end of the}} writing process the group's [...] "creative juices ... were just so depleted".|$|E
500|$|According to Roth, [...] "My friend Jeff, {{who plays}} the killer pilgrim – <b>we</b> <b>grew</b> up in Massachusetts, we were huge slasher movie fans and every November {{we were waiting for}} the Thanksgiving slasher movie.

I called Jeff and said, 'Dude, guess what, we don't have to make the movie, we can just shoot the best parts.'" [...] "Shooting the trailer was so much fun," [...] Roth has stated, [...] "because every shot is a money shot. Every shot is decapitation or nudity. It's so ridiculous, it's absurd.

500|$|Reactions {{to the red}} culture {{movement}} were divided. Bo’s {{revival of}} Mao-era culture and accompanying social welfare programs were popular within certain segments of society, and made Bo popular with both Marxists and neo-leftists. One student quoted in The Washington Post embraced the ethos of the campaign, saying, [...] "When I sing red songs, I find a kind of spirit I never felt when singing modern songs…To surround yourself with material stuff is just a waste of time." [...] A group of retired participants in a red song routine told the Los Angeles Times [...] "We know these songs from our youth. <b>We</b> <b>grew</b> up with revolutionary spirit {{and we want to}} pass that on to our children.” Another noted that he felt compelled to participate in order to express appreciation to the Communist Party for the country’s strong economy.|$|E
500|$|The {{content of}} Illmatic is also {{informed}} by notions of artistic authenticity. The promotional press sheet {{that accompanied the}} album's release implied Nas’s refusal to conform to commercial trends, stating: “While it's sad that there's so much frontin' in the rap world today, this should only make us sit up and pay attention when a rapper comes along who's not about milking the latest trend and running off with the loot.” At {{the time of the}} album's release, the hip hop community was embroiled in a debate about artistic authenticity and commercialism in popular music. Rapper Common, describes in the preface to Born to Use Mics: Reading Nas's Illmatic the concerns that were felt by him and his contemporaries: “It was that serious for so many of us. We didn’t just grow up with hip hop; <b>we</b> <b>grew</b> up with hip-hop as hip-hop was also growing, and so that made for a very close and intimate relationship that was becoming more and more urgent – and we felt it. Our art was being challenged in many ways as the moneymen began to sink their teeth into us.” ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where <b>we</b> <b>grew</b> up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E

500|$|Preparation was extensive: first Grohl had {{his usual}} start-off by {{developing}} demos with drummer Taylor Hawkins, {{but for the}} first time Grohl tried to input vocals and lyrics in this early composition stage. After rounding up composition with guitarist Chris Shiflett and bassist Nate Mendel, Grohl spent two weeks with Norton discussing [...] "arrangements, harmony and melody" [...] and reducing the song ideas, and then the band spent four weeks rehearsing, playing [...] "a song a day, from noon to midnight". Hawkins stated that [...] "we basically played each of these songs 100 different times, trying every little thing every different way" [...] and that it was the first time since The Colour and the Shape [...] "that Dave had to deal with someone in the room questioning all his ideas", given the more laid-back approach of previous producer Nick Raskulinecz. Grohl claimed the choices were for the [...] "most powerful, dramatic songs", and that there was an effort to [...] "make everything sound as natural as possible – just like on the albums <b>we</b> <b>grew</b> up listening to", citing 1970s artists such as Neil Young and Wings as a major influence. Shiflett added that for the first time he played lead guitar in some tracks while Grohl [...] "usually works out all the bits" [...] of composition.|$|E
500|$|... "Secrets That I Never Want to Know" [...] {{received}} mixed critical reviews. TV Guide Kate Stanhope gave a mixed {{review of}} the episode, opining that [...] "the episode moved a little slow for what was the last season premiere." [...] She praised the sequence in which Bree and Gabrielle attempt {{to get rid of}} Alejandro's car, writing, [...] "I always love the Bree-Gaby scenes because they contradict each other in such an interesting way." [...] She enjoyed that the Bree character was [...] "turning back into the controlling perfectionist <b>we</b> <b>grew</b> to love rather than the carefree woman she became" [...] in the seventh season. Stanhope was critical of the Lynette and Tom storyline, opining: [...] "it's annoying that their relationship has been reduced to this gimmick... I was never on board with the whole Tom and Lynette split simply because it felt less honest and more of a last-ditch effort to cause conflict. But if they're going to go through with separating the formerly stable couple, at least go through with it all the way and show Lynette really and truly on her own." [...] She also believed the Renee storyline to be a waste of Vanessa Williams's talents. Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly called the episode's overall storyline [...] "too juicy a landmine to not have the repercussions play out deliciously on this, the show’s last season." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Ice-T's {{gangsta rap}} albums, Body Counts {{material}} focused on various {{social and political}} issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing about the way <b>we</b> <b>grew</b> up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be}} a protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.|$|E

500|$|Powderfinger's Vulture Street was {{released}} on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No.1 in Australia; while in New Zealand it reached No.17. Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for {{the location of the}} band's first recording room in West End, Brisbane. The Sydney Morning Heralds music critic Bernard Zuel approved of [...] "a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album" [...] with [...] "a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect"; he felt it had Haug and Middleton [...] "dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut" [...] album. Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having [...] "opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs". Middleton described the band's aim was to [...] "get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things <b>we</b> <b>grew</b> up loving, which was Bowie, Zeppelin, Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s. We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record. It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape, of course. It's fairly organic in that sense". Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards in 2003: [...] "Album of the Year", [...] "Best Group", [...] "Best Rock Album" [...] and [...] "Best Cover Art" [...] (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are: [...] "(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind", [...] "Since You've Been Gone", [...] "Love Your Way", and [...] "Sunsets". Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004.|$|E
500|$|Kekal has {{acknowledged}} in interviews that the band members, {{at the time}} interviewed, subscribed to Christianity, and {{has been described as}} one of the first black metal bands to profess Christian beliefs. Known to have fans from different religious backgrounds, and with the majority of their listeners being non-Christians, the band has stated on its Facebook page that as an institution it is not a Christian metal band and does not endorse any particular religion or ideology, and has always maintained that it is about music, life, and universality, and stands against any form of elitism and exclusivism in today's culture. Although Christianity has comprised a part of the band's lyrics, the band has said that from The Painful Experience (3rd album) onward its lyrics have not been associated with religion or ideology at all. Mark Allan Powell commented on this in Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, stating that [...] "on the band's first two albums the songs testified to their Christian faith in an upfront way", but that on their third album, the band pulled back from an overt approach that [...] "Jeff says tended to turn people against the band before they gave the music a chance." [...] According to Powell, [...] "they maintain that three-fourths of their albums are purchased by non-Christians." [...] In an interview with HM Magazine, Jeff Arwadi clarified his view on Christian metal: [...] "I don't want to divide our fans and market as religious - secular dichotomy. We always see everything as one. When we started the band, we knew nothing about the Christian metal scene, and we started just like a normal band in our underground scene. <b>We</b> <b>grew</b> up in the normal underground metal scene, and have already got attention from that scene since the very beginning. Kekal never belong to any church or some kind of ministry and never will. We are 100% just like any band you would call them as secular band. But then we knew we were also accepted within the Christian metal scene as well, that's cool to know, although I think it still less than 50% of our general fan base." ...|$|E
