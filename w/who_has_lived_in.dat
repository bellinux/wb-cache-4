25|$|The {{census of}} 1970 came one year {{early in the}} decennial system of census taking. Difficulty was {{expressed}} in determining who was a permanent resident in Gibraltar and who was not. For example, wives and families of servicemen were considered temporary residents, and because a person <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Gibraltar for many years may have considered themselves a permanent resident even though in law, they could be asked to leave on a moment's notice.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, the Gender Recognition Act 2004 {{allows a}} person <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> their chosen gender {{for at least}} two years to receive a gender {{recognition}} certificate officially recognizing their new gender. Because in the United Kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate, and the same was formerly true for marriages in England and Wales, and still is in other territories. Such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. In Austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Since her Pulitzer Prize with Breathing Lessons, Tyler {{has written}} eight more novels, {{all of which}} have {{received}} favorable reviews; many have been Book of the Month Club Main Selections and have become New York Times Bestsellers.

[...] Saint Maybe (1991) and Back When We Were Grownups (2001) were adapted into TV movies in 1998 and 2004, respectively.

2500|$|Many of the {{residents}} of Key West were immigrants from the Bahamas, known as Conchs (pronounced [...] "conks"'), who arrived in increasing numbers after 1830. Many were sons and daughters of Loyalists who fled to the nearest Crown soil during the American Revolution. [...] In the 20th century many residents of Key West started referring to themselves as Conchs, and the term is now generally applied to all residents of Key West. [...] Some residents use the term [...] "Conch" [...] (or, alternatively, [...] "Saltwater Conch") to refer to a person born in Key West, while the term [...] "Freshwater Conch" [...] refers to a resident not born in Key West but <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Key West for seven years or more. However, the true original meaning of Conch applies only to someone with European ancestry who immigrated from the Bahamas. It is said that when a baby was born, the family would put a conch shell on a pole in front of their home.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the process}} of {{creating}} Out of Here, Wodiczko opted to expand the dictionary definition of veteran. Traditionally, the term is described as “a person who has served in a military force.” [...] Wodiczko has redefined veteran to include anyone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> an area where war was fought at the time they lived there, for example, residents of Iraq from 2003-2011, or residents of Germany, England, France, etc. during World War II. The Iraqi-born civilians (veterans, by the artist’s definition) who contributed to Out of Here, including the woman who lent her voice to the audio track, offered a perspective altogether {{different from those of the}} American military who had been in Iraq. This careful manipulation of the term foreshadows the artist’s choice to insert his own thoughts in Out of Here, in addition to culling the testimonies of soldiers and Iraqis. Having lived through World War II in Poland and served in the Polish military during the cold war, Wodiczko is not merely working with veterans; he is one. The artist fulfills both old and new definitions of the word veteran.|$|E

2500|$|The Field Guide, {{the first}} book in the series, was {{published}} in May 2003. It opens in Maine, where nine-year-old identical twins Jared and Simon and their thirteen-year-old sister Mallory move into the decrepit Spiderwick Estate with their mother, Helen. On the first night, they discover a secret library {{on the second floor}} using a dumbwaiter. They later discover that the library connects {{to the rest of the}} house via a hidden door in a hall closet. [...] A brownie named Thimbletack, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the house for years, becomes angry with the Grace children when they destroy his nest inside the walls, and Jared is blamed for the ensuing havoc wrought by the brownie in retaliation including assaults on Mallory, Simon, and the trashing of the kitchen. Following a clue in the form of a riddle-poem, Jared finds Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You in a secret compartment in a trunk in the attic. The Field Guide is an old hand-written and illustrated book with information on different types of faeries. The novel ends as the Grace children make amends with Thimbletack by building him a new home out of an old birdhouse. Thimbletack then warns them that the book which they found is dangerous and was not meant to be in the hands of mortals.|$|E
