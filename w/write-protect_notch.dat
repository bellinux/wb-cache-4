5000|$|An MFM-based, [...] "high-density" [...] format, {{displayed}} as [...] "HD" [...] on {{the disks}} themselves and typically advertised as [...] "1.44 MB" [...] {{was introduced in}} 1987; the most common formatted capacity was 1,474,560 bytes. These HD disks had an extra hole in the case {{on the opposite side}} of the <b>write-protect</b> <b>notch.</b> IBM used this format on their PS/2 series introduced in 1987. Apple started using [...] "HD" [...] in 1988, on the Macintosh IIx, and the HD floppy drive soon became universal on virtually all Macintosh and PC hardware. Apple's FDHD (Floppy Disk High Density) drive was capable of reading and writing both GCR and MFM formatted disks, and thus made it relatively easy to exchange files with PC users. Apple later marketed this drive as the SuperDrive. Interestingly, Apple began using the SuperDrive brand name again in 2001 to denote their all-formats CD/DVD reader/writer. Amiga included [...] "HD" [...] floppy drives relatively late, with releasing of Amiga 4000 in 1992, and was able to store 1760 KB on it, with ability in software to read/write PC's 1440 KB/720 KB formats.|$|E
5000|$|The Apple Disk II stored 140 kB on single-sided, [...] "single-density" [...] floppy disks, but it {{was very}} common for Apple II users to extend the {{capacity}} of a single-sided floppy disk to 280 kB by cutting out a second <b>write-protect</b> <b>notch</b> {{on the side of the}} disk using a [...] "disk notcher" [...] or hole puncher and inserting the disk flipped over. Double-sided disks, with notches on both sides, were available at a higher price, but in practice the magnetic coating on the reverse of nominally single-sided disks was usually of good enough quality to be used (both sides were coated in the same way to prevent warping, although only one side was certified for use). Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for no extra cost, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.|$|E
50|$|Also, the tabs {{covering}} the <b>write-protect</b> <b>notches</b> of Loran cassettes were built-in plastic mechanisms that would open or close the notch {{by turning the}} mechanism with a small flat-blade screwdriver or a fingernail, {{as opposed to the}} write-protect tabs of other cassettes which were broken out instead, as the hardness of the Lexan would've made this very difficult for the average user to accomplish.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Notches on the {{top surface}} of the Compact Cassette {{indicate}} its type. The rear-most cassette {{at the top of}} this picture, with only <b>write-protect</b> <b>notches</b> (here covered by write-protect tabs), is Type I, its tape consisting of iron oxide. The next cassette down, with additional notches adjacent to the write-protect tabs, is Type II, its tape consisting of chrome and cobalt. The bottom two cassettes, featuring the Type II notches plus an additional pair in the middle of the cassette, are Type IV (metal); note the removal of the tabs on the second of these, meaning the tape is write-protected.|$|R
25|$|Notches {{on top of}} the {{cassette}} shell indicate the type of tape. Type I cassettes have only <b>write-protect</b> <b>notches,</b> Type II have an additional pair next to the write protection ones, and Type IV (metal) have a third set near the middle of the top of {{the cassette}} shell. These allow later cassette decks to detect the tape type automatically and select the proper bias and equalization. Virtually all recent hi-fi systems (with cassette decks) lack this feature; only a small niche of cassette decks (hi-fi separates) have the tape type selector. Playing Type II and IV tapes on a player without detection will produce exaggerated treble, {{but it may not be}} noticeable because such devices typically have amplifiers that lack extended high-frequency output. Recording on these units, however, results in very low sound reproduction, and sometimes distortion and noise is heard. Also, these cheaper units cannot erase high bias or metal bias tapes. Attempting to do so will result in an incomplete erasure. This is due to the fact that the bias levels for high and metal position require greater levels.|$|R
5000|$|... 8 and 5¼ inch floppies can have, respectively, <b>write-protect</b> and write-enable <b>notches</b> on {{the right}} side (8″: punched = protected; 5¼″: covered/notch not present = protected). A common {{practice}} with single-sided floppies was to punch a second notch {{on the opposite side of}} the disk to enable use of both sides of the media, creating a flippy disk, so called because one originally had to flip the disk over to use the other side.|$|R
