5|$|Farleigh Hungerford Castle, {{sometimes}} called Farleigh Castle or Farley Castle, is a medieval castle in Farleigh Hungerford, Somerset, England.

A park was attached to the castle, requiring the destruction of a local village. His son, Sir Walter Hungerford, a successful knight and courtier to Henry V, became rich during the Hundred Years War with France and extended the castle with an additional, outer court, enclosing the parish church in the process. By Walter's death in 1449, the substantial castle was richly appointed and its chapel decorated with murals.|$|E
