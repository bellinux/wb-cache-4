The temperature dependencies of resistivity and thermopower have been measured. It {{was found that the}} S(T) dependencies take some additional features with Ca content increase. The results obtained have been analyzed {{on the basis of the}} phenomenological theory of electron transport in the case of the narrow conductive band. The main parameters of the band spectrum (the band filling with electrons degree and the total effective band width) have been determined. The dependencies of these from contents of substituting elements are discussed. Analyzing the results obtained simultaneously with the tendencies in oxygen content and critical temperature change we have confirmed the conclusion that the oxygen sublattice disordering has a determinant effect on band structure parameters and superconductive properties of YBa 2 Cu 3 O(y). The results obtained suggest that Ca gives rise to some peculiarities in band spectrum of this compound...|$|R

5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation <b>was</b> <b>less</b> likely to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males <b>was</b> <b>less</b> likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E
