[...] Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one and a half stars out of four, but praised Fey and Poehler's performances, saying [...] "though they look nothing like sisters, they’re believable as sisters.

The band played as a four-piece without Amiina and the brass band, the first time the band had played as a four-piece in seven years. The tour started on 17 September 2008 in the United States, at the United Palace Theater in New York City, and finished with a concert in Reykjavík at Laugardalshöll on 23 November 2008. The majority of the tour was European with the exception of concerts in the United States, Australia, Canada and Japan. The band then went on <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> with their manager saying it they were on an indefinite hiatus, although Jónsi commented saying [...] "We'd been touring for so many years and we'd gotten tired so <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> and the guys had babies." [...] Jónsi released an album titled Riceboy Sleeps in 2009 with his partner Alex Somers, and then released a solo album titled Go the next year.|$|R

In Häberlin´s diaries an entry can be found from September 16, 1934 in which he writes that Count Zeppelin was among other things his client in manners such as border disputes with the eminent psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger (1881-1966) who was running an exclusive psychiatric clinic nearby, the Sanatorium Bellevue. When Häberlin and the Count were discussing business matters in the lounge of the Count´s family estate Schloss Girsberg, it was not rare that they heard the propeller noise of Count Zeppelin’s airship passing by. In moments like these, Count Zeppelin’s attention was drawn away from matters at hand and Häberlin suggested, “Excellency, shall <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> until the airship has passed?”, upon which Count Zeppelin stood up, went to the window with a smile, saying, “Yes, you are right, Sir.” ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{effect of}} Global warming {{is growing at}} an {{alarming}} rate year by year and one of the major contributors to this is CO 2 emissions. In that, Diesel engine exhaust emission has a significant contribution. If <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> down it is found that CO 2 around constitutes 12 - 15 % of total exhaust emissions. One of the easiest and clean methods for reducing the CO 2 emissions is using carbon scrubber to capture the C 02. The project deals with capturing from the exhaust of Diesel generator Set. For this a carbon scrubber arrangement is used in which NaOH solution is taken as the scrubber. Along with carbon scrubbing one of the main advantages of this project is that the waste heat from flue gas is utilized to recover the NaOH which is lost. This is done {{with the help of a}} heat exchanger. This adds to the economy of the entire project in such a way that the NaOH lost during the scrubbing process is recovered in the regenerator by the heat exchanger and pumped back to the scrubber column...|$|E

[...] The deal was structured so that the release would be a joint venture between Wu-Tang Records and Aftermath Entertainment. After a period of time and reported delays in the recording process, the two parties eventually separated from the original agreement. The decision came after it was revealed that Dr. Dre had reportedly become creatively tied up with his personal Detox record. [...] Raekwon revealed in an interview that Cuban Linx Pt. II would not be released on Aftermath, stating [...] "Dr. Dre is a busy man and may not have the time to give the album his full attention." [...] An insider from Aftermath spoke on this matter, stating [...] "The Raekwon album came in done. It’s finished! It’s a finished record. Dre did two records.

At {{the beginning of the}} study, we encounter the spread of pneumonia in the Ljubljana zoo, where two younger chimpanzees and adult females lost their lives. The study included three female chimpanzees. After this tragic event <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> in our research to give the chimpanzees some time to recover. We began recording a month later. After six months of observation, we noticed some positive changes in their behaviour. We noticed that the number of abnormal behaviours significantly reduced in all three females. The interaction between the chimpanzees and visitors of the ZOO decreased. We also noticed a reduced interaction between female chimpanzees. Aggressive behaviour of the chimpanzees during our observations was not noticed. During the whole process of observation we noticed that each of the observed female chimpanzees had its own desired set of gaming aids. Mojca, the oldest of the observed female chimpanzees, was especially attracted to games with manipulative and unusual combinations of game play. Neža and Nika were more intrigued by games (usually a set of obstacles) which promised a food treat after getting {{to the end of the}} game (overcoming the obstacles). During the observation we noticed some unexpected defensive behaviour, which might be the result of the negative relationship of the chimpanzees towards the presumptuous visitors. During the winter time we haven’t noticed such defensive behaviours, because of the reduced amount of visitors...|$|R

Then <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> in front of the History Museum, parking the hotel van near the camp of the provincial students. The protesters around us didn’t seem to mind our presence, until we decided to crack out the beverages. It was hard to enjoy the hotel-bought drinks we had kept stored in an icebox in the back of the van while in the midst of so many under-nourished, homeless students from the countryside. The problem of eating well in front of people who had less access to food was a familiar one, something I had experienced on the set of The Last Emperor andEmpire of the Sun. We almost had a riot one day on the during a location shot on the Bund for the Spielberg film, as the cast and crew ate a hotel-catered lunch in the midst of 5000 hungry extras whose food had been duly paid for but never arrived, due to some sticky-fingered comprador or official intermediary. Thus it was with some reluctance that I extracted a can of iced cold soda from the icebox. Just then I noticed a young man in dusty clothes staring at me through thick black-rimmed glasses, eyeing the Coke I had in my hand. He had a wiry build and sported a flattop crew cut that made him look more a police cadet than student. But there was something extremely sympathetic about him too, he had a wide-eyed but vulnerable expression on his face, as if he wanted to talk but was afraid. I offered him a can of soda from the BBC icebox...|$|R

[...] Currie added [...] "We couldn't replace Joe. He's irreplaceable." [...] Bailey stated [...] "Joe's leaving didn`t change our sound at all. His leaving was entirely amicable. Alannah and I had become a very tight songwriting team, and at the risk of sounding immodest, we had become pretty good at it. So Joe was maybe feeling a little edged out. He wanted to do things on his own. Besides, he had fallen in love with someone in Los Angeles, and he wanted to be with her. So they got married and he bought a house and a dog and settled down.

While {{we are working on}} simple moves, coaches are looking for specific things. Where are the athlete’s eyes? Are their feet moving in the right direction? These things are considered our success criteria for each drill. Coaches use these to give athletes’ feedback {{in order for them to}} successfully complete the drill. By providing good feedback like, “keep your eyes up when dribbling,” or, “your left foot is sliding to the right,” coaches are giving pointers to the learner that they can immediately work on correcting. [...] "The principle of specificity in training states that the body will adapt to the specific imposed stimulus. Therefore, if an athlete desires to improve in a specific skill, movement, or exercise, he or she must perform that exercise in training with multiple variations, or tweaks, to that drill. Because of the complexity of the human structure and human movement, specificity is paramount in training to reach the desired outcome. Another layer to this philosophy is that if the test is the exercise, then if the exercise is properly tweaked (complex variations), it will provide the best opportunity for an improved outcome [...]" [...] The only way to achieve the desired outcome is to drill and tweak until we get to the desired outcome.|$|R

5000|$|As the Playboys' {{popularity}} grew, in 1956 {{the group}} was offered a Saturday morning radio show at WMMW 1470 AM. [...] Howie hosted the show and would invite the Village Playboys and other local musicians {{to come in and}} play. This exposure at WMMW brought Howie to come into contact with Jim Flaherty. n 1956, Howie was invited to join the Jim Flaherty's Western Caravan, and Howie brought with him Gus French. This group, with manager and lead guitar player Jim Flaherty, would be a significant step-up for Howie from his previous band. Jim was a very popular DJ at WHAY in New Britain, Connecticut, a successful concert promoter, and manager of the popular Belmont Record Shop located on Washington Street in Hartford, Connecticut. Howie played with the Jim Flaherty's Western Caravan, providing lead vocals, and playing instruments as needed, with a particular emphasis on the banjo, piano, and fiddle. The group would tour tirelessly throughout New England during these years and became quite popular. This time in Howie's life was certainly the pinnacle of his commercial and musical career. A dedicated self-promoter, Jim Flaherty secured multiple recording contracts with A&R man http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/morty_craft.htm Morty Craft in New York City from 1957 through 1960. The band began at Bell Studios as a studio band for other larger acts managed by Morty at the time. Morty was a hard-taskmaster, Gus French recalls [...] "Morty would have us play for 12 hours plus, one day my fingers were bleeding we stayed at it for so long, we asked if <b>we</b> could <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> Morty replied put some tape on 'em and keep playing.". [...] The working relationship however soon evolved into actual productions by the band on the Indie labels of MELL, JENN, & Frankie. The band would go on to record at the Bell Sound Studios in New York City, with Morty Craft acting as producer. [...] These recordings, beginning with [...] "Real Gone Daddy" [...] began to get much radio airtime throughout New England and put Howie and the band on the map. A total of 4 commercially produced 45's were released during this time. There was even a Howie Stange Fan Club, according to past President Mary Jane Papallo, who {{fell in love with the}} music after seeing Howie open for the Everly Brothers. On September 1, 1958 the band opened for the Wilburn Brothers and Johnny Cash at Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut.|$|R

30|$|Methodologically {{this is a}} {{textually}} based {{critical analysis}} and comparison of legislation, migration policies, judgements and executive responses in Southern Europe and Australia. While comparative work on law questions is often undertaken across legal systems that share similar foundations and/or legal and language regimes (Giannacopoulos, 2016, p. 2) the approach <b>we</b> <b>take</b> here requires <b>a</b> <b>break</b> from this familiar approach. This article draws on primary legal texts {{as the basis for}} analysis but does not conduct a formal ‘black-letter’ legal analysis. It does however work in line with Hollifield’s insight that “in order to understand the politics of international migration we must compare immigration politics and policy outcomes among the liberal democracies” (Hollifield, 1992, p. 590). We focus ﻿here﻿ on the domestic structure of the judiciary and the internal domestic response of executives to judicial action on the international and complex question of migration. Since the objective here is to track a legal relationship that is of increasing relevance for migration, that of the executive and the judiciary, across two regions that are conventionally legally incomparable, a diverse range of texts have been brought into dialogue. Like Borkert and Penninx, <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> approach that stems from the idea that the multi-level governance of migration “is a process and not an event” and as such “is often of a cyclical in nature” (Borkert & Penninx, 2011, pp. 10 – 11). Borkert and Penninx identify the crucial importance of analyzing the role of various actors within these cyclical relations, even if comparative study in the field of migration is “by no means straightforward” (Borkert & Penninx, 2011, pp. 11 – 12). This is a complex study grounded in legal decisions with a focus on the relationships between actors and institutions (specifically the executive and judiciary) and their cyclical connections which assists in better understanding the contemporary trends of securitisation, extra-territorialisation and the undoing of protections for irregular migrants. Tracking this cycle reveals a transformation of the relationship itself as well as showing the profound effects this has on the lives of the peoples whose movements activate the governance cycle we track. This power contest is paradoxical in some ways because even if the executive attempts to curb judicial power that gesture also re-affirms the judiciary’s ongoing role in irregular migration matters.|$|R
