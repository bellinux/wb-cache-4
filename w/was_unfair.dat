He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.|$|E
5|$|Morgan appealed his {{conviction}} {{on the grounds}} that it <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> due to the level of publicity the case had received. His application was rejected by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales on 5 February 1998 after the three sitting judges ruled there were insufficient grounds to justify an appeal.|$|E

5|$|On November2, {{following}} an investigation, President Corazon Aquino ordered Sulpicio Lines temporarily closed {{while the government}} was asked to inspect the company's crews and ships. Company officials felt that the indefinite closing <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> and argued it would disrupt shipping across the island nation, and that the inspection can take place without shutting the entire company down. Typhoon Ruby {{was the first of}} three tropical cyclones to affect the island chain in a span of a mere two weeks; Ruby was followed by Tropical Storm Tess and Typhoon Skip in early November1988.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E
5|$|After Michael France {{delivered}} the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine {{was brought in}} to rewrite it. Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt <b>was</b> <b>unfair,</b> particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.|$|E

5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature of the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Shoup opposed {{military}} action against Cuba, warning against any attempt to intervene militarily against Fidel Castro. He was initially not involved or aware of {{the plans for the}} Bay of Pigs invasion. He was asked by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to furnish an officer, but became furious when he learned the CIA was requisitioning Marine supplies without his permission. He finally learned the intent of the CIA when the officer, Colonel Jack Hawkins, contacted him {{on the night of the}} invasion, pleading with him to appeal to Kennedy for air support. Following the failure of the operation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were blamed, which Shoup thought <b>was</b> <b>unfair,</b> as they had not been aware of the early planning.|$|E
5|$|Cohen {{thereafter}} {{launched a}} media offensive claiming the DRS was biased {{in favor of}} large businesses and made frequent threats of lawsuits against Nominet. Cohen stated {{he believed that the}} DRS system <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> {{for a number of reasons}} and would seek redress against Nominet with the High Court via judicial review. Nominet stated that Cohen should appeal the case via the appeal process in the DRS. Cohen refused and, after several months, instead issued proceedings for judicial review. The High Court at first instance rejected Cohen's case in August 2005, noting that Cohen's company, Cyberbritain Group Ltd., should have used the appeal process forming part of Nominet's domain resolution service. Afterward, Cohen's company asked for a rehearing and, as that case progressed, the interim domain name was transferred to Apple in accord with the expert's decision and thereafter pointed to the Apple music site. In November 2005, Cohen dropped all legal action against Apple.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have varied}} interpretations of Marshall's vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall {{as one of}} the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 Time {{magazine}} article. Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidency, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the United States would have been much more involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler, which began in the following year. Morison {{and a number of other}} historians claim that Marshall's decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of the presidency would have made World War II much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on the subject <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from office, even temporarily.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Tillman accused {{his junior}} {{colleague}} from South Carolina, John L. McLaurin, {{of corruption in}} a speech to the Senate. McLaurin, who had been a Tillmanite before breaking from him after being elected to the Senate, called him a liar, whereupon Tillman rushed across the Senate floor and punched McLaurin in the face. McLaurin reciprocated, giving Tillman a bloody nose before the Sergeant at Arms and senators intervened. The body immediately went into closed session, and held both men in contempt. The Senate considered suspending them, but Tillman argued that it <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> to deprive South Carolina of her representation, though the body could certainly expel the two menâ€”knowing he had enough Democratic votes to prevent it. In the end, both men were censured, and later that year, Tillman arranged for McLaurin, whose term ended in 1903, to not be re-elected.|$|E
5|$|In November, Lyn {{stated that}} they wanted to {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who {{stated that they}} were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions if it was actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF stated that they were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium and that they were opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E

5|$|In R. v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, {{ex parte}} Lain (1967), {{it was held}} that {{the powers of the}} Board were in {{principle}} reviewable, despite it having been established under prerogative powers. This case was cited with approval in the GCHQ case, which reflects the modern position on the reviewability of prerogative powers in the United Kingdom. In this case, their Lordships unanimously held that executive action was not immune from judicial review merely because it was carried out in pursuance of a power derived from the common law (or the prerogative) rather than a statutory source. It was the subject-matter that counted, not the source. In this case, the Government, through an order in council, banned employees of the Government Communications Headquarters from joining a trade union. The House of Lords held that this exercise of the prerogative was judicially reviewable, and the trade unions had a legitimate expectation of prior consultation before the ban was imposed. However, although the failure to consult the unions <b>was</b> <b>unfair,</b> this lapse from proper procedure was overridden by national security considerations and thus not justiciable.|$|E
5|$|The European Championship was Razer's nextâ€”and finalâ€”televised tournament, {{for which}} it {{qualified}} as reigning World Champion. It defeated Dutch champions Pulveriser {{to set up a}} semi-final against Tornado. Razer's adversaries attached the anti-crusher frame used in their previous meeting in the series six grand final; the Razer team installed a revised version of the lifting hook. Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer picked it up with the hook and dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, but the result went to a judges' decision. They awarded victory to Razer for being in control of the fight, but in a split decision the team decided this <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> and conceded to Tornado, who beat Philliper 2 in the final to claim the European title.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1975 crisis, the Governor-General's {{power to}} dismiss a Prime Minister against the incumbent's will under Section 64 of the Constitution {{had never been}} exercised. Twice since Federation, {{conflicts}} between state premiers and state governors, who perform analogous functions to the Prime Minister and Governor-General respectively, at the state level, had resulted in the departure of one or the other. In 1916, New South Wales Premier William Holman was expelled from the Australian Labor Party for supporting conscription. He managed {{to hold on to}} power with the aid of opposition parties and consulted the Governor, Sir Gerald Strickland, proposing to pass legislation to extend the term of the lower house of the state legislature by a year. When Strickland objected, stating that such a course <b>was</b> <b>unfair</b> to Labor, Holman had him replaced. In 1932 the New South Wales Labor Premier, Jack Lang, refused to pay moneys owing to the Federal government, which froze the state's bank accounts, causing Lang to order that payments to the state government be only in cash. The governor, Sir Philip Game, wrote to Lang, warning him that ministers were breaking the law, and that if they continued, he would have to obtain ministers who could carry on government within legal bounds. Lang replied that he would not resign, and Game dismissed his government and commissioned the Leader of the Opposition, Bertram Stevens, to form a caretaker government pending a new election, in which Labor was defeated.|$|E
