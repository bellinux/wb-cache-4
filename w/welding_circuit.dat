On the basis of the <b>welding</b> transformer <b>circuit</b> model, a new method is proposed to measure the transformer primary-side signal for estimating the secondary-side resistance in each 1 / 4 cycle. The tailored computing system ensures that the measuring method possesses a real-time computational capacity with satisfying accuracy.

40|$|It is {{of great}} {{importance}} to study behavior of adhesively bonded dissimilar materials as they are widely used in electronic packaging, plastic integrated <b>circuit,</b> <b>welded</b> joints of dissimilar materials, composite materials etc. Due to mechanical loading, cyclic variation in climate or changes in moisture content of ambience leads to high stress at corners or interface, where discontinuities of geometry or material property is present. In this study an attempt {{has been made to}} study the behavior of small crack at the interface of aluminum/epoxy bimaterial system. Initially stress intensity factors are estimated experimentally by digital photoelasticity and then compared numerically with a finite element model. Experimentally, ten-step phase shifting technique is used to get isochromatic phase map without ambiguity and later it is unwrapped to get the total fringe order over the model domain. Three fringe photoelasticity technique is also used to get total fringe order. From this information stress intensity factor at interface crack tip is determined using simplified multi-parameter stress field equation of Deng involving over-deterministic least square approach. Numerically stress intensity factors are evaluated by virtual crack closure integral method. Numerically J-integral method is also used for evaluating stress intensity factors for interface crack. We may have to account for the effect of material mismatch as well as temperatute effect at material interfaces. A bimaterial wedge corner can also act as a source for high stress concentration, and it’s singularity is different from crack tip. In the present work, analytically order of singularity is found out for the aluminium/epoxy bimaterial system and using this, stress fields around the corner is predicted. For finding the order of singularity modified stress field equations of Seweryn has been used with appropriate boundary conditions.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 86 - 88. The use of shunt {{capacitor}} bank equipment is essential if a utility wishes {{to control the}} flow of reactive power effectively. The most significant results stemming from this will be lower losses on the system and an increased power transfer capability. Thus {{it is important that}} the methods used to protect a {{shunt capacitor}} bank will ensure that the bank is available when required. While the more common shunt capacitor problems are related to capacitor unit failures, conditions such as bank over currents, surge voltages and harmonics can cause extended undesired conditions. Today's protection methods are able to remove a shunt capacitor bank from service before extensive damage is done, although the location of the faulty capacitor units will not be known (if this was in fact the reason for the protection tripping the bank). This thesis explores the subject of improving the protection of high-voltage shunt capacitor banks, specifically with respect to the detection of unhealthy fuseless capacitor units. An extensive literature search was carried out on the theory pertaining to the protection of shunt capacitor banks, and a model of a fuse less shunt capacitor bank was built in the laboratory to better understand the failing process of an element within a capacitor unit. The changes in the capacitor unit's current and voltage profiles, as well as those of the remaining healthy capacitor units, were monitored as an element failure was simulated (whereby the element forms a solid <b>weld,</b> or short <b>circuit).</b> Stemming from these experiments, it was found that where a bank consists of strings of units with no interconnection between the units of different strings, an element failure in a capacitor unit would cause a significant decrease in voltage across the affected unit. This voltage change could be used to identify when elements are failing in capacitor units, and the location of the unhealthy unit could also be determined. One potential method would be to have capacitor units with built-in voltage transformers attached across each element section in the unit. As element failures occur either send this information to ground level, where it can be read by a microprocessor relay device, or have a display on the outside of the capacitor unit. In the case of the change in unit current, it was found to be very small and thus had no function for detecting unhealthy capacitor units...|$|R
