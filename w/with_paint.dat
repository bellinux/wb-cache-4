5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did <b>with</b> <b>paint</b> when creating the illusion of solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E
5|$|Vehicle {{camouflage}} techniques begin <b>with</b> <b>paint,</b> {{which offers}} at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised {{materials such as}} blankets and vegetation, and erecting nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb near infrared and radar waves. Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints also reflect infrared to help provide concealment from night vision devices.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{prosecutors}} began {{claiming the}} building was a national headquarters for a multimillion-dollar racketeering operation. On April 20, 1988, the FBI and Chicago police Internal Affairs Division investigators raided the On Leong Merchants Association Building, confiscated gambling paraphernalia from a casino hidden on the building's second floor and seized $350,000 from a vault. Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Scully asserted that the Association had collected $6million in illegal gambling profits between 1966 and 1988. The building was seized by the US federal government two months later under federal racketeering statutes. Other than several first-floor shops, the building sat empty for almost five years. Rooms on the upper floors fell into disrepair, <b>with</b> <b>paint</b> peeling and faded ornamentation in pieces on the floor.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca played music, {{sang and}} danced mainly {{as part of}} religious, burial and {{initiation}} rituals, with harvests and sowing and after the victory in battles. Also during the construction of their houses, the Muisca performed music and dances. The early Spanish chronicles noted that the music and singing was monotonous and sad. As musical instruments they used drums, flutes made of shells or ceramics, trumpets of gold, zampoñas and ocarinas. At the rituals, the people would be dressed in feathers, animal skins (mainly jaguar) and decorated their bodies <b>with</b> <b>paint.</b> At the dances the women and men held hands and both the commoners and the higher social classes participated in these activities. The main deities associated with the dances were Huitaca and Nencatacoa.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1991 season, Zerex {{ended their}} {{sponsorship}} of Kulwicki's team. Junior Johnson came calling again, {{looking for a}} driver for his revived second team that had last seen Neil Bonnett behind the wheel in 1986. Kulwicki turned down Johnson's $1 million offer thinking that he had secured a sponsorship deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Johnson then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team's expenses {{out of his own}} pocket. At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, fivecars raced <b>with</b> <b>paint</b> schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved in the Gulf War. It was the first use of special paint schemes in NASCAR history. Kulwicki's car was sponsored by the United States Army in a one-race deal. After running the second and third races of the season in a plain white unsponsored car, Kulwicki's luck finding a sponsor changed for the better at Atlanta Motor Speedway.|$|E

The body of the resistor is protected <b>with</b> <b>paint</b> or plastic. Early 20th-century carbon composition resistors had uninsulated bodies; the lead wires were wrapped around {{the ends of the}} resistance element rod and soldered. The completed resistor was painted for color-coding of its value.|$|E
25|$|The {{easiest way}} to {{distinguish}} the pottery of this period {{from that of the}} late Middle Helladic is the use of a fine ware that is painted in a dark-on-light style with lustrous paints. This period also marks the appearance of a fine ware that is coated all over <b>with</b> <b>paint</b> varying from red and black in color. This ware is monochrome painted and is directly descended from grey and black Minyan ware (which disappear during LH I). A form of the yellow Minyan style also appears in this period, merging into Mycenaean unpainted wares.|$|E

25|$|Regulated {{games are}} overseen by referees or marshals, who patrol {{the course to}} ensure {{enforcement}} of the rules {{and the safety of}} the players. If a player is marked <b>with</b> <b>paint,</b> they will call him out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the honor code; a broken ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this rule, such as requiring a tag to certain body locations only – such as the head and torso only. There are game rules that can be enforced depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance the fairness of the game or eliminate cheating.|$|E
25|$|Sienkiewicz {{continued}} as {{artist of the}} Moon Knight color comics series, starting with the first issue (November 1980). His eclectic art style helped shed the early perception of Moon Knight as a mere Batman clone. Four years later, after a stint as artist on the Fantastic Four, he became the artist on Marvel's X-Men spin-off New Mutants, beginning with issue No.18 (August 1984), producing cover paintings and character designs. From this period on, Sienkiewicz's art evolved into a much more expressionistic style, and he began experimenting <b>with</b> <b>paint,</b> collage, and mixed media. He illustrated New Mutants from 19841985.|$|E

The demonstrators responded by bombarding the police with fireworks, cobblestones, and bottles filled <b>with</b> <b>paint.</b> The police used armoured cars to split {{the main body of}} demonstrators into smaller groups. The demonstrators then moved downtown and vandalized a number of shops. The police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators.

25|$|Traffic circles are {{relatively}} rare in New York City, but Windsor Terrace has three of them, all framing Prospect Park entrances along the park's border. The northernmost, a medium-sized traffic circle named Bartel-Pritchard Square, {{is at the}} intersection of Prospect Park W, Prospect Park SW, and 15th Street, and contains an ornate entrance framed with two columns. Another traffic circle, a small circular asphalt pad that is largely delineated <b>with</b> <b>paint</b> and flex-barriers, is at Prospect Park SW and 17th Street. The southernmost, a large traffic circle named Park Circle, is at the convergence of Prospect Park SW, Coney Island Avenue, Parkside Avenue, Ocean Parkway, and Fort Hamilton Parkway, and was reconstructed in 2010. Park Circle's entrance to Prospect Park is designed in a style similar to the Bartel-Pritchard Square entrance.|$|E
25|$|The University was {{the site}} of social {{upheaval}} during the 1960s and 1970s, when nationalist students protested for civil rights, the independence of Puerto Rico, and taking the ROTC out of the campus. In 1970 Antonia Martínez was murdered by the police when they repressed students. As the shouting started in the street, everyone in the building she was in, on Ponce de León Avenue, went to the balconies to see what was happening. She was, like many others, watching the events, saw policemen attacking at the students, and allegedly shouted at the police ¡Asesinos! (Assassins!). A policeman turned and shot her in the head, killing her and injuring a roommate. A mural of her and her story existed on the College of Humanities, until administrative personnel covered it <b>with</b> <b>paint.</b> Other stories claim that she was shot by mistake.|$|E
