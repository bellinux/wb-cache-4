5|$|The new Parliament met in 1904 {{and reached}} a compromise, {{choosing}} Dalgety, which, like Bombala, {{was located in}} the Monaro region.

However, while the Federal Parliament supported Dalgety, the New South Wales government did not, and they proved unwilling to cede the amount of territory the Federal Government demanded.|$|E
5|$|Trucking {{achieved}} {{national attention}} during the 1960s and 70s, when songs and movies about truck driving were major hits. Truck drivers participated in widespread strikes against {{the rising cost}} of fuel, during the energy crises of 1973 and 1979.

5|$|While these Irish bulls {{have led}} many writers to portray Roche as a buffoon, other biographers have {{interpreted}} them not as blunders, but as calculated attempts to disarm opposition to ministerial policies through humour. Roche ended {{his political career}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act of Union 1800, which he supported. He chose not to attempt to enter the British House of Commons and retired on a government pension until his death, married but childless, in 1807.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Birmingham, Titterton worked in a research position under Mark Oliphant, who recruited him to work on radar for the British Admiralty during {{the first part of}} the Second World War. In 1943, he joined the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where he helped develop the first atomic bombs. He eventually became one of the laboratory's group leaders. He participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at the Bikini Atoll in 1946, where he performed the countdown for both tests. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave.

5|$|A {{scientist}} with a PhD in plant physiology, Marshall became independently wealthy {{after the death}} of his father in 1929. He had started his outdoor career in 1925 as forester with the U.S. Forest Service. He used his financial independence for expeditions to Alaska and other wilderness areas. Later he held two significant public appointed posts: chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the Forest Service, from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During this period, he directed the promulgation of regulations to preserve large areas of roadless land that were under federal management. Many years after his death, some of those areas were permanently protected from development, exploitation, and mechanization <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wilderness Act of 1964.|$|E

5000|$|Many changes {{occurred}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> LSTA. <b>The</b> original act, Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA), allocated {{funds for}} construction of buildings, but LSTA has an emphasis on technology.

Another change that occurred <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> LSCA was <b>the</b> responsibility of library services. This responsibility was originally a part of the Department of Education. It was moved to the newly created, independent federal agency called the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The range of libraries served also changed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> enactment of LSTA. Originally, public libraries were primarily served by LSCA. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> LSTA, all types of libraries are served, including public, school, academic, and special.|$|R
5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} fifteen, Coffin {{was helping}} his family assist {{escaping}} slaves by taking food {{to those who were}} hiding on his family's farm. As the repressive Fugitive Slave Act became more rigorously enforced, the Coffin family began to assist slaves in greater secrecy, doing most of their illegal activities at night. Scrutiny of the abolitionists only worsened <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1804 Black Laws. By the early 1820s Quakers in North Carolina were being openly persecuted for the assistance they were suspected of providing to runaway slaves. In 1821 Coffin and his cousin, Vestal, established a Sunday School to teach slaves to read the Bible, but the plan was short-lived; slaveholders soon forced the school to close.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{independence}} from the United Kingdom grew gradually {{over the course of}} many years since the formation of the Canadian Confederation in 1867. World War I and World War II, in particular, gave rise to a desire among Canadians to have their country recognized as a fully-fledged sovereign state with a distinct citizenship. Legislative independence was established <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Statute of Westminster 1931, the Canadian Citizenship Act of 1946 took effect on January 1, 1947, and full sovereignty was achieved with the patriation of the constitution in 1982. Canada's nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom. Legislation since the mid-20th century represents Canadians' commitment to multilateralism and socioeconomic development.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} {{the passage of}} the Licinio-Sextian law of 367 BC, which required the election of at least one Plebeian Consul each year, a series of laws were passed which ultimately granted Plebeians political equality with Patricians. The Patrician era came to a complete end in 287 BC, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hortensian law. This era was also marked with significant external developments. Up until 295 BC, the Samnites and the Kelts had been Rome's chief rivals, but that year, at the Battle of Sentinum, the Romans defeated the combined armies of the Samnites and the Kelts. This battle was followed by the complete submission of both the Samnites and the Kelts to the Romans, and the emergence of Rome as the unchallenged mistress of Italy.|$|E

5|$|Michigan, led by {{the young}} and hot-headed Mason, responded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pains and Penalties Act just six days after Lucas County was formed; the act made it a {{criminal}} offense for Ohioans to carry out governmental actions in the Strip, under penalty of a fine up to $1,000, {{up to five years}} imprisonment at hard labor, or both. Acting as commander-in-chief of the territory, Mason appointed Brigadier-General Joseph W. Brown of the Third U.S. Brigade to head the state militia, with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio trespassers. Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own, and he soon sent forces to the Strip area. The Toledo War had begun.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{opposition}} to the proposed amendment was the women's suffrage movement, which {{before and during the}} Civil War had made common cause with the abolitionist movement. However, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the National Woman Suffrage Association of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association of Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.|$|E
