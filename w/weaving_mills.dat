5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution, the River Beal was used to power large <b>weaving</b> <b>mills.</b> Within one {{generation}} during the late-19th century, and following a boom in nearby Oldham, Milnrow's staple industry changed from wool weaving to cotton spinning. Soon, distinctive rectangular brick-built mills dominated Milnrow's landscape. Milnrow, the location of some of the earliest ring spinning companies, had many of the characteristics of a company town. The Heaps of Milnrow exercised significant deferential and political influence in the local area. Following the Great Depression, the region's textile sector experienced a decline until its eventual demise in the mid-20th century. Milnrow's last cotton mill was Butterworth Hall Mill, demolished in the late 1990s. Milnrow experienced population growth and suburbanisation {{in the second half of}} the 20th century, spurred by the construction of the M62 motorway through the area, making Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire commutable. Milnrow Metrolink station opened as part of Greater Manchester's light-rail Metrolink network on 28 February 2013.|$|E

25|$|Improvements to {{the power}} loom in the early 1840s, and the {{construction}} of a railway line in 1846, led to greater investment in power looms in Blackburn {{in the second half of}} that decade. The railway brought opportunities for expansion of the cotton trade, and in subsequent decades many new mills were constructed: between 1850 and 1870, 68weaving-only and four combined weaving/spinning mills were built and nine <b>weaving</b> <b>mills</b> were built per decade between 1870 and 1890.|$|E
25|$|Colne's former cotton {{industry}} {{has all but}} disappeared. Many of the textile <b>weaving</b> <b>mills</b> that used to punctuate the landscape have been demolished {{to make way for}} new retail outlets and modern housing. Others lie semi-derelict, but the best examples continue to provide jobs for local residents by accommodating new manufacturing and service businesses. Strong growth has been experienced in precision engineering, particularly associated with the aerospace sector, as Rolls-Royce Aerospace operates a large wide chord fan-blade manufacturing facility in nearby Barnoldswick.|$|E
25|$|The group, {{through the}} South Colombo Youth League, became {{involved}} in a strike at the Wellawatte Spinning and <b>Weaving</b> <b>Mills.</b> It published an irregular journal in Sinhala, Kamkaruwa (The Worker). In 1933 the group got involved in the Suriya-Mal movement, which had been formed to provide support for indigenous ex-servicemen by the sale of Suriya (Portia tree) flowers. The Suriya-Mal movement surged {{as a reaction to}} the fact that at the time Poppy Day funds went solely to British ex-servicemen. The movement was honed by volunteer work among the poor during the Malaria Epidemic of 1934-1935. The volunteers found that there was widespread malnutrition, which they helped fight by making pills of 'Marmite' yeast extract.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{manufacturing}} businesses require raw materials to function, some players {{may find themselves}} relying on the city's open market for raw materials.

Since the dynasty now contains both a Crafts(wo)man and a Patron, the player may build their own farms to raise sheep, whose wool may then {{be sent to the}} <b>Weaving</b> <b>Mill</b> to be turned into cloth.|$|R
