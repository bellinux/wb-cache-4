Lebanese Christians feared that the Muslim influx would affect their political dominance and their assumed demographic majority. Accordingly, they imposed restrictions {{on the status of}} the Palestinian refugees. The refugees could not <b>work,</b> <b>travel,</b> or engage in political activities. Initially the refugees were too impoverished to develop a leadership capable of representing their concerns. Less democratic regimes also feared the threat the refugees posed to their own rule, but Lebanon would prove too weak to maintain a crackdown.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} vehicles, {{also known}} as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), {{and are expected to}} be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for <b>work,</b> <b>travel,</b> and pleasure—could reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades. This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This thesis {{examines}} {{student participation}} from Kazakhstan in the Summer <b>Work</b> & <b>Travel</b> U. S. A. program. Kazakhstan's government emphasizes the Bologna Process, the government-funded Bolashak scholarship, {{and the new}} elite Nazarbayev University as pillars of educational internationalization. The <b>Work</b> & <b>Travel</b> program forms an alternative avenue for Kazakhstan's students to reach the United States. Semi-structured interviews with students, faculty and administrators in the U. S. and in Kazakhstan (N = 22) and a survey of popular media publications indicated that {{students and their parents}} know about persistent quality issues that have plagued the <b>Work</b> & <b>Travel</b> program, but sign up nonetheless. This thesis seeks to determine why, despite known risks, significant numbers of students from Kazakhstan continue to participate in the <b>Work</b> & <b>Travel</b> program. Analysis of perceived risks and benefits inherent to the program and of strategies that students use to cope with challenges suggests that Kazakhstan's students prefer flexible exchange programs that accommodate their strong group solidarity and their collaborative decision-making preference. These preferences are explained within the framework of Douglas's group and grid cultural theory (1982, 1986, 1992, 1999; Douglas and Ney, 1998). Changes to <b>Work</b> & <b>Travel</b> mandated by the U. S. State Department for summer 2012 call for closer monitoring of student well-being and require opportunities for cultural enrichment and English language practice during the employment phase of the program. Sponsor companies may contract with third-party providers such as educational, non-profit, or community volunteer organizations to supply this enrichment. The new policy thus creates an opportunity for educators in the U. S. to serve students from Kazakhstan who participate in <b>Work</b> & <b>Travel.</b> Implications of this analysis suggest that educators in the U. S. and the government of Kazakhstan should assess further the reasons why Kazakhstan's students pursue <b>Work</b> & <b>Travel,</b> should consider <b>Work</b> & <b>Travel</b> in strategic planning for international education opportunities, and should seek to create high-quality, flexible, collaborative work-study options that would permit Kazakhstan's non-elite students to offset the costs of their international experience through concurrent employment...|$|R
