5|$|The second {{theory is}} simply that the battle {{occurred}} because the Persians finally moved to attack the Athenians. Although this theory has the Persians moving to the strategic offensive, this can be reconciled with the traditional account of the Athenians attacking the Persians by assuming that, seeing the Persians advancing, the Athenians took the tactical offensive, and attacked them. Obviously, it cannot be firmly established which theory (if either) is correct. However, both theories imply that there <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of Persian activity which occurred on or about the fifth day which ultimately triggered the battle. It {{is also possible that}} both theories are correct: when the Persians sent the cavalry by ship to attack Athens, they simultaneously sent their infantry to attack at Marathon, triggering the Greek counterattack.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.'

25|$|Mohenjo-daro had no {{series of}} city walls, but was {{fortified}} with guard towers {{to the west}} of the main settlement, and defensive fortifications to the south. Considering these fortifications and the structure of other major Indus valley cities like Harappa, it is postulated that Mohenjo-daro was an administrative center. Both Harappa and Mohenjo-daro share relatively the same architectural layout, and were generally not heavily fortified like other Indus Valley sites. It is obvious from the identical city layouts of all Indus sites that there <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of political or administrative centrality, but the extent and functioning of an administrative center remains unclear.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of March, a train carrying the personnel of the British embassy in Saint Petersburg arrived in Tampere. The British had left Russia {{in the aftermath of}} the October Revolution and were now heading back home through Finland and Sweden. The Finnish-American Reds, August Wesley and Verner Lehtimäki, negotiated with the British and the Reds agreed to let them cross the front line in Vilppula. When the British convoy reached the White lines, they were greeted with gunfire as the Whites did not notice the white flag against the snowy background and assumed the Union Jack <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of socialist banner. Eventually, crossing the front line succeeded and the British returned safely home.|$|E
25|$|Weather was {{instantly}} ruled {{out as a}} possible cause as the weather conditions were good and visibility was not limited {{at the time of}} the accident. Investigators also determined that the engines were operating {{at the time of the}} collision with terrain, that the landing gear and flaps were deployed properly, that there was no fire, neither pre-crash nor post-crash and that the crew's alcohol and drug tests returned negative results. So many uncertainties arose as to what may have contributed to or caused the accident. Because the site where the aircraft came to rest did verifiably not correspond with the official flight path – the flight ended up to the northwest of the airport whereas it was approaching it from the south – and the air traffic controller's account that the crew neither requested a deviation nor declared any other inconvenience such as an emergency, it was determined that there <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of navigational error by the fault of the crew.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Goode, {{a critic}} for Insight on the News, {{considered}} the piece {{to be the}} beginning of the Pop Art movement, labeling the work [...] "a sign of things to come as other artists tackled common yet sacrosanct items, including the American flag". Lichtenstein, reflecting on his work, told reporters, [...] "The idea of counterfeiting money always occurs to you when you do lithography". Despite the assessments of critics, Lichtenstein, in an interview with Joan Marter, considered the work to be [...] "a kind of Cubist dollar bill, not a Pop one". He continued, [...] "The fact it was a ten-dollar-bill at all [...] there <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of Pop influence on me that I wasn't aware of so much. They're really not Pop at all. They're more funny, or humorous, or something".|$|E
500|$|The {{manuscript}} of Serat Rerenggan mentions {{the story of}} Demang Tegis, a Portuguese man said {{to be one of}} the architect of Taman Sari. According to the manuscript, a strange man suddenly appeared in Mancingan Village (a locality name on the south coast of Java near Parangtritis). With long nose, white complexion, and a foreign language, the villagers suspected that the person <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of spirit or forest fairy. They presented him to the current sultan, Hamengkubuwono II. Apparently the sultan found interest in the person and took the strange man as his servant. Some years had passed and the man had finally learned to talk in Javanese. According to him, he was a Portuguese (or in Javanese, Portegis) who was stranded from a shipwreck. He also claimed to have been a housebuilder, so the sultan ordered him to erect a fortress. Satisfied by the man’s work, the sultan gave him the title [...] "demang." [...] From then on that person was known as Demang Portegis or Demang Tegis.|$|E
500|$|According to Mark Savage from BBC Music, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] is a disco-rock song, {{which is}} {{composed}} around a building chord sequence {{that he felt}} leads to a [...] "compelling sense of urgency". The singer's vocals are kept raw and untreated on the song, eschewing Auto-Tune. The composition consists of [...] "pulsing verses" [...] and a guitar-and-vocal breakdown before the final chorus, with Gaga singing the main title multiple times. Around the two minute mark, there is a key change before the final chorus. Lewis Corner from Digital Spy felt that the track alluded to Gaga's previous album eras. He called its core a [...] "simple pop song" [...] which harked back to the singer's initial releases like [...] "Just Dance" [...] and [...] "Poker Face" [...] (both 2008). The mixture of guitar and the [...] "grumbling" [...] synths reminded Corner of Gaga's single [...] "Marry the Night" [...] from her second studio album, Born This Way (2011), along with the [...] "thumping" [...] beat. There were also allusions to the Artpop era due to the verse and the refrain being connected in an unconventional manner. Glamour and Rolling Stone reported that some listeners found similarities between the song and Madonna's [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] (1986); {{in response to the}} comparisons, Ronson told the latter magazine, [...] "Obviously, that <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of accident".|$|E

500|$|Although Northrup did {{not speak}} out {{publicly}} against her ex-husband following their divorce, she broke her silence in 1972. She wrote privately to Paulette Cooper, {{the author of the}} book The Scandal of Scientology who was subsequently targeted by the Church's Operation Freakout. Northrup told Cooper that Hubbard was a dangerous lunatic, and that although her own life had been transformed when she left him, she was still afraid both of him and of his followers, whom she later described as looking [...] "like Mormons, but with bad complexions." [...] In July 1986 she was interviewed by the ex-Scientologist Bent Corydon several months after Hubbard's death, which had reduced her fear of retaliation. Excerpts from the interview were published in Corydon's 1987 book, [...] She died of breast cancer in 1997 but in the last few months of her life she dictated a tape-recorded account of her relationship with Hubbard. It is now in the Stephen A. Kent Collection on Alternative Religions at the University of Alberta. Rejecting any suggestion that she <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of [...] "pathetic person who has suffered through the years because of my time with Ron", Northrup spoke of her relief that she had been able to put it behind her.

500|$|On June 21, Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times criticized Jackson, stating, [...] "He {{may have}} lived a {{sheltered}} life, but {{there really is}} no excuse for using terms like 'Jew me' and 'kike' in a pop song, unless you make it clear you are denouncing such terms, and do so in an artful way." [...] Two days later, Jackson decided, despite the cost incurred, he would return to the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album; [...] "Jew me" [...] and [...] "Kike me" [...] would be substituted with [...] "do me" [...] and [...] "strike me". The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises partially drowning them out. He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some. Spike Lee claimed there <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of double standard in the music industry. [...] "While the New York Times asserted the use of racial slurs in [...] "They Don't Care About Us", they were silent on other racial slurs in the album.

500|$|The band {{contributed to}} Bosnian relief efforts to enhance {{humanitarian}} and {{public awareness of}} the issue, and Bono and Carter subsequently collaborated on the documentary Miss Sarajevo, which showcased the war-torn city during Carter's six months living there. In 1995, U2 and Eno wrote the song [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] as a response to [...] "the surreal acts of defiance that had taken place during the siege of Sarajevo". One such act was a beauty pageant organized by Bosnian women who planned to fight the war with their [...] "lipstick and heels". During the pageant, all of the participants walked onto the stage carrying a banner that said, [...] "Don't let them kill us". [...] The winner of the pageant, 17-year-old Inela Nogić, later said the pageant [...] "was a crazy thing to do during a war. But we tried to live a normal life. It <b>was</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of a defence mechanism we all had." [...] Years later, Bono said, [...] "It was pure Dada and it deserved to be celebrated in song." [...] Of the song's meaning, he said, [...] "Everywhere people had heard their call for help—but help never came. That was the feeling. I had tried to tackle subjects like this head-on, but I'd learnt a lesson. You have to try and make the same points, in a different, less direct, more surrealist way." [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] was recorded with Luciano Pavarotti and released as the first single from U2's side-project with Eno entitled Original Soundtracks 1; the record was released under the pseudonym [...] "Passengers".|$|E
