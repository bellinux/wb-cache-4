50|$|Londonderry Railway Station, known {{commonly}} as <b>Waterside</b> Railway <b>Station,</b> is {{a railway}} terminus {{in the city}} of Derry in Northern Ireland, on the east bank of the River Foyle.

5000|$|Thorne <b>Waterside</b> railway <b>station,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "Thorne Lock" [...] because of its location, was built by the South Yorkshire Railway as the terminus of its line from Doncaster. It was the first railway station to be opened in Thorne. The line was opened for goods traffic on 11 December 1855 and to passenger services on 7 July 1856. The station was built adjacent to the Stainforth to Keadby Canal and goods traffic was trans-shipped for forwarding on.|$|R

50|$|The {{steam engines}} {{were also used}} {{during the twentieth century}} in power {{stations}} for traction networks which had single-phase power distribution for specific railways. A special set of single-phase generators with steam turbines at <b>Waterside</b> Generating <b>Station</b> in New York City in 1938 was an example of such generation and distribution systems. The single-phase generators were eventually retired in the late 1970s due to concerns of a turbine failure in another station. The generators were replaced by two transformers to reduce from another three-phase power source to existing single-phase catenary power. Eventually, the transformers were replaced by two solid-state cycloconverter instead.|$|R

The line opened for passengers in July 1856.|$|R
5000|$|The route {{proposed}} {{on behalf}} of the Civil Rights Association was one commonly followed by 'Protestant' and 'Loyalist' marches in Derry. It was to start from the <b>Waterside</b> Railway <b>Station,</b> east of the River Foyle, cross the river along Craigavon Bridge and proceed to the Diamond, the central point of the city. This route traversed certain Protestant district’, and ended within the city's walls, which have major significance in Orange tradition. Local Unionists objected to the route of the march through what was viewed Unionist-dominated territory, and were concerned that the war memorial in the diamond would not be respected.|$|R

5000|$|Long Island City Power Station in Hunter's Point, NY {{was built}} by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1906 in {{preparation}} for the North River Tunnels and the opening of Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. The station consisted of 64 coal-fired boilers and three steam turbine generators with a total capacity of 16 MW. In 1910, the station was expanded with two additional turbine generators for a total capacity of 32.5 MW. Power was transmitted to rotary converters (AC to DC machines) for use in the PRR's original third rail electrification scheme. Like most DC electric distribution systems of the time (Thomas Edison's being the most famous), 25 Hz power was used to drive rotary converters at substations along the line. Some sources state that the station was largely dormant by the 1920s. When AC overhead electrification was extended in the 1930s, Long Island City connected to the 11 kV catenary distribution system. Operation of the station was transferred to Consolidated Edison in 1938, although ConEd began supplying power from the adjacent <b>Waterside</b> Generating <b>Station,</b> most likely due to declining overall demand for 25 Hz power. The station was disused and sold in the mid-1950s.|$|R

5000|$|Starting in Rudow, at the {{junction}} of Gross-Ziethener Chaussee and Neuköllner Straße, the U7 runs northwest below the road Alt-Rudow, before bearing west under Gropiusstadt. Because the settlement and underground construction there were planned simultaneously, the U7 follows no roads until it reaches Britz-Süd station, where it runs under Fritz-Reuter-Allee as far as Blaschkoallee before joining the route of Buschkrugallee. It continues north, crossing the urban motorway and the Ringbahn while under Karl-Marx-Straße, then heads north-west under Hasenheide, Südstern and Gneisenaustraße until it reaches Mehringdamm after a very sharp right curve. A tight left curve brings the U7 under the [...] (Tempelhof <b>waterside)</b> to Möckernbrücke <b>station,</b> with another taking it back and below {{the area of the}} former [...] (Anhalter goods station).

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} name of Derry City Council, the city is usually known as Londonderry in {{official}} use within the UK. In the Republic of Ireland, {{the city and county}} are almost always referred to as Derry, on maps, in the media and in conversation. In April 2009, however, the Republic of Ireland's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Micheál Martin, announced that Irish passport holders who were born there could record either Derry or Londonderry as their place of birth. [...] Whereas official road signs in the Republic use the name Derry, those in Northern Ireland bear Londonderry (sometimes abbreviated to [...] "L'Derry"), although some of these have been defaced with the reference to London obscured. Usage varies among local organisations, with both names being used. Examples are City of Derry Airport, City of Derry Rugby Club, Derry City FC and the Protestant Apprentice Boys of Derry, as opposed to Londonderry Port, Londonderry YMCA Rugby Club and Londonderry Chamber of Commerce. Most companies within the city choose local area names such as Pennyburn, Rosemount or [...] "Foyle" [...] from the River Foyle to avoid alienating the other community. Londonderry railway station {{is often referred to as}} <b>Waterside</b> railway <b>station</b> within the city but is called Derry/Londonderry at other stations. The council changed {{the name of}} the local government district covering the city to Derry on 7 May 1984, consequently renaming itself Derry City Council. This did not change the name of the city, although the city is coterminous with the district, and in law the city council is also the [...] "Corporation of Londonderry" [...] or, more formally, the [...] "Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of the City of Londonderry". The form [...] "Londonderry" [...] is used for the post town by the Royal Mail, however use of Derry will still ensure delivery.|$|R
