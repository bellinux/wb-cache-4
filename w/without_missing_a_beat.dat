500|$|Hank Stuever of The Washington Post {{found the}} pace of this episode [...] "sleeker" [...] than that of {{previous}} ones, adding, [...] "This has the subtle but immediate effect of making The Walking Dead less predictable and more frightening." [...] Derek Boeckelmann of Daily Nexus commended the episode, deeming it [...] "frighteningly good". He praised the performances of Holden and Reedus and described the former {{as one of the}} show's strongest characters. David Chute of Indiewire approved of the special effects and commended the highway sequence, saying, [...] "a sequence in which the humans hide under the wrecked cars in a freeway pileup, able to see only the feet of the flesh eaters shuffling past, is a classic nail-biter." [...] David Hickley of Daily News gave [...] "What Lies Ahead" [...] three out of five stars and expressed the view: [...] "The Walking Dead may be under new management, but it seems to have kept its rhythm, moving easily between bursts of intense violence and long stretches of psychological sparring." [...] The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman concurred. [...] "It's 90 minutes of skill", he wrote, [...] "bringing viewers back into the story <b>without</b> <b>missing</b> <b>a</b> <b>beat,</b> adding immediate depth to characters, ratcheting up suspense , plus expanding the emotional palette of the series." [...] In his [...] review, John Griffiths of Us Weekly liked the personal dynamics almost as much as the bloodthirstiness.|$|E
40|$|Fluctuation or {{variation}} of the heartbeat represents momently varying inner emotional tension. Can this psychological variations of the inner world, anxiety for example, is detectable and even quantifiable? Our answer to the question: Using a long-time electrocardiogram (EKG), we quantified them. We recorded EKGs by our own EKG amplifiers. The amplifier has a newly designed electric circuit, which enable us to record a stable EKG. The amplifier {{made it possible to}} record a perfect EKG where the EKG trace never jump-out from the PC monitor screen. Using this amplifier, we captured approximately 2000 heartbeats <b>without</b> <b>missing</b> <b>a</b> single <b>beat.</b> For the analysis of the EKGs, we used "modified detrended fluctuation analysis (mDFA) " technique, which we have recently developed by our group. The mDFA calculates the scaling exponent (SI, scaling index) from the time series data, i. e., the R-R interval time series data obtained from EKG. Detecting 2000 consecutive peaks, the mDFA can distinguish between a normal and an abnormal heart: a normal healthy heartbeat exhibits an SI of around 1. 0, comparable to the fluctuations exemplified as the 1 /f spectrum. The heartbeat recorded from subjects who have stress and anxiety exhibited a lower SI. Arrhythmic heartbeats and extra-systolic heartbeats both also exhibited a low SI ~ 0. 7, for example. We propose that the mDFA technique is a useful computation method for checking health. The functional capabilities of various internal systems, such as the circulatory system and the autonomic nervous system, can be quantified by using mDFA...|$|R

500|$|On July 8, 2007, {{during the}} concert in St. Louis, {{two people in}} the crowd who {{attended}} the show suffered burns after pyrotechnics meant for the stage tumbled into the audience; Knowles visited them in the hospital after the show. During the performance of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] at the Orlando, Florida show on July 24, Knowles fell down a flight of stairs. Her heel got caught in the bottom on her long coat and she tripped down; she quickly picked herself up and carried on with the show. After the incident Knowles jokingly asked the audience, not to post the footage on YouTube although she knew they would; several clips were posted on the video-sharing website and went viral. On July 26 YouTube removed many of the clips as they were infringing copyright terms. After an initial removal spree, clips of the incident reappeared on YouTube, and were uploaded to other content-sharing websites such as Dailymotion and eBaum's World.

[...] When asked about the fall on CNN, Knowles said that she hit her head and chin and was bruised up. She further noted that she immediately started thinking to get up and continue performing the show harder as an athlete due to the adrenaline she had: [...] "Whenever I do something like that I always perform really, really hard cause it makes me little mad at myself so I just go crazy. So they got a really good show in the end." [...] During her performance in Toronto on August 25, while performing [...] "Déjà Vu", Knowles had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer revealed that the speculations weren't true, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! Do you really think Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the incidents, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect. A tumble down the stairs onstage in Orlando and a subsequent 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." ...|$|E
