5|$|In late August 1949, Nixon {{embarked}} on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California, where he was less <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> <b>to</b> see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran. With many of his closest advisers urging him to do so, Nixon decided in early October to seek the Senate seat. He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, who had helped to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon's first congressional race.|$|E

5|$|Rupert Murdoch {{announced}} in early February 2007 that Baron Cohen had {{signed on to}} do another Borat film with Fox. However, this was contradicted by an interview with Baron Cohen himself in which Baron Cohen stated that Borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> avoid detection {{as he did in}} the film and on Da Ali G Show. A spokesman for Fox later stated that it was too early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.|$|E

5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|According to Charles Collins, the {{significance}} of the Elephanta Caves is better understood by studying them in context of ancient and early medieval Hindu literature, {{as well as in the}} context of other Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cave temples on the subcontinent. The historic Elephanta artwork were inspired by the mythology, concepts and spiritual ideas found in the Vedic texts on Rudra and later Shiva, the epics, the Puranas and the Pashupata Shaivism literature corpus of Hinduism composed by the 5th-century. The panels reflect the ideas and stories widely accepted and <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> the artists and cave architects of India by about 525 CE. The mythology varies significantly in these texts and has been much distorted by later interpolations, but the Elephanta Cave panels represent the narrative version most significant in the 6th century. The panels and artwork express through their eclecticism, flux and motion the influence of Vedic and post-Vedic religious thought on Hindu culture in mid 1st millennium CE.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the heads}} are realistic, unidealised and frank {{descriptions}} of the men. It is likely that they were portraits of living (or recently deceased) rulers <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> the sculptors. Each head is distinct and naturalistic, displaying individualised features. They were once thought to represent ballplayers although this theory is no longer widely held; it is possible, however, that they represent rulers equipped for the Mesoamerican ballgame. Facial expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling. The most naturalistic Olmec art is the earliest, appearing suddenly without surviving antecedents, with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed. Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El Manatí demonstrate that the Olmecs {{are likely to have}} created many more perishable sculptures than works sculpted from stone.|$|E

Hammer, known for his decades of work with the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, had spoken with Gorbachev prior to leaving and was carrying with him $1 million in relief funds. Half of those funds were from World Vision International, a California-based relief and development umbrella organization, {{and the other half}} were his own personal donation. The flight also carried Robert Seiple (president of World Vision) and a UCLA doctor who had worked {{in the aftermath of the}} 1985 Mexico City earthquake.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his {{succession}} Chamberlain's personality was not <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> the public, though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years. According to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self, these appeared relaxed and modern, showing an ability to speak directly to the camera. Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues. An attempt by his Parliamentary Private Secretary, Lord Dunglass (later Prime Minister himself as Alec Douglas-Home) to bring him to the Smoking Room in the Commons to socialise with his colleagues, ended in embarrassing silence. Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated press management system employed by a Prime Minister up to that time, with officials at Number 10 led by his chief of press George Steward, convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge, and should espouse the government line.|$|E

He became <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> Parisian critics as director, actor, and stage manager of his high-school theatre (lycée Louis-le-Grand). At 15, he was enthusiastically celebrated as a theatre prodigy. In 1964, at the age of 19, he began directing for the professional theatre. While studying at the Sorbonne, he professionally staged Victor Hugo's L'Intervention, and subsequently dropped out of the university.|$|E

5|$|He {{was said}} to have been {{discovered}} by Ipswich Town scout Jim Rodgers (his goals at schoolboy level meant that he was already <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> all the football scouts in Northern Ireland), who was told by manager Bobby Robson to wait until Whiteside grew older. Instead, it was Manchester United's 80-year-old Ulster scout Bob Bishop, who previously unearthed Belfast-born George Best and Sammy McIlroy for the club, who first offered him a trial at an English club. Whiteside's family were Manchester United supporters, though the youngster himself held no particular allegiance. He found that he had been offered schoolboy terms at the club during a school trip to the United States; on the trip, he and his classmates met President Jimmy Carter at the Oval Office, a rare and extraordinary occasion for children from a disadvantaged background.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Aston {{teamed up}} with {{television}} producer Tim Taylor and together they created two shows which focused on bringing archaeology into British popular consciousness. The first was the short-lived Time Signs (1991), although {{this was followed by}} the more successful Time Team, which was produced for Channel 4 from 1994 to 2013. Aston was responsible for identifying sites for excavation and for selecting specialists to appear on the show, and through the programme became <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> the viewing public for his trademark colourful jumpers and flowing, untidy hairstyle. In 1996 he was appointed to the specially-created post of Professor of Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University, and undertook a ten-year project investigating the manor at Shapwick, Somerset.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. These chemicals, termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Pheromones, a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver. Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver. While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is especially <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> have developed in social insects.|$|E
