5|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Bouba/Kiki phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia. Most people <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba. It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices. For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al. have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.|$|E

If Will sees this man, he must call a number attached to a picture. <b>Will</b> <b>agrees,</b> hoping this <b>will</b> fulfill his debt. Simon, however, continues to call Will, asking him to continue what he Is doing, claiming the man is a sex offender. Having no choice, as Simon promises to exact revenge if he does not obey, a reluctant <b>Will</b> <b>agrees.</b> He is instructed to kill the man on a pedestrian walkway that is under a high overpass by [...] "accidentally" [...] bumping him off it to his death, making it look like suicide.|$|R

25|$|As {{the number}} of {{replicate}} measurements in a microarray experiment increases, various statistical approaches yield increasingly similar results, but lack of concordance between different statistical methods makes array results appear less trustworthy.

25|$|Minkowski {{space is}} closely {{associated}} with Einstein's theory of special relativity, and {{is the most common}} mathematical structure on which special relativity is formulated. While the individual components in Euclidean space and time may differ due to length contraction and time dilation, in Minkowski spacetime, all frames of reference <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> on the total distance in spacetime between events. Because it treats time differently than it treats the 3 spatial dimensions, Minkowski space differs from four-dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
25|$|Coercive {{citation}} is {{a practice}} {{in which an}} editor forces an author to add extraneous citations to an article before the journal <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> to publish it, in order to inflate the journal's impact factor. A survey published in 2012 indicates that coercive citation has been experienced by one in five researchers working in economics, sociology, psychology, and multiple business disciplines, and it {{is more common in}} business and in journals with a lower impact factor. However, cases of coercive citation have occasionally been reported for other scientific disciplines.|$|E

25|$|In March 2015, {{a federal}} judge ruled null and void a {{decision}} to grant him a permanent visa as this would conflict with Brazilian law, and ordered his deportation. The judge stressed that the deportation {{should not be confused}} with extradition, as it does not require that Battisti be surrendered to Italy, but rather to the country from which he entered Brazil, or any other country that <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> to receive him. On 14 September 2015, the Regional Federal Court of San Paolo declared the expulsion illegal and canceled the order of deportation.|$|E

25|$|The {{automorphism}} j of a {{model of}} this kind {{is closely related to}} certain natural operations in NFU. For example, if W is a well-ordering in the nonstandard model (we suppose here that we use Kuratowski pairs so that the coding of functions in the two theories <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> to some extent) which is also a well-ordering in NFU (all well-orderings of NFU are well-orderings in the nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory, but not vice versa, due to the formation of urelements {{in the construction of the}} model), and W has type α in NFU, then j(W) will be a well-ordering of type T(α) in NFU.|$|E
25|$|The Lorentz transformations have a {{mathematical}} property called linearity, since x and t are obtained as linear combinations of x and t, with no higher powers involved. The linearity {{of the transformation}} reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that we tacitly assumed while performing the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere. All inertial observers <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion. Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, {{but there is nothing}} absolute about them. Another observer's conventions will do just as well.|$|E
25|$|Lebanon has by far {{the largest}} {{proportion}} of Christians of any Middle Eastern country, but both Christians and Muslims are sub-divided into many splinter sects and denominations. Population statistics are highly controversial. The various denominations and sects each have vested interests in inflating their own numbers. Shias, Sunnis, Maronites and Greek Orthodox (the four largest denominations) all often claim that their particular religious affiliation holds a majority in the country, adding up to over 150% of the total population, even before counting the other denominations. One of the rare things that most Lebanese religious leaders <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> on is to avoid a new general census, for fear that it could trigger a new round of denominational conflict.

25|$|DNA {{sequencing}} theories often {{invoke the}} assumption that certain random variables in a model are independent and identically distributed. For example, in Lander–Waterman Theory, a sequenced fragment is presumed {{to have the same}} probability of covering each region of a genome and all fragments are assumed to be independent of one another. In actuality, sequencing projects are subject to various types of bias, including differences of how well regions can be cloned, sequencing anomalies, biases in the target sequence (which is not random), and software-dependent errors and biases. In general, theory <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> well with observation up to the point that enough data have been generated to expose latent biases. The kinds of biases related to the underlying target sequence are particularly difficult to model, since the sequence itself may not be known a priori. This presents a type of Catch-22 (logic) problem.|$|E

Jaquino leaves, and Marzelline expresses her desire to become Fidelio's wife (O wär ich schon mit dir vereint—"If only I were already united with thee"). Rocco enters, looking for Fidelio, who then enters carrying a heavy load of newly-repaired chains. Rocco compliments Fidelio, and misinterprets her modest reply as hidden attraction to his daughter. Marzelline, Fidelio, Rocco, and Jaquino sing a quartet about the love Marzelline has for Fidelio (Mir ist so wunderbar—"A wondrous feeling fills me", also known as the Canon Quartet).|$|E
25|$|For {{experimental}} physics, hotness means that, {{when comparing}} any two given bodies {{in their respective}} separate thermodynamic equilibria, any two suitably given empirical thermometers with numerical scale readings <b>will</b> <b>agree</b> as to which is the hotter of the two given bodies, or {{that they have the}} same temperature. This does not require the two thermometers to have a linear relation between their numerical scale readings, but it does require that the relation between their numerical readings shall be strictly monotonic. A definite sense of greater hotness can be had, independently of calorimetry, of thermodynamics, and of properties of particular materials, from Wien's displacement law of thermal radiation: the temperature of a bath of thermal radiation is proportional, by a universal constant, to the frequency of the maximum of its frequency spectrum; this frequency is always positive, but can have values that tend to zero. Thermal radiation is initially defined for a cavity in thermodynamic equilibrium. These physical facts justify a mathematical statement that hotness exists on an ordered one-dimensional manifold. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers for bodies in their own thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
