5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local recipe from France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Nero's predecessor, Claudius, was {{allegedly}} poisoned <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms</b> or alternatively poison herbs. However, {{accounts of the}} way Claudius died vary greatly. Halotus, his taster, Gaius Stertinius Xenophon, his doctor, and the infamous poisoner Locusta have all been accused of possibly being the administrator of the fatal substance, but Agrippina, his final wife, {{is considered to be}} the most likely to have arranged his murder and may have even administered the poison herself. Some report that he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at his evening meal, while some say that he recovered somewhat, only to be poisoned once more by a feather dipped in poison which was pushed down his throat under the pretense of helping him to vomit, or by poisoned gruel or an enema. Agrippina is considered to be the murderer, because she was ambitious for her son, Nero, and Claudius had become suspicious of her intrigues.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms.</b> Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E

5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of clear undergrowth or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms</b> should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|E
5|$|Many {{mushroom}} {{species are}} poisonous to humans, with toxicities ranging from slight digestive problems or allergic reactions {{as well as}} hallucinations to severe organ failures and death. Genera <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms</b> containing deadly toxins include Conocybe, Galerina, Lepiota, and, the most infamous, Amanita. The latter genus includes the destroying angel (A.virosa) and the death cap (A.phalloides), {{the most common cause}} of deadly mushroom poisoning. The false morel (Gyromitra esculenta) is occasionally considered a delicacy when cooked, yet can be highly toxic when eaten raw. Tricholoma equestre was considered edible until it was implicated in serious poisonings causing rhabdomyolysis. Fly agaric mushrooms (Amanita muscaria) also cause occasional non-fatal poisonings, mostly as a result of ingestion for its hallucinogenic properties. Historically, fly agaric was used by different peoples in Europe and Asia and its present usage for religious or shamanic purposes is reported from some ethnic groups such as the Koryak people of north-eastern Siberia.|$|E

500|$|Mushroom ketchup is a {{style of}} ketchup (also spelled [...] "catsup") that is {{prepared}} <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms</b> as its primary ingredient. Originally, ketchup in the United Kingdom was prepared <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms</b> as a primary ingredient, instead of tomato, the [...] main ingredient in contemporary preparations of ketchup. Historical preparations involved packing whole mushrooms into containers with salt. It {{is used as a}} condiment and may be used as an ingredient in the preparation of other sauces and other condiments. Several brands of mushroom ketchup were produced and marketed in the United Kingdom, some of which were exported to the United States, and Geo Watkins Mushroom Ketchup continues to exist in contemporary times as a commercially mass-produced product.|$|E

500|$|The first {{reliably}} documented {{report of}} Psilocybe semilanceata intoxication involved a British family in 1799, who prepared a meal <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms</b> they had picked in London's Green Park. According to the chemist Augustus Everard Brande, {{the father and}} his four children experienced typical symptoms associated with ingestion, including pupil dilation, spontaneous laughter and delirium. The identification of the species responsible {{was made possible by}} James Sowerby's 1803 book Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms, which included a description of the fungus, then known as Agaricus glutinosus (originally described by Moses Ashley Curtis in 1780). According to German mycologist Jochen Gartz, the description of the species is [...] "fully compatible with current knowledge about Psilocybe semilanceata." ...|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, ketchup was {{historically}} made <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms</b> as {{a primary}} ingredient. The result was {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "mushroom ketchup". In contemporary times, ketchup's primary ingredient is typically tomato. Mushroom ketchup appears to have originated in Great Britain. In the United States, mushroom ketchup dates back to at least 1770 in English-speaking colonies in North America. A manuscript cookbook from Charleston, South Carolina that was written in 1770 by Harriott Pinckney Horry documented a mushroom ketchup that used two egg whites to clarify the mixture. This manuscript also contained a recipe for walnut ketchup. Richard Briggs's The English Art of Cookery, first published in 1788, has recipes for both mushroom ketchup and walnut ketchup.|$|E
500|$|Although {{dozens of}} species of {{psychedelic}} mushrooms {{are found in}} Europe, there is little documented usage of these species in Old World history besides the use of Amanita muscaria among Siberian peoples. The few existing historical accounts about psilocybin mushrooms typically lack sufficient information to allow species identification, and usually refer {{to the nature of}} their effects. For example, Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius (1526–1609) described the bolond gomba (crazy mushroom), used in rural Hungary to prepare love potions. English botanist John Parkinson included details about a [...] "foolish mushroom" [...] in his 1640 herbal Theatricum Botanicum. The first reliably documented report of intoxication with Psilocybe semilanceata—Europe's most common and widespread psychedelic mushroom—involved a British family in 1799, who prepared a meal <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms</b> they had picked in London's Green Park.|$|E

He called a macaroni gratin <b>with</b> <b>mushrooms</b> and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese [...] "fantastic" [...] and said that an apple crumble was [...] "awesome". Mark Bollard, in his review of the restaurant for the Evening Standard in 2009, was not expecting much from the restaurant. However, he called his Caesar salad starter a [...] "revelation" [...] and said that the chocolate brownie was [...] "dense, dark and rich". Although he was disappointed with the polenta chips, he said overall that the food was [...] "utterly sublime" [...] and he suggested that Ramsay should expand the concept to railway stations across London. In 2012, John Walsh wrote about Jamie Oliver's restaurant at Gatwick Airport, saying that Ramsay's Plane Food had [...] "pioneered the concept of non-revolting airport food".|$|E
