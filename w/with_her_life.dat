5|$|Wollstonecraft's ideas became {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>life</b> {{story and}} women writers {{felt that it}} was dangerous to mention her in their texts.

Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial {{to the development of the}} nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.|$|E

When she returns, Nick accepts her and they reunite. However, a man named Cameron Kirsten (Linden Ashby) who physically abused her (after having an affair with her) followed Sharon to Genoa City, wanting to bed her again.

Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal.
