5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1936, the US27/M-78 routing through Lansing was split into two. The {{mainline}} <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> cars only and moved to run along Capitol Avenue. The former routing <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> trucks only and designated as a truck route. In 1950, the bridge for Main Street over the Grand River was completed and mainline US27/M-78 was rerouted {{to use it to}} connect to Larch Street. From there north, US27/M-78 followed Larch Street supplanting the truck route, which was decommissioned at that time.|$|E

5|$|During the Principate, {{recruitment}} {{into the}} legions <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> Roman citizens only.

5|$|Engel was {{the fastest}} driver {{who was not}} issued with a penalty to not qualify within the top ten; his fastest time was eight-tenths of a second slower than Piquet's pole {{position}} lap. He was more than one-tenth of a second faster than 13th-placed qualifier Félix da Costa, who in turn, was nearly four-tenths ahead of débutant Carroll. The three drivers were followed by Sarrazin in 15th, and Evans in 16th; the latter struggled with cold brakes and tyres which prevented him from going faster. Ma's left-rear quarter was damaged when he contacted the barriers lining the circuit and qualified 17th. Jérôme d'Ambrosio struggled and <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> starting behind Ma. Di Grassi pushed hard and made a mistake at the chicane, making contact with the wall, and his front-left quarter was damaged, triggering red-flag conditions with three minutes left of the second group's running. He <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> starting 19th. Frijns completed the field and caused qualifying to be temporarily stopped when his car went airborne after hitting the kerbs at the chicane and collided with the barrier.|$|E
5|$|For the Europe/Africa Zone Group I tie against Serbia and Montenegro, Murray {{had been}} {{suffering}} with a bacterial infection, so he <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> playing the doubles alongside Greg Rusedski, which they lost.

5|$|The {{change to}} Best in Show was {{considered}} by the press to be of little significance and was not promoted by Charles Cruft, and did not require a dog to have won its Best of Breed class until 1936.

40|$|I {{describe}} several computational complexity {{results for}} planning, {{some of which}} identify tractable planning problems. The model of planning, called &quot;propositional planning, &quot; is simple—conditions within operators are literals with no variables allowed. The different planning problems are defined by different restrictions on the preconditions and postconditions of operators. The main results are: Propositional planning is PSPACE-complete, even if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> two positive (nonnegated) preconditions and two postconditions, or if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> one postcondition (with any number of preconditions). It is NP-complete if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> positive postconditions, even if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> one precondition and one positive postcondition. It is tractable in a few restricted cases, {{one of which is}} if each operator <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> positive preconditions and one postcondition. The blocks-world problem, slightly modified, is a subproblem of this restricted planning problem. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{government}} of Tamaulipas, most of the damage in the state was in farmland and in residents' dwellings, primarily near Matamoros, Valle Hermoso, Reynosa and San Fernando. In Matamoros, part of the city lost power and running water; in Valle Hermoso, two schools were damaged; in Reynosa, 180people were evacuated from low-lying areas in five districts of the city, while in San Fernando, the main highway through the city was closed, and traffic on the bridge over the Conchos River <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> one lane.|$|E

5|$|After {{suffering}} a foot injury {{at the start}} of 1986–87, Gibbs <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> 18 appearances as his team finished the season 9th in the First Division. However, the departure of Graham Taylor and arrival of Dave Bassett the following season signalled a decline in the club's fortunes. Gibbs lost his place shortly before Bassett's departure in January, and although he soon returned to the side under Steve Harrison, Watford were relegated in 1988. At the time of the club's relegation, Gibbs had made precisely 100 First Division appearances.|$|E
5|$|As of 2004, hunting <b>was</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a few animals {{each year}} off the Caribbean island of Bequia {{in the nation}} of St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

The announcement sparked global protests. After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years {{it would take to}} reach a formal agreement.|$|E
