500|$|... "The Moth" [...] {{aired on}} November 3, 2004. The episode was {{directed}} by Jack Bender and written by Jennifer Johnson and Paul Dini. The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview <b>with</b> <b>Stuff</b> magazine in October 2005, saying, [...] " [...] brown sugar. You get some really sweet boogers. You have {{to be careful not to}} snort too much of it, but it's happened a few times. You just find dessert up your nose couple of hours later." ...|$|E
500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} began recording the final 30 minutes of Flight93 at 09:31:57. At this moment, it recorded Jarrah announcing, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen: here the captain. Please sit down, keep remaining seating. We have a bomb on board. So sit." [...] The controller understood the transmission, but chose to respond, [...] "Calling Cleveland center, you're unreadable. Say again, slowly." [...] The cockpit recording captured Dahl moaning and Jarrah telling him in English {{to sit down and}} to stop touching something (presumably the controls); Jason Dahl's wife, Sandy Dahl, listening to the cockpit {{voice recorder}}, determined that Jarrah [...] "was fussing at my husband...he was speaking in English, and he spoke Arabic anytime he was talking with the other hijackers. Jason made moaning sounds after that. It sounded like he was trying to mess <b>with</b> <b>stuff</b> or get up, because the hijacker pilot kept telling him to stop and to sit down." ...|$|E

500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{reported}} a 3% approval score {{and an average}} score of 3.4/10 based on 68 reviews. The website's consensus reads, [...] "Speed2 falls far short of its predecessor, thanks to laughable dialogue, thin characterization, unsurprisingly familiar plot devices, and action sequences that fail to generate any excitement." [...] Website Metacritic rated the film [...] "generally unfavorable" [...] based on 22 reviews, with an average score of 23/100. Time said that Patric's character was [...] "fundamentally uninteresting", but blamed De Bont and the screenwriters for [...] "not providing their actors <b>with</b> <b>stuff</b> to act". Many critics stated that a major issue with the film {{was the lack of}} thrills due to the setting on the slow-moving ship. Entertainment Weekly heavily criticized the lack of story and said the film is [...] "as slow-moving as a garbage scow". According to the Los Angeles Times, even children who saw the film felt it was strange that it took place on a ship [...] "not capable of going more than a few knots per hour [...] ", and claimed that Speed was [...] "much more logical".|$|E
500|$|... "No Surprises", {{recorded}} {{in a single}} take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' [...] "Wouldn't It Be Nice"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of Louis Armstrong's 1968 recording of [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] and the soul music of Marvin Gaye. Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo, then slowed the playback for Yorke to overdub his vocals onto, creating an [...] "ethereal" [...] effect. Yorke identified {{the subject of the}} song as [...] "someone who's trying hard to keep it together but can't". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, [...] "a heart that's full up like a landfill"; according to Yorke, the song is a [...] "fucked-up nursery rhyme" [...] that [...] "stems from my unhealthy obsession {{of what to do with}} plastic boxes and plastic bottles... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's how we deal, that's how I deal <b>with</b> <b>stuff,</b> I bury it." [...] The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, [...] "even when the subject is suicide... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Basilica of St. Ursula in Cologne {{holds the}} alleged relics of Ursula and her 11,000 companions.

[...] The Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber), a 17th-century chapel attached to the Basilica of St. Ursula, contains sculptures of their heads and torsos, [...] "some of the heads encased in silver, others covered <b>with</b> <b>stuff</b> of gold and caps of cloth of gold and velvet; loose bones thickly texture the upper walls." [...] The peculiarities of the relics themselves have thrown doubt upon the historicity of Ursula and her 11,000 maidens. When skeletons of little children ranging in age from two months to seven years were found buried with one of the sacred virgins in 1183, Hermann Joseph, a Praemonstratensian canon at Steinfeld, explained that they were distant relatives of the eleven thousand. A surgeon of eminence was once banished from Cologne for suggesting that, among the collection of bones which are said to pertain to the heads, there were several belonging to full-grown mastiffs. The relics may have come from a forgotten burial ground.|$|E
