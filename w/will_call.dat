5|$|When {{a player}} is {{found by the}} umpire to have {{delivered}} the ball contrary to those rules, the umpire <b>will</b> <b>call</b> a no ball and {{he is said to}} have been called for throwing. Where public opinion is that a player's bowling action appears to be that he routinely throws, he is said to have a 'suspect' or an 'illegal' action, or more derogatorily, is said to be a 'chucker'. The issue is often highly emotive with accusers considering that deliveries with an illegal action are akin to cheating.|$|E
5|$|As a {{birthday}} gift for Marge, Homer buys a blender designed by television chef Paula Paul. He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it. Homer is impressed by the store and {{says he will not}} be shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart any more. Apu, who is there to spy, overhears Homer and the two engage in a fight until the security guards grab hold of Apu and take him away. At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she <b>will</b> <b>call</b> Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the phone as she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E

5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost every {{play in a}} baseball game involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher <b>will</b> <b>call</b> for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E

25|$|If any {{of these}} rules is violated, an umpire <b>will</b> <b>call</b> the {{delivery}} a no ball. Additionally a player may not make any significant movement after the ball comes into play and before the ball reaches the striker. If this happens, an umpire <b>will</b> <b>call</b> and signal 'dead ball'. For close fielders anything other than minor adjustments to stance or position {{in relation to the}} striker is significant. In the outfield, fielders may move in towards the striker or striker's wicket; indeed, they usually do. However, anything other than slight movement off line or away from the striker is to be considered significant.|$|E

25|$|Vehicles {{then proceed}} from the Highway 34 {{entrance}} {{north to the}} main gate via Gate Road, a desert dirt road with a speed limit of 10mph. All vehicles driving into the city must have the appropriate vehicle pass, and all occupants are required to have valid ticket, {{in order to get}} in. Vehicles are also searched for any items that are prohibited in the city. For those who have their tickets held at <b>Will</b> <b>Call,</b> the booths are located between the Highway 34 entrance and the main gate. All tickets and vehicle passes must be bought in advance; they are not directly sold outside the gate or at the <b>Will</b> <b>Call</b> booths. Furthermore, unless they have a valid early arrival pass for the pre-event set up, any vehicle who arrives before the gate opens is turned away and told to go back to Reno, and not to wait {{along the side of the}} road on either Highways 34 or 447 (which would be a safety hazard), nor stay in Gerlach (and overcrowd the small town).|$|E

25|$|Doctor Stoppage/Cut: {{the referee}} <b>will</b> <b>call</b> {{for a time}} out if a fighter's ability to {{continue}} is in question {{as a result of}} apparent injuries, such as a large cut. The ring doctor will inspect the fighter and stop the match if the fighter is deemed unable to continue safely, rendering the opponent the winner. However, if the match is stopped {{as a result of an}} injury from illegal actions by the opponent, either a disqualification or no contest will be issued instead.|$|E
25|$|Calls are {{typically}} heard more frequently during the breeding season.

Some <b>will</b> <b>call</b> at night from their roosts. Frequency can vary between species and between individuals. One male brushland tinamou called every few minutes from dawn until dusk (over 500 calls daily). Some, in particular Crypturellus species, use regular call sites. Only a few possess an alarm call.|$|E

25|$|A bowler may {{attempt to}} run out a batsman who leaves his ground before he {{delivers}} the ball, but must do so before he reaches the point in his action when he would normally release the ball. It is unfair for batsmen to attempt to steal runs during the bowler's run-up. If they try the umpires will allow the bowler to attempt a run out. Should the bowler not attempt a run out then the umpires <b>will</b> <b>call</b> dead ball, return the batsmen to their previous ends and award a 5 run penalty to the fielding side.|$|E

25|$|AT Stadium, {{previously}} named Cowboys Stadium, is a domed stadium with a retractable roof in Arlington, Texas. After failed {{negotiations to}} build a new stadium {{on the site of the}} Cotton Bowl, Jerry Jones along with the city of Arlington, Texas a suburb of Fort Worth, funded the stadium at a cost of $1.3billion. The stadium is located in Tarrant County, the first time the Cowboys <b>will</b> <b>call</b> a stadium home outside of Dallas County. It was completed on May 29, 2009 and seats 80,000, but is expandable to seat up to 100,000. AT Stadium is the largest domed stadium in the world.|$|E
25|$|Regulated {{games are}} overseen by referees or marshals, who patrol {{the course to}} ensure {{enforcement}} of the rules {{and the safety of}} the players. If a player is marked with paint, they <b>will</b> <b>call</b> him out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the honor code; a broken ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this rule, such as requiring a tag to certain body locations only – such as the head and torso only. There are game rules that can be enforced depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance the fairness of the game or eliminate cheating.|$|E
25|$|The catcher {{is usually}} the first to notice the tendencies, quirks, and peculiarities of each home-plate umpire. Some umpires favor high strikes, pitched balls that are {{technically}} above the strike zone but appear, to the umpire, to be good. Conversely, some umpires <b>will</b> <b>call</b> low pitches strikes {{even when they are}} slightly below the knees. Other umpires have an inside bias or an outside bias; some umpires have more than one bias; some are uniformly lenient; some have very restricted notions of the strike zone, and the pitcher will constantly feel that his pitches are unfairly judged. The catcher can exploit an umpire's tendencies by taking him into account in how he chooses to receive the ball.|$|E
