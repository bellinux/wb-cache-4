40|$|SummaryDrilling {{operations}} {{are a significant}} cost {{in the process of}} recovering hydrocarbons. The {{operations are}} advanced and associated with large HSE and financial risks. The main objectives in a successful drilling operation are to construct safe and economically efficient wells, but the success also depends on hitting the target. As the drilling operation has very high standards of execution, a good drilling operation depends on a good well plan. The planning phase is a large and complex process as it engineers all aspects of a drilling operation. This is key to create safe and economically efficient wells. Well trajectory planning is a mixture of many parameters but in the end it comes down to identifying the most optimum well path. That means they should be based on exact mathematical calculation models, to precisely calculate well bore trajectories. The industry uses a number of different planning tools that makes it possible to calculate and plan complex well path trajectories. Very few studies have addressed this topic in a systematic manner. In this thesis, a large study has been made on the background of <b>well</b> <b>planning</b> and the <b>well</b> <b>planning</b> software s used in the industry today. The industry leader within <b>well</b> <b>planning</b> software is Halliburton Landmark s Compass. Compass {{has been used as a}} base study in this thesis. Work presented, has looked at three essential parts of the <b>well</b> <b>planning</b> software. 1. 	The Software Model 2. 	The Calculation Models 3. 	The FunctionsThe main objective of this thesis has been to identify the different calculation models used in these programs and to program suitable functions similar to those found in existing planning softwares, in an attempt to create a new and more user friendly <b>well</b> <b>planning</b> software. Also, there is not much in the literature or information supporting what the different software models do to create well paths so a better understanding of the engineering of 3 D well paths has been developed. A study was done to find/map different calculation methods that develop precise wellbore coordinates. A number of calculation models were found, but the bulk of these models is presented as models that are used to calculate already drilled wells. However, two new methods were identified. The method called Exact departures, Constant Turn Rate Method was found to give accurate results and is also the main calculation model found in the <b>well</b> <b>planning</b> softwares. This is the main calculation model used to support the functions presented in this thesis. The major part of the work presented in this thesis relates to the construction of precise and user friendly functions, that allow calculation of exact well paths. Using Compass as an offset to calibrate the programmed models, a substantial study has been done to understand and identify assumptions and how the presented functions work in Compass. The result is accurate program functions. The results show exact and accurate calculations - identical to compass. This thesis also presents the basics behind the operational phase, including surveying and anti-collision. Some work is left for further investigation. In the process of constructing a new <b>well</b> <b>planning</b> tool, a software or platform has to be programed to implement the functions presented in this thesis. Some of the functions presented also have some limitations that have to be finalized. Furthermore, more functions have to be developed, and programing of a plotting tool is also left for further work...|$|E

30|$|Pore {{pressure}} {{prediction is}} an essential part of wildcat <b>well</b> <b>planning.</b> In India, Tripura sub-basin is characterised by huge anticlines, normal faults and abnormally pressured formations. These factors push the wildcat <b>well</b> <b>planning</b> in this area into wide margin of uncertainty. Pore pressures were predicted from seismic velocities by using modified Eaton’s method over the synclinal and flank part of Atharamura to understand the pressure succession towards the anticline. These predicted pore pressures on the flank part lead to a reasonable match when plotted with offset well-measured pore pressures. To reduce the uncertainty, fracture pressures were established by various methods such as Hubbert and Willis method and Matthews and Kelly method from predicted pore pressures. But the fracture pressures were predicted with available horizontal stress correlations due to lack of Poisson’s ratio curve for the study area. The mud pressure required to drill the well is calculated using median line principle, and hence drilling mud window is established by assuming virtual tight conditions. The plot of equivalent circulation density versus depth suggests that well can be drilled with two casing policy. But it is found that adding one more casing pipe will ensure the safety of well. Casing pipes were designed on the basis of collapse pressure, burst pressure and tensile load. Finally, a well plan which includes pore pressure, fracture pressure, drilling mud policy, casing policy and kick tolerance graph were proposed to give clear picture on <b>well</b> <b>planning</b> on the top of the anticline in pore pressure point of view.|$|E
