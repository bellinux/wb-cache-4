5|$|Megalodon is now {{considered}} {{to be a member of}} the family Otodontidae, genus Carcharocles, as opposed to it previous classification into Lamnidae, genus Carcharodon. Megalodon's classification into Carcharodon was due to dental similarity with the great <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> but most authors currently believe that this is due to convergent evolution. In this model, the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> is more closely related to the shark Isurus hastalis than to megalodon, as evidenced by more similar dentition in those two sharks; megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> teeth. The great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> is more closely related to the mako shark (Isurus spp.), with a common ancestor around 4 mya. However, proponents of the former model, wherein megalodon and the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> are more closely related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure.|$|E
5|$|Prior to August 1981, {{no great}} <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> in captivity lived longer than 11 days. In August 1981, a <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> survived for 16 days at SeaWorld San Diego before being released. The idea of {{containing}} a live great white at SeaWorld Orlando {{was used in}} the 1983 film Jaws 3-D.|$|E
5|$|Sharks often employ complex hunting {{strategies}} to engage large prey animals. Great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> hunting strategies may {{be similar to}} how megalodon hunted its large prey. However, megalodon bite marks on whale fossils suggests that it employed different hunting strategies against large prey than the great <b>white</b> <b>shark.</b>|$|E
5|$|This shark's {{behavior}} and social structure {{is not well}} understood. In South Africa, <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females dominate males, larger sharks dominate smaller sharks, and residents dominate newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. <b>White</b> <b>sharks</b> rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other <b>white</b> <b>sharks.</b> This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> bite to show their dominance.|$|R

5|$|The great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> has {{no known}} natural predators other than, on very rare occasion, the killer whale. The great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> {{is arguably the}} world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, {{and is one of}} the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, {{including}} fish and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon, and is ranked first in having the most recorded shark bite incidents on humans. The IUCN list the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> as a vulnerable species, while it is included in AppendixII of CITES.|$|E
5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> may have up to five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} {{how much of a}} {{concurrent}} increase in fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> is now considered vulnerable. Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.|$|E

5|$|The {{narrative}} of Abzû is told wordlessly through gameplay and using cutscenes, {{taking place in}} a vast ocean. The player character, {{referred to as a}} female diver, awakens floating in the ocean and begins exploring the surrounding sea: ruins and ancient murals show that an ancient civilization which shared a symbiotic connection with the ocean. As she explores, she is led by a great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> to wells that—when activated using an energy from within her—restore life to the local seas. That energy is being forcefully harvested by pyramid-like devices, the development of which disrupted the ocean's balance and brought about the civilization's downfall. Upon reaching the original pyramid, the diver sees the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> attacking it, and the pyramid's counterattack damages the diver—revealing her to be mechanical and confirming her existence as a being connected to the pyramid and capable of restoring life to the ocean—and mortally wounds the great <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> which dies as the diver comforts it. After activating the final well, the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> manifests and guides the repaired diver back to the pyramid. The diver destroys the pyramid, causing life to return to the ocean. During the credits, the diver and great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> swim together through the revitalized ocean.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that other notable species of sharks, such as the great <b>white</b> <b>shark,</b> responded to competitive pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Australian {{government}} {{created the}} <b>White</b> <b>Shark</b> Recovery Plan, implementing government-mandated conservation research and monitoring for conservation {{in addition to}} federal protection and stronger regulation of shark-related trade and tourism activities. An updated recovery plan was published in 2013 to review progress, research findings, and to implement further conservation actions. A study in 2012 revealed that Australia's <b>White</b> <b>Shark</b> population was separated by Bass Strait into genetically distinct eastern and western populations, indicating a need {{for the development of}} regional conservation strategies.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. <b>White</b> <b>sharks</b> (Carcharodon carcharias) {{are widely}} distributed, ecologically {{important}} marine apex predators {{that are considered}} to be vulnerable to extinction. Given their crucial roles in structuring marine ecosystems, their populations need to be effectively monitored. Photo-identification provides a standardised, non-lethal method of assessing the population dynamics of extant species and provides live-encounter mark-recapture and data that are essential for management and conversation. <b>White</b> <b>sharks</b> occur throughout South African coastal waters but their centre of abundance is the Western Cape, where large sharks predominate at aggregation sites like Seal Island, False Bay. This study documents inter- and intra-seasonal trends in mean sighting rates and sex ratios of <b>white</b> <b>sharks</b> at Seal Island, and provides mark-recapture data that are used to estimate proportions of "resident" and "transient" <b>white</b> <b>sharks,</b> their size-distribution and maturity composition...|$|R

5|$|The genus Carcharocles {{currently}} contains four species: C. auriculatus, C. angustidens, C. chubutensis, and C. megalodon. The genus {{was proposed}} by D. S. Jordan and H. Hannibal in 1923 to contain C. auriculatus. In the 1980s, megalodon {{was assigned to}} Carcharocles. Before this, in 1960, the genus Procarcharodon was erected by French ichthyologist Edgard Casier, which included those four sharks and was considered separate from the great <b>white</b> <b>shark.</b> It is now considered a junior synonym of Carcharocles. The genus Palaeocarcharodon was erected alongside Procarcharodon to represent {{the beginning of the}} lineage, and, in the model wherein megalodon and the great <b>white</b> <b>shark</b> are closely related, their last common ancestor. However, it is believed to be an evolutionary dead-end and unrelated to the Carcharocles sharks by authors who reject that model.|$|E
