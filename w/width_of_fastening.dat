40|$|The {{intermittently}} rivet fastened Rectangular Hollow Flange Channel Beam (RHFCB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{hollow section}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} welded hollow flange beams. Many experimental and numerical studies have been carried out in the past to investigate the shear behaviour of lipped channel beams. However, no research has been undertaken on the shear behaviour <b>of</b> rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs. Therefore experimental and numerical studies were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength <b>of</b> rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs. In this research finite element models <b>of</b> rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs were developed to investigate their nonlinear shear behaviour including their buckling characteristics and ultimate shear strength. This paper presents the details of the finite element models <b>of</b> rivet <b>fastened</b> RHFCBs and the results.

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1831 in Zug as a {{hardware}} store by Franz Kaspar Bossard-Kolin. The earlier silk trading business inherited from his father-in-law was dissolved at the same time. The hardware store kept its local character roughly a century before the company expanded its business activity in the 1930s and 1940s to trading fasteners. The local specialized store first developed into a regional, and from the 1950s into a national, company. From the 1960s Bossard began {{to set up and}} expand an international network of bases. In the course of expansion, the company went public on the stock market in 1987. The recession {{at the beginning of the}} 1990s and the associated worsening business trend led Bossard to a review of the entire organization. In doing so the company focused on the core competence <b>of</b> <b>fastening</b> technology and the gradual selling off of all its tools, fittings and handicraft units. Bossard is active in the field <b>of</b> <b>fastening</b> technology in Europe, America and Asia. In November 2012, the Bossard group acquired the KVT Koenig Group’s range <b>of</b> <b>fastening</b> technology.|$|R
