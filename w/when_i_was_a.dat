25|$|Both the teepee and the oval-shaped {{house were}} used <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> boy. The oval hut {{was covered with}} hide and was the best house.

25|$|This is {{an opera}} for {{children}} because {{it tries to}} recapture my own childhood. You see, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child I lived in Italy, and in Italy we have no Santa Claus. I suppose that Santa Claus is much too busy with American children {{to be able to}} handle Italian children as well. Our gifts were brought to us by the Three Kings, instead.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kid, {{my father}} told me about an {{accident}} that happened while he was working on Grand Coulee Dam in Washington. (At the time, Grand Coulee Dam was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung out with it, and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Yates {{made his}} first film <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> Girl in Swindon. The film entered the festival circuit where it was named Best Short Film at the San Francisco International Film Festival, in {{addition}} to obtaining other awards. It contributed to Yates' acceptance into the National Film and Television School in 1989 {{and led to the}} BBC hiring him to direct Oranges and Lemons, a short drama film in 1991. Before completing film school, he began to direct, produce and write the screenplay to the dramatic short The Weaver's Wife. He also made his fourth short film Good Looks, which was presented at the Chicago International Film Festival. After graduating in 1992, Yates directed an episode of the film studies programme Moving Pictures.|$|E

25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E
25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

500|$|I {{loved the}} play; I saw its {{original}} production <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> teenager so I really worked hard {{on it and}} tried to dispel any prejudices that might be there.

He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: [...] "I recalled the places I had seen with my mother <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little boy—the mountaintop Buddhist retreats. There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again—just as my mother had taught me. The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me." ...|$|E

[...] Davis {{said that the}} song's concept deals with his childhood, saying [...] "People think 'Daddy' was written because my father abused me, but that's not what the song's about. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kid, I was being abused by someone else. I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song." [...] Some 14 minutes into [...] "Daddy"—well after the song has ended—a hidden track begins to play.

500|$|My mind {{rejects the}} whole present social order and Christianity—home, the {{recognised}} virtues, classes {{of life and}} religious doctrines.

We give several constraints on the behavior of what may be termed the regularity defect (the sequence e_m = I^m - dm). <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>is</b> -primary we give a family of bounds on the first differences of the e_m, including an upper bound on the increasing part of the sequence; for example, we show that the e_i cannot increase for <b>i</b> ≥(S). <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> monomial ideal, we show that the e_i become constant for i ≥ n(n- 1) (d- 1), where n = (S).
