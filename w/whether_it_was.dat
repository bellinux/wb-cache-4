5|$|Historically, the {{terrestrial}} locomotion of Pteranodon, especially <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> bipedal or quadrupedal, {{has been the}} subject of debate. Today, most pterosaur researchers agree that pterosaurs were quadrupedal, thanks largely to the discovery of pterosaur trackways.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Supreme Court {{continued}} {{hearings on}} the PLI case about the statues.

5|$|Lead vocalist Nivek Ogre {{said the}} band took a {{simplified}} approach, {{but that it}} was a difficult record to make. It charted on a number of billboard charts, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics focusing on <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stylistically similar to previous albums.|$|E
5|$|The white Schnauzer {{is one of}} four color {{varieties}} of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation: <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two Schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the AMSC chooses not to recognize white.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} issues {{concerning}} the locomotory abilities of Tyrannosaurus: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been. Both {{are relevant to the}} debate about <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a hunter or a scavenger.|$|E
50|$|The Death Penalty: Opposing Viewpoints {{is a book}} in the Opposing Viewpoints series. It {{presents}} {{selections of}} contrasting viewpoints on the death penalty: first surveying centuries of debate on it; then questioning <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just; <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an effective deterrent; and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> applied fairly. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> edited by Mary E.

5|$|Along {{with the}} arcade, the other main draw for the centers since the {{beginning}} was its animatronic show, until the mid-1990s. More recently, less attention {{has been placed on}} animatronics.

5|$|Although {{some debate}} remains <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{six or seven}} championships held at one time, the {{contracts}} of Broken Matt (Hardy) and Brother Nero (Jeff Hardy) expired with TNA Wrestling on February 27, 2017 at midnight after negotiations were stalled by the company. Having previously filmed television weeks in advance, in storylines Matt and Jeff remained the TNA Tag Team Champions as their contracts expired. They offered to drop the titles the following week on {{the next set of}} television tapings but TNA's new parent company, Anthem, declined.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{regards the}} main influences {{at play in}} the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> inspired more by the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.|$|E

5|$|Democratic {{committee}} member John Conyers questioned <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{appropriate for the}} comedian to appear before Congress {{and asked him to}} leave the hearing.

5|$|Despite its popularization {{in later}} times, the phrase is not {{recorded}} elsewhere in Roman history. Historians question <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> ever {{used as a}} customary salute. It was more likely an isolated appeal by desperate captives and criminals condemned to die, and noted by Roman historians in part for the unusual mass reprieve granted by Claudius to the survivors.|$|E
5|$|HIP 78530 b is {{most likely}} a brown dwarf, a massive object that {{is large enough to}} fuse {{deuterium}} (something that planets are too small to do) but not large enough to ignite and become a star. Because HIP 78530 b's characteristics blend the line between {{whether or not it is}} a brown dwarf or a planet, astronomers have tried to determine what HIP 78530 b is by predicting <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> created in a planet-like or star-like (how brown dwarves are formed) manner.|$|E

5|$|In July 2011, the BBC TV {{programme}} Fake or Fortune investigated {{a copy of}} Dirck van Baburen's The Procuress {{owned by}} the Courtauld Institute. Opinion had been divided as to <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a 17th-century studio work or a van Meegeren fake. The programme used chemical analysis of the paint {{to show that it}} contained bakelite and thus confirmed that the painting was a 20th-century fake.|$|E
5|$|In his films, {{the common}} man exaggerations continued. Much {{of his time in}} the films was spent {{spoofing}} himself, <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the affected nervousness of the treasurer in The Treasurer's Report or the discomfort in explaining The Sex Life of the Polyp to a women's club. The longer, plot-driven shorts, such as Lesson Number One, Furnace Trouble, and Stewed, Fried and Boiled, likewise show a Benchley character overmatched by seemingly mundane tasks. Even the more stereotypical characters held these qualities, such as the incapable sportscaster Benchley played in The Sport Parade.|$|E
5|$|Numismatic author Dean Albanese {{considers}} the legend that Washington provided the gold {{for the first}} 400 eagles to be improbable; holding $4,000 in coin would have tied up much of Washington's capital in unproductive cash. Albanese suggests that as many surviving 1795 eagles are found with little wear, Washington may have had the government purchase pieces to give to dignitaries. By some reports, one eagle was presented to Washington, though <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> from this first coinage is uncertain.|$|E
50|$|The Supreme Courts of {{the states}} and territories are {{superior}} courts of record with general and unlimited jurisdiction within their own state or territory.

5|$|On {{his return}} trip to Vermont with Schaeffer on June 16, they stopped in Philadelphia {{to meet with}} new Saturday Evening Post editor Ben Hibbs. Many {{accounts}} portray this visit as unplanned, but <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> is unclear. Hibbs liked Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches, and he gave Rockwell two months to complete the works. A June 24 correspondence from The Post clarified that both Rockwell's and Schaeffer's series would be published. By June 26, The Posts art editor James Yates notified Rockwell of plans for a layout of paintings with an accompanying essay or accompanying essays by President Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|Outside Europe, {{women were}} able to dress as men and go undetected. Deborah Sampson fought in the American Revolution as a man named Robert Shurtlieff, and pursued {{relationships}} with women. Edward De Lacy Evans was born female in Ireland, but took a male name during the voyage to Australia and lived as a man for 23 years in Victoria, marrying three times. Percy Redwood created a scandal in New Zealand in 1909 when he {{was found to be}} Amy Bock, who had married a woman from Port Molyneaux; newspapers argued <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a sign of insanity or an inherent character flaw.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
