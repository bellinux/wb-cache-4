500|$|Interpretations of the song's meaning {{vary from}} one {{listener}} to the next; some people {{view it as}} a song about love and desire, while others understand it as a political metaphor, the lyrics being addressed as much to the Chinese nation as to a girlfriend. University of Florida scholar Jonathan Matusitz describes the song's lyrics as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that could not be stated through any other medium. In this interpretation, the lyrics near the beginning, [...] "I've asked you without end / When <b>will</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> with me / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to my name" [...] ("") are taken to express the [...] "humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal freedom", the [...] "sense of loss and disorientation" [...] among China's youth in the 1980s. Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as [...] "recast the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole." [...] The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase yī wú suŏ yŏu, an idiomatic chengyu. It literally means [...] "to have nothing" [...] and has no grammatical subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as meaning [...] "I have nothing" [...] (implying that it is a song about two people), or [...] "we have nothing" [...] (understanding it as social commentary).|$|E
500|$|On August 7, 2007, [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain" [...] was {{released}} {{as part of}} The Simpsons— The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set. Mike Scully, Matt Selman, Ron Hauge, Rich Appel, Marc Wilmore and Pete Michels participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode. Following its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. Giving the episode a positive review, DVD Town's James Plath described {{it as one of}} the season's better episodes. Ian Jane of DVD Talk wrote that, while episodes that revolve around Lisa tend to be [...] "less popular" [...] than others, he considered [...] "They Saved Lisa's Brain" [...] to be [...] "well done". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a mixed review, writing [...] "I like the fact that 'Brain' pokes some fun at Mensa, one of the more smug, self-congratulatory groups to be found. The show manages a few good laughs as it goes after various pretensions." [...] However, he added that [...] "the show peters out after a while", and that it [...] "never becomes particularly memorable". A reviewer for Currentfilm.com wrote that, while the episode [...] "isn't without its charms", it [...] "just don't hold up very well". Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News wrote that the episode is [...] "great if you think palindromes are funny", and added {{that it was one of}} the season's worst episodes. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide described it as a [...] "retread" [...] of the season 9 episode [...] "Lisa the Simpson". They wrote [...] "Once we're past the How Low <b>Will</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> show, the episode takes a nose-dive until the last few minutes." [...] They concluded their review by calling the episode [...] "Very, very tedious." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Ahab confronts Elijah, {{he refers}} {{to him as the}} [...] "troubler of Israel." [...] Elijah {{responds}} by throwing the charge back at Ahab, saying that it is Ahab who has troubled Israel by allowing the worship of false gods. Elijah then berates both the people of Israel and Ahab for their acquiescence in Baal worship. [...] "How long <b>will</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him." [...] And the people were silent. The Hebrew for this word, [...] "go limping" [...] or [...] "waver", is the same as that used for [...] "danced" [...] in verse 26, where the prophets of Baal frantically dance. Elijah speaks with sharp irony: in the religious ambivalence of Israel, he is portraying here as engaging in a wild and futile religious [...] "dance".|$|E
