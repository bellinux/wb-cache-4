5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E

In 1996, GCC published a report entitled Global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> extreme weather: fact vs. fiction written by Robert E. Davis.|$|E
5|$|Increased {{precipitation}} {{during the}} Tauca phase was probably {{triggered by the}} southern movement of the ITCZ and the strengthening of the South America monsoon, possibly caused by chilling in the northern hemisphere. Combined with a southern shift of high pressure zones, increased moisture during late glacial times would have flowed from the Amazon. This change, which occurred from 17,400–12,400 years or 18,000–11,000 BP, is recorded in Bolivian Chaco and Brazilian cave records. The Tauca phase may have been triggered by the southern shift of tropical atmospheric circulation. Although another theory posits that vegetation changes and lake development would have decreased the albedo of the Altiplano, resulting in <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> moisture advection of moisture towards the Altiplano, but such positive feedback mechanisms were considered questionable in a 1998 study. Persistent La Niña climatic conditions {{may have contributed to}} the lake's filling. Conversely, a global climatic <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> a northward shift of the monsoon occurred around 14,500 years ago. The ideal conditions for the development of paleolakes in the Altiplano do not appear to exist during maximum glaciation or warm interglacial periods.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed at the Brazilian move, Argentina and Chile quickly nullified their 1902 pact {{and sought}} dreadnoughts of their own. Argentina's orders, after a {{drawn-out}} bidding process, {{went to an}} American company, Fore River Shipbuilding Company, while Chile's orders, delayed by the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake, went to Armstrong. Since Brazil's relations with Argentina were <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> the country's economic boom was losing steam, the government negotiated with Armstrong to remove the third dreadnought from the contract, but without success. They borrowed the necessary money, and Armstrong laid down Rio de Janeiros keel in March 1910.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not a true}} coral, Millepora alcicornis {{is subject}} to the same general threats that corals and coral reefs are facing. The {{greatest}} of these is global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> the consequent rise in sea temperatures. Millepora alcicornis {{is one of the first}} corals to show bleaching as the symbiont zooxanthellae are killed. However, it is also more resilient than most and becomes re-established by recruitment earlier than the scleractinian corals. Other general threats to reefs include ocean acidification, pollution, sedimentation, invasive species and other changes in species dynamics, coral diseases, fisheries, leisure activities and tourism. Small quantities of Millepora alcicornis are gathered for sale to collectors.|$|E
5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude non-tropical cyclone. However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> increased hurricane activity.|$|E

Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park is {{dominated}} by mountains which were carved into their present shapes by the huge glaciers of the last ice age. These glaciers have largely disappeared over the last 12,000 years. Evidence of widespread glacial action is found throughout the park {{in the form of}} U-shaped valleys, cirques, arêtes, and large outflow lakes radiating like fingers {{from the base of the}} highest peaks. Since the end of the ice ages, various <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> cooling trends have occurred. The last recent cooling trend was during the Little Ice Age, which took place approximately between 1550 and 1850. During the Little Ice Age, the glaciers in the park expanded and advanced, although to nowhere near as great an extent as they had during the Ice Age.|$|E

It was found in locations with a mean temperature ranging from , with a total range of , indicating that the global extent of suitable habitat should not have been greatly affected by the temperature changes that occurred.|$|E

The film grossed $24 million in the U.S. and $26 million at the international box office, becoming the tenth highest grossing documentary film to date in the United States. Since the film's release, An Inconvenient Truth has been credited for raising international public awareness of global <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> reenergizing the environmental movement.

5|$|The {{cannibalism}} of {{the frog}} {{has been speculated}} to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other postulated causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due to {{the hole in the}} ozone layer, global <b>warming,</b> <b>and</b> increased drought. The first theory was tested and the results were inconclusive. Global warming is not thought to be a credible cause, as the extremities of the frog's range have not changed, while declines in population have occurred in both dry and wetter areas.|$|E

5|$|The early Archaic {{people living}} near Mesa Verde {{utilized}} the atlatl and harvested {{a wider variety}} of plants and animals than the Paleo-Indians had, while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle.

Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa Verde, whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled with spring rains, provided relatively plentiful amounts of water.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} {{a tropical}} storm, Blanca had already developed an eye-feature, though it {{not expected to}} develop into a hurricane. The storm maintained a general northwestward track throughout its existence due to a mid-level ridge well {{to the west of}} the circulation. Shortly after, a central dense overcast, a large area of deep convection, developed over the center of circulation and large banding features developed along the periphery of the cyclone. Late on July6, Blanca reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg). Although the storm had intensified, its overall structure had deteriorated, with cloud tops <b>warming</b> <b>and</b> convection shrinking.|$|E
