500|$|The cost of {{construction}} aggregate in Afghanistan is high (around $250 to $650 per cubic metre) because {{of security and}} transport costs, therefore Foley attempted to minimise its use. [...] A series of trials using various foundation systems was carried out at Camp Bastion to assess the capacity of a geosynthetic cell system called Neoweb. [...] Neoweb is supplied flat but unfolds to form a hollow honeycomb structure that can be backfilled with aggregate and overlain with a <b>wearing</b> <b>course.</b> [...] The specification of Neoweb allowed a 75percent reduction in aggregate and a two-thirds cost saving compared to traditional road-building methods. [...] The Neoweb layer acts as a semi-rigid slab foundation and is designed to allow the surfacing layer to hold together under heavy vehicles and in harsh weather.

50|$|The <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> is {{the upper}} layer in roadway, airfield, and {{dockyard}} construction. The term 'surface course' is sometimes used, however this term is slightly different {{as it can}} be used to describe very thin surface layers such as chip seal. In rigid pavements the upper layer is a portland cement concrete slab. In flexible pavements, the upper layer consists of asphalt concrete, that is a construction aggregate with a bituminous binder. The <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> is typically placed on the binder coarse which is then laid on the base course, which is normally placed on the subbase, which rests on the subgrade. There are various different types of flexible pavement <b>wearing</b> <b>course,</b> suitable for different situations. Stone mastic asphalt is a type of flexible pavement <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> which is typically used for heavily trafficked roads.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the basic}} safety {{requirements}} on roadways is the skid resistance. It plays very important role especially during wet and rainy conditions. It is a pavement surface characterization which describes interaction between vehicle wheel and road surface. Mainly insufficient skid resistance or its complete loss is a reason of slippery roads and therefore risk of traffic accidents rises.

50|$|The runway <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> {{is made of}} in-situ gravel material. Most of {{the runway}} surface is covered in silt and {{overgrown}} with grass. The underlying rock layer has been exposed on approximately 20% of the entire runway surface. The landing strip was the hub for UN and operations during 1993-1996 but had fallen into despair since then, however local NGOs are planning to renovate and rebuild it.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{pavement}} surfaces - Portland cement concrete (PCC) and hot-mix asphalt (HMA). Underneath this <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> are material layers that give structural support for the pavement system. These underlying surfaces may include either the aggregate base and subbase layers, or treated base and subbase layers, and additionally the underlying natural or treated subgrade. These treated layers may be cement-treated, asphalt-treated, or lime-treated for additional support.|$|E

40|$|In many countries, where studded tyres are prohibited, {{the traffic}} {{polishing}} of the coarse aggregate in the <b>wearing</b> <b>courses</b> {{is a problem}} to a rather great extent. In those countries there are often regulations on the aggregate polishing value. In Sweden, where the use of studded tyres is extensive, the micro texture of the aggregate in {{the surface of the}} <b>wearing</b> <b>courses</b> increases during the winter season. Therefore, there have been few problems with low wet friction levels in Sweden. However, the increased use of wear resistant aggregates and stone mastic asphalt together with lightweight studs has led to a reduced amount of wear. During later years, a problem with low friction levels has been noticed in <b>wear</b> resistant surface <b>courses</b> during late summer and fall, especially at high trafficked roads with a complicated geometry. Measurements have shown that the friction level can be reduced rather quickly on surfaces with aggregates that are disposed for polishing and low wet friction related accidents have been reported. This report is a knowledge survey covering polishing, friction and to some extent surface texture and wear caused by studded tyres. Experiences from friction measurements mainly in Stockholm and Gothenburg have been compiled in this report. A review of testing methods and existing requirements is also presented in the report. Friction measurements have been carried out with two friction measurement equipments, SAAB Friction Tester and BV 12, where the measuring speed, time of the year, the amount of water film thickness, the type of tyre and tyre pressure have been varied...|$|R

Rutting was found in five of the six taxilanes and one of the six taxiways. Plastic deformation of the asphalt <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> was observed near the takeoff position of the runway. However, the investigators noted that plastic deformation at this location was a common phenomenon and only routine maintenance was required to repair the distress. Aside from this surface distortion, both runways were in good structural condition.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} a subbase course, the base course is {{constructed}} directly above this layer. Otherwise, it is built directly {{on top of the}} subgrade. Typical base course thickness ranges from 4 to 6 in and is governed by underlying layer properties. Generally consisting of a specific type of construction aggregate, it is placed by means of attentive spreading and compacting to a minimum of 95% relative compaction, thus providing the stable foundation needed to support either additional layers of aggregates or the placement of an asphalt concrete <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> which is applied directly on top of the base course.|$|E

In the light of the above, Authors introduced the first results carried out from a two-year monitoring of an experimental road section.

50|$|Polymer {{concrete}} may be {{used for}} new construction or repairing of old concrete. The adhesive properties of polymer concrete allow repair of both polymer and conventional cement-based concretes. The low permeability and corrosive resistance of polymer concrete allows it to be used in swimming pools, sewer structure applications, drainage channels, electrolytic cells for base metal recovery, and other structures that contain liquids or corrosive chemicals. It is especially suited to the construction and rehabilitation of manholes due to their ability to withstand toxic and corrosive sewer gases and bacteria commonly found in sewer systems. Unlike traditional concrete structures, polymer concrete requires no coating or welding of PVC-protected seams. It can also be used as a bonded <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> for asphalt pavement, for higher durability and higher strength upon a concrete substrate.|$|E

50|$|With {{a view to}} {{assessing}} the potential use of kimberlite tailings in road works, the Central Road Research Institute engaged in a detailed laboratory study. Kimberlite tailings were characterized to determine their physical engineering properties. Results indicate that kimberlite tailings are a marginal material and possess adequate strength {{for use in the}} construction of rural roads. The feasibility of utilizing this material for the construction of various layers of road pavement by adopting stabilization techniques was investigated. A study was also undertaken to assess the suitability of this material for use in bituminous mixes. The laboratory studies indicate that kimberlite tailings can be used in subbase and base course layers in a road pavement. They can also be used in bituminous macadam as the base course and in premix carpet as a <b>wearing</b> <b>course.</b> A 1-km-long road was constructed near the diamond mine using kimberlite tailings, and its performance was monitored during a period of 1 full year.
