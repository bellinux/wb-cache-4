5|$|After {{performing}} {{in a number}} of heavy metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai's album Sex & Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> in the music industry, and vented his anger on the solo album Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records.|$|E
5|$|Cicero {{decided to}} stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a time, during which he perused Atticus's library, reading any and all books that dealt with {{overcoming}} grief. Unsatisfied with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>found,</b> he relocated to his villa at Astura, where he composed the Consolatio. It was during this time that he also wrote the famed—and now lost—dialogue Hortensius. Cicero later opined that the Consolatio was written in an attempt not only to heal himself emotionally, but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Pei {{boarded a}} boat and sailed to San Francisco, then {{traveled}} by train to Philadelphia. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>found,</b> however, differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the Beaux-Arts style, rooted in the classical traditions of Greece and Rome. Pei was more intrigued by modern architecture, and also felt intimidated by {{the high level of}} drafting proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> to be fallacious descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of that year, the German anarchist Augustin Souchy was invited by the Castro {{government}} to survey the agrarian sector. He was not impressed with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>found,</b> and declared in his pamphlet Testimonios sobre la Revolución Cubana that the system {{was too close to}} the Soviet model. Three days after Souchy departed Cuba, the entire print run was seized by the government, and destroyed. However, an Argentinian anarchist publisher republished the pamphlet the following December. Around the same time, the ALC, alarmed at the movement of the Castro government towards a Marxist–Leninist form of rule, issued a declaration, under the name Grupo de Sindicalistas Libertarios to prevent reaction against the ALC's membership. The document declared opposition to the centralism, authoritarian tendencies, and militarism of the new government. After a denunciation of the document by the Secretary General of the Partido Comunista Cubano (PCC), anarchists failed in their search for a printer who would publish a reaction to the denunciation. The publication El Libertario published its last edition that summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain had}} to record his survey in {{painstaking}} paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log {{as well as}} detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he saw. He made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E

At the age of 24, Hōnen then went to study at the city of Saga, then Nara, and stayed at such temples at Kōfuku-ji and Tōdai-ji. Still not satisfied, he returned to the libraries of Mt. Hiei and studied further.|$|E
25|$|With the Capitulations of Santa Fe, the Crown of Castile granted {{expansive}} {{power to}} Christopher Columbus, including exploration, settlement, political power, and revenues, with sovereignty reserved to the Crown. The first voyage established sovereignty for the crown, and the crown acted {{on the assumption}} that Columbus's grandiose assessment of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> was true, so Spain negotiated the Treaty of Tordesillas with Portugal to protect their territory on the Spanish side of the line. The crown fairly quickly reassessed its relationship with Columbus and moved to assert more direct crown control over the territory and extinguish his privileges. With that lesson learned, the crown was far more prudent in the specifying the terms of exploration, conquest, and settlement in new areas.|$|E

25|$|Huygens had experimented in 1672 {{with double}} {{refraction}} (birefringence) in Icelandic spar (calcite), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by Rasmus Bartholin. At first {{he could not}} elucidate <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>found.</b> He later explained it with his wave front theory and concept of evolutes. He also developed ideas on caustics. Newton in his Opticks of 1704 proposed instead a corpuscular theory of light. The theory of Huygens was not accepted, by some, because longitudinal waves cannot show birefringence. The interference experiments of Thomas Young vindicated a wave theory in 1801: the results could not be explained with light particles. The {{solution to the problem}} Huygens had faced was then resolved by a transverse wave theory. For a view from modern physics see wave–particle duality.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many others}} who devoted their life to {{commercial}} art {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, Denis McLoughlin was never paid a great deal for his work. Many pieces of his artwork, the Boardman book covers in particular, which Denis had been promised would be returned to him, were either lost or ended up in private collections. While he made a living, Denis never accumulated much money. Although he had a pension from the British government, he was forced to augment his income by working long past retirement age. He once commented that he never particularly liked illustrating military topics and yet that is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> himself doing for the last 20 years of his life. Perhaps, had he been given cowboy stories to illustrate, he might have been happier.|$|E
25|$|On a scholarship, {{he studied}} at Kenyon College, a small liberal arts school in central Ohio from 1947–1948, graduating with a B.A.. Inspired by radical {{debate in the}} student community, he wrote a {{critical}} essay on Friedrich Hayek's The Road to Serfdom. Palme wrote his senior honour thesis on the United Auto Workers union, led at the time by Walter Reuther. After graduation he traveled {{throughout the country and}} eventually ended up in Detroit, where his hero Reuther agreed to an interview which lasted several hours. In later years, Palme regularly remarked during his many subsequent American visits, that the United States had made him a socialist, a remark that often has caused confusion. Within the context of his American experience, it was not that Palme was repelled by <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> in America, but rather that he was inspired by it.|$|E

25|$|In Steve Lenius' {{original}} 2001 {{paper he}} explored {{the acceptance of}} bisexuality in a supposedly pansexual BDSM community. The reasoning behind this is that 'coming-out' had become primarily {{the territory of the}} gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.|$|E
25|$|When Hall {{agreed to}} the design role and was {{appointed}} in April 1966, he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>found</b> was {{an enormous amount of}} work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure. In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall. Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role. With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.|$|E
