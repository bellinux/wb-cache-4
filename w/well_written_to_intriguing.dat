He lies; I shot him through the body as he is shot. I could not miss, shooting not further than ten feet and the object is to excuse his conduct for killing our poor friend Wright." [...] Crain was attacking any claim of self-defense that Bowie might mount with respect to Wright's death. These and other accounts of the brawl by participants were colored by legal considerations. Samuel L. Wells III died within a month of an unrelated fever, so his testimony was not long available to support criminal charges.|$|R
