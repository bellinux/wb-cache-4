40|$|One of {{the causes}} of traffic jams in Yogyakarta is the surplus of {{vehicles}} that isn’t equalized with the length of the roads in the city. This can affect the decreasing of the air quality in Yogyakarta city. Pollution that is caused by the vehicles is consider as an external cost. This is way the pollution has to be value as an amount of money so it can be charged to the society that caused it in the first time. The purpose of this experiment is to know how much pollution that is caused by CO (carbon monoxide) which is caused by vehicles with 2 or 4 <b>whells</b> that uses gasoline for its fuel in Yogyakarta, and then followed by an analysis about the willingness to pay (WTP) with Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) of the society to decrease the emission level until it suits the threshold level. This experiment uses area under discussion sampling and surveys. Area under discussion sampling is done to measure the emission in Yogyakarta. Survey is done using quetioner that is spread to the drivers of the 2 or 4 <b>whells</b> that uses gasoline for its fuel in Yogyakarta. The infraction of the CO emission shows that during this experiment shows there are 59, 13...|$|E

Como elemento sensor, usou-se um anel simples para tração/compressão, {{instruments}} do a extensômetros elétricos em ponte completa, conectado por cabos de aço flexíveis entre a barra do implemento e a base da torre intermediária. Projetado para trabalhos na faixa de 0 - 6. 000 N, submetido a testes de calibração estática, mostrou alta linearidade de resposta com R = 0, 9997, um excelente retorno ao zero e resolução em torno de 70 N. O conjunto, levado a testes com uma unidade semeadora-adubadora de sete linhas, em terreno firme, plano e inclinado, acusou esforços altamente consistentes com valores resultantes de cálculos simples; isso, aliado à simplicidade de sua concepção, confere-lhe um caráter de alta confiabilidade. O uso do conjunto altera a geometria trator-implemento, o que não constitui problema maior quando se está interessado em esforços de fração apenas, em se tratando desse tipo de implemento. Valores obtidos em trabalhos em terreno plano e preparado para plantio, bastante discrepantes dos encontrados em literatura, mostram a conveniência da execução de trabalhos sistemáticos para o conhecimento das reais necessidades de tração desses implementos em nossas condições. An intermediary tower-articulated arm device, for {{attachment to}} three-point hitch of mounted implements, with ground <b>whells,</b> more specifically, multiple row seed-planters, {{was developed and}} tested on draft determination works. A single ring with electrical extensometers connected in full bridge, was used for sense traction compression efforts, anchored by flexible steel cables between the implement bar and {{the base of the}} intermediary tower. Designed for works on tie range of 0 - 6, 000 N, submitted to static calibration tests, showed high linearity, with R = 0. 9997, an excellent zero return and a resolution of around 70 N. A seven row seed-planter was then tested in two sites, firm ground, plane and inclined, and plane, prepared for planting. Draft values from the two first conditions were highly consistent with results obtained from simple theoretical calculus. This, allied to it's simplicity of conception, confers to tire device a great deal of reliability. It's use alters the tractor-implement geometry, not being a major problem if there is interest on draft efforts only, for these kind of implements. Results from works in the site prepared for planting, so different from literature citations, say about of convenience of sistematic work for the knowledge of real draft requirements of mounted implements in our conditions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The factors {{important}} in achieving good walking status in mye-lomeningocele include level of paraplegia, the additional anomalies of brain and kidney, the intelligence, {{and the home}} environment. In a group of fifty-six patients none of those with lesions of the thoracic level walked {{and all of those}} with lesions of the sacral level walked. In those with lesions at lumbar levels (twenty-one lower and nineteen upper) fourteen were community ambulators and five household am-bulators. The other twenty-one were either wheel-chair (nineteen) or non-functional ambulators (two) and the level of paraplegia did not seem to matter nor did the ex-tent of surgery. Some very young non-functional ambulators rose in functional level, but in most instances the trend was to deteriorate.
