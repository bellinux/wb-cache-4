We would use those same cards when figuring out stories for the series." [...] Later, Spotnitz noted that the cards were also in his handwriting [...] "because the prop guy couldn’t do it as well as we could because that’s really the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it. It’s a very emotional love story and it’s really about our love for these characters as writers". The writers eventually settled on the title of [...] "Milagro," [...] which means miracle in Spanish.|$|E

500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely {{different from what they}} do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E

2500|$|The Swiss group Celtic Frost {{was another}} {{precursor}} to gothic metal, translating the influence they drew from gothic rock acts Bauhaus and Siouxsie and the Banshees {{into their own}} albums. The band's [...] "radical fusion of violent black metal and elements of classical music" [...] was dubbed [...] "avant-garde" [...] and had a huge impact [...] "on the evolution of European heavy metal". Christofer Johnsson of Therion cites Celtic Frost's 1987 album Into the Pandemonium in particular for playing {{a key role in}} the development of the [...] "gothic and symphonic wave of bands" [...] in the 1990s, noting further that neither his group Therion nor Paradise Lost [...] "would have sounded the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> without Celtic Frost".|$|E

2500|$|Fox ordered {{thirteen}} episodes. Immediately after, however, Fox {{feared the}} themes of the show were not suitable for the network and Groening and Fox executives argued over whether the network would have any creative input into the show. With The Simpsons, the network has no input. Fox was particularly disturbed by the concept of suicide booths, Doctor Zoidberg, and Bender's anti-social behavior. Groening explains, [...] "When they tried to give me notes on Futurama, I just said: 'No, we're {{going to do this}} just the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> Simpsons.' And they said, 'Well, we don't do business that way anymore.' And I said, 'Oh, well, that's the only way I do business.'" [...] The episode [...] "I, Roommate" [...] was produced to address Fox's concerns, with the script written to their specifications. Fox strongly disliked the episode, but after negotiations, Groening received the same independence with Futurama.|$|E

[...] "Unless something radical happens it would be difficult for me to believe that it won't come out in 2016". In May 2016, Ulrich said in an interview with Metal Forces that the album would be released in the summer of 2016, and that details for the new album would be finalized in the next month. [...] "If the record doesn't come out this year then it won't be because it’s not done... it will be because there's some sort of cosmic reason that it would be smarter to hold onto it until next year. But the record will be done this summer". Recording of the album was completed in June 2016 once the recording for the song [...] "Hardwired" [...] was finished.|$|E
2500|$|The Scots form {{improved}} in their qualifying {{campaign for the}} 1982 FIFA World Cup, finishing top of their group and only losing once. Scotland travelled to Spain {{in the summer of}} 1982 in what would be the only occasion Stein would manage a side at the finals of major international tournament. Scotland swept into a 30 lead in their first group game against New Zealand, but then careless defending saw the Kiwis stage a comeback, scoring twice. Scotland added a further two goals near the end to restore their three-goal advantage, but concern was raised at the potential repercussions of the two New Zealand goals should goal difference become a factor. Brazil were the next opponents, and Stein make a number of changes to his side. Danny McGrain and Kenny Dalglish were surprise omissions, whilst David Narey, Willie Miller and Steve Archibald came into the side. Graeme Souness took over the captaincy in McGrain's absence. Narey gave Scotland a shock lead when he opened the scoring with a powerful right-foot strike. Zico equalised just before half-time from a free kick, and then Brazil took control in the second half, scoring three times to send Scotland crashing to a 41 defeat. The final group game paired Scotland against the Soviet Union; both teams were level on two points each, but the Soviet's had a better goal difference. Joe Jordan came into the team for his first appearance at the 1982 World Cup, and gave Scotland the lead in the first half, but the Soviet's rallied and scored twice in the second half. The second goal was particularly galling for the Scots, and came as a result of defenders Alan Hansen and Willie Miller colliding with one another, allowing Ramaz Shengelia a clear run in at goal to score. Graeme Souness netted a late equaliser for Scotland, but there was little time left for Scotland to score a winner, and the game finished 22 with Scotland going out on goal difference. Stein commented after the final match: [...] "I am very disappointed we have not qualified. If we had played the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> in any other section we would have gone through", adding [...] "We have proved we can compete at this level, if not win..... Tonight I think we have done Scotland proud, {{both on and off the}} field." ...|$|E

60|$|Soon it grew dark, and we strode on up {{hill and}} down dale, {{at one time}} for a mile or more through burnt forest, with its ghastly spider-work of {{leafless}} decaying branches and creepers against the moonlit sky--a sad sight: but music enough we had to cheer us on our <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> <b>did</b> not hear the howl of a monkey, nor the yell of a tiger-cat, common enough on the mountains which lay in front of us; but of harping, fiddling, humming, drumming, croaking, clacking, snoring, screaming, hooting, from cicadas, toads, birds, and what not, there was a concert at every step, which made the glens ring again, as the Brocken might ring on a Walpurgis-night.|$|E

You must remember if you were caught trying it they would shoot you to a certainty." ...|$|E

But when I got nothing above, I suddenly remembered them, and concluded that they had their nests in the crannies of the rocks. So I walked along to the top, and as I did so numbers of them flew up. I shot a couple; most of the others soon settled again, but some kept flying round and round, and in ten minutes I got as many as I wanted.

6000|$|... "That's very neatly done, I think, gentlemen," [...] laughed the man {{addressed}} as Jack, {{and who they}} now saw was the warder who had attended upon them. [...] "We had rare trouble in hitting upon that plan. The cell you were in opened upon a corridor, the doors to which are always locked by the chief constable himself; {{and even if we}} could have got at his key, and opened one of them, we should have been no nearer escape, for two of the warders sleep in the lodge, {{and there would be no}} getting out without waking them, and they could not be got at. They are both of them married men, with families, and that sort of man does not care about running risks, unless he happens to be tired of his wife and wanting a change. Nat here and I have no incumbrances, and weren't sorry of a chance to shift. Anyhow, there was no way, as far as we could see, of passing you out through that part of the prison, and at last the idea struck us of getting you out the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did.</b> That wing of the jail is only used for debtors, and they are nothing like so strict on that side as they are on the other. Some of the warders sleep there, so there was no difficulty in getting hold of the key for an hour and having a duplicate made. Till yesterday all the cells were full, and we had to wait till a man, whose time was just up, moved out. After that it was clear sailing." ...|$|E
60|$|Through {{the night}} we pushed our way slowly, for in such a march none may go swifter than the slowest, namely, the carts and the waggons. Thus it befell that the Maid and the captains were in more {{thoughts}} than one to draw back to Compiegne, for the night was clear, and the dawn would be bright. And, indeed, after stumbling and wandering long, and doubting of the <b>way,</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> at last, see the church towers and walls of Pont l'Eveque stand out against the clear sky of morning, a light mist girdling {{the basement of the}} walls. Had we been a smaller and swifter company, we should have arrived an hour before the first greyness shows the shapes of things. But now, alas! we no sooner saw the town than we heard the bells and trumpets calling the townsfolk and men-at-arms to be on their ward. The great guns of the keep roared at us so soon as we were in reach of shot; nevertheless, Pothon and the Maid set companies to carry the double ladders, for the walls were high, and others were told off to bring up the fascines, and so, leaving our main battle to wait out of shot, and come on as they were needed, the Maid and Pothon ran up the first rampart, she waving her standard and crying that all was ours. As we ran, for I must needs be by her side, the din of bells and guns was worse than I had heard at Orleans, and {{on the top of the}} church towers were men-at-arms waving flags, as if for a signal. Howbeit, we sprang into the fosse, under shield, wary of stones cast from above, and presently three ladders were set against the wall, and we went up, the Maid leading the way.|$|E
