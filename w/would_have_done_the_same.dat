She said that had she been in Martin's place, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> She went on to say, however, that the party under Martin had fallen into disarray and that Martin and his inner circle ran the party using guerrilla warfare tactics. She said she would still vote with the Liberals on {{the vast majority of}} legislation, but would now be free to express her views without fear of reprisal.|$|E
25|$|This was {{influenced}} by Christianity's early members, who were Jewish. The Jews of the time distinguished themselves from foreigners according to religion rather than ethno-cultural standards, and early Jewish Christians <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Because Hellenic culture was the dominant pagan culture in the Roman east, they called pagans Hellenes. Christianity inherited Jewish terminology for non-Jews and adapted {{it in order to}} refer to non-Christians with whom they were in contact. This usage is recorded in the New Testament. In the Pauline epistles, Hellene is almost always juxtaposed with Hebrew regardless of actual ethnicities.|$|E
25|$|Then {{everything}} changed when the Jin dynasty attacked, with even better bombs. The iron bomb. Traditionally {{the inspiration for}} the development of the iron bomb is ascribed to the tale of a fox hunter named Iron Li. According to the story, around the year 1189 Iron Li developed a new method for hunting foxes which used a ceramic explosive to scare foxes into his nets. The explosive consisted of a ceramic bottle with a mouth, stuffed with gunpowder, and attached with a fuse. Explosive and net were placed at strategic points of places such as watering holes frequented by foxes, and when they got near enough, Iron Li would light the fuse, causing the ceramic bottle to explode and scaring the frightened foxes right into his nets. While a fanciful tale, it's not exactly certain why this would cause the development of the iron bomb, given the explosive was made using ceramics, and other materials such as bamboo or even leather <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> job, assuming they made a loud enough noise. Nonetheless, the iron bomb made its first appearance in 1221 at the siege of Qizhou (in modern Hubei province), and this time it would be the Jin who possessed the technological advantage. The Song command Zhao Yurong (趙與褣) survived and was able to relay his account for posterity.|$|E

500|$|Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised Alphonse's {{development}} in the manga, especially where he refuses to recover his weakened body and instead helps his friends. As a result, Silverman brought a comparison between the two brothers and wondered whether Edward <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> Chris Beveridge found the character's growth in Conqueror in Shamballa appealing as he starts visually resembling Edward. When reviewing the video game Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel, RPGFan's Neal Chandran enjoyed the dynamic between the main characters both in fights as well as dialogues. After Aaron Dismuke's voice matured, Anime News Network writer Justin Sevakis criticized him {{for his part in}} the Fullmetal Alchemist: Premium OVA Collection, writing that [...] "he simply no longer sounds like Alphonse".|$|E
2500|$|Police have {{attributed}} to the banlieues' gang subculture a [...] "poisonous mentality that designates Jews as enemies along with other 'outsiders,'" [...] such as Americans, mainstream French, and Europeans in general. [...] "If they could have gotten their hands on a (non-Jewish) French cop in the same way, they probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing," [...] a retired police chief opined. This may have hampered the original investigation. Antisemitism is an aggravating circumstance (circonstance aggravante) in a murder case in France.|$|E
2500|$|In the DS9 episode [...] "", Worf prematurely ended {{a mission}} to contact a Cardassian {{informant}} inside the Dominion {{in order to save}} his injured wife. The informant was subsequently executed by the Dominion, causing Captain Sisko to officially caution that Starfleet might not grant Worf his own command after this incident (being another official reprimand in Worf's records of consequence). However, Sisko added that, had he been forced to choose between his duty and his wife, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing.|$|E

2500|$|In general, the Irish players {{blamed the}} {{officials}} rather than Henry. Damien Duff admitted he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{had it been}} to Ireland's advantage, and said: [...] "If it was down the other end and it was going out of play, I would have chanced my arm. You can't blame him (Henry). He's a clever player – but you expect the ref to see it, it was so blatant." [...] Many players, including Duff, supported call for the introduction of video technology. Sean St Ledger hoped France would {{be put in a}} 'group of death' in the World Cup draw, but feared they might go on to win the tournament.|$|E
2500|$|Campese was {{involved}} in the biggest controversy of the World Cup Final in the 69th minute. English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage [...] "may have had an overlap," [...] when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty." [...] The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try. Moore was reported after the Test to have said, [...] " [...] sets himself up as the saviour of rugby. Yet {{when it comes down to}} it he's as cynical as anyone. I wouldn't criticise Campese except he called me mad as a hatter earlier this week." [...] Moore writes in Beware of the Dog: Rugby's Hard Man Reveals All that, ‘I have no issue with what Campese did; I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same,</b> and he got away with it. The point I make about what he did is that, as he has been shown to be as cynical as the rest of us, I don’t now want to hear lectures from him about the spirit of the game.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Show creator Jason Rothenberg said he {{and others}} {{involved}} with the series were aware of Debnam-Carey while casting Clarke in 2014; although the chance for her to portray Clarke never materialized, her name was brought up while casting Lexa. He called the casting a [...] "no-brainer"; she did not audition for the role, but was rather offered it. At the time, Debnam-Carey was also being considered {{for the role of}} Alicia Clark on Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "That's always a concern when you have an actor in your show that is popping—that someone else is going to grab them and make them a series regular if you don't. That's kind of what happened in this case," [...] stated Rothenberg, who considered Debnam-Carey's performance on The 100 [...] "amazing". He added, [...] "You know we can't compete on some level with the cache of a franchise like that, with the numbers." [...] Debnam-Carey was allowed to continue work on both shows. [...] Rothenberg said he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> had it been the other way around, with creators asking to borrow one of his actors, and he would have done his best to make the situation work.|$|E

2500|$|Of the {{decision}} to have Lexa betray Clarke, a significant moment for the series that allowed the writers to strain the characters' relationship, Rothenberg said Lexa {{was under the impression}} Clarke would likely die in the battle and Mount Weather would possibly remain to keep her people united. [...] "She was probably—master strategist that she is—thinking several moves ahead. Thinking she could keep her alliance together, the 12 clans, because they would still have this evil empire out there to unite them," [...] he stated. Lexa was not expecting Clarke to win, and to subsequently become a legend. [...] "Everywhere she goes it's like, 'I heard it was 5,000 people! No, I heard it was 10,000 people!' Everywhere she goes, [...] a legend now," [...] said Rothenberg. [...] "Certainly it means that her alliance now no longer has a real reason to be held together. [...] I'm really excited to play out the ramifications of all of that." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke would eventually {{come to terms with the}} likelihood that, if she had been in a similar position as Lexa, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing: Protect her own people at all costs. He said she did as much in the season 2 finale. [...] "That was kind of the theme of the entire season, which was how far can you go and still be the good guy in order to save your people. Lexa had that choice in [...] 15. Obviously, it landed very emotionally for both of them, but especially on Clarke," [...] he stated. [...] "In [...] 16, Clarke had a similar choice and I hope that over the course of the first part of , Clarke will eventually come to see it that way. If she can't, then they'll never figure out a way to make peace with each other".|$|E
