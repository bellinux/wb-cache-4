5|$|Devil Daggers was {{developed}} by Sorath, a Melbourne-based independent video game developer. The development group was formed by Matt Bush, a member of Dustforce creators Hitbox Team. The game's art direction and rendering engine were designed to reimagine the aesthetics and graphical style of video games from the 1990s. This was achieved by making use of unfiltered textures, jagged 3D models, and the deliberate implementation of polygon jitter and texture <b>warping</b> found in early 3D games. Jitter and <b>warping</b> were often considered technical flaws of PlayStation games; however, the recreation of these effects in Devil Daggers is to make enemies shudder and ripple during movement. Enemy designs are hellish, with some entities taking the form of insectoids with skeletal features. Audio is composed largely of distorted and abstract sounds with compressed, digitised screams used to produce unsettling noises for the creatures.|$|E

5|$|Two drains were built, {{of which}} the most {{successful}} was the Swinefleet <b>Warping</b> Drain, pioneered by Ralph Creyke and T.H.S. Sotheron, and authorised by an Act of Parliament. Opened in 1821, poor-quality land was reclaimed for around forty years. The other scheme was Durham's <b>Warping</b> Drain, {{to the north of}} Thorne, which ran westwards to a sluice on the River Don. The drain was completed in 1856 by Makin Durham, but he failed to achieve much reclamation of the peat moors. He died in 1882, just as ideas to use the peat commercially began to replace the concept of attempting to make the moors suitable for agriculture. The change was brought about by an agricultural depression and the high price of straw for animal bedding.|$|E

40|$|High single {{instruction}} multiple data (SIMD) {{efficiency and}} {{low power consumption}} have made graphic processing units (GPUs) an ideal platform for many complex computational applications. Thousands of threads can be created by programmers and grouped into fixed-size SIMD batches, known as <b>warps.</b> High throughput is then achieved by concurrently executing such <b>warps</b> with minimal control overhead. However, if a branch instruction occurs, which assigns different paths to different threads, this <b>warp</b> will be broken into multiple <b>warps</b> {{that have to be}} executed serially, consequently reducing the efficiency advantage of SIMD. In this thesis, the contemporary fixed-size <b>warp</b> design is abandoned and a hybrid <b>warp</b> size (HWS) mechanism is proposed. Mixed-size <b>warps</b> are generated according to HWS and are scheduled and issued flexibly. Once a branch divergence occurs, split <b>warps</b> are squeezed according to the proposed algorithm, and <b>warp</b> sizes are downscaled wherever applicable. Based on updated <b>warp</b> sizes, <b>warp</b> schedulers calculate the number of cycles the current <b>warp</b> needs and issue the next <b>warp</b> accordingly. As a result, hybrid <b>warps</b> are pushed into pipelines as soon as possible and more pipeline stages are overlapped. The simulation results show that this mechanism yields an average speedup of 1. 20 over the baseline architecture {{for a wide variety of}} general purpose GPU applications. This work also integrates HWS with dynamic <b>warp</b> formation (DWF), which is a well-known branch handling mechanism aimed at improving SIMD utilization by forming new <b>warps</b> out of split <b>warps</b> in real time. The <b>warp</b> forming policy is modified to better tolerate <b>warp</b> conflicts. Also, squeeze operations are added before a <b>warp</b> merges with other <b>warps.</b> The simulation shows that the combination of DWF and HWS generates an average speedup of 1. 27 over the DWF-only platform for the same set of GPU benchmarks...|$|R
5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the <b>warping</b> {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E

As the series progressed and the budget increased, a stairway and balcony was installed in the foyer in an attempt to get characters off the floor and not all appear in the same geometric plane. For the first few seasons, the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards; due to <b>warping,</b> it was replaced by concrete painted to look like wood.|$|E
5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} long on keel and narrow of beam (width) {{to allow for}} the {{mounting}} of very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging (<b>warping)</b> and included extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Since the fledgling United States could not match the numbers of ships of the European states, Humphreys designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{tension of}} <b>warp</b> and weft {{run through the}} whole weaving process in knitted carpet weaving equipment. The {{performance}} of delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism and guiding weft mechanism {{in this kind of}} equipment influences the quality of carpet directly. A self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism is designed in this thesis, which is used in knitted carpet weaving equipment or other textile equipment that delivers <b>warp</b> by warp-spindle and demands even <b>warp</b> tension. The self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism consists of the device for setting and detecting <b>warp</b> tension, the device for driving warp-spindle in different speed, and the device for transmitting warp-spindle movement. The device for setting and detecting <b>warp</b> tension can determine initialization tension of <b>warp,</b> according to the technical requirements, can detect and feed back <b>warp</b> tension in real time. The device for driving warp-spindle in different speed makes the rotating speed of warp-spindle change according to the <b>warp</b> tension. The self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism realizes the function on controlling the rotating speed of warp-spindle in closed loop, and on stabilizing delivering <b>warp</b> tension...|$|R

40|$|Spatially varying <b>warps</b> are {{increasingly}} popular for image alignment. In particular, as-projective-as-possible (APAP) <b>warps</b> {{have been proven}} effective for accurate panoramic stitching, especially in cases with significant depth parallax that defeat standard homographic <b>warps.</b> However, estimating spatially varying <b>warps</b> requires {{a sufficient number of}} feature matches.

Our method automatically identifies misaligned regions, and inserts appropriate point correspondences to increase the flexibility of the <b>warp</b> and improve alignment.

The rate of subsidence was initially about 20cm (8in) per year but slowed to 1–2cm (0.4–0.8in) a year by the 1990s. It had several causes: settling of the loose tephra forming the bulk of the volcano, compaction of sea floor sediments underlying the island, and downward <b>warping</b> of the lithosphere due to the weight of the volcano.|$|E

5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the <b>warping</b> and transporting sounds.|$|E

The top speed limitation proved troublesome against Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3Gs followed by rapid loss of airspeed. One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into pitch-up. The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the F-84E pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy <b>warping.</b> The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the computing gunsight aided in accurate gunnery and bombing.
