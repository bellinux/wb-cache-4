5000|$|The term [...] "workforce housing" [...] is {{appearing}} in policy discussions at {{national and state}} levels. While typically defined by local terms - area median income, fair market rent, and the employment base of the particular region - without the ability fund initiatives or to create sufficient incentives or mandates, {{it is difficult to}} have any impact on affordable housing. As with all affordable housing initiatives, local governments may use existing tools like inclusionary zoning, upzonings, density bonuses to create desired outcomes. Incentives may include <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> like building permit fees, water and sewer fees. Real estate transfer taxes and retail sales taxes may provide funding in states where local governments have the power to raise revenue in this way. In Missouri, some examples of policy recommendations for changes at the state level that might accelerate creation of workforce housing include bond issues to fund projects, and mandated inclusion of workforce housing in the comprehensive plans required for the state's largest municipalities.|$|E
50|$|Mr Mothew was a {{solicitor}} who {{had acted}} for both borrower and lender in a mortgage transaction {{relating to the}} purchase of a residential property. It was alleged that he negligently told the building society that there was no second charge on the house when the mortgage agreement was signed. At the time of reporting to the building society and requesting its funding, unbeknown to Mr Mothew, the borrower had a relatively small bank overdraft facility limited to £2,000. After completion of the purchase and mortgage (at which time the lender's funds were applied to the transaction) but before the transactions were registered at Land Registry Mr Mothew was approached by the borrower's bankers Barclays to say that they were granting a second mortgage facility to the borrower and seeking that their second charge be registered at Land Registry. The second charge documentation had been prepared and executed by the borrower at the bank's premises. By registering the second charge documentation contemporaneously with the purchase and (first) mortgage there was a <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> payable to the Land Registry thereby saving expense for the borrower than if the second charge had been registered separately later. The Cheshunt Building Society were asked by Mr Mothew to consent to registration of the second charge which they did and they were also given formal notice of the second charge which they acknowledged. Mr Mothew delayed sending the application to the registry whilst the lender's consent was being obtained since it was also required to be lodged at the Land Registry. At the time of their default the borrower's overdraft facility had risen from £2,000 to £3,350. The housing market collapsed, and the homeowners (having lost their employment in the recession) defaulted on their mortgage with the building society. To realise their money, the building society had the property sold off for £53,000 in February 1991, a considerable time after they had taken possession of it. The lender claimed that if it had known of the borrower's overdraft facility, it would not have granted its mortgage to the borrower. They sued Mothew for the sum they lent (£59,000) less the proceeds of the sale.|$|E

30|$|Highly cited work is {{unlikely}} to be published in the first volumes of new journals. Prospective randomized trials and non-randomized trials performed by influential collaborative groups are prefentially submitted to well-established journals. It has also been shown that five newly established oncology journals, in this case open access publications without print issues, all published less than 50 articles in their first annual volume (Nieder et al. 2013 b). First after 4 - 5 years number of articles per volume increased sharply. At that time, the two journals analysed here were already taken off the market. During the time period in question (1996 - 1999), no other new radiation oncology journals entered the market. However, afterwards two successful journals were established (in 2006 “Radiation Oncology” (open access, no print issues); in 2011 “Practical Radiation Oncology” (print issues, sister journal to the “International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology and Physics”)). Regarding “Radiation Oncology”, the annual volumes 2006 - 2008 all consisted of less than 50 articles. In 2009, contents expanded to 71 articles, while the most recent volume (2014) featured approximately 300. On the one hand, one could hypothesize that open access fees might prevent authors from submitting to journals like “Radiation Oncology”. On the other hand, advantages such as rapid publication and unlimited distribution and access appear to outweigh financial considerations. Institutional membership or publication funds and <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> for authors from countries with limited resources might also encourage researchers to publish in open access journals.|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis examines the topic of conflict of norms in European Union (EU) law and the legal reasoning of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), arguing that the framework of conflict of norms provides conceptual insight into justification {{and the role of}} value choices in legal reasoning. After examining the theory of conflict of norms, which seems to have been relatively under-studied generally and especially in EU law, it examines three particular aspects of norm conflict resolution in the legal reasoning of the ECJ and EU law: conflict of interpretative norms, especially the opposition between conserving and innovative interpretation; conflicts of human rights norms, looking in particular at the idea of a hierarchy of rights and of specificationism in the articulation of rights; and conflicts of competence norms. It concludes that the scope exists for a fuller justification of the choice of norms in the legal reasoning of the ECJ and generally in EU law and offers a perspective on how the values articulated by the EU suggest particular approaches to norm conflict resolution by the ECJ in its decision-making in these fields, in particular, a greater resort to lex specialis and originalist or historical interpretation, in contrast to its current method.

40|$|NATIONAL CHAMPIONS [...] AGAIN! UGA Wins National Moot Court Competition ATHENS, Ga. [...] The University of Georgia School of Law won the 47 th Annual National Moot Court Competition January 30 in New York City, {{the second}} time UGA has claimed the prestigious {{national}} championship in the 1990 s. UGA also won the national title in 1992, reached the semifinals in 1994, and placed second in the competition last year. The University of Georgia holds the record as the only law school {{in the nation to}} have reached the quarterfinals of the national competition for seven consecutive years. Third-year teammates Chandler Mason, Tom Mew, and Kerry Harike earned eight trophies from the competition, including individual honors for Mason as Best Oralist and Mew as Runner-up Best Oralist in the final round. The UGA students defeated Texas Tech in the finals after victories over South Texas in the semifinals, Wake Forest in the quarterfinals, Montana in the octafinals, and Albany in the preliminary rounds. The team 2 ̆ 7 s only loss came in a close decision to Ohio State in the prelims. 2 ̆ 2 I 2 ̆ 7 m extremely proud of the team, 2 ̆ 2 said moot court advisor Richard Ford. 2 ̆ 2 They worked so hard and performed admirably when it mattered the most. They got better and better with each round, and presented their best argument in the national finals. It 2 ̆ 7 s a tribute to their poise and preparation. 2 ̆ 2 Our program is also very fortunate to have the support of committed and talented faculty members such as Faculty Advisor Rebecca White and many others who have generously shared their time to bench the various teams, 2 ̆ 2 Ford said. 2 ̆ 2 In addition, we have been extremely fortunate to have the active support of our moot court alumni, who care a great deal for the program. 2 ̆ 2 The National Competition, the oldest and most prestigious moot court tournament in the country, is sponsored by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. Teams from 160 law schools entered the competition, with the top two teams from each region advancing to the nationals in New York City. UGA secured the berth in November by reaching the finals of the Southeastern Regionals and winning the Best Brief award. Judge Amalya L. Kearse of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit presided over the distinguished panel which heard final arguments in New York City. The jurists included four federal judges, three New York state judges, and the presidents of the American College of Trial Lawyers and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. Students argued a hypothetical appellate court case concerning the timely issue of publication of information about convicted sex offenders following their release from prison. Also addressed was an issue concerning the <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> for prisoners 2 ̆ 7 appeals. 2 ̆ 2 The University of Georgia enjoys a long, proud tradition of excellence in its moot court program, 2 ̆ 2 said Dean Ned Spurgeon, 2 ̆ 2 and this latest victory attests to the continuing strength of our advocacy training. Our talented and dedicated students have set the standard of excellence in numerous state, national and international competitions, and have advanced the reputation of the law school in the process. 2 ̆ 2 Not only has the University of Georgia achieved incredible success in the prestigious National Moot Court Competition, teams this decade have also won four national championships and one international title in the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition. Intrastate teams have brought home the trophy six of the last ten years, and UGA has a ten-match winning streak over Florida in the Hulsey-Kimbrell Competition, held each fall. The ABA teams have won or been finalists in the regional tournament seven of the last eleven years, advancing to the quarterfinals of the national competition in 1995. In the select William B. Spong Invitational Moot Court Tournament at the College of William and Mary, UGA has twice won the championship (1997, 1994); won Best Brief and reached the Final Four (1995); and won Best Oralist (Chandler Mason) and reached the quarterfinals (1996).

40|$|Jordan v. State {{rules on}} two {{separate}} appeals {{that address the}} same issue of first impression regarding guidelines Nevada state courts must follow in order to restrict court access to in proper person litigants with in forma pauperis status. This case also reconfirms {{the process by which}} in forma applications are reviewed. In the first case, respondent Officer Jimmie W. Jones arrested proper person appellant James Jacob Jordan for trespassing on state property 2 after Jordan did not heed Officer Jones’s warning to leave the premises. After the trespass charge was dropped the following day, Jordan sued Officer Jones along with the Nevada State Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Safety for six different torts. Jordan filed this action with the First Judicial District Court, Carson City. After being granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, Jordan filed various papers that the district court found incomprehensible and procedurally improper. For that reason, the court ordered that Jordan be prohibited from proceeding without a <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>fees</b> in any new actions unless he obtained leave of the court prior to filing any new action. A few months later, a joint case conference report regarding Jordan’s cause of action was filed. The court granted the State’s motion for summary judgment because the court was unable to interpret the meaning of Jordan’s claims. Jordan timely appealed his suit. In the second case, proper person appellant John Luckett sued respondent Edward Doumani, owner of respondent La Concha Motel, for various torts in connection with a financial scam that Luckett claimed Doumani conspired in. Luckett filed this action with the Eighth Judicial District Court, Las Vegas. After Luckett was granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, Doumani served Luckett with a demand for security costs under Nevada Revised Statute 18. 130, which requires an out-of-state plaintiff to post security for any future adverse award of costs and charges. 3 Doumani also moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. After the allotted time to pay the costs expired, the court notified Luckett that he had thirty days to pay or the case would be dismissed. The court then conducted a hearing on Doumani’s motion to dismiss for failure to pay and declared its intent to issue a restrictive order calling Luckett a vexatious litigant. Luckett was then given three weeks to file an opposition before the next hearing. After Luckett failed to attend that hearing, the court declared Luckett a vexatious litigant and noted that he had a history of filing unmeritorious pleadings, of claiming in forma pauperis status, and of traveling and gambling—thereby undercutting his claim of indigence. Accordingly, the court granted Doumani’s motion to dismiss for failure to post security for costs and barred Luckett from proceeding in his action against Doumani without paying appropriate costs; the court also barred Luckett from filing any new litigation in Nevada state courts in forma pauperis unless he first obtains leave of the presiding judge in the court. Luckett timely appealed his suit. In reviewing whether it was proper for the district courts to restrict Jordan’s and Luckett’s court access, respectively, the Nevada Supreme Court used an abuse of discretion standard {{and for the first time}} expressly adopted the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s four-part analysis for restricting court access, 4 with some caveats. 5 The Nevada Supreme Court found that the restrictive order levied against Jordan did not comply with the Ninth Circuit’s guidelines and ordered it vacated. First, Jordan was not given proper notice or opportunity to respond before the court restricted his court access. Second, the district court did not include an adequate record of filings and rulings in similar cases that led the court to order the restriction. Third, even though Jordan’s filings were difficult to understand, they were not without merit and should have at least warranted a preliminary evidentiary hearing as espoused by Spears v. McCotter. 6 Finally, the restrictive order against Jordan was unconstitutionally broad and seemed to bar him from filing any new actions in forma pauperis, regardless of whether the future action concerns a fundamental right. (In addition, based on a de novo review, the Nevada Supreme Court overturned the district court’s grant of summary judgment because two of Jordan’s six tort claims were legally viable.) The Nevada Supreme Court found that the restrictive order levied against Luckett followed the Ninth Circuit’s guidelines more closely and was warranted. First, Luckett was afforded notice and opportunity to be heard before the order was given. Second, the record substantiated the court’s findings (however, some of the suits the court cited to were pending and therefore should not have been referenced). Third, the court made substantive findings as to the frivolity of Luckett’s filings. Finally, the court narrowly drew the restrictive order that required Luckett to obtain a presiding judge’s permission to make new filings. However, the court should have explicated 1) a standard against which the presiding judge should evaluate any new filings from Luckett, and 2) which specific jurisdiction the restrictive order applied to—in this case, only the Eighth Judicial District Court. Therefore, even though the Nevada Supreme Court found the restrictive order to be proper, it remanded the order for modification because it lacked a complaintreview standard and wrongly attempted to apply to all Nevada jurisdictions rather than just the Eighth Judicial District. In addition, the Nevada Supreme Court did find that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing Luckett’s action based on his failure to post security because the record contains no order expressly vacating the in forma pauperis order and no order was entered at a time early enough in the proceedings to give Luckett any opportunity to respond by posting security; instead, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of Luckett’s action for failure to state a claim...|$|E
