5|$|This {{set up a}} {{showdown}} with Manchester United in the final on 21 May 2005. United were on top {{for long periods of}} the game but Arsenal resisted their pressure and the match ended 0–0 after 120 minutes, albeit Arsenal <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> lighter after Reyes' dismissal with a minute remaining for two bookable offences. The match went to penalties with all the penalty takers converting barring Paul Scholes, whose effort was denied by Lehmann. Vieira converted the final and winning spot-kick to seal a tenth FA Cup crown for Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|A folk tale from Barra {{tells of}} a lonely kelpie that {{transforms}} itself into a handsome young man to woo a pretty young girl it was determined to take for its wife. But the girl recognises the young man as a kelpie and removes his silver necklace (his bridle) while he sleeps. The kelpie immediately reverts to its equine form, and the girl takes it home to her father's farm, where it is put {{to work for a}} year. At the end of that time the girl rides the kelpie to consult a wise man, who tells her to return the silver necklace. Once again transformed into the handsome young man she had first met the wise man asks the kelpie whether if given the choice it would choose to be a kelpie or a mortal. The kelpie in turn asks the girl whether, if he <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> she would agree to be his wife. She confirms that she would, after which the kelpie chooses to become a mortal man, and the pair are married.|$|E
25|$|At the tribunal, Caspar's {{case was}} heard first. Caspar was {{suspended}} for four weeks. Coleman's defence was simple: he had simply retaliated to two unprovoked punches from Caspar (for which Caspar had been suspended). The VFL at that time made no allowance for provocation, the Players' Advocate Dan Minogue was thought {{to have made a}} good case for Coleman by arguing that any man, if he <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> at all, would hit back after being hit. Both the boundary umpire, Herb Kent, and goal umpire Allen gave evidence that Coleman had retaliated only after he had been punched twice by Caspar.|$|E

According to Li's epitaph for his wife, Shen would sometimes relay questions via Li to Hu when he needed clarification for his mathematical work, as Hu Wenrou was esteemed by Shen as a remarkable female mathematician. Shen lamented: [...] "If only she <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> Wenrou would be my friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Aminah's parents come in soon {{afterwards}} and {{ask where}} Mahmud has gone, {{to which she}} replies [...] "out". Their discussion is interrupted when Aminah's younger sister Sri comes in, upset, and tells them that she has just broken up with her fiance, Supono. Upon questioning her, the family learns that Pono had likewise been pushed to join the recently established Pembela Tanah Air (PETA; Protectors of the Homeland), and refused; Sri had broken off their engagement rather than marry a coward, saying that if she <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> she would have certainly joined. Aminah implies that Mahmud has likewise refused to join.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé resigns herself and {{continues}} to sing about cruelties that men often inflict on women. Still imagining herself impersonating {{the man who has}} wronged her, she highlights how some men switch off their phones to avoid ex-lovers after having found another girl. Beyoncé continues, [...] "I'd put myself first / And make the rules as I go / 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful / Waitin' for me to come home". She then repeats the chorus; the intensity with which she sings gradually increases until she hits her upper register and seems close to crying. During the bridge, Beyoncé stops singing about the male behaviors she would indulge in if she <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> and addresses her callous lover directly. As Beyoncé emphasizes how it feels to be cheated on, she sings her vocal lines an octave higher than she did {{in the rest of the}} song. She finally tells him that it is too late to come back and apologize. In the last verse, Beyoncé concludes, [...] "But you're just a boy". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music notes that she [...] " [...] her voice into a thin, pleading whine" [...] at this point. With a squeak in her voice, she repeats the chorus for the final time as she fights to remain strong, not allowing her agony to bring her down.|$|E

2500|$|Dutugemunu's {{given name}} was Gamini (Sinhala:ගාමිණි) or Gamani (Sinhala:ගාමණි) {{as the first}} name, a {{traditional}} Buddhist name still popular in Sri Lanka today and the second name as Abhaya (Sinhala:අභය) which means fearless. The Mahavamsa describes how as a youth he mocked his father Kavantissa (Sinhala:කාවන්තිස්ස), king of Ruhuna (Sinhala:රුහුණ), for refusing to wage war against the powerful invading Elara (Sinhala:එළාර), the Solee (Sinhala:සොළී)king of Anuradhapura (Sinhala:අනුරාධපුර) who usurped the throne by killing the native kings. The prince stated that 'If [...] father <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> he would not speak thus' and sent him a piece of women's jewellery. The resulting fury of the king caused many of his friends to flee to Malaya region and the prince himself being dubbed Dutthagamani, [...] meaning [...] "disobedient". After his death, he {{was referred to as}} Dharma Gamini ("righteous Gamini"), but it is as Duttha Gamini or Dutugemunu that he is known to posterity.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was typical}} of the Hines to ask if there were any Christians in the villages they visited. In one case, they found out that the only Christians that their host knew about <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Dmitri and his wife Lyudmila. Dmitri's wife knew how to read -- evidently a fairly rare thing at that time and in that place. She taught herself how to read because a Russian soldier had left a Bible behind several years earlier, and she started slowly {{learning}} by reading that Bible. When the Hines arrived in the village and approached Dmitri's house, they heard a strange and wonderful sound: Dmitri's wife was reading from the gospel of John about the crucifixion of Christ to a houseful of guests, and those visitors were in the very act of repenting. In Ukraine (as I know first hand!), this act of repenting is done very much out loud. So the Hines heard people calling out to God, saying how unbelievable it was that Christ would die for their own sins, and praising Him for His love and mercy. They just couldn't barge in and disrupt this obvious work of the Holy Spirit, so they stayed outside and listened. Stuart wrote down the phrases he heard the Repenters use, and (even though this was all in Russian), it became the third verse that we know today: [...] "And when I think that God, His Son not sparing, Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{obligation}} {{that was}} incumbent upon an Israelite or Jew was {{to separate from}} his harvested grain (wheat, barley, spelt, etc.), wine (including unpressed grapes) and oil (including unpressed olives) the one-fiftieth portion of these products (or one-fortieth, if he <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of generosity; and one-sixtieth if he were stingy) and to give the same to a man of Aaron's lineage (priestly stock), who, in turn, would eat such fruits {{in a state of}} ritual cleanness, in accordance with a biblical command, [...] "...and let him not eat of the holy things, until he bathes his flesh in water. And when the sun goes down down, he will be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things because it is his food" [...] (...) [...] This obligation was contingent upon the fact that such fruits grew in the Land of Israel. Later, the Rabbis made it an obligation {{to do the same for}} all fruits and vegetables grown in the Land of Israel, and not only to such fruits as grain, grapes and olives. With the destruction of the Temple and the cessation of ritual purity, the obligation to separate the Terumah continued unabated, although it was no longer given to a priest of Aaron's lineage, since bodily defilement was now pervasive. The general practice after the Temple's destruction was to separate the Terumah from all fruits and vegetables by removing even the slightest portion thereof, and to immediately discard it by burial or some other means of disposal (since it can no longer be eaten in the current state of ritual uncleanness, and those doing so would make themselves liable to extirpation).|$|E
2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they <b>were.</b> <b>A</b> <b>man</b> wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will ask all of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will test your abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E
