5|$|On 17 February 1997, the W3C {{approved}} Yggdrasil {{to coordinate}} future development of Arena. Development {{was taken over}} by Yggdrasil, with the idea to turn Arena into an open source X <b>Window</b> <b>System</b> browser licensed under the GNU General Public License. Yggdrasil licensed an X emulator from Pearl Software to port Arena to Windows, although these builds were never released. Yggdrasil didn't provide any official binaries at this time, because they didn't want to expand the community with alpha-quality software. Although users would be able to run Arena by compiling it from the published source code, volunteers created unofficial finished binaries. Yggdrasil had planned to implement browsing features that were already standard in competitive web browsers, which resulted in the new bookmarks feature in version 0.3.18 on 7 April 1997.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} {{threat of}} terrorist attacks over recent years has brought to light the need for enhanced physical security features to be incorporated into occupied facilities. Such features may {{include the use of}} hardened <b>window</b> <b>systems</b> designed to reduce the level of hazardous glass fragments generated during an explosive event. Historically, the majority of building occupants seriously injured or killed in blast events sustained these injuries due to flying glass fragments from the buildingâ€™s exterior <b>window</b> <b>systems.</b> This has prompted many Federal agencies to mandate explosive testing to pre-qualify <b>window</b> <b>systems</b> prior to being installed in their facilities. Explosive testing can reveal many deficiencies in new technologies and improperly designed <b>window</b> <b>systems,</b> in addition to providing valuable data for improved analytical methods and software validation.
