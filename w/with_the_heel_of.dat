5|$|Nick Dalton, an {{attorney}} and key-holder for the Playboy Club, introduces himself to newly hired Bunny Maureen and asks her for cigarettes. Maureen notifies to him that she is out of cigarettes, {{and goes to the}} storeroom to resupply. Bruno Bianchi, who previously tried to dance with her, is at the premises and attempts to seduce her. A terrified Maureen begins to resist his attempts; the two later get into a scuffle. Dalton—checking on his order—witnesses the attack and gets into an altercation with Bianchi. Maureen stabs Bruno Bianchi in the neck <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> her shoes, killing him. Nick Dalton later informs her that Bianchi is the head of a local chapter of the Chicago Outfit. They dispose of his body in the Chicago River, and Dalton provides refuge for Maureen at his condominium.|$|E
500|$|Several of the {{earliest}} sources refer to the structure as [...] "Wade's Causeway", [...] "Wade's Causey", and [...] "Wade's Wife's Causey". The word causeway derives from the earlier English causey way or simply causey. Causey derives from the Middle English cauci, which derives from the Anglo-French causee, itself derived from the Medieval Latin calciata ("paved highway"), which ultimately may derive from the Latin calx (meaning [...] "heel"). The derivation from calx can most likely {{be explained by the}} practice in the Ancient Roman era of consolidating earthworks through trampling <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> the foot.|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, {{the term}} 'flipper' {{has been used}} to {{describe}} other types of deliveries. The Australian leg spinner Bob Holland employed a back spinning ball that he simply pushed backwards <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> his palm. Sometimes this form of front-hand flipper is called a [...] "zooter". It is easier to bowl but not as effective as the amount of backspin is much less.|$|E

2500|$|Commercial {{tomato ketchup}} has an additive, usually xanthan gum, {{which gives the}} {{condiment}} a pseudoplastic or [...] "shear thinning" [...] property - more commonly known as thixotropic. This increases the viscosity of the ketchup considerably with a relatively small amount added—usually 0.5%—which can {{make it difficult to}} pour from a container. However, the shear thinning property of the gum ensures that when a force is applied to the ketchup it will lower the viscosity enabling the sauce to flow. A common method to getting ketchup out of the bottle involves inverting the bottle and shaking it or hitting the bottom <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> the hand, which causes the ketchup to flow rapidly. A technique involves inverting the bottle and forcefully tapping its upper neck with two fingers (index and middle finger together). Specifically, with a Heinz ketchup glass bottle, one taps the 57 circle on the neck. This helps the ketchup flow by applying the correct shearing force. These techniques work because of how pseudoplastic fluids behave: their viscosity (resistance to flow) decreases with increasing shear rate. The faster the ketchup is sheared (by shaking or tapping the bottle), the more fluid it becomes. After the shear is removed the ketchup thickens to its original viscosity.|$|E
2500|$|Hand {{planes are}} ancient, {{originating}} {{thousands of years}} ago. Early planes were made from wood with a rectangular slot or mortise cut across {{the center of the}} body. The cutting blade or iron was held in place with a wooden wedge. The wedge was tapped into the mortise and adjusted with a small mallet, a piece of scrap wood or <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heel</b> <b>of</b> the user's hand. Planes of this type have been found in excavations of old sites as well as drawings of woodworking from medieval Europe and Asia. The earliest known examples of the woodworking plane have been found in Pompeii although other Roman examples have been unearthed in Britain and Germany. The Roman planes resemble modern planes in essential function, most having iron wrapping a wooden core top, bottom, front and rear and an iron blade secured with a wedge. [...] One example found in Cologne has a body made entirely of bronze without a wooden core. [...] A Roman plane iron used for cutting moldings was found in Newstead, England. Histories prior to these examples are not clear although furniture pieces and other woodwork found in Egyptian tombs show surfaces carefully smoothed with some manner of cutting edge or scraping tool. [...] There are suggestions that the earliest planes were simply wooden blocks fastened to the soles of adzes to effect greater control of the cutting action.|$|E

50|$|Beale Air Force Base spans 23000 acre {{of rolling}} hills in {{northern}} California. The base's natural resources are quite rich. Native Americans lived on this land, and the mortar bowls they carved into bedrock lie {{embedded in a}} shallow stream. German prisoners of war were held on the base during World War II. A block of prison cells still stands at the base, and the drawings of the POWs remain on the cell walls. The surprisingly detailed images {{were said to have}} been drawn <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prisoners' boots which probably helped protect them. To preserve these and other historic areas, the base maintains 38 Native American sites, 45 homestead sites, and 41 World War II sites.|$|R

40|$|The {{combination}} of a foot restraint platform designed primarily for use by an astronaut being rigidly and permanently attached to an end effector which is suitable for attachment to the manipulator arm of a remote manipulating system is described. The foot restraint platform is attached by a brace to the end effector at a location away from the grappling interface of the end effector. The platform comprises a support plate provided {{with a pair of}} stirrups for receiving the toe portion of an astronaut's boots when standing on the platform and a pair <b>of</b> <b>heel</b> retainers in <b>the</b> form of raised members which are fixed {{to the surface of the}} platform and located to provide abutment surfaces for abutting engagement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> astronaut's boots when his toes are in <b>the</b> stirrups. <b>The</b> <b>heel</b> retainers preclude a backward sliding movement of the feet on the platform and instead require a lifting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heels</b> in order to extract the feet.
