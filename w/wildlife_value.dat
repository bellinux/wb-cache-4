40|$|The {{conservation}} of wildlife {{is an important}} concern for many political actors. <b>Wildlife</b> is <b>valued</b> {{in a number of}} different ways and the development, priorities and outcomes of conservation policy can be better understood with recognition of these distinct ‘wildlife’ values held by the varied political actors involved in the policy process. This thesis describes these <b>wildlife</b> <b>values</b> and explores their impact on conservation policy through a comparison of six global conservation agreements; the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, Antarctic Treaty system, Ramsar wetlands convention, Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species, Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species, and the Convention on Biological Diversity. It is argued that the policy-arenas within which these agreements developed have features a broad variety of <b>wildlife</b> <b>values,</b> yet that the debate has, in fact, been dominated by just a few. The policy-arena has also featured a broad range of political actors placing distinct <b>values</b> on <b>wildlife.</b> States are characterised as reactive primarily to the economic and political <b>value</b> of <b>wildlife</b> and its conservation. Non-governmental organisations broaden the spectrum of values to include, in particular, ecological and animal-welfare values. The centrality of natural scientists to conservation policy acts to promote the importance of <b>wildlife’s</b> educational <b>value.</b> Business and industrial actors, along with individuals, are also considered to have a significant impact upon the valuation of wildlife. It is argued that the distribution of <b>wildlife</b> <b>values</b> expressed and acted upon in international conservation policy reflects political power or influence. It is further argued that the dominance of economic priorities, with an attendant need to express the <b>value</b> of <b>wildlife</b> economically, tends actually to greatly under-value wildlife. Thus the effectiveness of state-centric wildlife conservation is questioned. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Methylmercury (MeHg) is an {{environmental}} contaminant {{that can have}} adverse effects on wildlife. Because MeHg is produced by bacteria in aquatic ecosystems, studies of MeHg contamination of food webs historically have focused on aquatic organisms. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that terrestrial organisms such as songbirds can be contaminated with MeHg by feeding on MeHg-contaminated spiders. In the present study, the authors examined the risk that MeHg-contaminated terrestrial long-jawed orb weaver spiders (Tetragnatha sp.) pose to songbirds at Caddo Lake (Texas/Louisiana, USA). Methylmercury concentrations in spiders were significantly different in river, wetland, and open-water habitats. The authors calculated spider-based <b>wildlife</b> <b>values</b> (the minimum spider MeHg concentrations causing physiologically significant doses in consumers) to assess exposure risks for arachnivorous birds. Methylmercury concentrations in spiders exceeded <b>wildlife</b> <b>values</b> for Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis) nestlings, with the highest risk in the river habitat. The present study indicates that MeHg concentrations in terrestrial spiders vary with habitat and can pose a threat to small-bodied nestling birds that consume large amounts of spiders at Caddo Lake. This MeHg threat to songbirds may not be unique to Caddo Lake and may extend throughout the southeastern United States. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015; 34 : 303 – 306...|$|R

40|$|The {{economics}} of two selective logging systems were investigated in Sabah, Malaysia. Both logging systems employed chainsaws and bulldozers to extract timber. Reduced impact logging (RIL) differed from conventional logging (CL) {{in that it}} included comprehensive preharvest planning, pre-harvest climber cutting, stock mapping, tree marking, directional felling, {{and a set of}} environmentally-friendly skidding guidelines. RIL has been widely recognised as the logging technique to achieve sustainable utilisation of tropical forest. The main objective of this research was to compare the immediate and long term (60 years) economic costs and benefits of RIL with those of conventional logging (CL) practice in terms of timber and nontimber values. The suit of non-timber benefits included carbon, soil, non-timber forest product namely, rattan, water and <b>wildlife</b> <b>values.</b> The study was carried out in Sabah, Malaysia within the Sabah Foundation forest concession. The primary source of data for this research came from a commercial project that was initiated between Innoprise Corporation Sdn Bhd (Malaysia) and the New England Electric Supplies (USA). The RIL project was aimed at reducing logging damage using RIL, hence, increase carbon sequestration potential in forest biomass. The economic analysis comprised two parts, namely (i) an assessment of the logging impacts on the ecological parameters, and (ii) carrying out an economic cost-benefit analysis. Primary data were collected for the timber, carbon, soil values and rattan values using a system of rectangular plots. The water and <b>wildlife</b> <b>values</b> were based on secondary data from published information. To determine the timber harvest for the second cut, a forest growth model (DIPSIM) was adopted for this purpose. Similarly, the potential future carbon in the logged forest was projected using a carbon recovery model (C-REC). The valuation of the timber and non-timber values was based on the market price and opportunity costs techniques. Future costs and benefits were discounted at rates between 2...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Surveys of bird life in forests below about 600 m a. s. 1. in the West Coast Beech Project Area {{have shown}} wide {{differences}} {{from place to}} place in the abundance or 13 more common native birds.

The results are consistent with the diversity of bird habitats in the West Coast Beech Project Area and provide a basis for its representation in a network of conservation areas. The <b>wildlife</b> <b>values</b> of the Area are as much a function of the large expanse of continuous, relatively undisturbed forests as the diversity of habitats itself. Alternative strategies for management of the production forests are examined in relation to the maintenance of this continuity, and recommendations are put forward...|$|R
