Munster tenants availed of land purchase in exceptionally high numbers, encouraged by their Irish Land and Labour Association's leader D. D.

The hierarchy and authority empower employers and supervisors <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>rights</b> of resource allocation, rewards and punishment, which in turn reinforce their status, as well as enable them to lead and guide their subordinates autocratically. The hierarchical differentiation between the top and the bottom gradually creates an invisible gap in the workplace, where the subordinates tend to build greater sensitivity and cautiousness when communicating with their supervisors.|$|R

However, both Qatari and non-Qatar women are affected by a wage gap, in which they are paid 25 to 50 percent less than men. In addition, Qatar greatly partakes in social allowances for men which include amenities such as housing, and travel allotments, that female employees are less likely to receive.

40|$|The law {{and finance}} {{literature}} highlights {{the role of}} investor rights in financial development, firm corporate governance, and financing patterns. For a panel of 35 countries, we investigate how bankruptcy use relates to countries' creditor rights and judicial efficiency. Bankruptcies are higher in countries <b>with</b> <b>more</b> creditor <b>rights,</b> except for a "no automatic stay on assets" provision. Higher judicial efficiency is associated <b>with</b> <b>more</b> bankruptcies and appears as a substitute <b>with</b> <b>more</b> creditor <b>rights.</b> Although only a first step, our findings suggest creditor rights are complex, balancing prioritization of claims, ex ante risk-taking incentives, and an efficient resolution of distressed firms.

5000|$|Research {{has found}} that {{compensatory}} stereotypes might lead to increased justification of the status quo. That is, stereotypes that have components that would offset the negative aspects of the stereotypes would allow people to more easily explain or justify the inequality of the prevailing system. One of the more common examples is the compensatory stereotype of “poor but happy” or “rich but miserable.” [...] Stereotypes like these that incorporate a positive aspect to counterbalance the negative aspect would lead people to increase their justification of the status quo. Interestingly, other findings suggested that these compensatory stereotypes are preferred by those <b>with</b> <b>more</b> left leaning political ideologies, while those <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>right</b> leaning political ideologies preferred non-complimentary stereotypes that simply rationalized inequality rather than compensated for it. [...] But that overall, conservatives {{were more likely to}} have increased system justification tendencies than liberals.|$|R

Critics {{argue that these}} are unlikely to have made any actual difference in reality. Others contend that international regimes can improve {{respect for human rights}} in state parties, particularly in more democratic countries or countries with a strong civil society devoted to human rights and with transnational links. Our findings suggest that rarely does treaty ratification have unconditional effects on human rights. Instead, improvement in human <b>rights</b> is typically <b>more</b> likely the more democratic the country or the more international non-governmental organizations its citizens participate in. Conversely, in very autocratic regimes with weak civil society, ratification can be expected to have no effect and is sometimes even associated <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>rights</b> violation. ...|$|R

40|$|Beginning {{with the}} passage of the Lanterman-Petris- Short Act in 1969, deinstitutionalization in California has had a devastating effect on the mentally ill. Instead of affording the mentally ill <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>rights</b> and protections, the process of {{shutting}} down state psychiatric hospitals and impeding psychiatric care for those in need caused a cascade effect leading to an increase of homelessness and incarceration. Over the past four decades, prisons and jails in California have become the de facto state mental hospitals, with severely mentally ill individuals having nearly a four-to-one chance of ending up in jail or prison over a psychiatric facility of some variety. This restructuring of mental health services has contributed to the ever-increasing problem of mass incarceration – a problem that has reached epidemic levels in recent years. To that end, solutions to this problem include: community-based mental health services, reopening some state psychiatric hospitals with greater oversight, funding medical research into improved treatment options, and community education aimed at fostering a greater understanding of mental health issues...|$|R

40|$|With {{the level}} of {{urbanization}} in China now exceeding 50 %, its collective rural land system is under increasing pressure, creating conditions {{in which there is}} increasing conflict between the efficient use of land for agricultural purposes and its retention as security for the rural population. This paper first examines the fundamental nature of China's collective land system by analyzing the collectivization history of China, then provides a comprehensive appraisal of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the collective land system's role in history and the challenges it faces in modern times. The main changes needed for the current collective system are identified as (1) the establishment of a new transfer mechanism for potential collective construction land, (2) the completion of land rights verification and consolidation work, and (3) the endowment of villagers <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>rights</b> to enjoy the distribution of land incremental value. The paper's main contribution is to question the relevance of collective rural land system in contemporary China, where a shift is now taking place from one of pure economic development to one involving more social concerns, and propose potential viable amendments to integrate the need for both perspectives...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the modern}} Olympic Games were first held in 1896, {{not a single}} woman was allowed to compete. The International Olympic Committee did not promote gender {{equality}} in sports for its first fifty years, but it gradually began changing its views on the topic and followed the lead of many progressive countries that were starting to view women as equal in almost all spheres of life. This attitude {{has led to a}} positive trend in which women are becoming more involved in sports, especially evident at the Olympic level. Over time, as women gained <b>more</b> <b>rights</b> in other areas of their lives, this followed <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>rights</b> in areas regarding participation in sports. Not all countries have the same policies regarding women’s participation, but {{it can be said that}} women participation in sport has significantly increased over time. A country’s view on if women should be allowed to participate in sport involves the country’s culture and society. Sometimes culture and society do not move in lockstep with each other, though, which is what causes some women to be discriminated against for their desire to participate in sport. In some more traditional countries, sport is still considered a manly activity and not suitable for women participation. [...] The IOC is very involved in issues regarding gender equality in sports and is trying to set an example for countries and other organizations to follow in regards to sports participation.|$|R
