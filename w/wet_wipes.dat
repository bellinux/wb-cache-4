It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations, but proved {{difficult to use}} due to {{the time required to}} set up, use, and stow. The shower, which {{featured a}} plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using <b>wet</b> <b>wipes,</b> with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.|$|E

40|$|It was the {{objective}} of this project to provide a glass cleaner formulation for a <b>wet</b> <b>wipe</b> application with cleaning and anti-fogging properties. This glass cleaner formulation was developed for automotive glass i. e. interior of windscreens. This formulation relates to a glass cleaner with a composition comprising of: (a) a blend of amphoteric surfactants; (b) a solvent system with a combination of glycol ethers; and (c) an aqueous solvent system. This glass formulation must provide good cleaning properties while also providing good wetting and sheeting properties to assist with anti-fogging properties. The objectives were obtained using 2 specific approaches: The first was by using a blend of 2 amphoteric surfactants in an alkaline medium, allowing the glass surface to become more hydrophilic which will also assist with reduction of surface tension on the glass surface. The second was by using the glycol ethers that have good coupling properties and surface tension reducing properties. The formulation was evaluated using commercial standard test methods as per the industry. A predictive model was successfully obtained for each of the five criteria that were evaluated using the 25 formulations derived from the statistical design. There were variables and variable interactions that were antagonistic for some of the criteria which were found to be synergistic for others. To achieve satisfactory cleaning, the fogging rating had to be compromise...|$|R

50|$|The {{fingerboard}} is {{a crucial}} part of the guitar. It is generally made up of ebony or rosewood. It is not flat in shape. At the one end of the fingerboard it has radius of 16, with this we achieve low action and also prevents buzz while string bending. At the other end of fingerboard, it has radius of 10 for the purpose of comfort. First of all, Design of fingerboard is prepared on some commercial software like,aspire. If it has some kind of additional aesthetic design, then how it will look like in reality, is interpreted. The aesthetic design is split and pieces, required for it, are sorted out in design. To get exact size and shape, separate design for pieces are prepared and code is generated. For precision work and repeatability, the cutting is done on cnc machine with the help of code. The cutting parameters are specified then pieces are cut. Also the radiusing is done on the fingerboard. Then pockets are generated on the fingerboard for the accommodation of pieces. Pieces are glued in the pockets. To get finish and removal of extra glue sanding is done on this. <b>Wet</b> <b>wipe</b> is done on this for cleaning and then oiling is done. After this fret slot cutting is done to put steel wire fret in that. At last nut pocket is generated for locking nut.|$|R

40|$|The {{work for}} this master's thesis, which was {{performed}} at Medibiome, {{was a part}} of a Vinnova-funded national project “Innovation mot Infektion” for the establishment and evaluation of a draft standard FprEN 16615 in order to evaluate different disinfection and analytical methods. Healthcare associated infections are a global issue and the need for new methods to reduce contamination and evaluate efficiency of disinfection is increasingly recognized in scientific, clinical and political communities. In order to evaluate the antibacterial efficiency of cleaning and disinfecting products, test floorings were inoculated with bacterial suspensions and an interfering substance, and wiped with a product. A unitary weight was used to standardize the wiping. The bacteria load on the surface was swabbed after wiping and the remaining bacterial load was evaluated after plate cultivation. The ATP bioluminescence analysis was used during a similar procedure to replace the plate cultivation method. The enzyme luciferase provided light emission while degrading the ATP contained into bacteria. The light emission is measured to determine the bacterial load on the surface. The compatibility of wiping materials and cleaning agents was also tested with a test suspension of S. aureus. The recovery of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa after different drying times on surfaces was studied. The results show that three disinfectants meet the requirements of the standard FprEN 1661 : DES 45, Rely+On™ Virkon® and <b>Wet</b> <b>Wipe.</b> Input was transmitted to the standard committee, especially regarding the need to sterilize the wipes, to standardize and improve the release of bacteria from the swab, and to decrease the weight of the granite block for more clinical relevance.
