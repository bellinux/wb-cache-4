500|$|For the {{upcoming}} God of War title, Barlog explained that Kratos {{had to change}} his cycle of violence {{and learn how to}} control his rage. He said that Kratos had made many bad decisions, which led to the destruction of Olympus, and wanted to know what would happen if Kratos made a good decision. The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos' character change. The canceled live-action Star Wars television series was also an influence. The bond between Kratos and his son {{is at the heart of}} the game and Barlog said [...] "This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god, and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again." [...] Referencing the Marvel Comics character Hulk, Barlog said that in regards to Kratos, [...] "We've already told the story of The Hulk. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the story of Banner now." [...] Christopher Judge, best known as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1, replaces T.C. Carson as the voice of Kratos in the game; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original God of War. Commenting in response to the change, Carson said, [...] "Sony went in a new direction." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} eight months of development, game {{director}} Cory Barlog left Santa Monica for unexplained reasons and Stig Asmussen (lead environment artist and art director on God of War and God of War II, respectively) became director. In an interview with IGN, Asmussen said that Barlog [...] "had a major impact on the game" [...] and although he had left the team, they spoke several times afterwards and [...] "bounced a few ideas off him," [...] but there was no formal collaboration. He also said that David Jaffe [...] " [...] been around the studio a few times" [...] and they [...] " [...] gone over some high-level stuff with him to get his observations and feedback." [...] Early in development when Barlog was still with the team, he expressed interest in a cooperative mode [...] "if we can do something unique with it". In November 2009, Asmussen told GamePro that although a multiplayer option had been discussed, it was unsuitable for God of War III: [...] "There's a story <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> and an experience we want to deliver, and multi-player doesn't fit into that." [...] By December 2009, the game was in its final developmental stages.|$|E

500|$|Using two {{digital video}} (DV) cameras, Bartley and ÓBriain shot over 200 hours of {{material}} on 300 DV tapes. They intended that editing take ten weeks; instead, it took six months. Rod Stoneman, BSÉ's CEO at the time, described {{the amount of}} footage compared to the film's final length as [...] "exceptional". The 200:1 ratio was far above the norm for most documentaries, which usually have a ratio of 10:1 or 15:1. When the filmmakers returned to Ireland, they decided they needed an editor who spoke Spanish. Bartley remembered a documentary she had seen about baseball in Cuba, El juego de Cuba, so they hired its editor, Ángel Hernández Zoido. Zoido approached the film {{as if it were}} entertainment, feeling that the primary concern was to ensure the audience did not get bored. He tackled each scene the same way. After watching the rushes with Bartley and ÓBriain, Zoido asked them, [...] "What do <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> in this scene?" [...] He focused on two factors: how much information would be necessary to drive the plot, and provide an emotional core. Preferring to work alone, Zoido would then send the filmmakers from the edit suite. After Zoido completed the scene, the trio discussed whether those aims had been realized.|$|E
500|$|Atwell had stated on {{potential}} further seasons, [...] "We {{think that there}} could be more to come....the [...] finale doesn't suggest that that's it and they live happily ever after; that's the end. We know that's not the case. They've done it in a very clever way which wraps up and that gives the audience a very satisfying conclusion but they're not quite finishing it and leaving it there." [...] On the location for a third season, Fazekas stated that moving the series to London had been a possibility, an idea that creators Markus and McFeely had early on. Fazekas added, [...] "you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [...] all going to be determined by what story <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> I loved [...] I loved how it looked, I loved how it looked on Peggy. We would be very happy to do another L.A. season, but we're not married to it." [...] Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and {{that the end of the}} second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file, was [...] "very much tied to a third season arc", with the shooter and their reason for taking the file already determined. Atwell added that the third season would have gone [...] "further back into [...] past” while having [...] "a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [...] family." [...] She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael.|$|E

One week later, Theodore Roosevelt asked President Wilson for {{permission}} to lead a [...] "Rough Rider"-type regiment against the Germans in France. While Roosevelt was waiting for Wilson's answer, he got some kidding from his friend Masterson, who wrote Roosevelt on May 14, 1917: [...] "I wish you would arrange for an appointment with Tex Rickard and myself to meet you at your office when convenient. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you how to organize your European expedition and how to win your battles when you get there." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{film has}} been criticized as propaganda. Critics felt the {{documentary}} lacked information about Mormon history, its tenets, and its controversies. Producer Jeff Roberts responded to these reviews saying, [...] "Most reviewers <b>wanted</b> the movie <b>to</b> be controversial, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> stories about those who make up our base."

2500|$|In 1997, {{the year}} Steve Jobs {{returned}} to Apple, Dell founder and CEO Michael Dell was {{asked how he}} would fix Apple. Dell responded: [...] "I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders". This angered Jobs, due to Dell's success with its online store originally built by NeXT, Jobs' former business that Apple acquired to bring Jobs back. A team of Apple and NeXT employees spent several months building an online store that {{would be better than}} Dell's. On November 10, 1997, Steve Jobs announced the online store at an Apple press event, and during his keynote speech, he said: [...] "I guess what <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, Michael, is that with our new products and our new store and our new build-to-order manufacturing, we're coming after you, buddy." ...|$|E

He left for France in 1977 after 10 years in Israel. He is chairman of Peace Now in France. He said the group seeks to support Israel's long-term future because [...] "as friends, as Jews, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you that you are going down a wrong path. I think our initiative is actually helping Israel's image in Europe. It is a pretty low image over here these days, because of what happened in Gaza, mainly, and it is commonly believed in Europe that Israel is the provocative, negative side of the conflict—the one that is blocking the peace process." [...] He claimed that [...] "We’re not saying that only Israel is responsible for the problem. As Jews tied to Israel, we speak to the Israelis. So this is a call to the Israelis, but of course [...] have a lot of the responsibility for the continuation of the conflict." [...] He affirmed, on behalf of the membership that [...] "our connection to the state of Israel is part of our identity," [...] but in Europe [...] "Israel is seen as responsible for all the problems [...]" [...] Chemla added that the group's was not a movement as such after the first petition but hoped to become one.|$|E

In the third season of Samurai Jack there’s an episode called “Jack and Travelling Creatures” where, after trials and tribulations aplenty, we catch a glimpse of a possible future for our wandering hero; we see Jack as an older Warrior-King, a veteran of an untold number of conflicts. Zub stated that the team is [...] "embracing that awesome vision of Jack in a very heartfelt done-in-one story called 'Mako the Scribe'."
