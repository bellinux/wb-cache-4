Analysis of air-gap flux probe data can pinpoint the number and location (pole and coil) of shorted turns without having to take the generator offline.

EFFECTS OF SHORTED TURNS IN ROTOR WINDINGS The impact of operating a round rotor generator with rotor <b>winding</b> <b>shorted</b> turns depends upon many factors 1. If the percentage of total turns shorted out is small, the generator may be able to run at rated load for years without further problems. However, larger shorted turn percentages can cause operating conditions that may limit unit loads. If the problems become severe, forced outages may occur. Conditions that may result in running a rotor with shorted-turns include: 1. Rotor unbalance that varies with field current changes (thermal sensitivity). Coils with shorted-turns operate at lower temperatures than coils without shorted-turns. This i...|$|R

40|$|Differential {{protection}} {{is a popular}} method to protect aircraft generators against winding faults. Traditional relay-based systems have a limited capability to distinguish between differential current resulting from a winding fault, and the one resulting from measurement noise or current saturation, resulting in false alarms and unnecessary equipment shutdown. Modern aircraft generators are monitored and controlled by advanced generator control units, and therefore, sophisticated signal processing algorithms can be implemented to enhance the differential protection performance. We propose and compare four different differential detector designs, based on the available information about measured currents, for detection of persistent, short circuit faults in the protected windings. Also, current sensors are subject to intermittent, open circuit, cable faults, resulting in degradation in the differential detection performance. We propose an optimal differential protection architecture, based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion, to detect <b>winding</b> <b>short</b> circuit faults {{in the presence of}} intermittent cable faults. In this architecture, the system switches between two different detectors, depending on the cable health state. ...|$|R

The proposed online technique is based on considering the correlation between the instantaneous input and output voltage difference (ΔV) and the input current of a particular phase as a finger print of the transformer that could be measured every cycle to identify any incipient mechanical deformation within power transformers. To precisely emulate real transformer operation under various winding mechanical deformations, a detailed three-dimensional finite-element model is developed. Detailed simulations with (non) sinusoidal excitation are performed and analysed to demonstrate the unique impact of each fault on the ΔV-I locus. Impact of harmonic order, magnitude and phase angle is also investigated. Furthermore, practical measurements have been performed to validate the effect of <b>winding</b> <b>short</b> circuit fault on the proposed ΔV-I locus without and with the impact of system harmonics...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} a fault {{detection}} scheme for different percentage of stator <b>winding</b> <b>short</b> circuit is presented for three phase induction motors. In the examined case, the induction motor in the faulty and healthy {{case has been}} transformed in the two phase (q−d) model. The model has been identified by the utilization of a Least Squares Set Membership Identification (SMI) algorithm, where additional to the identified parameters, confidence intervals can be also calculated, based on a priori knowledge for the corrupting measurement noise. The identified confidence intervals in an μ–dimensional space can be represented as hyper–ellipsoids having as a center the identified parameters’ vector. The novelty of this article stems from the proposal of a fast and geometrical based scheme, which relies on the calculation of the distance among centers of hyper–ellipsoids and the corresponding intersection in each iteration of the identification procedure. Detailed analysis of the proposed fault detection strategy, as also extended simulation results are being presented that prove {{the efficiency of the}} suggested scheme.

When turn-to-turn short circuit fault happens to rotor winding of the generator, the generator terminal parameters will change.

The satisfactory results in fault diagnosis can be obtained by the application of neural network. In general, the information about the severity level of the generator faults can be acquired directly when the faulty samples are found in the training samples of neural network.
