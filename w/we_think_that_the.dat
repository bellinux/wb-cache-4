5|$|To {{summarize}} {{and conclude}} upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA 703) is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe {{rules of conduct}} {{to be applied to}} particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and {{of the nature of the}} few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.|$|E
25|$|The {{court is}} {{informed}} that the plaintiff in error {{is no longer in}} the service of the state. We see nothing to be gained by prolonging the life of this bizarre case. On the contrary, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> peace and dignity of the state, which all criminal prosecutions are brought to redress, will be the better conserved by the entry of a nolle prosequi herein. Such a course is suggested to the Attorney General.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} step which is {{normally}} overlooked {{by the top}} level management is defining the exact problem. Though <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> problem identification is obvious, many times it is not. The rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process. If {{the problem is not}} identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem. Hence, {{it is very important that}} the definition of the problem is the same among all group members. Only then is it possible for the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner.|$|E

[...] Pakistan's chief adviser on internal security, Rehman Malik, said [...] "the authorities would fight on until the last terrorist is cleared. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> safe Pakistan, safe Afghanistan is safety for the world and therefore we will not let them have easy way." ...|$|E

People say that these things happen in wartime {{and that there is}} loyalty to the army and loyalty among the troops, which causes these things to disappear beneath the carpet. But I believe that we are betraying our real responsibility, which is to take these skeletons out of the closet, even if <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> enemy has more skeletons than us.

5000|$|Wahid said: All {{religions}} {{insist on}} peace. From this <b>we</b> might <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> religious struggle for peace is simple ... {{but it is}} not.

60|$|Of Home's successes with Sir William Crookes, Lord Crawford, and others, {{something}} {{remains to}} be said; but first we shall look into attempted explanations of alleged physical phenomena occurring not {{in the presence of}} a paid or even of a recognised 'Medium.'

"We are {{of opinion}} that Master Sankey, by aiding this {{rebellion}} against his master, has done wrongly, {{and that he}} erred grievously in discharging a heavy missile at his master; {{at the same time}} <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> provocation that he received by the tyranny which has been proved to have been exercised by Mr. Hathorn toward the boys under his charge, and especially by their unjust punishment for an offense which the complainant conceived without sufficient warrant, or indeed without any warrant at all, that they had committed, to a great extent justifies and excuses the conduct of Master Sankey. Therefore, with a reprimand as to his behavior, and a caution as to the consequences which might have arisen from his allowing his temper to go beyond bounds, we discharge him.|$|E
