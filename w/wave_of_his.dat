25|$|Unser {{rode the}} <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fourth Indy victory {{to secure a}} ride at Penske for the Michigan 500, Pocono 500, and Marlboro Challenge for 1987. Near {{the end of the}} year, Unser had two other starts. He drove as a {{substitute}} for Roberto Guerrero at Nazareth, and had a competitive run until crashing a few laps short of the finish. He was then hired to drive the brand new Porsche Indy car at Laguna Seca. The team was still in its infancy, and the car dropped out. Unser left the team after only one race.|$|E
25|$|Osborn {{planned to}} send eight flatboats each with 35 {{soldiers}} in the first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> assault. Howe declined to give the order for the 400-man storming party to attack, waiting for a high tide and hoping that the garrison would evacuate the fort. That evening, Thayer gave the order to abandon Fort Mifflin. The 300 survivors and what equipment could be salvaged were rowed across to Red Bank. Thayer held back a detail of 40 men. These troops burned down the barracks at midnight and soon joined the others in New Jersey. Thayer {{was the last to}} leave.|$|E
500|$|The second Milton Berle Show {{appearance}} came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. Berle {{persuaded the}} singer {{to leave his}} guitar backstage, advising, [...] "Let 'em see you, son." [...] During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of [...] "Hound Dog" [...] with a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic, exaggerated body movements. Presley's gyrations created a storm of controversy. Newspaper critics were outraged: Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability.... His phrasing, {{if it can be}} called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub.... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway." [...] Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music [...] "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley.... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos". Ed Sullivan, whose own variety show was the nation's most popular, declared him [...] "unfit for family viewing". To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as [...] "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called [...] "one of the most childish expressions I ever heard, comin' from an adult." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Nation of October 1987 noted: [...] "'Hill was shaken, {{he became}} very disturbed, {{by the case}} of the son of a thirty-year embassy employee, a student who was arrested, never to be seen again,' {{recalled}} former New York Times reporter [...] 'Hill took a personal interest.' He went to the Interior Minister, an army general with whom he had worked on drug cases, saying, 'Hey, what about this? We're interested in this case.' He buttonholed (Foreign Minister Cesar) Guzzetti and, finally, President Jorge R. Videla himself. 'All he got was stonewalling; he got nowhere.' de Onis said. 'His last year was marked by increasing disillusionment and dismay, and he backed his staff on human rights right to the hilt." [...] "It sickened me," [...] said Patricia Derian, the Mississippi civil rights crusader who became President Jimmy Carter's State Department point person on human rights, after Hill reported to her Kissinger's real role, [...] "that with an imperial <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand, an American could sentence people to death {{on the basis of a}} cheap whim. As time went on I saw Kissinger's footprints in a lot of countries. It was the repression of a democratic ideal." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a case in}} point, Hazlitt {{brings in}} Irving's own mentor, the Scottish theologian, scientist, philosopher, and {{minister}} Dr. Thomas Chalmers (1780â€“1847), whom Hazlitt had heard preach in Glasgow. Comparing the published writings of both men, Chalmers was, thought Hazlitt, much more interesting as a thinker. Although he ultimately dismisses Chalmers' arguments as [...] "sophistry", Hazlitt admires the elder clergyman's [...] "scope of intellect" [...] and [...] "intensity of purpose". His Astronomical Discourses were engaging enough that Hazlitt had eagerly read through the entire volume at a sitting. His claim to our attention must rest on his writings; his unprepossessing appearance and ungainly manner in themselves, maintains Hazlitt, drew no audience. Chalmers' follower Irving, on the other hand, gets by {{on the strength of}} his towering physique and the novelty of his performances; judging him as a writer (his For the Oracles of God, Four Orations had just gone into a third edition), [...] Hazlitt finds that [...] "the ground work of his compositions is trashy and hackneyed, though set off by extravagant metaphors and an affected phraseology ... without the turn of his head and <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand, his periods have nothing in them ... he himself is the only idea with which he has yet enriched the public mind!" ...|$|E
60|$|Herr Freudenberg smiled. With a <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand {{they were}} alone.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now would I {{give the}} world," [...] he exclaimed with great interest, [...] "for a hook and line, a fish-spear, or any piscatorial {{instrument}} of death! Look, Ellen, {{you can see}} the <b>waving</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tail from beneath the bank!" ...|$|R
60|$|It was in {{the eastern}} or blue chamber in which stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words. They rang {{throughout}} the seven rooms loudly and clearly, for the prince was a bold and robust man, and the music had become hushed at the <b>waving</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|R

50|$|On 19 February 1945, Colonel Wornham {{landed with}} the first <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{regiment}} on Iwo Jima. He personally participated in the reconnaissance of the terrain under heavy mortar and small-arms fire and when one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> battalion was halted by enemy's fire, Wornham rallied his men to renew the attack and inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese. For his gallantry in action, he was decorated with Navy Cross.|$|R

60|$|The {{stranger}} was old {{and bent}} and had a great beard which hid almost his entire face except for two piercing eyes, a great nose {{and a bit of}} wrinkled forehead. When he spoke, he accompanied his words with many shrugs <b>of</b> <b>his</b> narrow shoulders and with <b>waving</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arms and other strange and amusing gesticulations. The child was fascinated. Here was the first amusement <b>of</b> <b>his</b> little starved life. He listened intently to the conversation, which was in French.|$|R
60|$|In {{the still}} burning {{air of the}} windless {{afternoon}} he made the <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> agony travel {{as far as the}} O. S. N. Company's offices. Captain Mitchell on the balcony, trying to make out what went on generally, had heard him faintly but distinctly, and the feeble and appalling sound lingered in his ears after he had retreated indoors with blanched cheeks. He had been driven off the balcony several times during that afternoon.|$|R

50|$|On 15 September 1916 at Ginchy, France, {{during the}} Battle of the Somme, Lieutenant Colonel Campbell took {{personal}} {{command of the}} third line when the first two <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> battalion had been decimated by machine-gun and rifle fire. He rallied his men and led them against the enemy machine-guns, capturing the guns and killing the personnel. Later in the day he again rallied the survivors <b>of</b> <b>his</b> battalion and led them through very heavy hostile fire. His personal gallantry and initiative at a very critical moment enabled the division to press on and capture objectives of the highest tactical importance.|$|R
60|$|Respecting the {{stricture}} laid by Judge Menefee against comments {{upon the}} stories, all were silent when the passenger who was nobody in particular had concluded. And then the ingenious originator {{of the contest}} cleared his throat to begin the ultimate entry for the prize. Though seated with small comfort upon the floor, you might search in vain for any abatement of dignity in Judge Menefee. The now diminishing firelight played softly upon his face, as clearly chiselled as a Roman emperor's on some old coin, and upon the thick <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> honourable grey hair.|$|R

5000|$|Castro began {{recruiting}} from {{an office}} in Paris in 1842 and the first <b>of</b> <b>his</b> recruits sailed into the port of Galveston, Texas, on January 1, 1843. In the fall of 1843, Castro recruits in Alsace, Baden, and Switzerland. <b>Waves</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> colonists departed for Texas {{in the winter of}} 1843 and spring of 1844. Castro left Europe for Texas on May 19, 1844, by way of New Orleans. He made it to San Antonio in July 1844 to meet with the colonists and was escorted by the Texas Rangers to inspect his land grant. The first of Castro's colonists arrived at the land on September 2, 1844.|$|R
