5|$|NY345 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US11 {{in the village}} of Potsdam, just north of Clarkson University.

5|$|East of NY198, {{the road}} becomes more open {{as it passes}} through neighborhoods with a more {{suburban}} residential feel to them. Along this stretch, NY33 connects to several streets, including Bailey Avenue (U.S. Route62 or US62) and Harlem Road (NY240). Past Harlem Road, the expressway makes a slight curve to the south as it prepares to meet a toll-free section of the New York State Thruway (I-90) at a cloverleaf interchange. Beyond I-90, the expressway veers to the south again, traversing an S-curve before connecting to Union Road (NY277) by <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> partial interchange.

His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B major, Thème et variations in C major, and Huit pièces brèves. For piano duet, Fauré composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil André Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth.|$|E

5|$|For {{the next}} , the route passes by open fields as it overlooks {{the lake to}} the east. The route {{gradually}} descends back into the valley as it heads further northward into the town of Fleming. Once in Fleming, NY38 runs along the lakeshore and serves {{a long line of}} lakeside homes as it passes by a series of fields to the west. The amount of development along the route begins to increase at the northern end of the lake in the hamlet of Melrose Park, where NY38 meets NY437 by <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traffic circle. At this point, NY437 becomes the primary lakeside highway while NY38 becomes a four-lane divided highway and heads northwest as Lake Avenue toward the city of Auburn.|$|E

At Birkleland, there are few remains of the line, although when leaving the village, part of the line {{is used as a}} pathway. Further along, the route is disused, but fenced in.
