500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out {{and the whole thing}} revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions." [...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think {{it may have been a}} little bit too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>do</b> for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E

[...] Myers also indicated in a press release for the college magazine, Sarah Lawrence, that the college will be involved in developing the new database of colleges discussed in the Annapolis Group statement as they [...] "believe in accountability and openness, and that the public has a right to solid and reliable information about the important decisions involved in choosing a college." [...] The press release also indicated that Sarah Lawrence [...] "plans not to participate in the peer reputational survey or data collection for U.S. News and World Report’s rankings" [...] as, according to Myers, [...] "by submitting data and the peer reputation survey we have tacitly been endorsing these rankings [...] all the information we have provided to U.S. News in the past will be available to the public through other channels.” ...|$|E
