40|$|There is a {{consistent}} {{finding in the}} research literature that, overall, females have lower global self-esteem than males, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) {{is by far the}} most widely used measure of global self-esteem in psychological research. My goal is to determine whether or not this gender difference in self-esteem scores can be partially explained by <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RSES. In particular, self-esteem scores appear to vary with the use of the verbs 2 ̆ 2 think 2 ̆ 2 versus 2 ̆ 2 feel 2 ̆ 2 in <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RSES. Four versions of the RSES were created: the original RSES, a version using only the verb 2 ̆ 2 feel 2 ̆ 2 in appropriate items, a version using only the verb 2 ̆ 2 think 2 ̆ 2 in such items, and a version that eliminates the verbs 2 ̆ 2 think 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 feel. 2 ̆ 2 Self-esteem scores will be examined using a 4 (RSES version) x 2 (gender) ANOVA.

If my hypothesis is supported, then it is possible that the reported gender difference in self-esteem is not as large as previously believed and that the RSES is biased against women. In this case, a critical reexamination of the validity of the RSES is required...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves [50]- 53. v, 53 l tablesThe {{results of}} a number of studies suggest that words acquire both {{attitudinal}} meaning and instrumental reinforcing properties in accordance with the principles of classical conditioning. On the basis of these findings, as they have been incorporated and extended within a general theory of human motivation, hypotheses have been deduced concerning the stimulus properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> comprising interest inventories. Specifically, it has been suggested by Staats that <b>the</b> <b>words</b> comprising <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Strong Vocational Interest Blank should function as (1) elicitors of classically conditionable emotional responses; (2) reinforcers for instrumental behaviors; and (3) discriminative stimuli controlling approach and avoidance behaviors. The present investigation was designed to test the hypothesis that interest inventory <b>items</b> are elicitors <b>of</b> classically conditionable emotional responses. A higher-order conditioning procedure was used in which <b>items</b> from <b>the</b> Strong Vocational Interest Blank were employed as UCSs and nonsense syllables as CSs. <b>Items</b> for which <b>the</b> subjects had positive interest, as indicated by a pre-test, were paired with one CS; <b>items</b> <b>of</b> negative interest were paired with a different CS.

40|$|Contextual {{information}} {{extracted from}} corpora is frequently used to model semantic similarity. We discuss distinct classes of context types and compare their effectiveness for compound noun interpretation. Contexts corresponding to word-word similarity perform better than contexts corresponding to relation similarity, even when relational co-occurrences are extracted from {{a much larger}} corpus. Combining word-similarity and relation-similarity kernels further improves SVM classification performance. Similarity Types and Co-Occurrence Contexts We can model different kinds of semantic similarity by using different definitions of co-occurrence context. When extracting corpus information to interpret a compound such as bread knife, {{there are a number}} of context types that might plausibly be of interest: <b>Word</b> Similarity: <b>The</b> contexts in which instances of each constituent appear e. g., all sentences containing <b>the</b> <b>word</b> bread or <b>the</b> <b>word</b> knife.

Relation Similarity: The contexts in which both constituents appear together e. g., all sentences containing both bread and knife. Token Similarity: The context in which the particular compound token was found. The definition of “context ” can range from a simple window <b>of</b> <b>words</b> around <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>of</b> interest to information extracted from syntactic parses.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent to which {{measures}} and operationalisations of intra-organisational trust reflect the essential elements of the existing conceptualisation of trust inside the workplace. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an overview of the essential points from the rich variety of competing conceptualisations and definitions in the management and organisational literatures. It draws on this overview to present a framework of issues for researchers to consider when designing research based on trust. This framework is then used to analyse the content of 14 recently published empirical measures of intra-organisational trust. It is noted for each measure the form that trust takes, the content, the sources of evidence and the identity of the recipient, as well as matters related to <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>items.</b> Findings – <b>The</b> paper highlights where existing measures match the theory, but also shows a number of “blind-spots” or contradictions, particularly over the content of the trust belief, the selection of possible sources of evidence for trust, and inconsistencies in the identity of the referent. Research limitations/implications – It offers researchers some recommendations for future research designed to capture trust among different parties in organisations, and contains an Appendix with 14 measures for intra-organisational trust. Originality/value – The value of the paper is twofold: it provides an overview of the conceptualisation literature, and a detailed content-analysis of several different measures for trust. This should prove useful in helping researchers refine their research designs in the future...|$|R
40|$|Internet privacy {{concerns}} (IPC) {{is an area}} of study that is receiving increased attention due to the huge amount of personal information being gathered, stored, transmitted, and published on the Internet. While there is an emerging literature on IPC, there is limited agreement about its conceptualization in terms of its key dimensions and its factor structure. Based on the multidimensional developmental theory and a review of the prior literature, we identify alternative conceptualizations of IPC. We examine the various conceptualizations of IPC with four online surveys involving nearly 4, 000 Internet users. As a baseline, study 1 compares the integrated conceptualization of IPC to two existing conceptualizations in the literature. While the results provide support for the integrated conceptualization, the second-order factor model does not outperform the correlated first-order factor model. Study 2 replicates the study on a different sample and confirms the results of study 1. We also investigate whether the prior results are affected by the different perspectives adopted in <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> in <b>the</b> original instruments. In study 3, we find that focusing on one's concern for website behavior (rather than one's expectation of website behavior) and adopting a consistent perspective in <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> help to improve the validity of the factor structure. We then examine the hypothesized third-order conceptualizations of IPC through a number of alternative higher-order models. The empirical results confirm that, in general, the third-order conceptualizations of IPC outperform their lower-order alternatives. In addition, the conceptualization of IPC that has the best fit with the data contains a third-order general IPC factor, two second-order factors of interaction management and information management, and six first-order factors (i. e., collection, secondary usage, errors, improper access, control, and awareness). Study 4 cross-validates the results with another data set and examines IPC {{within the context of a}} nomological network. The results confirm that the third-order conceptualization of IPC has nomological validity, and it is a significant determinant of both trusting beliefs and risk beliefs. Our research helps to resolve inconsistencies in the key underlying dimensions of IPC, the factor structure of IPC, and <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>items</b> in prior instruments of IPC.

40|$|Background: Teamwork is a ‘soft skill’ {{employability}} competence {{desired by}} employers. Poor teamwork skills in healthcare {{have an impact}} on adverse outcomes. Teamwork skills are rarely the focus of teaching and assessment in undergraduate courses. The TeamUP Rubric is a tool used to teach and evaluate undergraduate students’ teamwork skills. Students also use the rubric to give anonymised peer feedback during team-based academic assignments. The rubric’s five domains focus on planning, environment, facilitation, conflict management and individual contribution; each domain is grounded in relevant theory. Students earn marks for their teamwork skills; validity of the assessment rubric is critical. Question: To what extent do experts agree that the TeamUP Rubric is a valid assessment of ‘teamwork skills’? Design: Modified Delphi technique incorporating Feminist Collaborative Conversations. Participants: A heterogeneous panel of 35 professionals with recognised expertise in communications and/or teamwork. Methods: Three Delphi rounds using a survey that included the rubric were conducted either face-to-face, by telephone or online. Quantitative analysis yielded item content validity indices (I-CVI); minimum consensus was pre-set at 70 %. An average of the I-CVI also yielded sub-scale (domain) (D-CVI/Ave) and scale content validity indices (S-CVI/Ave). After each Delphi round, qualitative data were analysed and interpreted; Feminist Collaborative Conversations by the research team aimed to clarify and confirm consensus about <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> on <b>the</b> rubric. Results: Consensus (at 70 %) was obtained for all but one behavioural descriptor of the rubric. We modified that descriptor to address expert concerns. The TeamUP Rubric (Version 4) can be considered to be well validated at that level of consensus. The final rubric reflects underpinning theory, with no areas of conceptual overlap between rubric domains. Conclusion: The final TeamUP Rubric arising from this study validly measures individual student teamwork skills and can be used with confidence in the university setting. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation and {{measurement}} play {{important role in}} helping educators cope with their environment {{of teaching and learning}} program. Evaluation involves judging the value of or worth of a pupil, of an instructional method or of an educational program. To make valid judgment, an evaluator needs to do measurement through test. As an important measuring instrument, the test of UN should have high quality and be able to give reliable and accurate measurement result. The quality of a test can be identified by knowing the difficulty level and the discrimination index of the test. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the difficulty level and the discrimination index <b>of</b> English test <b>items</b> in UN 2005 / 2006 which was readministered to the third grade students of MA AlHuda Wajak, Malang.

40|$|Background: Amblyopia is {{a visual}} {{condition}} {{that occurs in}} childhood. Screening programmes exist within the United Kingdom (UK) to detect amblyopia, and once detected treatment is given. Existing patient reported outcome (PRO) measures for amblyopia do not meet current recommendations for the methods adopted during their development, or {{the way in which}} the instruments are administered. The overall aim of this study was to produce a self-complete PRO instrument for amblyopia for children aged 4 – 7 years that uses children’s responses in the development phase. The study comprised a number of stages. This paper reports on the refinement of the descriptive system for the draft instrument (the Child Amblyopia Treatment Questionnaire, CAT-QoL) using qualitative and quantitative methods. Methods: The study consisted of three components. Children were asked to read, and complete the draft questionnaire as independently as possible. They were then asked about the questionnaire, and its format, in a cognitive debriefing exercise. Observations were made as to the child’s ability to read the questionnaire, particular attention was made as to which individual words participants struggled to read. Children were also asked their opinion on the design layout of the questionnaire. Finally, some children were asked to complete a ranking task to help determine the order of <b>the</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> as judged by the children. Mid-rank scoring and statistical level of agreement were calculated for the ranking exercise. Results: Thirty-two (n= 32) participants completed a draft questionnaire; each of these underwent a cognitive de-briefing interview. Twenty-two (n= 22) children completed the ranking exercise. Ten children did not understand the concept of ranking. The results of the qualitative phase (cognitive de-briefing interview) were used to modify <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> and layout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument. Results of the ranking exercise were used to inform the order of the response levels for <b>the</b> <b>items.</b> Conclusion: Responses <b>of</b> young children can be used in the development of PRO instruments. They are able to help inform <b>the</b> content, <b>wording,</b> and format of an instrument, ensuring good content and face validity. The results have been used to further refine the CAT-QoL, however further research is required to assess the psychometric properties of the instrument...|$|R
30|$|The {{focus of}} this {{analysis}} is to explore the psychometric qualities of the Self Efficacy for Seeking Mental Health Care (SE-SMHC) measure, a newly developed nine-item instrument. The scale was constructed considering the recommendations made by Bandura (2006) regarding the construction of self-efficacy scales. For example, Bandura suggests items should accurately reflect the construct of self-efficacy (i.e. perceived capability), and “…be phrased in terms of can do rather than will do [italics in the original]” (Bandura 2006). This {{is reflected in the}} SE-SMHC as the stem for all items reads, “How confident are you in your ability to…” Bandura also suggests that a good efficacy scale should accurately reflect the domain of functioning that is being assessed, and <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> be directly related to factors that determine quality of functioning in the specific self-efficacy domain. <b>The</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> was developed based on a review of previous research related to barriers to mental health care that addressed access (Fortney et al. 1993; Issakidis and Andrews 2002; Meltzer et al. 2003) and mental health literacy (Jorm et al. 1997), particularly knowledge, insight, and ability to follow through with treatment recommendations; as well as psychosocial factors, including stigma (Komiti et al. 2006; Link and Phelan 2001). A list <b>of</b> 11 <b>items</b> was developed that reflected the themes from the literature previously cited and attempts were made to make the scale as short as possible to increase ease of administration. Based on their clinical experience and the literature review, the authors judged these items as accurately capturing the domain of self-efficacy to seek mental health treatment. These items were then reviewed by an expert in mental health care (PhD-level licensed clinical social worker), and the scale was piloted with three lay persons. Small changes were made to <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> to enhance clarity. As a result of the principal component analysis, two items were deleted which resulted in the most statistically robust and theoretically sound pattern of factor loadings, and the final scale consists <b>of</b> nine <b>items.</b> In accordance with Bandura’s (2006) suggestion that self-efficacy measures should use a 10 or 100 -point scale (with labelled anchors at the extreme) to rate the strength of belief such that scale sensitivity and reliability are enhanced, the final scale utilizes a 10 -point Likert response scale with the anchors of 1  = no confidence to 10  = complete confidence in the respondent’s ability to do each behavior.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Early Childhood Education)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Obesity {{rates in}} {{children}} and adolescents have reached epidemic proportions across the United States. This rise in obesity may be related to decreasing levels of physical activity among school aged children. A second factor may be the negative effects of school lunch programs, a source of much of the daily nutrition for school aged students. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether there was a relationship between children???s lunch choices, including school lunch, vegetarian alternatives and lunch brought from home, and students??? levels of obesity as measured by the Body Mass Index (BMI). Participants in the study included 15 male and 25 female elementary school children aged 9 - 12 years recruited from two public schools. Each student completed a questionnaire that elicited information about their school lunch choices, their level of physical activity at home and at school, and their food choice preferences at home for breakfast and dinner. The students??? height and weight were obtained from the Physical Education teacher at the two participating schools. These data were used to compute a Body Mass Index (BMI) Score for each individual student, which was converted into a BMI percentile-for-age score as a measure of level of obesity. The researcher used descriptive statistics to summarize students??? food choices and activity levels. A t-test was also conducted to test whether student gender was a predictor of their BMI score. Finally, a single factor ANOVA analysis was conducted to identify any relationship between the participants??? lunch choices and their BMI percentile-for-age scores. The results of these tests were not statistically significant. Results did not indicate a link between students??? gender or type of school lunch and their levels of obesity. These findings may have been a result of the number of subjects in the study, the wide range of ages included, <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> <b>items</b> in <b>the</b> questionnaire, and/or the use of BMI scores as the sole measure of obesity. Since school aged children continue to consume a large portion of their daily nutrition through school lunch programs, further research is needed to identify the links between children???s school lunch choices and the rising rates of obesity among America???s children.
