He went on to say [...] "There's other days, I go, 'What if it's crunch time, two minutes left, do you want the ball?' I don't know if I do." [...] In March, Favre hears Phil Simms say on Sirius Radio that as long as Favre can physically play the game, he should. Shortly thereafter, Favre confirms he would return to play. After the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears the last game of the season 26-7, Favre choked up during {{an interview}} with Andrea Kremer by saying [...] "If today's my last game, I want to remember it. It's tough. It's tough. I'll miss these guys. I'll miss this game. I just want every one to know that...I didn't plan on doing this. Way to put me on the spot." [...] Asked if he was indeed going to retire, Favre responded [...] "We'll see. We'll see. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> right now." [...] After the game, a Packers teammate said that Favre was just as emotional in a speech after the Seattle Seahawks game in 2005 at Lambeau Field when he was all but certain he was going to retire.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan based {{the show}} on their own lives. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, based the {{relationship}} between Will and Grace on his real-life relationship with a woman named Janet. Originally, Mutchnick and Kohan first went to the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), who told them to create a television series about a new young love story, as Mad About You was going off the air. The character of Will {{was part of a}} sitcom Mutchnick and Kohan first pitched to NBC executives in 1997. The original concept was an ensemble comedy featuring three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman. Warren Littlefield, the executive vice president of NBC at the time, was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted {{to learn more about the}} gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan was sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters. NBC went to sitcom director James Burrows to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show. Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, [...] "I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before." [...] The filming of the pilot began in March 1998. The actors who played Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last on television. McCormack said, [...] "When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting on the couch and looking at each other and I said, ‘We’re gonna be on this set for a while.’ And we sort of clasped hands, but we didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> beyond that and jinx it." ...|$|E
2500|$|King Arthur {{begins to}} give up hope of ever putting on the Broadway musical and laments that he is alone, even though Patsy has been with him the entire time ("I'm All Alone"). The Lady Of The Lake appears and tells Arthur {{that he and the}} Knights have been in a Broadway musical all along. Patsy also reveals he is half Jewish, but didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to Arthur because [...] "that's not really the sort of thing you say to a heavily armed Christian." [...] All that's left is for King Arthur to find the Grail and marry someone. After picking up on some not-too-subtle hints, Arthur decides to marry the Lady Of The Lake after he finds the Grail ("Twice in Every Show").|$|E

2500|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{the program}} {{production}} company {{and in some}} cases the executive producer (both Barker and Richards, the executive producer since September 2009) have been sued by numerous women. Most of the lawsuits involved models and other staff members in cases of sexual harassment, wrongful termination and racial discrimination. Allegations of sexual harassment brought by Parkinson led to Barker calling a press conference to admit a past consensual sexual relationship with her, while denying any harassment and alleging instead that she was only angry with him for calling off the relationship. Barker was widowed in 1981 following the death of his wife, Dorothy Jo. It has also been alleged that Barker and senior staff created a hostile work environment, particularly to those who testified for the plaintiffs suing Barker. Responding to the controversy just before his retirement, Barker told William Keck of USA Today, [...] " [...] been such a problem. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about them. They [...] disgusting; I don't want to mention them." [...] The Barker-era lawsuits, except for one, were settled out of court. After Barker dropped his slander suit against Hallstrom, she eventually countersued and received millions in settlement. There are two lawsuits in litigation: a pregnancy discrimination suit involving Sherwood and a sexual harassment suit involving Lanisha Cole, filed in September 2011.|$|E

25|$|Although Cage started {{painting}} in his youth, {{he gave it}} up in order to concentrate on music instead. His first mature visual project, Not <b>Wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Anything</b> About Marcel, dates from 1969. The work comprises two lithographs {{and a group of}} what Cage called plexigrams: silk screen printing on plexiglas panels. The panels and the lithographs all consist of bits and pieces of words in different typefaces, all governed by chance operations.|$|R

5000|$|Kurtzman {{discussed}} {{his approach to}} Two-Fisted Tales in a 1980 interview: When I thought of doing a war book, the business of what <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about war {{was very important to}} me and was uppermost in my mind, because I did then feel very strongly about not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> glamorous about war, and everything that went before Two-Fisted Tales had glamorized war. Nobody had done anything on the depressing aspects of war, and this, to me, was such a dumb—it was a terrible disservice to the children.|$|R

5000|$|Guest editors: {{a number}} of issues had guest editors who were invited to choose among the scores {{received}} by the magazine for possible inclusion, make their own suggestions of graphic scores to publish and bring their expertise on a specific field. Alvin Lucier included electronic experiments, in addition to the British Systems music forming the core of issue 10. Ken Friedman was asked to focus on Fluxus, performance and intermedia art in issue #11. John Cage took advantage of the skills of Source's resourceful printer, Doug Galbreath, to create a version of Not <b>Wanting</b> <b>To</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Anything</b> About Marcel printed on transparencies inserted in issue #7-8.|$|R

60|$|There was a {{good deal}} of hubbub in the kraal when the women told their story; some of the men took up their weapons and searched the village and the {{surrounding}} bushes, but the greater portion altogether disbelieved the story. Whoever heard of a spirit talking in an unknown tongue to a lot of women? If he had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> them, he would have spoken so that they could understand. It must have been some man who had drunk too much, and who bellowed in at the door to startle them; and so gradually the din subsided, the men returned to the dance, and the women to their huts.|$|R

2500|$|On October 22, 1999, {{approximately}} {{one month after}} his death, The Washington Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Media tune out torture death of Arkansas boy." [...] The story contrasted the lack of coverage of the Dirkhising case with the treatment the murder of Matthew Shepard received. The story quoted Tim Graham, director of media studies at Media Research Center, a Conservative media watchdog group that frequently criticizes liberal bias, as <b>saying,</b> [...] "Nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> negative about homosexuals. Nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> {{be seen on the}} wrong side of that issue." [...] Brent Bozell, media critic and director of the Media Research Center, accused the media of deliberately spiking the story. Bozell wrote, [...] "Had he been openly gay and his attackers heterosexual, the crime would have led all the networks. But no liberal media outlet has as its villains two gay men." ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} reading of John Cage's artwork Not <b>Wanting</b> <b>To</b> <b>Say</b> <b>Anything</b> About Marcel. The work is emblematic of Cage's {{practice}} of art {{by virtue of the}} aleatory processes that are at the basis of its creation {{as well as of the}} desire to express silence through the act of creation. The work is a celebration of one of the most often proclaimed influences on Cage (Duchamp), but the composition becomes a celebration of creation and also a celebration of a community - that of the viewers and the artists — becoming an icon of influences working in infinite ways. The use of transparency creates an open field of reverberations from one field to the next, as from one layer of glass to the next. What remains is therefore only the trace of a meaning which cannot appear in a linear fashion, but only at the moment of its disappearance. Rigaud Antonia.
