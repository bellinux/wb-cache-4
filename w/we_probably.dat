500|$|Beyoncé wrote [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] {{alongside}} the Norwegian production team Stargate, {{which consists of}} Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Storleer Eriksen. The duo initially composed [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] as a traditional rhythm and blues song but co-writer Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds changed one chord and added falsetto vocals. His recording a demo version preceded a rewrite of the backing track chords {{and the addition of}} a four-on-the-floor piano; the result was a [...] "grand-piano ballad". According to the sheet music published by EMI, [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] was composed at a tempo of 84beats per minute using common time in the key of D minor. Eriksen explained, [...] "I suppose many of our songs are in minor keys. <b>We</b> <b>probably</b> lean towards more a moody, melodic expression. It's what comes most natural for us." ...|$|E
500|$|The film grossed $32.5 {{million on}} its opening day, pacing 38% {{ahead of its}} predecessor. Including some early Tuesday previews, it earned $36.6 million in one-and-a-half days, and by Thursday its {{overseas}} total reached $66 million. By {{the end of its}} first weekend, it had earned $219.8 million, which stands as the fifth-largest opening weekend of all time overseas and the largest for Paramount. Its foreign launch was 57% ahead of that of Revenge of the Fallen ($139.6 million). 70% of its grosses came from 3-D (a higher 3-D share than Pirates 4s 66%). Don Harris, general manager of distribution for Paramount, commented on the results of Dark of the Moon: [...] "If we hadn't chosen to debut the movie later in Japan and China, <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> would have had the all-time record."

500|$|In September 2012, Chris Evans {{stated that}} filming would begin in March 2013. Evans {{also stated that}} Rogers' {{adjustment}} to the modern world, which was originally set {{to be included in}} The Avengers, would be better suited for Captain America: The Winter Soldier. At the end of the month, The Greater Cleveland Film Commission announced that Captain America: The Winter Soldier would film in Cleveland, Ohio after the production was approved for a $9.5 million tax credit. Producer Nate Moore said that after also serving as a location in The Avengers, Cleveland's government was helpful in providing large locations for filming, which [...] "provided production value which <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> could not have built in a backlot." [...] McFeely joked that while writing ambitious action scenes [...] "I did not realize a great American metropolis would say 'Sure, shut down three miles of freeway and go to town'." [...] Portions of the film were also scheduled to be shot in California and Washington, D.C.|$|E
500|$|Live {{performances}} {{are very important}} to the band. [...] "We love playing live," [...] said Scogin, [...] "That's what this band are all about: playing live shows." [...] This mentality leaked into their recording process: the band's first album was recorded entirely live in one take. Their next two efforts followed more traditional recording sensibilities: [...] "We may go in and [...] this one part," [...] explained Scogin, [...] "but [...] there's lots of stuff <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> should have tightened up. [...] But that [...] it feeling like a real record." [...] Despite their attentiveness to the recording process, Scogin has maintained that their focal point is live performances, [...] "...recording records, that's all circled around hopefully bringing more kids to the live show so we can perform for them." [...] The band's shows have built up a reputation; MTV called them [...] "the thing of metalcore legend".

[...] VanDerWerff also writes, [...] "the more I think about this episode, the more I admire it for taking away Jack’s agency." [...] IGN reviewer Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.9/10, writing that it [...] "features one of the best flashbacks dedicated to Jack." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave [...] "White Rabbit" [...] a 72/100, praising on how the writers did another [...] "character heavy" [...] episode without [...] "trying to cram unnecessary action." [...] However, Pierson added that the cliff scene was clichéd, particularly as [...] "we don’t really believe that he will die, so it is an action movie scene which <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> didn’t leave." ...|$|E

500|$|Slay Tracks was {{recorded}} during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing {{the studio and}} the recording process, said, [...] "You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a glide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top." [...] Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, [...] " [...] {{come in and they}} play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums were in there so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'" [...] Kannberg said, [...] "We did it really fast. <b>We</b> <b>probably</b> spent one day tracking and one day mixing it." [...] The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} knew we were recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. <b>We</b> <b>probably</b> wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
500|$|Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace {{offers a}} mix of both {{electric}} and acoustic songs, which Grohl likened to the band growing older and [...] "comfortable {{with all kinds of}} music" [...] instead of just focusing on straight rock songs, saying that listening to the album he felt like [...] "we've gotten over our insecurities, because it presents us in a way that <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> hid in the past." [...] Grohl also stated that [...] "the idea now is to step up and make [...] Odessey and Oracle" [...] - [...] the album he claimed to have listened the most during production - and that [...] "it has always been my dream to mix Steely Dan with Nomeansno." [...] Amidst the amount of heavier tracks and themes Grohl decided to include the song [...] "Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)", described as [...] "the most light-hearted, melodic song of all" [...] which [...] "seemed like a little ray of hope {{in the middle of all}} this despair." [...] Grohl added that there was a bigger focus on melodies even in heavier tracks such as [...] "The Pretender", [...] "Let It Die" [...] and [...] "Erase/Replace", and that album closer [...] "Home", a ballad featuring Grohl on the piano, was [...] "the best song I've ever written".|$|E

500|$|One of Aden's {{most notable}} storylines {{highlighted}} {{the issue of}} sexual abuse. In the story Aden struggles {{to cope with the}} sexual abuse inflicted on him by his grandfather. Lasance and the serial's writing team worked hard to raise awareness of the [...] "taboo issue". Lasance said he felt he had to do the storyline [...] "one hundred percent justice" [...] because there are people, [...] "more than <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> realise" [...] in real life who have suffered the same as Aden. He felt it was a challenge to play as he did not want victims to think it was unrealistic. Lasance said he had to come onto set each morning in Aden's frame of mind. To research Aden's storyline, he spoke to a relative who had been through a similar situation. He drew inspiration for his portrayal from how his relative had coped and the effects it had on him growing up. Lasance said like his relative, Aden goes though [...] "the huge rebellion years" [...] and the subsequent attempts to [...] "reconnect with those people who had betrayed you." [...] Lasance also received extra training from an acting coach, where he used [...] "haunting" [...] techniques to make himself feel vulnerable like Aden. He also used the storyline to show US agents his acting abilities.|$|E
500|$|... "Lose My Breath" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Fred Jerkins, Sean Garrett, LaShawn Daniels and Jay-Z. The {{production}} of the song was handled by Jerkins, Beyoncé, Rowland and Garrett. Record producer Jerkins, who had previously collaborated with the group for [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), had worked on [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] without informing Destiny's Child. Beyoncé and Williams heard the drum instrumentation of the track and they enjoyed it with the latter feeling that the song was nothing like the mainstream radio sound. They went to their band mate Kelly Rowland presenting the song. Alongside Jerkins, the group asked for help from American rapper Jay-Z who immediately created a chorus including the lines [...] "Can you keep up" [...] without hearing the track. The group took his chorus and wrote the verses and bridge around it. During an interview with Complex, Garrett recalled the time he worked with Williams on the song, saying, [...] "There was so much magic {{going on in the}} studio. <b>We</b> <b>probably</b> recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards {{the latter part of the}} album and that was an amazing song that we felt could not only be big on the radio but big with bands and marching bands. I was on a natural high after that." ...|$|E
500|$|Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on eight reviews. David Jeffries of Allmusic opined that [...] "the too-pop [...] now feels more balanced once this eight-track EP worth of material tips the scales", {{adding that the}} additional tracks and DVD is [...] "the better deal and bigger picture" [...] than the original. Dan Weiss of the Boston Phoenix complimented Minaj's rapping, commenting that [...] "the rapper who rhymes [...] "fri-vo-lous" [...] with [...] "po-ly-ga-mist" [...] is X-Acto sharp as ever". The Los Angeles Times Gerrick D. Kennedy noted the variety of genres incorporated in the reissue, stating [...] "Sure, she flirts with dance pop and R balladry, but you can forgive her for wanting to satisfy different tastes. Here, it actually works". Andy Gill of The Independent provided a mixed review, feeling that the material was generic and [...] "does not add much to the Minaj experience". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani criticized the lyrical content and featured guests, adding that [...] "as long as [...] keeps comparing herself to Jesus, <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> shouldn't hold our breath". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly placed the album at number two on his list of The Worst Albums Of The Year, writing that the album was [...] "soul-less, lazy, and totally unnecessary." ...|$|E

500|$|The school’s {{refusal to}} play Ward in the Georgia Tech game later {{became part of}} the public legacy of President Gerald R. Ford. Ward {{recalled}} that he met “my man Jerry” during freshman orientation in 1932, and the two became friends and roommates when the football team traveled for road games. When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend." [...] Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography, recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was [...] "morally wrong." [...] “I went to Willis himself. He urged me to play. [...] ‘Look,’ he said, ‘the team’s having a bad year. We’ve lost two games already and <b>we</b> <b>probably</b> won’t win any more. You’ve got to play Saturday. You owe it to the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. That Saturday afternoon, we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin, their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E
