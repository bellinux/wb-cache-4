Breeding pairs construct dome-shaped nests using grass or bamboo leaves.|$|E
5|$|At that time, the {{university}} {{did not offer}} a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program so Massey undertook a Master of Science (MSc) course, with both experimental and theoretical components. The former, in cooperation with Courtney Mohr, dealt <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> X-ray deflection from metal surfaces; the latter with wave mechanics. This involved translating numerous articles from German journals such as Zeitschrift für Physik, Annalen der Physik and Physikalische Zeitschrift. His external examiner was Ralph Fowler from the University of Cambridge, who was Paul Dirac's PhD supervisor.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight progress is rather indirect. Their flight pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E

5|$|Corals {{that grow}} on reefs are called hermatypic, with those growing {{elsewhere}} {{are known as}} ahermatypic. Most of the latter are azooxanthellate and live in both shallow and deep sea habitats. In the deep sea they share the ecosystem <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> corals, polychaete worms, other worms, crustaceans, molluscs and sponges. In the Atlantic Ocean, the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa forms extensive deep-water reefs which support many other species.|$|E
5|$|Falle had no role models. She {{began writing}} poetry about suicide and wearing black clothing. She acted out by {{stealing}} cars and using drugs recreationally. She started out <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> drugs {{and then moved}} on to using psychedelic mushrooms and LSD. Her associates in these criminal activities, who came from similarly dysfunctional backgrounds, provided her with a sense of belonging that she no longer found at home. Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house unsafe, so Falle ran away from home. She slept at friends' houses, on their couches and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E
5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales provide some protection from predators as they {{emerge from the}} nest.

The adults emerging from pupae are covered <b>with</b> <b>soft,</b> loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make {{their way out of the}} nest after hatching.|$|E

5|$|In 1842, Johannes Theodor Reinhardt {{proposed}} {{they were}} ground doves, based on studies of a dodo skull he had rediscovered {{in the royal}} Danish collection of Copenhagen. This view was met with ridicule, but later supported by Strickland and Melville, who suggested the common descent of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo in 1848, after dissecting the only known dodo specimen <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> tissue and comparing it with the few solitaire remains then available. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features in the leg bones, features which were otherwise known only in pigeons.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} summer, the Jewish harvest festival of Shavuot is celebrated. Shavuot marks {{the peak of}} the new grain harvest and the {{ripening}} of the first fruits, and is a time when milk was historically most abundant.

Each train has eight four-passenger cars, allowing thirty-two passengers per train. The trains are arranged in stadium-style seating with overhead lap bars fitted <b>with</b> <b>soft,</b> padded over-the-shoulder straps. In early July 2010, the ride received a unique new restraint design. The over-the-shoulder part of the harness now resembles a padded seat belt rather than the typical over-the-shoulder restraints used by Intamin.|$|E
