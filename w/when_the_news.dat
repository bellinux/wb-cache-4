50|$|<b>When</b> {{looking at}} <b>the</b> source of {{knowledge}} about an event, hearing <b>the</b> <b>news</b> from <b>the</b> media or from another person does not cause a difference in reaction, rather causes {{a difference in the}} type of information that is encoded to ones memory. <b>When</b> hearing <b>the</b> <b>news</b> from <b>the</b> media, more details about the events itself are better remembered due to the processing of facts while experiencing high levels of arousal, whereas <b>when</b> hearing <b>the</b> <b>news</b> from another individual a person tends to remember personal responses and circumstances.|$|R

5|$|By March 1942, the Japanese {{invasion}} of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to Bataan, while his headquarters and {{his family moved to}} Corregidor. The doomed defense of Bataan captured the imagination of the American public. At a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the state}} of anarchy being {{experienced}} by the city, Belgrano's death was largely unnoticed. The only newspaper of the time to note his death was El Despertador Teofilantrópico, written by Francisco de Paula Castañeda, and there was no government representation at his funeral. Former students of his educative institutions would arrive in the following days with obsequies, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> started to be known. The following year the political context was less chaotic and Bernardino Rivadavia, who was minister by then, organised a massive state funeral.|$|E

Ascending the throne, Kam Bakhsh made Ahsan Khan, {{who served in the}} army as the bakshi (general of the armed forces), and made his advisor Taqarrub Khan as chief minister and gave himself the title of Padshah Kam Bakhsh-i-Dinpanah (Emperor Kam Bakhsh, Protector of Faith). He then conquered Kulbarga and Wakinkhera.|$|E
5|$|In December 1932, Hu {{was briefly}} {{arrested by the}} German police after {{attending}} a protest against the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Two months later, following the Nazi Machtergreifung, Adolf Hitler suppressed the German Communist Party and threw thousands of party members in jail. Hu Lanqi was arrested and imprisoned for three months. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> reached China, Soong Ching-ling and the prominent writer Lu Xun formally petitioned the German consulate in Shanghai and secured her release. She was deported to France and moved to England soon afterward.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr in Denmark {{that the}} Nazis {{considered}} {{his family to}} be Jewish, {{and that they were}} in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September 1943. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a telegram asking Bohr to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).|$|E

5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{where he}} {{discovered}} {{that no one would}} employ him in any job other than as an actor. In 1882, he put together a troupe of his own with Keni Liptzin, and brought Rosenberg in as a partner. This troupe toured to Rostov, Taganrog, around Lithuania, to Dünaburg (now Daugavpils, Latvia). Aiming to bring the troupe to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> arrived that a total ban was about to be placed on Yiddish theater in Russia.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of Shankar's death {{reaches the}} Singh haveli, {{everyone}} turns somber and the ceremonies towards rendering {{her into a}} widow emotionally drains Meera. Her vivaciousness and exuberance are thrust behind her black veil. The {{rest of the family}} vents their frustration of losing their only bread-winner on Meera, by blaming her for bringing bad-luck to their family. Meera, being her respectful self, bears the insults silently.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the {{execution}} reached Elizabeth, she became indignant and asserted that Davison had disobeyed her instructions not {{to part with}} the warrant and that the Privy Council had acted without her authority. Elizabeth's vacillation and deliberately vague instructions gave her plausible deniability, to attempt to avoid the direct stain of Mary's blood. Davison was arrested, thrown into the Tower of London, and found guilty of misprision. He was released 19 months later after Cecil and Walsingham interceded on his behalf.|$|E

5|$|According to the city's {{metropolitan}} bishop, Symeon (in office 1416/17–1429), {{both he and}} the Despot Andronikos sent repeated {{pleas for}} aid to Constantinople, but the imperial government was short of resources and preoccupied with its own problems. At long last, a single unnamed commander {{was sent to the}} city, but he brought neither men nor money with him. The commander proposed setting up a common fund of the citizens to support the defence, but this proposal met with vehement opposition, particularly from the wealthy aristocrats, who would naturally have born the brunt of the cost. The common people however also proved unwilling to contribute, and rioted in favour of an accommodation with the Ottomans, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> spread that they had offered a peaceful settlement, provided that the Despot Andronikos left the city.|$|E
5|$|British {{naval forces}} in North America and the West Indies were weaker than the {{combined}} fleets of France and Spain, and, after much indecision by British naval commanders, the French fleet gained control over Chesapeake Bay, landing forces near Yorktown. The Royal Navy attempted to dispute this {{control in the}} key Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September but Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves was defeated. Protected from the sea by French ships, Franco-American forces surrounded, besieged and forced the surrender of British forces commanded by General Cornwallis, concluding major operations in North America. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> reached London, the government of Lord Frederick North fell, and the following Rockingham ministry entered into peace negotiations. These culminated in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, in which King George III recognised {{the independence of the}} United States of America.|$|E
5|$|Having ruled {{himself out}} of the race <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of Macmillan's illness broke, Home angered at least two of his cabinet colleagues by {{changing}} his mind. Macmillan quickly came to the view that Home would be the best choice as his successor, and gave him valuable behind-the-scenes backing. He {{let it be known that}} if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from the British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would alienate moderate voters.|$|E

5|$|On May 15, Bedel left The Cedars, leaving Butterfield {{in charge}} of the fort. Bedel later claimed that the reason for his {{departure}} was to meet with the friendly Caughnawaga Indians. In his court martial, the judges concluded this claim was suspect. He returned to Montreal and reported that a force of 150 British troops of the 8th Foot and about 500Iroquois commanded by Forster was approaching. On this news, Colonel John Paterson sent Major Henry Sherburne with 140men from his regiment toward The Cedars. Arnold, who was meeting with the retreating Continental Army command at Sorel, returned to Montreal <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> reached him and set about organizing a larger relief force.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of Zong voyage reached Britain, the ship's owners claimed {{compensation}} {{from their}} insurers {{for the loss}} of the slaves. The insurers refused to honour the claim and the owners took them to court. Zongs logbook went missing after the ship reached Jamaica, two years before the hearings started. The legal proceedings provide almost all the documentary evidence about the massacre but there is no formal record of the first trial other than what is referred to in the appeals hearing. The ship's insurers claimed that the log had been deliberately destroyed, which the Gregson syndicate denied.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> {{of their}} plight reached the Parsis, who {{by this time}} had become quite prosperous, Parsi funds were set up to help the Iranian Zoroastrians and emissaries were {{dispatched}} to Iran. A Parsi philanthropist, Maneckji Limji Hataria, was sent to help them. He found only 7711 Zoroastrians in Kerman, Yazd and Tehran (now the capital of Iran). Using his influence with the British government {{he managed to get}} some of the repression against Zoroastrians removed. Jizya was paid by the Zoroastrian minority until 1882, when it was removed by pressure on the Qajar government from the Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund.|$|E
