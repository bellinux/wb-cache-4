40|$|We {{present a}} new open {{superstring}} field theory, whose string fields carry an arbitrary picture number and {{reside in the}} large Hilbert space. The redundancy related to picture number is resolved by treating picture changing as a gauge transformation. A mid-point insertion is imperative for this formalism. We find that this mid-point insertion must include all multi-picture <b>changing</b> <b>operators.</b> It is also proven that this insertion {{as well as all}} the multi-picture <b>changing</b> <b>operators</b> are zero weight conformal primaries. This new theory solves the problems with the Ramond sector shared by other RNS string field theories, while naturally unifying the NS and Ramond string fields. When partially gauge fixed, it reduces in the NS sector to the modified cubic superstring field theory. Hence, it shares all the good properties of this theory, e. g., it has analytical vacuum and marginal deformation solutions. Treating the redundant gauge symmetry using the BV formalism is straightforward and results in a cubic action with a single string field, whose quantum numbers are unconstrained. The generalization to an arbitrary brane system is simple and includes the standard Chan-Paton factors and the most general string field consistent with the brane system. Comment: V 1 : 29 p.

40|$|We {{present an}} exact {{solution}} of open bosonic string field theory {{which can be}} used to describe any time-independent open string background. The solution generalizes an earlier construction of Kiermaier, Okawa, and Soler, and assumes the existence of boundary condition <b>changing</b> <b>operators</b> with nonsingular OPEs and vanishing conformal dimension. Our main observation is that boundary condition <b>changing</b> <b>operators</b> of this kind can describe nearly any open string background provided the background shift is accompanied by a timelike Wilson line of sufficient strength. As an application we analyze the tachyon lump describing the formation of a D$(p- 1) $-brane in the string field theory of a D$p$-brane, for generic compactification radius. This not only provides a proof of Sen's second conjecture, but also gives explicit examples of higher energy solutions, confirming analytically that string field theory can "reverse" the direction of the worldsheet RG flow. We also find multiple D-brane solutions, demonstrating that string field theory can add Chan-Paton factors and change the rank of the gauge group. Finally, we show how the solution provides a remarkably simple and nonperturbative proof of the background independence of open bosonic string field theory.
