50|$|One {{limitation}} of comparative statics using the implicit function theorem is that results are valid {{only in a}} (potentially very small) neighborhood of <b>the</b> optimum—that <b>is,</b> only for very small changes in <b>the</b> exogenous variables. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> potentially overly restrictive nature of the assumptions conventionally used to justify comparative statics procedures.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons why microsegments can <b>be</b> {{ineffective}} [...] <b>The</b> limitations surrounding microsegments <b>are</b> if <b>the</b> business does not have enough resources it cannot reach or serve the customers profitably or <b>the</b> resources could <b>be</b> used but {{will not be able to}} meet thee needs of the rest of <b>the</b> customers, <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> for microsegments could <b>be</b> if <b>the</b> customers targeted by the specific microsegments do not produce the advantages other segments do in the form of longetivity or other sources of revenue.|$|R
30|$|One of the {{limitations}} of <b>the</b> study <b>was</b> that systolic and diastolic blood pressures were not recorded in this study, however, <b>the</b> standard protocol <b>was</b> to exclude any patient with a blood pressure over 160 / 95 from <b>the</b> procedure. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> potential lack of detailed information and data about pre-specified complications in this study. Finally, Post procedure ultrasound was done based on patients symptoms (abdominal pain or macroscopic hematuria) and this may have led to underestimation of complications and under-detection of haematomas.|$|R
30|$|The main {{limitation}} {{of our study}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> leak of arterial blood gas analysis during SpO 2 measurements for determining <b>the</b> accurate value. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> of our study was that, {{we did not have}} adequate left hand dominance volunteers. Further studies can be made with adequate number of left hand dominance volunteers or corroborated by arterial blood gas analyses and PI parameters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conditioning}} paradigm {{has certain}} limitations. Researchers {{have had a}} hard time conditioning infants that are just a few months old. This might be because they have not yet developed what Piaget calls [...] "primary circular reactions". Because they cannot coordinate sensory motor actions they cannot learn to make different associations between their motoric behaviors and <b>the</b> environment. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> concerns <b>the</b> kind of conditioned stimuli humans can learn. When researchers attempt to condition children to fear things such as curtains or wooden blocks they have had great difficulty. Humans may be [...] "innately disposed to fear certain stimuli".|$|R
30|$|A {{potential}} {{limitation of}} this study <b>was</b> <b>the</b> fact that blind investigations could not <b>be</b> performed, because <b>the</b> investigator needed to be able to detect the load in the backpack and see the declining or inclining slope. In addition the investigator needed to screen all video recordings to check the usefulness of the measurements. However, all force plate measurements were recorded automatically, which means the investigator itself had no influence on <b>the</b> results. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> present study assumed comparability of contralateral limbs. Moreover, mediolateral components of ground reaction force were assumed to te negligible (Muir and Whishaw 1999) and were therefore not included in the measurement.|$|R
50|$|Postmortem brain {{samples are}} limited resources, {{because it is}} {{extremely}} difficult for a researcher {{to get a hold of}} an individual’s brain. The researchers ask their participants or the families to consent to allowing them to study the loved ones brain, however there has been a falling rates of consent in the last few years. Subsequently researchers have to use indirect methods to study the locations and processes of <b>the</b> brain. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> to postmortem studies <b>is</b> <b>the</b> continuous funding and the time it takes to conduct a longitudinal study. Postmortem longitudinal studies usually take place at the time of assessment until the time of death about 20-30 years.|$|R
30|$|The {{post-hoc}} {{nature of}} <b>the</b> analysis <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>limitation</b> of <b>the</b> study. These studies were not {{specifically designed to}} correlate PK measures with analgesia; therefore, no conclusions about HVD {{as a predictor of}} duration of efficacy can <b>be</b> drawn. However, <b>the</b> HVD (and flux) offer information about the stability of plasma concentrations over time with ER analgesics, which may be important in populations receiving multiple doses of analgesics over a prolonged period of time.|$|R
30|$|Our {{study has}} several limitations. The data sets {{of credit card}} {{transaction}} records {{used in this study}} are based on samples of the full customer set of the financial institution. Therefore, sampling bias could exist and potentially influence <b>the</b> results. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> of using credit card transaction data is that, credit card holders may only represent a certain fraction of the population, and customers may choose to pay by cash under certain circumstances. However, our data sets do cover a relatively large period in time, which makes our results robust against external factors that might influence customers’ financial activities such as seasonality and economic instability.|$|R
30|$|The {{performance}} of the proposed newly designed treatment concept should be evaluated in further studies using various tumor models and, if possible, different combinations of radioagents with optimized doses for each single agent to maximize <b>the</b> therapeutic efficacy. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> of <b>the</b> present study <b>is</b> <b>the</b> lack {{of information on the}} radiation absorbed dose distribution in tumors, which might be more directly related to the tumor response. However, to obtain these data, a sophisticated three-dimensional dose calculation technique would be needed [29].|$|R
30|$|TMA <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{dominant}} management {{paradigm in}} business literature (Gladwin et al. 1995). However, it receives criticism from some societies and scientific groups. As Shrivastava (1995) mentioned that while organizations {{pay attention to}} their social, political, and economic environments, they virtually ignore the natural environment. According to him, <b>the</b> environment has <b>been</b> described as a packaged source {{to be used by}} organizations. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> of <b>the</b> TMA <b>is</b> that it only takes financial risks into account and it does not care about the effects of organization’s technology usage on <b>the</b> environment. <b>Another</b> important <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> anthropocentricity of the TMA. This anthropocentric ideology gives the human race a separation, uniqueness, priority, and supremacy against nature (Shrivastava 1995).|$|R
30|$|A {{limitation}} {{of this study is that}} waiting time and duration of <b>the</b> procedure <b>were</b> not examined. Waiting time can possibly change the anxiety and pain level of the patient and prolonged duration of the procedure can increase the dissatisfaction of the patient and <b>the</b> doctor. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> difference in experience between the doctors. In both groups, hysteroscopy and colposcopy, the doctors consisted of both gynaecologists and residents. According to the literature, pain scores can be lower when an experienced doctor performs the procedure [17]. iPod speakers were used to play the music which prevented double-blind testing. However, during the pilot study, headphones turned out to impede the interaction between patient and doctor. For this reason, headphones were waived.|$|R
30|$|While {{the study}} {{contributes}} to the entrepreneurship literature, we include noteworthy limitations of the study. For example, due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, inferences of causality need to be verified with longitudinal research. Accounting for the business and entrepreneurial experiences {{of the students in the}} sample would strengthen the study; however, data was not collected on exactly what courses were completed by each individual at the time of <b>the</b> study. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> to <b>the</b> generalizability of <b>the</b> findings <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> dependent variable in <b>the</b> study <b>is</b> entrepreneurial intent, which does not necessarily translate into entrepreneurial action, business start-up, and eventual business success. However, our study does suggest potential future research questions worth exploring and these questions would best be researched longitudinally.|$|R
5000|$|All {{the agents}} of the Corps have gone through a violent, mortal death, but merely being alive again does not render them immortal. They can [...] "die" [...] again, and they face {{immediate}} judgement upon dying, which may {{be a problem for}} those who have not completed their redemption. Injury can happen to them, as can all the usual mental anguish that mortals suffer. Corps agents have no magical powers to give them an advantage over <b>the</b> opposition. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> that agents of <b>the</b> Corps <b>are</b> not allowed to have sexual relations with others, {{due to the fact that}} sleeping with a Morlock will turn an agent into one. They also cannot overtly contact their friends and family from before they died.|$|R
50|$|Traceroute {{limitations}} {{are well known}} and {{should be taken into}} account when using the tool. For example, traceroute does not discover paths at the router level, but at <b>the</b> interface level. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> appears when routers do not respond to probes or when routers have a limit for ICMP responses. In the presence of traffic load balancing, traceroute may indicate a path that does not actually exist, to minimize this problem there is a traceroute modification called Paris-traceroute, which maintains the flow identifier of the probes to avoid load balancing.|$|R
30|$|Tapping {{accurately}} into a topic {{as broad}} as innovation and as sophisticated as human capital investment {{takes a long}} time, and therefore time was an important limitation in this research. We would recommend future work to be conducted over a longer time period {{in order to get}} the full benefit from <b>the</b> research. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> lack of quantitative information available. Very few people in Jordan truly understand the concepts of innovation and the importance of human capital investment, which was a serious constraint on the kind of information gathered from interviewees and focus groups, and a possible cause of individual bias. We would recommend that future researchers explain to participants the exact purpose of their research in order to obtain the most accurate information from them.|$|R
30|$|Navda et al. [4] {{proposed}} a proactive channel hopping protocol with pseudo-random channels to avoid jamming. They {{assumed that the}} sequence of hopping channels is pseudo-random, {{and it is difficult}} to predict the next channel. However, a pseudo-randomly generated sequence is not truly random, because it is completely determined by a relatively small set of initial values. Thus, using a previous channel hopping sequence, the attacker might calculate or predict the next channel. They assumed that <b>the</b> channel sequence <b>is</b> only known to legitimate users and <b>the</b> AP. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> of this approach is that it may not work in public Wi-Fi hot spots, where people come and leave frequently. If the users do not know the seed for the pseudo-random scheme, they cannot predict the next channel.|$|R
30|$|The use of locking {{compression}} plate (LCP) combines {{the convenience of}} internal fixation and stability of an internal fixator [16]. In contrast to external fixation techniques, the long learning curve is short and shares much with the basic techniques of internal fixation. A shortcoming of this treatment {{is that it does}} not allow correction of leg length discrepancy although it can <b>be</b> addressed using <b>the</b> technique of leg lengthening over the plate; this loses the advantage of avoiding use of an external fixator in <b>the</b> postoperative period. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> of this study <b>is</b> <b>the</b> small number of cases in <b>the</b> series; this <b>is</b> attributed to <b>the</b> indications for patient selection.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} {{also noted that}} the {{frictional}} forces recorded in this study were substantially different from the actual applied forces in orthodontic movement. Many intraoral variables such as saliva, plaque, chewing, bone density, tooth number, anatomic configuration, and occlusion can influence frictional force levels, and were not evaluated in <b>the</b> present study. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> {{of this study is that}} other types of orthodontic wires such as beta titanium wires have not been investigated, and thus, the obtained results cannot be extrapolated to them. Further clinical studies are required to investigate the effect of chlorhexidine-containing prophylactic agents during orthodontic treatments and on other types of archwires.|$|R
30|$|A certain {{limitation}} of <b>the</b> present survey <b>is</b> <b>the</b> omission of books, edited volume chapters, theses and conference {{papers in the}} analysed sample. Since entrepreneurship is a new field of research, books are important as they present various influential perspectives and elaborate complex arguments (Landström et al. 2012). The use of a single bibliographic database (SCOPUS) is also a weakness for the generalisation of <b>the</b> results. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> lack of a bibliometric algorithm to justify the evolution of cpp over time. Hence, older articles receive higher citation rates than newer ones and the analysis of impact becomes detrimental for recent publications. In addition, the present analysis lacks identification of cross-citations {{and the formation of}} author clusters (e.g., Landström et al. 2012). Therefore, present results can be considered explanatory and indicative but primitive; i.e. a first step for further analysis. Albeit, confined in the educational context, present results are indicative for research ‘gaps’ that scholars may have to consider in their research.|$|R
30|$|The {{limitation}} {{of our study}} is cross-sectional design that does not revealed <b>the</b> causality. <b>Another</b> obvious <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> rather small sample size that did not reach desired one, estimated according to (Dupont and Plummer 1990). <b>The</b> study <b>was</b> performed in <b>the</b> hospital settings, i.e. in conditions that differ from free-living routine, but contribute to standardization of diet and daily activity. At the same time, we revealed {{for the first time}} the association of HRV with wide set of GV indices, reflecting the actual and antecedent glucose fluctuations.|$|R
30|$|Herein, {{the most}} obvious {{limitation}} <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> HIS system could not provide adequate roll stiffness to control <b>the</b> roll mode. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>was</b> that <b>the</b> modal analysis method was linear in this study. However, the suspension system and tire assembly often exhibit many nonlinearities for practical applications. Thus, the performances of the bounce, pitch, and roll modes would <b>be</b> considered for <b>the</b> passive HIS system, and {{the extension of the}} proposed methodology to a full nonlinear vehicle model must <b>be</b> explored in <b>the</b> future. Additionally, the semi-active or active control strategy for the HIS system must be considered as future works to improve the ride comfort and handling performance of the mining vehicle based on control theories.|$|R
30|$|Some {{limitation}} to {{this study}} is to be considered. First of all, PET images were normalized to MNI space using PET-only information since magnetic resonance (MR) images were not available. Although this approach could reduce the accuracy of the normalization, the impact on the resulting discriminative and disease-specific patterns is expected to be limited. Moreover, since high-resolution anatomical MR data were not available, we did not consider a patient-specific gray matter mask to spatially constrain the disease-specific or discriminative brain patterns nor did we apply prior knowledge to generate these pattern. These approaches could prove beneficial and will <b>be</b> considered in <b>the</b> future. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> that not all PET data <b>were</b> acquired with <b>the</b> same PET scanner. However, potential scanner differences were accounted for during the preprocessing steps which comprised a histogram normalization and demean. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} resolution properties of the two PET scanners that have been used for this study were very similar for the applied reconstruction settings [35].|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the authors}} of <b>the</b> program, there <b>are</b> {{limitations}} that {{should be taken into}} account when using this program. Some of these limitations include the fact that ForDisc will classify any unknown into the ‘closest’ group, this means that even if an individuals ethnic group or race is not represented in the database, the program will classify it to <b>the</b> ‘closest’ group. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> involves classification using hybrid individuals and groups. The authors state that genetic exchange between groups can cause misclassifications due to gene overlap that can consist of two ancestral populations. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> deal with <b>the</b> classification of individuals under the age of 18, this <b>is</b> due to <b>the</b> nature of physical anthropologists ability to assess age in subadults. However, the authors state that there are differences between subadults in different groups, but these differences tend to not correspond to differences seen in adults. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> that <b>the</b> authors believe researchers should take into account <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fact that this program is based on measurements that are effected by [...] "disease, disuse, treatment, or trauma." [...] The measurement of effected bone(s) may produce values that are inaccurate, and therefore he classification will not reflect the correct population affinity.|$|R
30|$|The major {{limitation}} {{of our study}} {{is that it was}} a retrospective, observational study, which had potential for referral bias and confounding factors. Secondly, although we aimed to investigate long-term outcomes, the length of follow-up achieved was not adequate. Third, we did not examine serologic reactivity to bacterial antigens, which are well-known predictors of fibrostenosing behavior in Western populations (Dubinsky et al. 2006). However, more time will be needed to incorporate serological tests into clinical practice because of their high cost in Korea. Forth, the data on smoking history, endoscopic and radiologic findings other than the presence of bowel damage was not complete because of the retrospective nature of <b>the</b> study. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> comes from <b>the</b> small size of the studied population; further prospective studies with larger numbers of patients are needed. Despite of the several limitations, our study may provide useful insight into the disease course in mild CD patients, given the paucity of knowledge of this matter.|$|R
50|$|The CL {{can take}} {{nearly all the}} Leica M lenses. Exception are some lenses that {{protrude}} deep into the body and could hurt the meter arm, these include: 15mm/8 Hologon, 21mm/4 Super Angulon, 28mm/2.8 Elmarits before serial number 2314921. The eyed lenses, including the M3 wide-angle lenses, the 135mm/2.8 Elmarit, and the 50mm/2 Dual Range Summicron, cannot be mounted either because they <b>are</b> incompatible with <b>the</b> body shape. The 90mm/2 Summicron and 135mm/4 Tele-Elmar <b>are</b> incompatible too. <b>The</b> collapsible lenses can be mounted but they must not be fully collapsed, and Leitz advised {{to stick to the}} barrel an adhesive strip of adequate width, to limit <b>the</b> collapsing movement. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> rangefinder <b>is</b> only coupled until 0.8m.|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} several limitations. Due to the {{retrospective}} {{nature of this}} study, there was no predefined protocol for selecting patients. The decision to perform a computer-assisted 3 D planned corrective osteotomy <b>was</b> made by <b>the</b> surgeon. Only patients with complex malunions were selected {{for this type of}} treatment. This approach has resulted in a selection bias and potentially limits the generalisability of our results. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, {{we were not able to}} acquire preoperative grip strength or functional questionnaires (e.g. DASH, PRWE), thus limiting the evaluation of functional outcome of <b>the</b> procedure. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> heterogeneity of the population. We included subjects with both diaphyseal and extra-articular distal radius malunions. Distal malunions commonly show axial malalignment in pronation [25], whereas diaphyseal malunions typically involve angular deformation [23]. Individual cases require different goals of correction. As mentioned, an oblique single-cut rotation osteotomy (OSCRO) aims to correct rotational deformities and is limited in providing ulnoradial or volodorsal shifts. This phenomenon—in combination with the low number of cases—may explain the lack of statistically significant improvement in individual directional parameters.|$|R
30|$|Though both {{techniques}} are generally acceptable concepts founded on well-grounded principles for forensic examination, they exhibit some limitations. For instance, both estimation {{techniques are}} based on manual derivation of estimation parameters. Morphological assessment being a method that relies on visual perception is highly influenced by subjectivity of the observer. Besides, it necessitates {{a certain level of}} experience as well as familiarity of the forensic expert with the cranial samples in a population group that is being studied. Whereas, the process of morphometric analysis is laborious as it requires ample amount of time for accurate and precise landmark annotation. Moreover, variation in the shape of <b>the</b> skull <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>limitation</b> of morphometric analysis, which inhibits the generalization ability of the method to diverse population groups.|$|R
30|$|This {{study is}} not without {{limitation}}s. One limitation concerns the cross-sectional nature of our data. Because data capture snapshot reports, the results imply correlations and not causation, and we caution readers to consider this difference when assessing <b>the</b> findings. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> relates to <b>the</b> use of caregiver-reported subjective health. Previous studies found that caregivers sometimes under-report children’s outcomes (Cebotari, Siegel, & Mazzucato, 2016; Jordan & Graham, 2012). Future research is advised to include two comparable sets of questions to be answered by both caregivers and children to increase the reliability of assessments. A final limitation concerns the complexity of factors when analyzing comparative data. Despite employing {{a number of different}} transnational characteristics, we could not identify all factors that describe the life of children in transnational care in the two countries. It was thus not possible to conduct analysis on specifics of migration such as multiple migration spans, the frequency of contact, the country of destination, children’s ages at separation, the type of employment, or the residency status abroad. Future analyses must detail these factors in relation to children’s health.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{parameter}} estimation {{problem in a}} general heteroscedastic linear system, by putting {{the problem in the}} framework of the bilinear approach to low-rank matrix approximation. The ellipse fitting problem is studied as a specific example of the general theory. Despite the impression given in the literature, the ellipse fitting problem is still unsolved when the data comes from a small section of the ellipse. Although there are already some good approaches to the problem of conic fitting, such as FNS and HEIV, convergence in these iterative approaches is not ensured, as pointed out in <b>the</b> literature. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> of these approaches is that they can’t model the correlations among different rows of the “general measurement matrix”. Our method, of employing the bilinear approach to solve the general heteroscedastic parameter estimation problem, overcomes these limitations: it is convergent and can cope with a general heteroscedastic problem. Experiments show that the proposed bilinear approach performs slightly better than other competing approachesPei Chen and David Sute...|$|R
30|$|Although tieness is able {{to better}} {{differentiate}} the strength of ties when compared to neighborhood overlap and co-authorship frequency, there are limitations. One {{of them is that}} tieness classifies a tie as strong when the modified neighborhood overlap and weight are very high. Thus, few ties are classified as strong. A solution to this <b>is</b> changing <b>the</b> nominal scale, but it requires to make more analyses from <b>the</b> social networks. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> applying tieness in co-authorship social networks from research areas in which collaborations among researchers are not a common practice. For example, in the sociology area, the level of collaboration is low [4]. Nonetheless, this is a limitation intrinsic to the definition of co-authorship networks, which should contain a good number of connections for any proper analysis.|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a product is highly iterative in nature. Conflicts frequently occur during the design phase of products. Resolution of these conflicts typically involves negotiation among people from several departments across an organization. Once <b>the</b> conflict <b>is</b> resolved, <b>the</b> required changes <b>are</b> incorporated into <b>the</b> product model. Work on the design proceeds until either a satisfactory model is produced or another conflict <b>is</b> encountered. Often, <b>the</b> meetings held to resolve <b>the</b> conflict <b>are</b> face-to-face and require that all or most members <b>be</b> present in <b>the</b> same place. Furthermore, members from different disciplines use varied stand-alone tools {{to make their own}} calculations and arrive at alternatives. This group decision-making process requires organization and <b>is</b> time consuming. <b>The</b> process also involves gathering of information related to <b>the</b> product. <b>Another</b> <b>limitation</b> <b>is</b> that a person can be involved in only one group meeting at a time. All these factors contribute towards making group decision-making the major cause of delays in the design of a product.

30|$|Various aminomutases have <b>been</b> {{used for}} <b>the</b> {{conversion}} of aliphatic and aromatic α-amino acids to the corresponding β-isomers (for an overview see Wu et al. 2010 a). Coupling the catalysis of a promiscuous alanine racemase {{with that of}} phenylalanine aminomutase (PAM) increased the production of enantiopure (R)-β-arylalanines from the corresponding racemic α-isomers (Cox et al. 2009). Using PAM in tandem with a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), various aromatic (S)-β-amino acids can be obtained (Wu et al. 2010 b).
