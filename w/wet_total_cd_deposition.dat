Cesium- 137 (137 Cs) with a half-life of 30. 1  y causes the largest concerns because of its deleterious effect on agriculture and stock farming, and, thus, human life for decades. Removal of 137 Cs contaminated soils or land use limitations in areas where removal is not possible is, therefore, an urgent issue. A challenge {{lies in the fact}} that estimates of 137 Cs emissions from the Fukushima NPP are extremely uncertain, therefore, the distribution of 137 Cs in the environment is poorly constrained. Here, we estimate <b>total</b> 137 <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition</b> by integrating daily observations of 137 <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition</b> in each prefecture in Japan with relative deposition distribution patterns from a Lagrangian particle dispersion model, FLEXPART. We show that 137 Cs strongly contaminated the soils in large areas of eastern and northeastern Japan, whereas western Japan was sheltered by mountain ranges. The soils around Fukushima NPP and neighboring prefectures have been extensively contaminated with depositions of more than 100, 000 and 10, 000  MBq km- 2, respectively. <b>Total</b> 137 <b>Cs</b> <b>depositions</b> over two domains: (i) the Japan Islands and the surrounding ocean (130 – 150 [*]°E and 30 – 46 [*]°N) and, (ii) the Japan Islands, were estimated to be more than 5. 6 and 1. 0  PBq, respectively.

40|$|Background: Every {{five years}} since 1990, the European Heavy Metals in Mosses Survey {{provided}} data on atmospheric heavy metal bioaccumulations in mosses throughout Europe at a high spatial resolution. The moss data show the effectiveness of air quality control policies: for Germany the metal bioaccumulations decreased between 1990 and 2000, whilst they increased from 2000 to 2005. This investigation is intended {{to show how the}} moss data could be used to map atmospheric <b>depositions</b> of <b>Cd</b> and Pb, which later on might serve for the calculation of Critical Loads Exceedances. In addition, we compared how much heavy metal concentrations in mosses in Germany deviate from background data observed in Greenland. Methods: Mapping heavy metals with a high spatial resolution for the German territory was conducted according to the following methodology: EMEP deposition maps (50 km by 50 km spatial resolution) were intersected within a GIS with Kriging maps on Cd and Pb accumulations in mosses (EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) is a scientifically based and politically driven programme under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution for international co-operation to solve transboundary air pollution problems). Subsequently, the statistical relations between the EMEP modelled depositions and the bioaccumulations in mosses were quantified by using regression analysis. The regression functions were used to transform the moss concentration maps into deposition maps. The resulting maps on <b>Cd</b> and Pb <b>depositions</b> have a spatial resolution of 5 km by 5 km and were added to the respective map on the residuals of the regression functions (Regression Kriging). Finally, the territory of Germany was extracted from the European maps on <b>Cd</b> and Pb <b>depositions</b> and the legends were adjusted accordingly in terms of n standard deviations from the German mean value. The concentrations of Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn, and Zn in the mosses sampled in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005 in Germany were compared with background values derived from mosses sampled in north-eastern Greenland (Zackenberg Background Values). The differences between heavy metal concentrations in mosses in Germany and Greenland were calculated for the 16 federal states of Germany and mapped for Pb. Results and discussion: The regression models corroborate that the Cd concentration in mosses is correlated with the EMEP modelled <b>total</b> <b>Cd</b> <b>deposition</b> across Europe (regression coefficient according to Pearson, rp = 0. 67; regression coefficient according to Spearman, rs = 0. 69). The coefficient of determination is r 2 = 0. 44. The same is true for Pb with rp = 0. 76 and rs = 0. 77 and r 2 = 0. 58. Based on the regression models and the respective residuals, maps on the <b>total</b> <b>deposition</b> of <b>Cd</b> and Pb were calculated for the year 2005. The German mean value of <b>total</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb <b>deposition</b> was 0. 342 g/ha/a (standard deviation 0. 08 g/ha/a and 8. 6 g/ha/a (standard deviation 2. 1 g/ha/a) respectively. The maps depict the spatial patterns of the <b>total</b> <b>Cd</b> and Pb <b>deposition</b> in terms of n standard deviations from the respective German wide mean value.

Conclusions: In Germany, the moss measurement data provide a valuable tool at a high spatial resolution for the validation of modelling and mapping of atmospheric heavy metal deposition and should as such be used for this purpose. The comparison of the metal concentrations in mosses in Germany with the values found in Greenland indicate that atmospheric deposition of heavy metals in Germany is still considerably higher than the natural background deposition. ...|$|R
30|$|The European moss {{monitoring}} produces datasets at high {{spatial resolution}} {{which was used}} to evaluate the performance of the EMEP model [11] and to calculate deposition maps with a spatial resolution of 5 [*]km by 5 [*]km through modelling the statistical relations between atmospheric deposition and bioaccumulation of of Cd, Pb and N by use of Regression Kriging [12, 13]. The corresponding methodology and results can be summarised as follows: The EMEP deposition maps were intersected within a GIS with Kriging maps on N, Cd and Pb accumulations in mosses. The maps were calculated by Ordinary Kriging on basis of the variograms presented in the ‘Results’ section of this paper. Next medians were calculated for all moss estimations within each EMEP grid cell. Both moss data and corresponding modelled deposition values were ln-transformed and their relationship investigated and modelled by linear regression analysis. The regression models corroborate that the Cd concentration in mosses is correlated with the EMEP modelled <b>total</b> <b>Cd</b> <b>deposition</b> across Europe (regression coefficient according to Pearson, rp[*]=[*] 0.67; regression coefficient according to Spearman, rs[*]=[*] 0.69). The coefficient of determination is R 2 [*]=[*] 0.44. The same is true for Pb with rp[*]=[*] 0.76 and rs[*]=[*] 0.77 and R 2 [*]=[*] 0.58 [13]. The regression analysis of the estimated N concentrations in mosses and the modelled EMEP depositions, too, resulted in clear linear regression patterns with coefficients of determination of R 2 [*]=[*] 0.62 and Pearson correlations of rp[*]=[*] 0.79 and Spearman correlations of rs[*]=[*] 0.70, respectively [12]. The regression equations were applied on the moss kriging estimates of the element concentration in mosses. The respective residuals were projected onto the centres of the EMEP grid cells and were mapped using variogram analysis and ordinary kriging. Finally, the residual and the regression map were summed up to the map of <b>total</b> N, <b>Cd,</b> and Pb <b>deposition</b> in terrestrial ecosystems throughout Europe. This was done for a 5 [*]km by 5 [*]km raster which was chose due to the results of nearest neighbourhood statistics: All nearest neighbour distances of all moss sites were calculated in ArcGIS 10.0 and summarised in terms of quantile statistics. The 10 th quantile was chosen in order to adjust the interpolation raster to the high density of the moss monitoring net approximating ca. 5000 [*]m (exact value: 5468.5 [*]m).|$|R

In the milk production areas in Finland soil types vary from clayish to humus and peat soils. Although <b>total</b> 137 <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition</b> from nuclear weapon testings was approximately the same in all regions, 137 Cs concentrations in dairy milk during the 1960 s ranged between 5 and 35 Bq/l being highest in regions with high proportion of peat soils.

The level of 90 Sr deposition was 3 – 4 orders of magnitude higher than pre-accident levels and did not reach the level registered during the 1960 s after nuclear tests; the effects from 90 Sr will not be as large as from radioCs. During 2013, the Fukushima fallout decreased by 3 – 4 orders from its magnitude {{at the time of the}} accident, yet some becquerel per square meter of monthly deposition continues. This corresponds to the level in the 1970 s and early 1980 s when China performed atmospheric nuclear tests. During 2013, the 137 Cs concentration remained at a level of tens of micro becquerel per cubic meter. Because re-suspension (secondary emission) will continue over a long time, it is necessary to monitor its future trends and variability. An apparent decrease in atmospheric radioCs deposition was fitted by trinomial exponentials, giving information regarding the reducing trend of airborne radionuclide persistence through re-suspension into the atmosphere. Extrapolation of the decreasing rate suggests that it would take at least a decade for the activity to return to pre-disaster period levels. Further monitoring efforts are essential.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. During {{the summer}} of 1992, {{sampling}} of soil and vegetation was carried out at five localities in West Greenland to investigate the distribution of 137 Cs in soil and in some reindeer fodder plants. Depending on the locality, between 69 % and 97 % of the <b>total</b> 137 <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition</b> resided in the vegetation and upper 5 cm of soil. Between 0 % and 15 % had penetrated to depths lower than 10 cm. Both in the soil and in the vegetation, the concentration of 137 Cs was {{in agreement with the}} degree of continentality estimated from the composition of plant communities; this agreement indicates a precipitation-related longitudinal gradient in the <b>deposition</b> of 137 <b>Cs</b> along the coast of West Greenland. In leaves of Salix spp., the 137 Cs concentrations in dry matter varied between 2 and 30 Bq kg- 1 : the lowest concentrations were in Salix glauca growing on mineral soils in the continental inland of Søndre Strømfjord (Kangerlussuaq), and the highest concentrations were in Salix glauca growing in bogs at Skarvefjeld on the coast of southwestern Disko Island. In the two species of lichens, the 137 Cs concentration pattern was similar to that of Salix, with a variation between 65 and 138 Bq kg- 1 in Cetraria nivalis and between 209 and 305 Bq kg- 1 in Cladina mitis. The ratio between the concentration (Bq kg- 1) in the plant and the ground deposition (Bq m- 2), the Observed Ratio, or OR (m 2 kg- 1), was calculated for Salix, lichen, and moss species. The OR for Salix varied between localities, and ranged from 0. 003 to 0. 017 m 2 kg- 1.

Given these findings, we evaluated whether N-alpha-benzoyl-N 5 -(2 -chloro- 1 -iminoethyl) -L-ornithine amide (Cl-amidine), a recently described pan-PAD inhibitor, could affect the development of arthritis and autoimmunity by treating mice in the CIA model with Cl-amidine on days 0 - 35.

Reduced levels of citrullinated synovial proteins observed in mice treated with Cl-amidine are consistent with the notion that Cl-amidine derives its efficacy from its ability to inhibit the deiminating activity of PADs.

The method uses a relationship between deposition and precipitation at Tromsø (Norway) calculated for each year since 1955, which is spread over the Arctic using a global precipitation data set within a geographical information system. The advantages of this approach include the ability to cover the whole Arctic area and to predict 137 <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition,</b> either integrated or decay corrected (cumulative), for any 0. 5 × 0. 5 ° unit for any year. For land north of 60 °N, the areas with the lowest estimated ground 137 <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition</b> from nuclear weapons testing are the Russian far north east, north Greenland and northern Canada. The highest estimated ground deposition occurred in the coastal areas of Alaska, {{the southern tip of}} Greenland, western Canada, Iceland and the western coast of Norway. Predicted differences in the spatial distribution of global fallout are generally consistent with the trends observed by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) and with reported measurements in the region above 60 °N. A comparison of the predicted cumulative 137 <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition</b> with measured values gave a significant correlation (p< 0. 001).

40|$|The {{roughness}} {{evolution of}} carbon films deposited from hyperthermal species was investigated by AFM. 10 eV <b>C</b> <b>deposition</b> {{at normal incidence}} angle starts with formation of 10 nm high islands followed by continuous, sp(exp 2) rich films at larger doses with essentially the same feature height and film roughness. 40 eV <b>C</b> <b>deposition</b> at normal incidence angle (0 deg of angle) forms sp(exp 3) rich, atomically smooth films, which become sp(exp 2) rich and rough at oblique angles (>= 60 deg of angle). The limitations of currently available molecular dynamic simulations prevent their use to describe the island formation during 10 eV C bombardment.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition</b> {{on the field}} {{emission}} (FE) properties of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) bundles were studied. In addition, a comparative study was made {{on the effects of}} O 2, Ar and H 2 gases on the field emission properties of SWNT bundles and multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). We observed that <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition</b> decreases the turn-on field for FE by a factor of 2. 1 - 2. 9 and increases the FE current by 6 orders of magnitude. After <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition,</b> the FE current versus voltage (I-V) curves showed non-Fowler-Nordheim behavior at large currents consistent with tunneling from adsorbate states. At lower currents, the ratio of the slope of the FE I-V curves before and after <b>Cs</b> <b>deposition</b> was approximately 2. 1. Exposure to N 2 does not decrease the FE current, while exposure to O 2 decreases the FE current. Our results show that cesiated SWNT bundles have great potential as economical and reliable vacuum electron sources. We find that H 2 and Ar gases do not significantly affect the FE properties of SWNTs or MWNTs. O 2 temporarily reduces the FE current and increases the turn-on voltage of SWNTs. Full recovery of these properties occurred after operation in UHV. The higher operating voltages in an O 2 environment caused a permanent decrease of FE current and increase in turn-on field of MWNTs. The ratios of the slopes before and after O 2 exposure were approximately 1. 04 and 0. 82 for SWNTs and MWNTs, respectively. SWNTs compared to MWNTs would appear to make more economical and reliable vacuum electron sources...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{incubation}} of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with polyclonal antibodies from HIV-infected persons and complement results in complement-mediated neutralization due, at least in part, to virolysis. The current study was performed to determine whether any of a panel of 16 human monoclonal antibodies to HIV could activate complement and, if so, which determinants of the HIV envelope could serve as targets for antibody-dependent complement-mediated effects. Human monoclonal antibodies directed to the third variable region (V 3 region) of HIVMN gp 120 induced <b>C</b> 3 <b>deposition</b> on infected cells and virolysis of free virus. Antibodies to two other sites on HIVMN gp 120 and two sites on gp 41 induced few or no complement-mediated effects. Similarly, only anti-V 3 antibodies efficiently caused complement-mediated effects on the HIVIIIB isolate. In general, the level of <b>C</b> 3 <b>deposition</b> on infected cells paralleled the relative level of bound monoclonal antibodies. As expected, pooled polyclonal antibodies from infected persons were much more efficient than monoclonal antibodies inducing <b>C</b> 3 <b>deposition</b> per unit of bound immunoglobulin. Treatment of virus or infected cells with soluble CD 4 resulted in increases in anti-gp 41 antibody-mediated virolysis and <b>C</b> 3 <b>deposition</b> but decreases in anti-V 3 antibody-mediated virolysis and <b>C</b> 3 <b>deposition.</b> In general, virolysis of HIV was more sensitive as an indicator of complement-mediated effects than infected-cell surface <b>C</b> 3 <b>deposition,</b> suggesting the absence of or reduced expression of functional complement control proteins on the surface of free virus. Thus, this study shows that human monoclonal antibodies to the V 3 region of gp 120 are most efficient in causing virolysis of free virus and <b>C</b> 3 <b>deposition</b> on infected cells. Elution of gp 120 with soluble CD 4 exposes epitopes on gp 41 that can also bind antibody, resulting in virolysis and <b>C</b> 3 <b>deposition.</b> These findings establish a serologically defined model system for the further study of the interaction of complement and HIV...|$|R

Three tracer techniques using C isotopes to quantify rhizodeposition are discussed: pulse labelling, continuous labelling, and natural 13 C abundance. Only the tracer methods provided adequate results for the whole rhizodeposition. The differences in the below-ground C translocation pattern between cereals and grasses are discussed. Cereals (wheat and barley) transfer 20 – 30 % of <b>total</b> assimilated <b>C</b> into the soil. Half of this amount is subsequently found in the roots and about one-third in CO 2 evolved from the soil by root respiration and microbial utilization of root-borne organic substances. The remaining part of below-ground translocated C is incorporated into the soil microorganisms and soil organic matter (SOM). The portion of assimilated C allocated below the ground by cereals decreases during growth and by increasing N fertilization. Pasture plants translocated about 30 – 50 % of assimilates below-ground, and their translocation patterns {{were similar to those}} of crop plants. On average, the <b>total</b> <b>C</b> amounts translocated into the soil by cereals and pasture plants are approximately the same (1. 5 Mg C ha 71; calculated for the productivity of about 6 Mg grain yield), when the same growth period is considered.

Cystatin C is abundant in cerebrospinal fluid and the most prominent pathology in HCCAA is cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to mutant cystatin <b>C</b> amyloid <b>deposition</b> with associated cerebral hemorrhages, typically in young adult carriers. Analyses of post-mortem brain samples shows that pathological changes are limited to arteries and regions adjacent to arteries. The severity of pathological changes at post-mortem has precluded the elucidation of the evolution of histological changes. Mutant cystatin <b>C</b> <b>deposition</b> in carriers is systemic and has, for example, been described in the skin, suggesting similar pathological mechanisms both in the brain and outside of the central nervous system. The aim {{of this study was to}} use skin biopsies from asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers to study intermediate events in HCCAA pathogenesis. We found that cystatin <b>C</b> <b>deposition</b> in minimally affected samples was limited to the basement membrane (BM) between the dermis and epidermis. When the deposits were more advanced, they extended to other BM regions in the skin. Our results showed that the immunoreactivity of the BM protein COLIV was increased to a similar extent in all carrier biopsies and cystatin C deposits were in close association with COLIV. The density of fibroblasts in the upper dermis of carrier skin was increased, whereas the distribution of other cell types examined did not differ compared with control biopsies. COLIV and cystatin C immunoreactivity in carrier biopsies was closely associated with the fibroblasts. The results of this study, in conjunction with our previous results regarding pathological BM changes in leptomeningeal arteries of patients, suggest that BM changes are early and important events in HCCAA pathogenesis that could facilitate cystatin <b>C</b> <b>deposition</b> and aggregation...|$|R
