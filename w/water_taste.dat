40|$|The {{sense of}} taste allows animals to detect and assess {{potentially}} nutritive and toxic substances prior to ingestion. Animals have evolved to detect taste substances that are present in their environment. In fliesDrosophila melanogaster, these include (but may not be limited to), sugars, salts, toxic or noxious bitter compounds, CO 2, and water. How do flies detect diverse taste substances? The {{first part of this}} thesis describes the results of a microarray-based screen performed in order to identify novel taste detection components. More specifically, a screen comparing RNA from proboscises with and without gustatory neurons enriched for known taste sensillum associated transcripts (gustatory receptors and odorant binding proteins) as well as transcripts with no known gustatory ascribed function. This latter group included transcripts with homology to ion channels and transporters, cytochromes, transcription factors, and proteases. A secondary screen with transgenic flies identified genes whose putative cis-regulatory sequence directed reporter expression in specific subsets of taste neurons, including epithelial sodium channel/degenerin (ENaC/Deg) family members, ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), an orphan G-protein coupled receptor, and a carbonic anhydrase. The second part of this thesis focuses on the molecular basis for <b>water</b> <b>taste.</b> Here, I identify a member of the ENaC/Deg family, ppk 28, as an osmosensitive ion channel that mediates the cellular and behavioral response to water. I use molecular, cellular, calcium imaging and electrophysiological approaches to show that ppk 28 is expressed in water-sensing neurons and loss of ppk 28 abolishes water sensitivity.

40|$|Water {{perception}} {{is important for}} insects, because they are particularly vulnerable to water loss because their body size is small. In Drosophila, gustatory receptor neurons are located {{at the base of}} the taste sensilla on the labellum, tarsi, and wing margins. One of the gustatory receptor neurons in typical sensilla is known to respond to water. To reveal the neural mechanisms of water perception in Drosophila, it is necessary to identify water receptor neurons and their projection patterns. We used a Gal 4 enhancer trap strain in which GAL 4 is expressed in a single gustatory receptor neuron in each sensillum on the labellum. We investigated the function of these neurons by expressing the upstream activating sequence transgenes, shibirets 1, tetanus toxin light chain, or diphtheria toxin A chain. Results from the proboscis extension reflex test and electrophysiological recordings indicated that the GAL 4 -expressing neurons respond to water.

Methods: The rated intensity and pleasantness of sucrose taste was compared in male alcoholics (n = 45) and non-alcoholic controls (n = 33). Results: The rated intensity, but not pleasantness, of <b>water</b> <b>taste</b> (0 % sucrose) was higher in the alcoholics. The two groups did not differ with respect to the rated intensity or pleasantness of sucrose solutions (1 – 30 %). The proportion of sweet-likers, i. e. subjects rating 30 % sucrose as most pleasant, was similar in both groups (the controls: 57. 6 %, the alcoholics: 62. 2 %). A sub-group of alcoholics with a paternal history of alcoholism (n = 22) rated the highest sucrose concentration as more pleasant compared to alcoholics without alcoholic fathers. The proportion of sweet-likers among the alcoholics with a paternal history of alcoholism (77. 3 %) was significantly higher than that found in the alcoholics without a familial history of alcoholism (47. 8 %). Conclusions: The present results suggest the following: (i) alcohol dependence is not associated with any major alterations in taste responses to sucrose solutions, (ii) sweet liking is a phenotypic marker of male alcoholics with a paternal history of alcoholism...|$|E
