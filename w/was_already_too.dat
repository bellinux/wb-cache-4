5|$|One soon {{latched onto}} him and began firing. McCudden dived steeply but the enemy pilot {{remained}} behind him. At 800 feet McCudden began a spinning dive until the German, now some distance behind, abruptly turned away. The enemy aircraft was fired at by British ground forces and McCudden, who by now had unjammed his Lewis machine gun, turned to give pursuit. The enemy pilot, apparently unaware of this, <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> high and McCudden {{watched as he}} re-joined his flight and departed the area.|$|E
5|$|Smith asked Walls {{for details}} of his plan ("Operation Quartz") for using force to prevent ZANU-PF taking power by force if it lost the election. Walls insisted that ZANU-PF would not win the election. When it did happen, both Smith and Van der Byl {{believed}} that the Army should step in to prevent Mugabe taking over. Walls took the view that it <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> late, and while the others wished for some move, {{they were forced to}} concede to this view.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour {{ended in}} tragedy on June 30, with an {{accident}} at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death {{as the crowd}} rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled {{and members of the}} band contemplated retiring after this event. Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.|$|E

5|$|Todd Elementary School serves {{students}} {{from kindergarten through}} to fifth grade. The current elementary school building opened in 1953 and is named after George A. Todd, Jr. who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent and taught for over 40 years. When it opened, the school <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> small; two more rooms were added. In 1956, another addition nearly doubled the school's size. In 2000, another expansion of the school began, creating distinct wings for students in kindergarten to second grade and students in third to fifth grade. It became a Blue Ribbon school in 2016.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the cathedral, {{including}} the chapter house, was finished in 1306, it <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> small for the developing liturgy, and unable to accommodate increasingly grand processions of clergy. Bishop John Droxford initiated another phase of building under master mason Thomas of Whitney, during which the central tower was heightened and an eight-sided Lady chapel was added at the east end by 1326. Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury followed, continuing the eastward extension of the choir and retrochoir beyond. He oversaw the building of Vicars' Close and the Vicars' Hall, to give {{the men who were}} employed to sing in the choir a secure place to live and dine, away from the town and its temptations. He had an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes, and he surrounded his palace with crenellated walls, a moat and a drawbridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Hornsby {{was again}} hired {{to manage the}} St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, Bill Veeck, {{was the son of}} former Cubs {{president}} and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. On June9, he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when it <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> late to do anything about it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.|$|E

5|$|In February 1999, Payton {{announced}} that he had a rare autoimmune liver disease known as primary sclerosing cholangitis, which may have led to his cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). He spent his final months as an advocate for organ transplants, appearing in many commercials to encourage others to donate organs, although by the time his first appeal was recorded, his illness <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> far advanced for transplantation to have been a viable option. In April of that year, Payton made a final public appearance at a Chicago Cubs game with Mike Ditka, where he threw the game's ceremonial first pitch. Author Don Yaeger worked with him during the last weeks of his life to create his autobiography, Never Die Easy.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May, Paulus, {{on orders}} from Bock, began a general {{offensive}} {{from the area}} of Merefa {{in the north of}} the bulge in an attempt to encircle the remaining Soviet forces in the Izium salient. Only then did Stalin authorize Zhukov to stop the offensive and fend off German flanking forces. However, it <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> late. Quickly, the Germans achieved considerable success against Soviet defensive positions. The 20 May saw more of the same, with the German forces closing in from the rear. More German divisions were committed to the battle that day, shattering several Soviet counterparts, allowing the Germans to press forward. The Luftwaffe also intensified operations over the Donets River to prevent Soviet forces escaping. Ju 87s from StG 77 destroyed five of the main bridges and damaged four more while Ju 88 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3) inflicted heavy losses on retreating motorised and armoured columns.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} {{launching}} of Toan Thang 44, the two battalions of the 3rd Brigade, U.S. 9th Infantry Division, crossed the border 48 kilometers southwest of the Fishhook into an area known as the Dog's Face from 7 through 12 May. The only significant contact with PAVN forces took place near the hamlet of Chantrea, where 51 North Vietnamese were killed and another 21 were captured. During the operation, the brigade lost eight men killed and 22 wounded. It <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> late for thousands of ethnic Vietnamese murdered by Cambodian persecution, but there were {{tens of thousands of}} Vietnamese still within the country who could now be evacuated to safety. South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu arranged with Lon Nol to repatriate as many as were willing to leave. The new relationship did not, however, prevent the Cambodian government from stripping the Vietnamese of their homes and other personal property before they left.|$|E

5|$|The Doughnut <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> {{small for}} the number of GCHQ staff at its completion, as a vast {{expansion}} in the number of employees had occurred {{as a consequence of the}} September 11 attacks in 2001. The staff numbered almost 6,500 by 2008. The addition of a two-storey office block and a three-storey car park to the Doughnut was proposed in 2008, but eventually suspended in 2011. The new buildings were intended to facilitate the arrival of 800 staff from GCHQ's former site at Oakley. Though it was initially felt that the Doughnut would be adequate for the new staff, 600 contractors working on technical projects for GCHQ were eventually relocated in a secret undisclosed building in the 'Gloucestershire area'. The parking of cars by GCHQ staff on residential roads has caused 'annoyance' among local residents in Benhall. It was believed that the arrival of new staff may have further affected local parking but GCHQ stated the presence of the new employees would have been offset by redundancies.|$|E
5|$|The {{command of}} the German V Corps, trapped with the IX Army north of Forst, passed from the IV Panzer Army to the IX Army. The corps was still {{holding on to the}} Berlin-Cottbus highway front line. Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner's Army Group Centre {{launched}} a counter-offensive aimed at breaking through to Berlin from the south and making a successful initial incursion (the Battle of Bautzen) in the 1st Ukrainian Front region, engaging the 2nd Polish Army and elements of the Red Army's 52nd Army and 5th Guards Army. When the old southern flank of the IV Panzer Army had some local successes counter-attacking north against the 1st Ukrainian Front, Hitler gave orders that showed his grasp of military reality was completely gone. He ordered the IX Army to hold Cottbus and set up a front facing west. Then they were to attack the Soviet columns advancing north. This would supposedly allow them to form a northern pincer that would meet the IV Panzer Army coming from the south and envelop the 1st Ukrainian Front before destroying it. They were to anticipate a southward attack by the III Panzer Army and be ready to be the southern arm of a pincer attack that would envelop 1st Belorussian Front, which would be destroyed by SS-General Felix Steiner's Army Detachment advancing from north of Berlin. Later in the day, when Steiner explained {{that he did not have}} the divisions to do this, Heinrici made it clear to Hitler's staff that unless the IX Army retreated immediately, it would be enveloped by the Soviets. He stressed that it <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> late for it to move north-west to Berlin and would have to retreat west. Heinrici went on to say that if Hitler did not allow it to move west, he would ask to be relieved of his command.|$|E

25|$|It <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> late. The Japanese armies in Central Burma {{had lost}} most of their equipment, and their cohesion. They {{would be unable to}} stop the Fourteenth Army {{exploiting}} to within striking distance of Rangoon. Furthermore, with the loss of Mandalay, the Burmese population finally turned against the Japanese. Uprisings by guerilla forces and a revolt by the Burma National Army, which the Japanese had formed two years previously, would contribute to the eventual Japanese defeat.|$|E
25|$|The crew never {{realized}} {{the severity of}} the fire. The fire <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>too</b> severe and started to degrade the structural integrity of the lift wing. This caused the crew to hardly be able to control the aircraft. The crew had to apply maximum aileron trim setting due to the reduction of the stiffness of the wing. The left wing then failed upwards, causing the aircraft to roll through 90 degree and crash, subsequently bursting into flames and killing everyone on board.|$|E

Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors— even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.|$|E
