5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the heliograph. In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the heliograph) was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and signal lights (at night). Signal lights, which were secured in a <b>wooden</b> <b>case,</b> employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by signal lights could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E

Secondly, a broad variety of wood and metal-working tools, including hand tools required to maintain and repair a steamboat. Finally, there were the personal effects of the crew, including small bits of clothing and shoes together with bottles of ink and vanilla. One of the more surprising finds was a gramophone in a <b>wooden</b> <b>case</b> and three Berliner records.|$|E

500|$|N. Macleod then related how as a child, he {{had been}} close to an English smith {{employed}} at Dunvegan. One day the smith told him in secrecy that the chest in which the flag was held was to be forced open the next morning, {{and that it had}} been arranged by Hector Macdonald Buchanan that the smith would be at the castle with the necessary tools. N. Macleod then asked Buchanan for permission to be present, and was granted leave on the condition that he not tell anyone—especially the chief—what was about to be done. The next morning the chest was forced open and the flag was found to be held within a <b>wooden</b> <b>case.</b> N. Macleod described the flag then as being a square-shaped piece of cloth with crosses wrought on it with gold thread, and several [...] "elf spots" [...] stitched onto it. After the flag had been examined, it was placed back into its case. N. Macleod stated that at around this time it was learned that the heir to the chiefship, Norman, was killed at sea. The HMS Queen Charlotte, on which he was a lieutenant, caught fire and exploded at sea killing 673 officers and men. N. Macleod stated that at about the same time, MacLeod's Maidens were sold to Campbell of Ensay. He also stated that he personally saw a fox with cubs, which lived in the west turret of the castle. N. Macleod related how he was grateful that the worst part of the prophecy remained unfulfilled; and that the chiefly family still owned their ancestral lands.|$|E
500|$|Salt Lake City police placed Bundy on 24-hour surveillance, and Thompson flew to Seattle {{with two}} other detectives to {{interview}} Kloepfer. She told them that in the year prior to Bundy's move to Utah she had discovered objects she [...] "couldn't understand" [...] in her house and in Bundy's apartment: a set of crutches; a bag of plaster of Paris that he admitted stealing from a medical supply house; a meat cleaver, never used for cooking, that he packed {{when he moved to}} Utah; surgical gloves; an Oriental knife in a <b>wooden</b> <b>case</b> that he kept in his glove compartment; and a sack full of women's clothing. Bundy was perpetually in debt, and Kloepfer suspected he had stolen almost everything of significant value that he owned. Once, when she confronted him over a new TV and stereo, he warned her, [...] "If you tell anyone, I'll break your fucking neck." [...] She said Bundy became [...] "very upset" [...] whenever she considered cutting her hair, which was long and parted in the middle. She would sometimes awaken {{in the middle of the}} night to find him under the bed covers with a flashlight, examining her body. He kept a lug wrench, taped halfway up the handle, in the trunk of her car—another Volkswagen Beetle, which he often borrowed—"for protection". The detectives confirmed that Bundy had not been with Kloepfer on any of the nights during which the Pacific Northwest victims had vanished, nor on the day Ott and Naslund were abducted. Shortly thereafter, Kloepfer was interviewed by Seattle homicide detective Kathy McChesney, and learned of the existence of Stephanie Brooks and her brief engagement to Bundy around Christmas 1973.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah (Yoma 39a) {{follows the}} Hebrew Bible text; two goats were procured, similar {{in respect of}} appearance, height, cost, and time of selection. Having one of these on his right {{and the other on}} his left, the high priest, who was {{assisted}} in this rite by two subordinates, put both his hands into a <b>wooden</b> <b>case,</b> and took out two labels, one inscribed [...] "for Yahweh" [...] and the other [...] "for Azazel". The high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said, [...] "A sin-offering to Yahweh" [...] (thus speaking the Tetragrammaton); and the two men accompanying him replied, [...] "Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever." [...] He then fastened a scarlet woolen thread {{to the head of the}} goat [...] "for Azazel"; and laying his hands upon it again, recited the following confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness: [...] "O Lord, I have acted iniquitously, trespassed, sinned before Thee: I, my household, and the sons of Aaron Thy holy ones. O Lord, forgive the iniquities, transgressions, and sins that I, my household, and Aaron's children, Thy holy people, committed before Thee, as is written in the law of Moses, Thy servant, 'for on this day He will forgive you, to cleanse you from all your sins before the Lord; ye shall be clean.'" ...|$|E
