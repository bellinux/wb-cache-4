5|$|Bolzano and Willi were great-great grandsons of Folie, {{while the}} rest were great-great-great grandsons. Especially {{in the early years}} of the breed's history, some {{inbreeding}} occurred, both by accident and design, which served to reinforce the breed's dominant characteristics. During the 1980s and 1990s, several studies <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> examine morphological differences among the breed lines. Significant differences were found in some characteristics, including height and proportions; these have been used to help achieve breeding objectives, especially in Italy during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In September 1862 Helm {{and several}} other {{citizens}} from Hardin County were arrested by Colonel Knox. After several days of confinement in Elizabethtown the prisoners <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> Louisville. By chance, Kentucky governor James F. Robinson recognized Helm in the group and negotiated with General Jeremiah Boyle to get him released. Shortly after returning home Helm learned of Benjamin's death at the Battle of Chickamauga.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Australian {{personnel}} from the SWPA was delayed by shipping shortages {{and the need}} to maintain a force in the area for garrison duties. The military provided these personnel with training courses to prepare them for civilian life. Refresher courses in basic subjects such as maths and English were run first before vocational training began. The teachers and instructors for these courses were service personnel {{selected on the basis of}} their civilian occupations. In addition, sport competitions <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> keep the men busy.|$|E

5|$|Australian and United States air units {{began their}} pre-invasion attacks on north Borneo in late May. The first {{attack on the}} Brunei Bay area took place on 3 May, and {{included}} a raid targeting the town of Victoria on Labuan. A large number of further attacks <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> suppress Japanese airfields and other facilities throughout north-western and north-eastern Borneo. The plans for the invasion of Brunei Bay had specified that the landings would be supported by aircraft based at Tarakan, but delays in rebuilding the airfield there rendered this impossible and reduced {{the scale of the}} pre-invasion bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they could to help rescue those trapped in the flood waters {{and take care of}} the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{a series}} of Historical Public Exposure Studies <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> assess past {{releases}} and public exposures. For example, the figure at right illustrates the calculated lifetime cancer risk to a laborer from the 1957 Rocky Flats fire. The key shows the cancer risk due to exposure during the 1957 event per million persons. This figure means that an outdoor laborer in the reddest part of Arvada would have roughly a two-in-a-million risk of contracting cancer (0.000002) from being outside during the 1957 fire. The original, complete figure - {{as well as many}} others showing the risks of past exposures - can be viewed in the Summary of Findings from the Historical Public Exposure Studies.|$|E
30|$|Before each {{experimental}} run, {{the filter}} module was washed with deionized water (DW) of electrical conductivity (EC) less than 1  µS/cm, {{unless and until}} particles were not detected in the effluent. In this study, Run 1 <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> observe the kaolin particle removal efficiency in DW with no electric charge to the filter bed, Run 2 <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> observe the effect of conductivity on kaolin particle removal performances with no electric charge, and Run 3 <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> observe the effect of electric charge to the filter bed on kaolin particle removal performances.|$|R
30|$|To confirm these slip {{estimation}} methods, three experiments <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> on a loose sandy field, {{as shown}} in Fig.  5. The first experiment <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> confirm the slip model for straight maneuvering. The robot traveled along a straight line on an inclined slope to the robot’s tilt roll and pitch angles independently. The second experiment <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> verify the conventional slip ratio estimation method [7] and the proposed slip angle estimation method during turning motion of the robot. The third experiment <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> evaluate slip-compensated odometry using the proposed slip model during turning motion of the robot.|$|R

5|$|On September 6, Mayor Ray Nagin {{ordered a}} forced {{evacuation}} of {{everyone from the}} city who {{was not involved in}} clean up work, citing safety and health concerns. The order was given not only as an attempt to restore law and order, but also out of concern about the hazardous living conditions in the city. Eviction efforts escalated three days later, when door-to-door searches <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>to</b> advise remaining residents to leave the city. Despite this, a number of residents defied the eviction order. While initially lax in enforcing evictions, National Guard troops eventually began to remove residents by force.|$|E
