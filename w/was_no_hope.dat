5|$|Meanwhile, {{the troops}} of Urquiza and Eugenio Garzón had {{surrounded}} {{the army of}} Oribe near Montevideo. Their forces numbered roughly 15,000 men, almost double Oribe's 8,500. Realising that the Brazilians were approaching and knowing that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> of victory, Oribe orderered his troops to surrender without a fight on 19 October, and retreated into seclusion on his farm in Paso del Molino.|$|E
5|$|Station to Station was {{recorded}} in late 1975 at Cherokee Studios, Los Angeles. In 1981, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised that it was cut—"in 10 days of feverish activity"—when Bowie decided that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> of his producing a soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth. More recent scholarship contends that the album {{was recorded}} {{over a couple of}} months—with the sessions beginning in late September or early October 1975 and ending in late November—so that it was in the can before Bowie began his abortive sessions on the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to call up}} the aircraft. It {{received a call from}} a resident close to Torghatten which said they had heard aircraft noise followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while a meeting place for the next of kin was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> of finding survivors and the scene changed from a search to an investigation scene. Due to the fog {{it was not possible to}} verify that all people had been killed until the next day. Seventy-five soldiers from the Home Guard participated in the salvage.|$|E

5|$|Crusaders' {{arrival at}} Jerusalem {{revealed}} an arid countryside, lacking in water or food supplies. Here {{there was no}} prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault. They might have been left with little choice, as {{by the time the}} Crusader army reached Jerusalem, {{it has been estimated that}} only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained. These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Provençal contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.|$|E
5|$|KG 53 {{approached}} North Weald {{from the}} east between Maldon, Essex and Rochford. No. 56 Squadron's 12 Hurricanes engaged the bombers, while No. 54 Squadron’s 11 Spitfires engaged the escorting Bf 109s and Bf 110s. In the engagement, at least one Bf 110 was shot down. The line of advance was now clear to the British ground controllers. Five Squadrons: No. 46, 85, 151, 257, and 310 with 61 Hurricanes, were scrambled to intercept the bombers in front of, or over the target. By 17:00 the airfield was covered in 5/10ths stratocumulus at 5,000 feet. Within thirty minutes the cloud base fell to just 3,500 feet. The German formation leaders soon realised that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> of hitting a target from 12,000 feet, particularly when they could not see it. At 17:40, KG 53 turned away and headed for base. They had lost a single bomber to 56 Squadron. Things were about to change. As they turned around, 28 Hurricanes from Nos. 46, 85, and 151 Squadron prepared for a head-on attack. Meanwhile, 12 Hurricanes from 256 Squadron closed on the Germans from behind.|$|E

However, throughout his early days as an aircraft apprentice (and at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell), he maintained his interest in model aircraft and joined the Model Aircraft Society, where he built working replicas. The quality of these attracted {{the eye of the}} Apprentice Wing commanding officer, who noted that Whittle was also a mathematical genius. He was so impressed that in 1926 he recommended Whittle for officer training at RAF College Cranwell.|$|E

25|$|It seems that, in {{response}} to this new submarine threat, some alterations were made to Lusitania and her operation. She was ordered not to fly any flags in the War Zone, a number of warnings, plus advice, were sent to the ship's commander to help him decide how to best protect his ship against the new threat, and it also seems that her funnels were most likely painted a dark grey to help make her less visible to enemy submarines. Clearly, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> of disguising her actual identity, since her profile was so well known, and no attempt was made to paint out the ship's name at the prow.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} Vital Signs helped others {{to follow their}} suit, and the rock music in the country skyrocketed {{for the first time}} in the history of the country. In a time when there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> for the {{industry}} to survive, rock/pop music bands notably and much quickly filled the gap that pop music industry had left. According to the Western observers and cultural critics, the rock music bands in the country brought the significant shift of country's transformation into modernism during the 1990s. With the rise of Vital Signs and later, Junoon and others, the rock music, exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, became a vehicle for expressing patriotic nationalist spirit in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|On 24 August, the Kennedy {{administration}} sent Cable 243 to Lodge in Saigon, marking {{a change}} in American policy. The message advised Lodge to seek {{the removal of the}} Nhus from power, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diệm refused to remove them. As the probability of Diệm doing so was seen as highly unlikely, the message effectively meant the fomenting of a coup. Lodge replied that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> of Diệm removing Nhu, and began to make contact with possible coup plotters through CIA agents. The Voice of America broadcast a statement blaming Nhu for the pagoda raids and absolving the army of culpability. Lodge believed Nhu's influence had risen to unprecedented levels and that Nhu's divide and conquer tactics had split the military into three power groups.|$|E

There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> of reassembling the council while the very anti-Protestant Paul IV was Pope. The council was reconvened by Pope Pius IV (1559–1565) for the last time, meeting from 18 January 1562 at Santa Maria Maggiore, Trento, and continued until its final adjournment on 4 December 1563. It closed {{with a series of}} ritual acclamations honouring the reigning Pope, the Popes who had convoked the Council, the emperor and the kings who had supported it, the papal legates, the cardinals, the ambassadors present, and the bishops, followed by acclamations of acceptance of the faith of the Council and its decrees, and of anathema for all heretics.|$|E

The British {{submarine}} [...] was positioned outside the fjord, and when her crew spotted the German ships, she fired a spread of torpedoes. Karlsruhe zig-zagged to evade the torpedoes, but two still hit the ship; one struck her bow and the other hit amidships. They blasted large holes in the hull and allowed {{thousands of tons of}} water to flood the ship. The flooding disabled her engines and electricity generators, which cut off power to the pumps that were trying {{to keep pace with the}} progressively worsening flooding. With the pumps shut off, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>hope</b> to save Karlsruhe, and so her commander, Friedrich Rieve issued the order to abandon her two hours after the attack.
