Dinklage attended Delbarton School, a Catholic preparatory school for boys, where he developed his acting. In 1984, Dinklage {{was inspired by a}} production of the play True West, written by American playwright Sam Shepard, to pursue a career in acting.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool manager Bill Shankly <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> {{with his}} team's victory and hailed {{it as his}} {{greatest}} moment in management.

The national media was critical of the final, labelling it 'boring'.|$|E

5|$|The casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top {{choice was}} Robert De Niro, who {{repeatedly}} turned the part down, as did {{a succession of}} other actors. Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey {{if he would be}} interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> and signed on immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretary}} of the Treasury <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for the British Government.

5|$|Blencathra sailed for Spitsbergen, but {{was stopped}} by ice, so she {{returned}} to Tromsø. Here she encountered the research ship Princesse Alice, purpose-built for Prince Albert I of Monaco, a leading oceanographer. Bruce <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> when the Prince invited him to join Princesse Alice on a hydrographic survey around Spitsbergen.

5|$|In December 1961, Disney Studios {{released}} Babes in Toyland, a {{film version}} of Victor Herbert's 1903 operetta starring teen heartthrobs Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands. Though new songs with jazzy tempi were incorporated into the film and one critic <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> with the film's colorful numbers, Babes in Toyland was neither a success nor a complete box office flop. Its gigantic toy soldiers became members of the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Christmas Parades.|$|E
5|$|Stenson {{originally}} auditioned to play {{a friend}} of the established character Zara Morgan (Kelly Greenwood). Although unsuccessful, the Hollyoaks casting team later asked her to apply for the new role of Steph Cunningham, and placed her straight into the final stage of auditions. She <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> to subsequently be given the part, which was her first major television role. Stenson joined the cast straight after leaving high school, aged seventeen. She made her first appearance in March 2000, and by 2007 had become the longest-serving female cast member remaining.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of Spitfire and The Lake, RKO cast Hepburn in The Little Minister (1934), based on a Victorian novel by James Barrie, {{in an attempt to}} repeat the success of Little Women. There was no such recurrence, and the picture was a {{commercial}} failure. The romantic drama Break of Hearts (1935) with Charles Boyer was poorly reviewed and also lost money. After three forgettable films, success returned to Hepburn with Alice Adams (1935), the story of a girl's desperation to climb the social ladder. Hepburn loved the book and <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> to be offered the role. The film was a hit, one of Hepburn's personal favorites, and gave the actress her second Oscar nomination. She received the second most votes, after winner Bette Davis.|$|E

5|$|All but Daniel Ricciardo {{did their}} first run in Q3 on used tyres {{in order to}} save a set for the race, with Hamilton fastest yet again. When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> with eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|An often {{overlooked}} influence upon Benchley's early professional career was the admiration and friendship of the Canadian economist, academic, and humorist Dr. Stephen Leacock. From Toronto Leacock closely followed the increasing body of Benchley's published humor and wit, and opened correspondence between them. He admitted to occasional borrowing of a Benchley topic {{for his own}} reflection and writings. Eventually, he began lobbying gently for Benchley to compile his columns into book form, and in 1922 <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> with {{the result of his}} nagging. For his part – in a tribute to Leacock – Benchley later said he wrote everything Leacock ever wrote. They had a marvelous friendship.|$|E
5|$|Australia's manager Frank Farina criticised the {{qualification}} {{format and}} questioned {{the need for}} these kind of matches. Archie Thompson, who scored a record-setting 13 goals, <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> with his record, but he also agreed with Farina's comments. FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper agreed with both comments and suggested {{a change in the}} qualification format, with the smaller teams entering a preliminary round. However, Oceania Football Confederation chairman Basil Scarsella, opposed both comments and claimed that the smaller teams have the right to face Australia and New Zealand, similar to Australia having the rights to face stronger opponents such as Brazil and France.|$|E

5|$|By 1940, the {{outbreak}} of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States. (Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist Nikita Magaloff earlier that year.) They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> {{to be able to}} raise her own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in our own little world.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> {{with his}} team's win and {{credited}} his opponent's performance. He felt the brawl in stoppage time was {{born out of}} Arsenal's frustration after going behind in the match; he did not want either team to be punished. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger apologised for his players' conduct and said he had no regrets over his team selection. Both finalists were fined £100,000 each by The Football Association for their inability to control their players. Emmanuel Eboué was retrospectively banned for three matches as his punch on Wayne Bridge was missed by Howard Webb. Wenger was later found guilty of improper conduct and charged £2,500 for his comments about the linesman.|$|E
5|$|Early in pre-production, Spielberg {{hired the}} film title {{designer}} Dan Perri {{to design a}} logotype for Close Encounters. Perri, who had previously worked on The Exorcist (1973) and Taxi Driver (1976), produced a logotype in Handel Gothic typeface, with only a script to work from. Spielberg <b>was</b> <b>delighted</b> with the result, and applied the logo to all production stationery and crew shirts. Unusually in filmmaking, Spielberg carried enough influence to maintain creative control over the film's entire branding, and asked Perri to design the advertising campaign and title sequence for Close Encounters based on his logo. Perri later went on to design titles {{for a number of}} other major Hollywood pictures, including Star Wars (1977), Raging Bull (1980), and Airplane! (1980).|$|E
