5|$|The {{trend of}} {{military}} sites continues from the Iron Age into the Roman period; two Roman forts in Greater Manchester are scheduled monuments {{and were the}} two main areas of Roman activity in the county. Of the nine castles in Greater Manchester, four are scheduled monuments: Buckton Castle, Watch Hill Castle, Bury Castle, and Radcliffe Tower. The last two are fortified manor houses, and although defined as castles were not exclusively military in nature; they probably acted as the administrative centre of the manors they <b>were</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> are several other manor houses and country houses some with moats in the county that are protected as scheduled monuments. The Astley Green Colliery, the Marple Aqueduct, Oldknows Limekilns, and the Worsley Delph are scheduled relics of Greater Manchester's industrial history.|$|E
25|$|Lively {{tries to}} {{drive a wedge between}} Kenehan and the miners by convincing a young widow, Bridey Mae Tolliver, to falsely accuse Kenehan of sexual assault, and he plants a letter which makes Kenehan appear to be the infiltrator. Danny Radnor overhears Hickey and Griggs talking about the scheme but is caught and held by the two men. The agents intend to keep a watchful eye on Danny, but become drunk and are not paying {{attention}} that night when Danny, while preaching at the Freewill church, relates a parable about Joseph that convinces the miners that they have been deceived by a false story. One of the miners hurries to the camp to find Few Clothes (James Earl Jones), who had drawn the short straw for who would kill Kenehan for his assumed treachery. Few Clothes tells Kenehan he is there to guard him when he comments on the gun the black miner has. Asked whether he knows how to use it, Few Clothes says yes, {{that he was in the}} Spanish–American War of 1898. Kenehan tells him that he was in Fort Leavenworth Military Penitentiary in 1917, and saw Mennonites imprisoned for refusing to bear arms passively resist having their beards shaved and rip the buttons off their prison clothes, since all these were against their religion. They were punished by being handcuffed to cell bars for eight hours per day, until the cuffs had cut into their wrists and caused gangrene. Despite it all, they ripped off re-sewn buttons with their teeth, not one giving up. Kenehan says he never saw braver men, and ironically they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> for refusing to fight. This tale of bravery and injustice leaves Few Clothes conflicted and unsure about his mission to execute Kenehan. Another miner arrives and tells Few Clothes the truth and Kenehan's execution is called off just in time. Meanwhile, Sephus has made his way back to town and informed the others of Lively's betrayal, furiously burning down his restaurant. Lively flees town by swimming across the Tug Fork River.|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} restarted in 2005, {{there was}} a more budget-conscious approach to filming The Fountain, whose original budget was mostly intended for visual effects. Libatique reflected, [...] "Visual effects [...] {{a lot of the}} budget in the original conception. The popcorn moments <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> to justify the budget and bring target audiences into the theater. Ultimately, I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to the core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality. I {{think at the end of}} the day, the theme of the film will be easier to feel." ...|$|E

500|$|Slay Tracks was {{recorded}} during a four-hour session on January 17, 1989, at Young's studio. Kannberg, describing {{the studio and}} the recording process, said, [...] "You go into his house and it's stuff everywhere, old dogs lying around, big pot plants everywhere, and Gary tells us that he got all his equipment by selling pot! It was us going in and pretty much just laying down the songs with a glide guitar and a detuned guitar through a bass amp and then we'd play drums over the top." [...] Young, though bewildered by the band's sound, contributed by playing drums. He recalled, [...] " [...] {{come in and they}} play this weird guitar noise and it just sounds like noise, with no background. My drums <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> so I said, 'Should I drum?' and they said 'Okay.'" [...] Kannberg said, [...] "We did it really fast. We probably spent one day tracking and one day mixing it." [...] The title of the EP had been decided prior to its recording, and the pseudonyms S.M. and Spiral Stairs were used to credit Malkmus and Kannberg respectively.|$|E
500|$|It {{would be}} January 1997 until the band {{would be able}} to wrap up {{sessions}} for Dude Ranch, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording. For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to [...] "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound-effects machine. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor's drum tracks for several songs. Hoppus recalled [...] "I remember when we finished Dude Ranch I was so proud. That {{was the first time we}} could take the time and whatever to make a good record." [...] Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard. [...] "When we <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> mixing, the A person would come by," [...] remembered Cameron. [...] "I don't think the band really knew what they had but certainly the label knew they had so many good songs on the record." [...] DeLonge remembered it differently: [...] " [...] fucking hated pop-punk. They wanted nothing to do with it. They were into Pavement or whatever." [...] After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood.|$|E

60|$|From {{there we}} {{went on to a}} place called Bruges; and from there to Ghent, where we picked up with the 52nd and the 95th, which were the two regiments that we were brigaded with. It's a {{wonderful}} place for churches and stonework is Ghent, and indeed of all the towns we <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> was scarce one but had a finer kirk than any in Glasgow. From there we pushed on to Ath, which is a little village on a river, or a burn rather, called the Dender. There we were quartered--in tents mostly, for it was fine sunny weather--and the whole brigade set to work at its drill from morning till evening. General Adams was our chief, and Reynell was our colonel, and they were both fine old soldiers; but what put heart into us most was to think that we were under the Duke, for his name was like a bugle call. He was at Brussels with the bulk of the army, but we knew that we should see him quick enough if he were needed.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were not}} many adventures {{to be had}} in those regions where she washed up. Not much [...] "wide and {{adaptable}} life" [...] to take her thoughts off herself. But on her journeys {{to and from the}} hospital she had more than one odd little experience. One morning she noticed a poorly dressed woman with a red and swollen face, flapping along Regent Street like a wounded bird, and biting strangely at her hand. Hearing her groan, Noel asked her what the matter was. The woman held out the hand. [...] "Oh!" [...] she moaned, [...] "I was scrubbin' the floor and I got this great needle stuck through my 'and, and it's broke off, and I can't get it out. Oh! Oh!" [...] She bit at the needle-end, not quite visible, but almost within reach of teeth, and suddenly went very white. In dismay, Noel put an arm round her, and turned her into a fine chemist's shop. Several ladies <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> buying perfumes, and they looked with acerbity at this disordered dirty female entering among them. Noel went up to a man behind the counter. [...] "Please give me something quick, for this poor woman, I think she's going to faint. She's run a needle through her hand, and can't get it out." [...] The man gave her [...] "something quick," [...] and Noel pushed past two of the dames back to where the woman was sitting. She was still obstinately biting at her hand, and suddenly her chin flew up, and there, between her teeth, was the needle. She took it from them with her other hand, stuck it proudly in the front of her dress, and out tumbled the words: [...] "Oh! there--I've got it!" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{running of}} distempered {{people about the}} streets was very dismal, and the magistrates did their utmost to prevent it; but as it was {{generally}} in the night, and always sudden, when such attempts were made, the officers could not be at hand to prevent it; and even when they got out in the day, the officers appointed did not care to meddle with them, because, as they were all grievously infected, to be sure, when they were come to that height, so they were more than ordinarily infectious, {{and it was one}} of the most dangerous things that could be to touch them. On the other hand, they generally ran on, not knowing what they did, till they dropped down stark dead, or till they had exhausted their spirits so as that they would fall and then die in perhaps half an hour or an hour; and, which was most piteous to hear, they were sure to come to themselves entirely in that half hour or hour, and then to make most grievous and piercing cries and lamentations, in the deep afflicting sense of the condition they <b>were</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> was much of it before the order for shutting up of houses was strictly put into execution; for at first the watchmen were not so rigorous and severe as they were afterwards in the keeping the people in; that is to say, before they were (I mean some of them) severely punished for their neglect, failing in their duty, and letting people who were under their care slip away, or conniving at their going abroad, whether sick or well. But after they saw the officers appointed to examine into their conduct were resolved to have them do their duty, or be punished for the omission, they were more exact, and the people were strictly restrained; which was a thing they took so ill, and bore so impatiently, that their discontents can hardly be described; but there was an absolute necessity for it, that must be confessed, unless some other measures had been timely entered upon, and it was too late for that.|$|E
