40|$|Adults readily detect {{changes in}} face {{patterns}} {{brought about by}} the inversion of eyes and mouth when the faces <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> upright but not when they <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> upside down. Research suggests that this illusion (the Thatcher illusion) is caused by the interfering effects of face inversion on the processing of second-order relational information (fine spatial information such as the distance between the eyes). In the current study, 6 -month-olds discriminated ‘thatcherized’ faces when they <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> upright but not when they <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> upside down. These results are consistent with the notion that 6 -month-olds are sensitive to second-order relational information while processing faces...|$|R
