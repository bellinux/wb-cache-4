50|$|Nelsonic Industries was an {{electronics}} manufacturing and development company that operated from Long Island City, Queens, New York City {{in the early}} 1980s and throughout the 1990s when it was acquired by the watch-manufacturer, M.Z. Berger. Nelsonic produced numerous toy-themed <b>wrist-watches</b> during their existence, often targeting younger audiences with likenesses of characters from popular franchises such as Barbie, the Ghostbusters, and Mario. Nelsonic became notable during the early mid-1980s for being the first electronics company in the United States to produce game-watches (multi-purpose electronic devices capable of functioning as both a time-piece and as a typically electronic game). For a period subsequent to its purchase by M.Z. Berger, Nelsonic operated as a subsidiary division of its parent company and game-watches were produced that bore the Nelsonic mark. This practice ended as M.Z. Berger shifted focus to more traditional and higher-end timepieces. Today the original Nelsonic Game Watch line has entered the secondary market and individual Game Watches have become highly sought-after collectibles that often fetch high prices on eBay and other online auction websites.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout its existence, Nelsonic {{produced}} pop-culture-themed <b>wrist-watches</b> {{for children}} and young adults. The chronograph digital watches, typically made of molded plastic, invariably featured an alarm and utilized LCD screens to display the time for their wearers. In time the company began manufacturing multi-purpose units that used the LCD screen to combine time display functions with simple video game functions. These simple video games were variations {{on the theme of}} the Calculator watch, and the patent covering the Game Watch line is in fact classified as an [...] "electronic calculator watch structure." [...] Becoming the first electronics manufacturer in the United States to produce game-watches, Nelsonic earned a large share in this specialized market and was able to earn the attention of large video game companies at events such as the Consumer Electronics Show. Having caught the popular attention and with goodwill at a high-point, Nelsonic was able to obtain licensing from several big-name video game companies such as Sega, Nintendo, Midway Games, and Mylstar Electronics. With roots in the toy market, Nelsonic was also able to obtain similar licenses to produce LCD versions of popular electronic toys like Milton Bradley's Simon as well as to produce original LCD games for non-game toy franchises like Barbie, G.I. Joe, and Power Rangers and even for film and TV franchises such as Ghostbusters. So well-known became the Nelsonic brand that it was even able to license its own original games (such as the Nelsonic version of the public-domain blackjack which was licensed to Caesars Palace).|$|E

That small vessel is actually a weapon as it contains explosive chemicals (a bomb named [...] "Ophalaska") with its changing colours. Now comes the quarreling between two gangs, in which one gang is headed by Sarveshwaran ( [...] R. Sarath Kumar [...] ). He lives in Kumbakonam along with his men.Another scene opens in Pollachi, where Surya (also R. Sarath Kumar [...] ) is an unemployed youth. He lives in a bungalow with his joint family. Maha ( [...] Meera Nandan [...] ) {{falls in love with}} Surya. Surya sees a metal sheet written in Chinese language. When he magnifies that, he sees Chinese script along with some Tamil words.Sarveshwaran starts talking to the portrait of his mother who is no longer alive. He then reveals his childhood story. Sarveshwaran is the son of a handicapped woman who is a florist. He sees so many kids wearing <b>wrist-watches,</b> buying lollipops, etc. He asks his mother for the money so that he can also do the same things what the kids do regularly. He is the student of a corporation school. He also asks his mother to get him admitted in a government school so that he can learn to speak English. His mother pleads to principal of government school to enroll him in that school. But, the principal denies it and he accidentally pushes his mother from the balcony, resulting in her death. Sarveshwaran kills the principal the same way the principal killed Sarveshwaran's mother. Now comes the present, in which Sarveshwaran assures his mother that he'll earn a lot of money. He's then revealed to be a terrorist. Thirumalai is a cop who investigates a lorry which contains a lot of small vessels that explosive chemicals with its changing colours. This lorry actually belongs to Sarveshwaran. Thirumalai gets confused to see hospital getting converted into a lodge, injured men suddenly getting recovered. He learns that it is all because of Sarveshwaran. Selvam(Arun Sagar),who is one of Sarveshwaran's men, stabs Thirumalai. In spite of stabbing, he survives that and calls Surya for help. Surya suddenly gets shocked seeing Thirumalai dead.Surya is then revealed to be an undercover cop. He decides to foil all the plans made by Sarveshwaran to destroy the whole India using a bomb called WHI (We Hate India, planned to keep bomb in 101 various places of India). Surya also finds the matter that Sarveshwaran has made contacts with Chinese terrorists for helping him so that India is no more. Surya, along with other three undercover cops, go to Sarveshwaran's house and kill his two men. Sarveshwaran, in order to exact his revenge, kidnaps the whole family of Surya, in which Maha is included. A very few members from Surya's family is killed by Sarveshwaran. Surya keeps Selvam under his custody. When Surya and other three undercover cops along with Selvam go to Sarveshwaran's lair, Surya is left alive while the other four who came with him are killed. He saves his kidnapped family after beating Sarveshwaran's men to death. He also sees Maha being tied there with a timer bomb.Surya then confronts Sarveshwaran. An ensuing fight goes between both of them. After Surya defeats Sarveshwaran, Sarveshwaran falls unconscious. Surya deactivates the bomb and saves Maha. He suddenly sees Sarveshwaran missing. When he goes in search for him along with Maha, Sarveshwaran suddenly flies stabs Surya in his stomach. But Surya somehow survives the stab and shoots Sarveshwaran dead.And, in the end, he gets admitted to hospital.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how parallelism {{in the digital}} baseband processor can reduce the energy required to receive ultra-wideband (UWB) packets. The supply voltage of the digital baseband is lowered so that the correlator operates near its minimum energy point resulting in a 68 % energy reduction across the entire baseband. This optimum supply voltage occurs below the threshold voltage, placing the circuit in the sub-threshold region. The correlator {{and the rest of}} the baseband must be parallelized to maintain throughput at this reduced voltage. While sub-threshold operation is traditionally used for low energy, low frequency applications such as <b>wrist-watches,</b> this paper examines how sub-threshold operation can be applied to low energy, high performance applications. The correlators are further parallelized for a 31 x reduction in the synchronization time, which along with duty-cycling, lowers the energy per packet by 43 % for a 500 byte packet. Simulation results for a 100 Mbps UWB baseband processor are described. 1...|$|E
40|$|<b>Wrist-watches</b> {{are worn}} by a {{significant}} portion of the world‟s population, but their potential usefulness is not only limited to checking the time. Watches are located in a prime position to retrieve valuable position and acceleration data from a user‟s hand movements. In this paper, we explore the plausibility of using watches containing accelerometers to retrieve acceleration data from hand gesture motions for use in human-computer interaction tasks. We compare two approaches for discerning gesture motions from accelerometer data: naïve Bayesian classification with feature separability weighting and dynamic time warping. We introduce our own gravity acceleration removal and gesture start identification techniques to improve the performance of these approaches. Algorithms based on these two approaches are introduced and achieve 97 % and 95 % accuracy, respectively. We also propose a novel planar adjustment algorithm to correctly recognize the same gestures drawn in different planes of motion and reduce spatial motion dissimilarities.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The original objective was to produce a marketing survey of 16 countries in Western Europe, to measure their differences as consumers {{over a wide range}} of goods and services, and to see how subscribers to European editions of the Reader's Digest compared against the total population of each country. The results are of interest, however, to social planners, sociologists and students of Europe as well as to marketing organizations. Main Topics : The survey, carried out in 16 western European countries in 1969, was intended to up-date and extend the coverage of the 1963 Products and People survey (Survey Number 1511). Coverage was expanded to cover all the countries of EFTA as well as Finland, Spain and the Republic of Ireland. Like the 1963 study, this survey was intended primarily to be a marketing survey of western European countries, to measure these countries' differences as consumers over a wide range of goods and services, and to see how subscribers to the Reader's Digest compared against the total population of each country. However, a number of other broader attitudinal questions have been added, as in 1963, which give the survey a much wider relevance and potential audience than might otherwise be expected. Apart from measuring these and ownership of more than 200 consumer goods and services, information was also collected about the people and families of Europe and their attitudes over a wide range of topics. We present a broad overview of these below. See the questionnaire for more specific information on actual questions asked. 1. Families, Homes and Possessions: size and compostition of households; occupational structures; family incomes; education backgrounds; languages spoken and read; religions; types of accommodation, amenities and tenure; savings, insurance. 2. In the Home: labour-saving equipment; kitchen equipment; washing and cleaning. 3. Food and Drink: information on types of food and drink consumed, preferred. 4. The Leisure Hours: television viewing; involvement in various specified leisure activities, including adult education; second home ownership; pet ownership. 5. Transport and Tourism: automobile ownership; holiday activities and travel. 6. Fashion: attitudes to fashion; amount spent on grooming aids, cosmetics, clothing, <b>wrist-watches.</b> 7. Attitudes to Europe: sense of well-being; knowledge of and attitudes to Common Market and European union; national images and perception of same; identification of and attitudes towards various countries and their products. 8. Socio-Cultural Attitudes: attitudes to advertising; the generation gap; social tolerance (class, sex, religion, colour etc.), attitudes towards law-breakers and social justice; honesty and family relationships...|$|E
