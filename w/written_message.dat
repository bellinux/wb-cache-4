5|$|During {{his tenure}} as mayor, Galván {{received}} death threats from organized crime. Nuevo Laredo has been the battleground among Mexico's drug trafficking organizations given its proximity to the U.SMexico border and Interstate 35, a lucrative route {{where most of the}} cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine that reaches the United States are smuggled through. In May 2012, alleged organized crime members left the headless corpses of 14 men inside a vehicle near the Nuevo Laredo city hall. Alongside the corpses was a <b>written</b> <b>message</b> reportedly from the Sinaloa Cartel that accused Galván and other city officials of working for Los Zetas (such accusations between gangsters and local officials are common in Mexico). In June 2012, a car bomb detonated outside the Nuevo Laredo city hall at Galván's parking area, injuring several bystanders. On February 2013, the Nuevo Laredo police chief Roberto Alejandro Balmori Garza was kidnapped and his two brothers were found dead. He had been appointed by Galván as head of the police in 2011 following the murder of Manuel Farfán Carriola, the former police chief of Nuevo Laredo.|$|E

5|$|On 17 and 18 June, Tonogal and Lieutenant Colonel Aganović, {{gendarmerie}} commander {{for eastern}} Herzegovina, made {{an attempt to}} calm the situation by visiting villages east of the Gacko–Avtovac road to re-establish peace in the area. They received a <b>written</b> <b>message</b> from four villages {{that they did not}} acknowledge the NDH authorities, and wanted the message to be passed on to the Italians. The residents of the villages of Jasenik and Lipnik were willing to talk and return to work, but they asked that the gendarmerie not visit their villages, as this would tempt the Montenegrins to attack. Aganović assessed that while this was probably true, their request was insincere. The gendarmerie commander in Bileća believed that the reason for the rebellion was that the local Serbs were wedded to the idea of Greater Serbia, and did not accept that their villages were part of the NDH. This approach essentially meant that local Serbs wanted the NDH authorities to leave them alone and not impose on their lives. According to the historian Davor Marijan, this was a poor choice that gave the Ustaše an excuse to take radical action.|$|E
25|$|In December 1763, Matthew Smith, {{one of the}} Paxton Boys, took a small {{scouting}} {{party to}} Conestoga Town to investigate reports of a hostile Indian being sheltered there. The party returned with tales of dozens of strange Indians occupying the town, and began to assemble a more substantial force. Col. Elder heard of the expedition, and sent a <b>written</b> <b>message</b> dissuading it, to no effect. On the morning of December 14, 1763, just before dawn, fifty armed and mounted Paxton Boys descended upon Conestoga Town, killed the six Indians they found there, and burned the town. While the Susquehannocks were probably in communication with hostile Indians on the frontier, {{the results of the}} Rangers' attack are hardly consonant with their supposed justification of harboring numerous hostile Indians.|$|E
25|$|Several {{hours after}} the ambush, {{suspected}} CJNG gunmen based in Zacoalco de Torres killed Miguel Ángel Caicedo Vargas, the police chief of that municipality. According to investigators, the police chief was kidnapped and tortured before being killed. The assassins stabbed cardboard onto the corpse with a <b>written</b> <b>message</b> warning law enforcement that he was killed {{for the death of}} El Gringo. His body was dumped in a car wash shop in Zacoalco de Torres. Witnesses stated that the assassins were driving a white Suburban with Sinaloa license plates. Jalisco authorities stated that this execution and the ambush were both doings of the CJNG. Municipal authorities from Zacoalco de Torres refused to provide details on the murder, and did not say if they were planning to host a memorial ceremony for Caicedo Vargas. Citizens from Zacoalco de Torres said they were worried about the situation in their town; in 15 days, the town hosted the shootout where El Gringo was killed and the murder of its local police chief. Locals stated that there was a strong presence of the Jalisco State Police following both incidents. A memorial service was carried out at the city's convention center on April 8. The police department where Caicedo Vargas worked, which sat {{across the street from the}} convention center, placed a black ribbon in front of their main entrance. The PGR took over the ambush case, and stated that it would charge the suspects with organized crime, illegal possession of firearms, and homicide. This placed the investigation under federal jurisdiction.|$|E

500|$|On Saturday 16 November, the Imperial Family were {{confined}} in the palace, {{surrounded by a}} cavalry regiment. Pedro II continued reading scientific magazines and appeared calm throughout the day. At 3 p.m, Major Frederico Solón Sampaio Ribeiro informed the Imperial Family that the Republic had been proclaimed and that they must leave the country for exile within 24hours. The [...] "republicans had no courage to meet the Emperor, whom they secretly admired, face to face" [...] and therefore sent low-ranking officers to communicate with him. Solón, when complimenting the Emperor, called him first [...] "Your Excellency", then [...] "Your Highness" [...] and lastly [...] "Your Majesty". Although clearly deposed, the Emperor was still much respected by those around him, {{as illustrated by the}} parley between him and Solón. The notice of banishment caused the women to weep, while the men struggled to remain calm—with the exception of Pedro II, who remained impassive. The monarch resolved to travel the afternoon of the following day and sent a <b>written</b> <b>message</b> to the Provisional Government stating that he agreed to leave the country.|$|E
