2500|$|Before reciting kiddush, the challah, {{which will}} be the next food item eaten in honor of the Shabbat or holiday, is first covered with a cloth. According to Halakha, the blessing over bread takes {{precedence}} to the blessing over wine. However, in the interests of beginning the meal with kiddush, the challah is covered to [...] "remove" [...] it from the table (some do not have the challah on the table at all during kiddush). Some interpret the covering of the challah allegorically, explaining that if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> go out of our way to protect even an inanimate object (the bread) from being [...] "insulted" [...] (by the blessing over wine taking precedence), then certainly we must go out of our way to display sensitivity toward the feelings of other people.|$|E

After they received multiple recording contract offers in 2001, the band decided to sign with Sparrow Records. Matt Hammitt said, [...] "At that point, we really had to do some soul searching and figure out where it <b>was</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ...

2500|$|Variety {{magazine}} wrote {{a scathing}} advance review that appeared on July 16, 2006. Common {{complaints about the}} film were that little effort was put into getting the viewer {{to believe in the}} world, that few moments of the film could be taken seriously, and that Shyamalan was using the film as a form of self-indulgence; instead of having a minor cameo, as in most of his films, Shyamalan cast himself as a visionary whose writing changes the world, and another character included a film critic— portrayed by actor Bob Balaban as arrogant, self-assured, and passive— who comes to a violent end. Many reviewers attacked this perceived self-indulgence: Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote of the story, [...] "Apparently those who live in the water now roam the earth trying to make us listen, though initially it’s rather foggy as to what precisely <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> hear—the crash of the waves, the songs of the sirens, the voice of God—until we realize that of course we're meant to cup our ear to an even higher power: Mr. Shyamalan." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simon Cowell told Extra {{that had}} Malakar won, {{he would not}} have {{returned}} as a judge to the show, even though he was contractually obligated to return. The show's executive producer predicted that Malakar would not win. Some commentators have remarked that the judges seemed to have stopped giving thoughtful critiques of Malakar's performances. The judges seemed stunned by his large following of voters. Randy Jackson went as far to remark that [...] "I cannot even say anything on the vocals anymore", in his critique of Malakar after his performance during the top nine. Chris Ayres of The Times speculated {{that it would have been}} a turning point leading toward decline and eventual cancellation for American Idol if Malakar had won. Others, however, believe that the franchise benefited from the publicity, which was more popular than previous seasons of Idol. On the April 17 broadcast of American Idol, Cowell further said of the controversy, [...] "I know this has been funny for a while, but based on the fact that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be finding the next American Idol [...] was hideous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{describes}} New Labour {{as being}} formed by struggles in the 1980s and a programme of [...] "social liberalism, egalitarian {{education and the}} sexual revolution" [...] envisaged in the 1950s by figures such as Anthony Crosland and Roy Jenkins. He believes that its beliefs are Eurocommunist, and has criticised Labour for its [...] "attacks on the constitution", describing Tony Blair's constitutional reforms as a [...] "slow-motion coup d'état". [...] Hitchens believes the most significant changes introduced by New Labour concentrated {{power in the hands}} of the executive, with Blair effectively chief executive, and Orders in Council installing Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell in Whitehall. Hitchens also mocked Blair's public relations, previously calling him [...] "Princess Tony" [...] (in reference to Blair's calling Princess Diana [...] "the people's princess"), and [...] "Anthony Blair", as well as casting doubt on Blair's accounts of his early legal and political career. Hitchens also described Gordon Brown, as a [...] "dismal Marxoid", but criticised what he saw as [...] "prejudiced, shallow" [...] attempts by the media to destroy Brown after he became Prime Minister. However, Hitchens has shown some sympathy for Jeremy Corbyn, writing that the Labour leader [...] "speaks for a lot of people who feel left out of the recovery <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be having" [...] and who represents a split from [...] "the same cult, the Clinton-Blair fantasy that globalism ... will save the great nations of the West", likening him to Donald Trump in his anti-Establishment rhetoric.|$|E

Why, in short, attempt to a comprehensiveness that must be overwhelming when in fact the need is for a selection that shall not merely represent but elucidate and lead. Aren't we, after all, all of us after some such indicating projection of a leading digit, after such an insistence on the outstandingly essential in face of this abundance, this saturation, this fluid chaos that perpetually increases? Here we are gathering together to celebrate and summarize literature in some sort of undefined and unprecedented fashion, and for the life of me I find it impossible to determine what among my numerous associates and friends and--to embrace still larger quantities of the stuff in hand--my contemporaries is considered to be the literature in question.
