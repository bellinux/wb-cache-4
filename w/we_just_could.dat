6000|$|The {{scene was}} sordid, the {{arrangements}} primitive, the {{detail of the}} procedure, as it struck me, well-nigh of the rudest; yet I remember rejoicing in it all--as one indeed might perfectly rejoice in the juiciness of joints and the abundance of accessory pudding; for I said to myself under every shock and at the hint of every savour {{that this was what}} it was for an exhibition to reek with local colour, and one could dispense with a napkin, with a crusty roll, with room for one's elbows or one's feet, with an immunity from intermittence of the [...] "plain boiled," [...] much better than one could dispense with that. There were restaurants galore even at that time in New York and in Boston, but I had never before had to do with an eating-house and had not yet seen the little old English world of Dickens, let alone of the ever-haunting Hogarth, of Smollett and of Boswell, drenched with such a flood of light. As one sat there one understood; one drew out the severe séance not to stay the assault of precious conspiring truths, not to break the current of in-rushing telltale suggestion. Every face was a documentary scrap, half a dozen broken words to piece with half a dozen others, and so on and on; every sound was strong, whether rich and fine or only queer and coarse; everything in this order drew a positive sweetness from never being--whatever else it was--gracelessly flat. The very rudeness was ripe, the very commonness was conscious--that is not related to mere other forms of the same, but to matters as different as possible, into which it shaded off and off or up and up; the image in fine was organic, rounded and complete, as definite as a Dutch picture of low life hung on a museum wall. [...] "Low" [...] I say in respect to the life; but that was the point for me, that whereas the smartness and newness beyond the sea supposedly disavowed the low, they did so but thinly and vainly, falling markedly short of the high; which the little boxed and boiled Albany attained to some effect of, after a fashion of its own, just by having its so thoroughly appreciable note-value in a scheme of manners. It was imbedded, so to speak, in the scheme, and it borrowed lights, it borrowed even glooms, from so much neighbouring distinction. The places across the sea, as they to my then eyes faintly after-glowed, had no impinging borders but those of the desert to borrow from. And if it be asked of me whether all the while I insist, for demonstration of the complacency with which I desire to revert, on not regretting the disappearance of such too long surviving sordidries as those I have evoked, I can but answer that blind emotion, in whichever sense directed, has nothing to say to the question and that the sense of what <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> confidently live by at a given far-away hour is a simple stout fact of relief.|$|E

5000|$|Reliance Steel {{also wanted}} to {{strengthen}} its position in Texas, and, after attempting to acquire a Houston business, temporarily abandoned its acquisition philosophy and opened a new metals service center in Houston in 1975. Gimbel told Metal Service News, [...] "We had spent probably two years trying to buy out somebody, {{but at the time}} there was a big boom there, and everyone felt the streets of Houston were paved with gold. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> never make a deal to buy someone. So we started our own company." [...] Reliance closed the Houston center in 1984 due to a slump in the oil industry.|$|E

Obviously it was very hard since it took me almost like five years to get it nailed. I don’t follow blueprints or whatever. So it just came to me. I wasn’t like “Ooh, I’m going to do this kind of song.” I heard it and as soon as they played it for me I was like “This is a hit.” I went down there, told him to cut my microphone on, and I just started flowing out of my mind.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his remarks}} upon signing the act in October 1968, Johnson said: [...] "Congress adopted {{most of our}} recommendations. But this bill—as big as this bill is—still falls short, because <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not get the Congress {{to carry out the}} {{requests}} we made of them. I asked for the national registration of all guns and the licensing of those who carry those guns. For the fact of life is that there are over 160 million guns in this country—more firearms than families. If guns are to be kept {{out of the hands of}} the criminal, out of the hands of the insane, and out of the hands of the irresponsible, then we just must have licensing. If the criminal with a gun is to be tracked down quickly, then we must have registration in this country. The voices that blocked these safeguards were not the voices of an aroused nation. They were the voices of a powerful lobby, a gun lobby, that has prevailed for the moment in an election year." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bradley's {{football}} career {{took a turn}} {{to professional}} when {{on the last day}} of the transfer window it was reported that a private jet was awaiting him at Belfast City Airport too take him to complete his medical at Rangers F.C. ahead of a $95,000 move from Glenavon FC. Bradley was set to drive to Glasgow the day before the window shut but due to complication with him being banned from driving and his agents car breaking down a private jet was the only option, this cost the football club $60,000 to get him here before the window shuts. Deadline day yet again brings more excitement. Bradley's agent Eoghan Quigg has said that [...] "We have turned down a bid from MLS side New England Revolution. Rangers came in for Skinner when he got back from Boston and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not turn down a huge club like Rangers F.C." [...] It was also rumored that Eoin Bradley also had offers in India [...] "medical and airline ticket had been booked but soon as Bradley realized there was no Gaelic football club in the New Delhi area he called the move off" [...] and was set to stay with Glenavon FC. The deal has been finalized with Rangers FC and will wear the shirt number 44, a loan option to Boca Juniors was an option but nothing materialized after the club asked him to pay his own plane ticket to complete the deal, he will be in the squad for the Old Firm derby. Joey Barton was the main reason this deal was done.|$|E

30|$|On the 5 -hour trip to Long Island, Ellis and I had to {{carefully}} hold, by turn, the styrofoam box {{in which the}} crystallization trays were carefully packed. The tiny crystals grew in 2 microliter droplets in 24 -well trays. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not risk any damage to these extremely valuable but fragile crystals, so we handheld the box {{all the way to}} avoid any significant shaking when the coach was bumping on the road. Producing these soluble TCR molecules for crystallization was not an easy job, and still isn’t almost twenty years later. In Ellis’s lab, a team led by two highly skillful molecular biologists and protein chemists tried every available technique to clone, express and purify several kinds of TCR. One of the challenging issues to produce soluble TCR molecules is that like many other cell surface receptors, TCR molecules are glycosylated. Bacterium expression systems do not have this post-translational modification mechanism. Without glycosylation, the bacteria-expressed protein may be less soluble and tends to aggregate. At that time knowledge about the role of glycans was very limited. We just had no idea whether the glycan on the TCR molecule was of biological significance. One of the postdoctoral fellows in the lab turned to the mammalian system, the CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cell to express the protein, because these cells can produce glycoproteins. Then another headache struck. Glycosylation is notoriously heterogeneous. In order to grow crystals of diffraction quality, the prerequisite is to have a chemically homogeneous protein sample. Fortunately, scientists around that time developed an engineered CHO, termed CHO lec–, which is able to express homogeneous, mannose-enriched glycoprotein in large quantities (Stanley, 1989). At that point we started to have some ugly-looking crystals of TCR. One more advantage of using the CHO lec– system is that the produced glycoprotein can be treated with some enzymes for deglycosylation. All of a sudden by using the deglycosylated homogenous TCR sample, beautiful crystals appeared. This marked a big step toward our final goal. Using the home source X-ray machine, around 8 – 10 Å diffraction spots could be seen for these crystals. At that moment I knew a synchrotron trip was inevitable.|$|E
