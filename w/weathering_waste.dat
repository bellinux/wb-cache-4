Experimental treatments including the spreading of six types of waste and a control soil were set up in August 2000 and studied for 22 mo under bare soil conditions. Ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions, and nitrogen mineralization were measured in experimental devices and extrapolated to field conditions or computed in calculation models. The ammonia emissions varied from 80 to 580 g kg(- 1) NH 4 +-N applied, representing 0 to 90 g N kg(- 1) total N applied. Under these meteorologically favorable conditions (dry and warm <b>weather),</b> <b>waste</b> pH was the main factor affecting volatilization rates. Cumulated N 2 O-N fluxes were estimated at 2 to 5 g kg(- 1) total N applied, which was quite low due to the low soil water content during the experimental period; water-filled pore space (WFPS) was confirmed as the main factor affecting N 2 O fluxes. Nitrogen mineralization from wastes represented 126 to 723 g N kg(- 1) organic N added from the incorporation date to 14 May 2001 and was not related to the organic C to organic N ratio of wastes.

Colloids formed by the <b>weathering</b> of processing <b>wastes</b> may control the release of arsenic (As) into surface waters. At a former mine site in Madrid (Spain), we investigated the mobilization of colloidal As by surface runoff from <b>weathered</b> processing <b>wastes</b> and from sediments in the bed of a draining creek and a downstream sedimentation-pond. Colloids mobilized by surface runoff during simulated rain events were characterized for their composition, structure and mode of As uptake using asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation coupled to inductively plasma mass spectrometry (AF 4 -ICP-MS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the As and Fe K-edges. Colloidal scorodite mobilized in surface runoff from the waste pile is acting as a mobile As carrier. In surface runoff from the river bed and the sedimentation pond, ferrihydrite was identified as the dominant As-bearing colloidal phase. The results from this study suggest that mobilization of As-bearing colloids by surface runoff may {{play an important role in}} the dispersion of As from metallurgical wastes deposited above ground and needs to be considered in risk assessment.
