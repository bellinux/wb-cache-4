25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy?</b> Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|E

That guy as a Donald Rumsfeld-like public governmental figure... talked me into writing the book while I was still laughing."" ...|$|E

Here <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> from nowhere, and he was hitting the bonus box every time. It was bedlam, I can tell you, and we couldn't stop this guy.

40|$|Although {{there is}} some {{evidence}} that Matthew Rabin existed before 1990, we had the pleasure of discovering him for ourselves when, in the early 1990 s, he sent each of us a copy of his manuscript "Incorporating Fairness into Game Theory and Economics" [2]. Matthew <b>was,</b> at <b>this</b> time, an assistant professor in Berkeley's economics department, having recently finished his graduate training at MIT. The paper was remarkable in many ways, and it induced us both to call around and ask: "Who <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> Rabin?" Now, just a decade later, we find ourselves writing an article in honor of his winning the John Bates Clark award. So, who <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy?...</b>|$|R

500|$|Director Terry Gilliam would {{praise the}} film as [...] "a work of genius. It got people to {{understand}} what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing {{at the top of}} the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of X2, producer Lauren Shuler Donner had discussed {{the idea of a}} film focusing on the young X-Men with the crew, which was met with approval; the concept was revived during {{the production}} of [...] One of The Last Stands writers, Zak Penn, was hired to write and direct this spin-off, but this idea later fell through. Penn explained in 2007 that [...] "the original idea was to have me do a young X-Men spin-off, a spin-off of the young X-Men characters. But someone came up with a pretty interesting idea [...] it <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> who worked with me named Mike Chamoy, he worked a lot with me on X3. He came up with how to do a young X-Men movie which is not what you'd expect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former bassist Duff McKagan {{joined the}} band on {{stage for the}} first time since leaving the band on October 14, 2010 at The O2 Arena, in London, England. He {{performed}} four songs with the group: [...] "You Could Be Mine", [...] "Nice Boys", [...] "Knockin' on Heaven's Door", and [...] "Patience". The appearance was said to be a spur-of-the-moment decision, as he and Rose happened to be staying in the same hotel. Rose told the audience, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> at the end of my hallway playing all this loud music and shit. What the fuck? Oh — it's Duff!". McKagan later joined Guns N' Roses on part of its tour for two Seattle shows in December 2011, as well as having his band Loaded open for Guns N' Roses.|$|E

500|$|While in the army, Barbirolli {{adopted the}} anglicised form {{of his first}} name {{for the sake of}} simplicity: [...] "The sergeant-major had great {{difficulty}} in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>Guy</b> Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John." [...] After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.|$|R

2500|$|He {{underwent}} a change during mid-1970: [...] "I got stoned {{for the first}} time; I discovered Shakespeare, Dylan Thomas, and all that classic stuff. I read Moby Dick and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes." [...] Jobs also later noted to his official biographer that [...] "I started {{to listen to music}} a whole lot, and I started to read more outside of just science and technology—Shakespeare, Plato. I loved King Lear ... when I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class. The teacher <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> who looked like Ernest Hemingway. He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite." [...] From that point, Jobs developed two different circles of friends: those who were involved in electronics and engineering and those who were interested in art and literature. These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobs's senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend, the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan.|$|E
2500|$|Since his {{departure}} Greg {{has become an}} iconic villain on the soap. His romance with Caroline {{has been described as}} one of Shortland Streets most memorable couples. Writer, Rachel Lang, thought Balme was perfect for the role, stating:"I was at the bank and there <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> over at the counter and I thought, 'ooh he looks dodgy', he had that kind of look about him, he's quite a chameleon." [...] A reviewer of the soap stated in 2000 that Greg should be brought back because he made the show addictive with his [...] "badboy" [...] ways. Balmes portrayal was so realistic, a pharmacist refused him service whilst he was on the show fearing he was drug seeking. In 2012, the character was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years. His final scene with Caroline has been voted by fans as one of the show's most iconic moments.|$|E
