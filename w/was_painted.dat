5|$|During the Vietnam War the Shrine {{became a}} centre of {{conflict}} when anti-war demonstrators protested during ANZAC Day services against Australia's {{involvement in the}} war. In 1971 the Shrine was defaced when the word PEACE! <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in large white letters on the pillars of the north portico.|$|E
5|$|During the restoration, it was {{discovered}} that a long-standing ascription of the painting's date to 1883 {{was the result of a}} misinterpretation: the artist's original inscription of 1885 <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in a fugitive red-lake pigment that had faded, and was mistakenly repainted by a conservator to the earlier date.|$|E
50|$|Most Polish RWD-13 <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> red, with {{a silver}} {{lightning}} painted on a fuselage and silver wings. RWD-13S <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in ivory, with Red Cross markings, while RWD-13TS <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in ivory, with a red lightning on the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|For 2006, {{the track}} and {{supports}} <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> white. Previously, they had <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> in a pinkish-red.|$|R
50|$|The <b>painting</b> <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> in many layers, with {{brilliant}} colours, {{as many of}} Hunt's paintings <b>are</b> <b>painted.</b>|$|R
5|$|His The Round of the Prisoners (1890) <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> {{after an}} {{engraving}} by Gustave Doré (1832–1883). Tralbaut {{suggests that the}} face of the prisoner in the centre of the painting looking towards the viewer is Van Gogh himself; Jan Hulsker discounts this.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 a new fares scheme, the Glasgow Gold Card, was introduced, {{offering}} weekly {{travel on}} all SBG routes in the city. A Kelvin AEC Routemaster bus <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in a gold livery to advertise the ticket, and {{remained in the}} livery until withdrawal by Kelvin Central in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The Kuching Orangutan Murals {{are vital}} {{images of a}} {{wheelbarrow}} filled with eight young orangutans and another baby orangutan swinging from a pipe. It <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> by Ernest Zacharevic along Power Street in the city on 27 April 2014. This latest mural is painted in Zacharevic's usual interactive style, with an actual wheelbarrow sliced into half and secured to the wall to enable the public to take selfies while holding onto the handle. On the other hand, the baby orangutan <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> over a nail on the wall, where people can 'place' items in its hand.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> {{dark green}} lined out with red between two cream lines. The buffer beams <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> red. In {{the days of}} the Great Southern Railways the locomotives <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in a plain grey livery, the buffer beams being red.|$|R
50|$|The class have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> in {{a variety}} of {{different}} liveries during their careers, reflecting their mixed-traffic role. For the initial trials nos. 337 and 338 <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in red oxide, and after acceptance they <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in dove grey, lined with black and white for the official photographs (see above). Thereafter members of the class <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> plain black by the LB&SCR. Under Southern Railway ownership three examples <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> in lined umber, and others in passenger green and lined black. During the Second World War they <b>were</b> either <b>painted</b> in unlined dark green or black. Under British Railways the usual livery was lined black.|$|R
50|$|The current roster {{is made up}} {{completely}} {{of second}} generation EMD Switcher Units. Majority of the switchers <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> blue but numerous units <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> different colors including #3 and #17 <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> green, while #1 and #33 have a new yellow and red scheme.|$|R
5|$|The oil {{painting}} The Carlile Family with Sir Justinian Isham in Richmond Park is held at Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire. It <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> by Joan Carlile (1600–1679) {{who lived at}} Petersham Lodge.|$|E

5|$|A great {{portion of}} the mosque is covered with whitewash, but the drum of the dome and the walls {{immediately}} beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble. Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927. The ceiling of the mosque <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> with funding by King Farouk of Egypt.|$|E
50|$|All Japanese {{police force}} {{vehicles}} <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> and marked {{in the same}} ways. Japanese police vehicles <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> black and white with the upper parts of the vehicle painted white. However, motorcycles are usually all white and riot control and rescue vehicles <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> a steel blue.|$|R
25|$|With the Routemaster's longevity, {{examples}} <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> {{to celebrate}} both the Queen's Silver and Golden Jubilees. In 1977, 25 Routemasters <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> silver and temporarily renumbered SRM1 to SRM25 {{to celebrate the}} Silver Jubilee and, in 2002, 50 buses <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> gold including three RMs and 12 RMLs.|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] it will {{perhaps be}} replied, [...] "have, then, ships never <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> {{perfectly}} yet, {{even by the}} men who have devoted most attention to them?" [...] Assuredly not. A ship never yet has <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> at all, in any other sense than men have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> in [...] "Landscapes with figures." [...] Things have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> which have a general effect of ships, just as things have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> which have a general effect of shepherds or banditti; but the best average ship-painting no more reaches the truth of ships than the equestrian troops in one of Van der Meulen's battle-pieces express the higher truths of humanity.|$|R
5|$|Around the {{painting}} lie corpses {{in various states}} of undress. The Destroying Angel <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> shortly after Etty's visit to Paris in which he had witnessed the July Revolution at first hand, and the sight and smell of the dead in the streets had left a strong impression on him. The heaped bodies in The Destroying Angel were probably directly inspired by the events Etty had witnessed in France, and perhaps also by the cholera epidemic which killed thousands in London in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw the entire class.|$|E
5|$|Delaroche's {{early works}} had {{been based on}} topics from the Bible's Old Testament, but {{gradually}} his interests switched to painting scenes from English and French history. He 'combined colouristic skill {{with an interest in}} detailed scenes from history'.Bonaparte Crossing the Alps, which <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> roughly eight years before Delaroche's death, exemplifies this phase in Delaroche's career.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{miles of}} the seawall <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> with murals called [...] "wall art". These huge murals <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> by {{children}} and depict underwater life.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of unmarked traffic enforcement vehicles, all Japanese police forces <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> and marked in the same ways. Japanese police vehicles <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> black and white with the upper parts of the vehicle <b>painted</b> white. Motorcycles <b>are</b> usually all white and riot control and rescue vehicles <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> a steel blue.|$|R

5|$|During its operation, Virgin Atlantic Little Red's fleet {{consisted}} of four Airbus A320s wet leased from Aer Lingus under a three-year contract. The aircraft had 29 rows of seating with a 3–3 configuration, {{for a total}} of 174 seats. The fleet <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> with Virgin Atlantic livery with future plans to eventually repaint them with Little Red livery. However, due to the closure of operations, this rebrand of the planes never occurred and they retained their original livery.|$|E
5|$|Except {{those with}} an {{advertising}} livery, the trams are painted a light blue. The first series was delivered with a deeper blue color than has been tradition with Oslo Sporveier trams, but all have since been repainted to match the standard livery. Prior to the delivery of the second series, a single tram <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> deep red to match the buses and the T1000 trains used on the Oslo Metro. Due to negative feedback from the riders, the historic color was kept.|$|E
5|$|Flight 253, a Northwest Airlines Airbus A330-323E twinjet, {{registered}} N820NW, with 279 passengers, 8 flight attendants, and 3 pilots aboard, left Amsterdam around 08:45 local time. The {{plane was}} scheduled to arrive in Detroit at 11:40 EST, and <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> in Delta Air Lines' livery, as Northwest was a subsidiary of Delta at the time.|$|E

50|$|Until 1951, most steam {{locomotives}} <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> black. From that date, locomotives used on {{passenger services}} <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> green. The early diesel locomotives <b>were</b> <b>painted</b> green, {{with a red}} stripe later added. In the late 1960s, a grey and light blue livery was introduced. The latter was resurrected by South Spur Rail Services in the early 2000s.|$|R
5|$|From 1 December 1924, until 1 September 1925, she was {{in reserve}} at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. On 25 November She went into reduced commission, {{returning}} to full commission 1 September 1926. In early 1927, Mercy <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> white with no hospital markings, {{but by the time}} of a 1931 visit to Vancouver, the markings had been restored.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the {{lighthouse}} underwent major repairs for its anniversary. As {{part of those}} renovations, the tower <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> with high quality oil paint, which became the main contributor to {{the deterioration of the}} tower in subsequent decades– thick waterproof layers of paint did not allow the limestone to dry. The mortar began to deteriorate rapidly.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} assigned Victor (unit-assigned identification) number 9, but on 1 August {{it was given}} the circle R tail markings of the 6th Bombardment Group as a security measure, and it had its Victor number changed to 89 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft. Its nose art <b>was</b> <b>painted</b> after the Nagasaki mission. The name purportedly referred to the talents of the bombardier, Captain Kermit Beahan, with both the Norden bombsight and with women.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{surviving}} towers have <b>been</b> <b>painted</b> on the seaward side to serve as daymarks (navigational aids). Archirondel <b>is</b> <b>painted</b> red and white, while other towers <b>are</b> <b>painted</b> white and red, or white, {{in whole or in}} part, again, on the seaward side. The order below is counter-clockwise from the north-west corner of the island.|$|R
