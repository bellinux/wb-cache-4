5|$|The Earps' work as lawmen was not {{welcomed by}} the Cowboys, <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> the Earps as badge-toting tyrants who ruthlessly {{enforced}} the business {{interests of the}} town. In direct conflict with the Earps' roles as lawmen, Johnny Behan was Cochise County Sheriff.|$|E
5|$|Asa Gray {{promoted}} {{and defended}} Origin against those American naturalists with an idealist approach, notably Louis Agassiz <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> every species {{as a distinct}} fixed unit {{in the mind of}} the Creator, classifying as species what others considered merely varieties. Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt reconciled this view with evolutionism in a form of neo-Lamarckism involving recapitulation theory.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, it was {{revealed}} that Newsom had a romantic relationship in mid-2005 with Ruby Rippey-Tourk, the wife of his then campaign manager and former deputy chief of staff, Alex Tourk. Tourk filed for divorce shortly after the revelation and left Newsom's campaign and administration. Newsom's affair with Rippey-Tourk impacted his popularity with male voters, <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> his indiscretions as a betrayal of a close friend and ally.|$|E
5|$|This episode saw the {{introduction}} of the redesigned Romulans, with prosthetic forehead pieces designed by makeup supervisor Michael Westmore, and the first appearance of the Romulan Warbird which was designer Andrew Probert's final work for the Star Trek franchise. The episode was mildly received by critics <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> it {{after the end of the}} season, who criticised the two-plot nature of the episode and the general lack of excitement.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{struggle}} {{began in}} India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence. Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts. This led to tension, {{particularly in the}} Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> it with revulsion. The subsequent Non-Co-Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.|$|E
5|$|Baseball was a {{reasonably}} popular sport in Australia {{in the early}} 20th century and Ponsford alternated between cricket and baseball throughout his sporting life. At the time, baseball was generally played in Australia during the winter months, {{as many of the}} leading players were enthusiastic cricketers <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> the sport as a means of improving their fielding skills. As with cricket, Ponsford started his baseball career at Alfred Crescent School, where his coach was the former Victorian player Charles Landsdown. As a junior Ponsford played shortstop, later as a senior for the Fitzroy Baseball Club he converted to catching.|$|E
5|$|Coltrane for Lovers {{was issued}} 33 years after Coltrane's death and nearly 40 {{years after the}} {{original}} recording dates. The album peaked at number 5 on the Top Jazz Albums chart and received generally positive reviews from most music critics, despite some criticism from writers <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> it as a cash-in compilation from the release's label. The album was later compiled, along with other For Lovers titles, onto the box set The Complete Verve for Lovers Collection.|$|E
50|$|Shituf {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in the commentary of Tosafot on the Babylonian Talmud, in a passage concluding with a lenient ruling regarding non-Jews.

5|$|Following {{a period}} of {{personal}} and legal troubles with drug addiction, Gil Scott-Heron recorded and released his first album of original material in sixteen years, I'm New Here (2010), {{with the assistance of}} XL Recordings-label head Richard Russell. Produced by Russell, the album served as a departure from Scott-Heron's earlier work, both musically and thematically, eschewing its soul, jazz, and funk styles and social commentary for more personal, reflective lyrics with ruminations on love, loss, and identity, set to contemporary electronic music. It was well received by fans and music critics, <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> it as a comeback for Scott-Heron.|$|E
5|$|Here I Stand {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> it {{as a sign}} of growth and maturity from Usher, although others were unimpressed by the change in style from his 2004 album Confessions. It debuted atop the Billboard 200, and sold 433,000 copies in the US in its first week of release, and has since sold 1.3million copies in that country. The album also reached number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, UK Albums Chart and Australian Albums Chart, and has sold five million units worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In Russia in 2012, a {{proposal}} from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, {{with the support}} of some members of the governing United Russia party, proposed the removal of all Lenin monuments, {{a proposal}} strongly opposed by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. In Ukraine, during and after the 2013–14 Euromaidan protests, thousands of Lenin statues were damaged or destroyed by protesters <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> them as a symbol of Russian imperialism, and in April 2015 the Ukrainian government ordered that all others be dismantled to comply with decommunisation laws.|$|E

5|$|In the pre-war years, Göring enjoyed {{widespread}} personal {{popularity among}} the German public {{because of his}} perceived sociability, colour and humour. As the Nazi leader most responsible for economic matters, he presented himself {{as a champion of}} national interests over allegedly corrupt big business and the old German elite. The Nazi press was on Göring's side. Other Nazi leaders, such as Hess and Ribbentrop, were envious of his popularity. Even in the political circles of Britain and the United States, there were those <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> Göring as more acceptable than the other Nazis, and as a possible mediator between the western democracies and Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's volunteers {{responded to}} {{requests}} for military service {{in the early months}} of the war; however, as the war progressed and the number of casualties increased, the state government had to resort to conscription (the draft) to fill its quotas. Military conscription, which began in October 1862, was a divisive issue within the state. It was especially unpopular among Democrats, <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> it as a threat to individual freedom and opposed legislation that allowed a man to purchase an exemption for $300 or pay another person to serve as his substitute. A total of 3,003 Hoosier men were drafted in October 1862; subsequent drafts in Indiana brought the total to 17,903.|$|E
5|$|Rainivoninahitriniony's {{tenure as}} sole Prime Minister was short lived. His violent tendencies, {{irritability}} and insolence toward Rasoherina, {{in addition to}} lingering popular resentment over Rainivoninahitriniony's role in the violent end to Radama's rule, gradually turned {{the opinion of the}} nobles against him. As Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony attempted to counsel his brother, while simultaneously overseeing diplomatic and military efforts to re-pacify the agitated Sakalava and other peoples, <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> the coup as an indication of weakening Merina control. The Prime Minister repaid these efforts by repeatedly castigating high-ranking officers and even threatening Rainilaiarivony with his sword.|$|E

5|$|Romney {{supported}} raising various fees, {{including those}} for drivers' licenses and gun licenses, {{to raise more}} than $300million. He increased a special gasoline retailer fee by two cents per gallon, generating about $60million per year in additional revenue. Opponents said the reliance on fees sometimes imposed a hardship on those who could least afford them. Romney also closed tax loopholes that brought in another $181million from businesses {{over the next two}} years and over $300million for his term. He did so in the face of conservative and corporate critics <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> these actions as tax increases.|$|E
5|$|The Republicans {{convened in}} Chicago and {{nominated}} former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for {{president on the}} fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans <b>who</b> <b>viewed</b> Blaine as ambitious and immoral. The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur. Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice {{as an opportunity to}} win the White House {{for the first time since}} 1856 if the right candidate could be found.|$|E
