500|$|While {{awaiting}} {{the sequel to}} Star Wars, Marvel kept the monthly comic going with their own stories, one of which includes Jabba tracking Han Solo and Chewbacca down to an old hideaway they use for smuggling. However, circumstances force Jabba to lift the bounty on Solo and Chewbacca, thus enabling them to return to Tatooine for an adventure with Luke Skywalker—who {{has returned to the}} planet in order to recruit more pilots for the Rebel Alliance. In the course of another adventure, Solo kills the space pirate Crimson Jack and busts up his operation, which Jabba bankrolled. Jabba thus renews the reward for Solo's head and Solo later kills a bounty hunter who tells him why he is hunted once more. He and Chewbacca return to the rebels. (Solo mentions an incident with a [...] "bounty hunter <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> on Ord Mantell" [...] in the opening scenes of The Empire Strikes Back.) ...|$|E

'Unfortunately <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> {{a serious}} bit of {{corruption}} {{with one of}} the funders and the script was never transformed into film,' Perry told Chappell, 'I recall telling [...] Fred Schepisi about this. He just laughed and said that sort of thing happened to him {{a couple of times a}} year. But it was enough to make me decide to write another dozen books before looking at film again. I ended up writing another 24 books before returning to film, which I am now doing, but still as a secondary interest.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Osbourne {{resigned}} from managing The Smashing Pumpkins by releasing a memo which said, [...] "It was with great pride and enthusiasm that I took on {{management of the}} Pumpkins back in October, but unfortunately I must resign today due to medical reasons... Billy Corgan was making me sick!!!" [...] In an October 2008 interview, Osbourne revealed that she and Corgan had recently made up: [...] "I saw him at the Scream Awards. We hadn't seen each other since that whole thing in Germany. The first time <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> each other and we hugged and kissed and laughed." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the claim of a P-47 achieving supersonic speeds, Curtiss-Wright test pilot Herbert O. Fisher later observed, “We knew about Mach 1 going clear back to the P-36 and the P-40 ... Nothing could go 600 mph in level flight, but pilots were beginning to dive fighters. <b>We</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> compressibility back in ’38.” Using a highly modified P-47D, from 1947–1949, Fisher carried out 100 high mach number precision dives from 38,000 feet at speeds from 500 to 590 miles per hour. Several of these dives resulted in speeds of Mach [...]83, one occurring on October 27, 1949, the fastest speeds a P-47 could attain.|$|E
2500|$|Following promotional {{work for}} the second Kid Creole and the Coconuts album Fresh Fruit in Foreign Places, Darnell gave an {{interview}} to the UK music magazine Melody Maker in December 1981 in which he spoke enthusiastically of the forthcoming solo album he was planning called Wise Guy, and told the magazine about three songs he already had written for the record titled [...] "I'm a Wonderful Thing", [...] "Stool Pigeon" [...] (originally titled [...] "Jive Talking") and [...] "Imitation". When it became apparent a few months later, however, that the record {{would no longer be}} a solo album {{and that it would be}} significantly different in style musically from the previous records, Darnell told interviewers at the time that it was [...] "a chance to do some other things", but in reality he felt he was being forced to do [...] "a cop-out album, an R album" [...] in order to ease ZE's considerable financial difficulties with their parent label in the US, Sire Records. By the time of the album's release in May 1982, Darnell acknowledged that his record company had put pressure on him and that the record had not turned out how he had wanted: [...] "Make no mistake about it, this album is a compromise. It's much more steeped in R than Kid Creole should be. That's why it originally was supposed to be an August Darnell solo album. But because of the problems <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> in the [...] company, and the company not believing in Kid Creole enough, this had to be turned into a Kid Creole album." ...|$|E

60|$|Again we {{were off}} early in the morning. Wind outside and growing rough. Sun bright until off Isthmus, when <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> fog. The Jap albacore-boats were farther west. Albacore not biting well. Sea grew rough. About eleven thirty the fog cleared and the sea became beautifully blue and white-crested.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{always wanted}} to see how things look over in that part of New York," [...] {{declared}} Tom, [...] "and if <b>we</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> that Andy Royce I'm going to question him and see if he knows anything about that diamond ring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good," [...] {{said the}} captain, taking out his watch. [...] "This is half-past eight a.m., Friday morning. I'll jot that down, and we'll compute {{how many hours}} we've been out when <b>we</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> your mother's post-office. There! The entry's made, and now we go ahead." ...|$|R
6000|$|Barnstable {{shook his}} head with a grave air, as he muttered to himself, [...] "This is droll navigation; first <b>we</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> an unfrequented bay that is full of rocks, and sandpits, and shoals, and then we get off our pilot. But how am I to know him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This kind of yachting's {{not quite}} what I've been used to," [...] he remarked. [...] "On Long Island Sound you don't get the sea <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> coming round the head last night; {{and when we}} went {{cruising}} in small craft we always hired somebody to do the dirty work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Who is {{an exuberant}} young woman, bursts forth.) Oh, brother-in-law! Such excitement! That's what's {{the matter with}} mother. <b>We</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a go-cart. Our chauffeur was not to blame. It was the woman's fault. She tried to cross {{just as we were}} turning the corner. But we hardly grazed it. Fortunately the baby was not hurt--only spilled. It was ridiculous. (Catching sight of Hubbard.) Oh, there you are, Mr. Hubbard. How de do.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} we stood out to sea, {{with the intention}} of making a direct course to the Cape de Verd Islands. Unfavourable winds, however, delayed us, and on the 12th <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> Pernambuco,--a large city on the coast of Brazil, in latitude 8 degrees south. We anchored outside the reef; but in a short time a pilot came on board and took us into the inner harbour, where we lay close to the town.|$|E

6000|$|Then I wotted well that, sinful man as I am, I was in {{the company}} of the hosts of Heaven, though I saw them not. Great heart this {{knowledge}} gave me and others, and the Maid crying, in a loud voice, [...] "Aux fagots, tout le monde!" [...] the very runaways heard her and came back with planks and faggots, and so, filling up the fosse and passing over, <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the breach, smiting and slaying, and the town was taken.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain and}} the two {{passengers}} kept diaries. On our voyage to San Francisco <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a calm {{in the middle of}} the Pacific, and did not move a rod during fourteen days; this gave me a chance to copy the diaries. Samuel Ferguson's is the fullest; I will draw upon it now. When the following paragraph was written the doomed ship was about one hundred and twenty days out from port, and all hands were putting in the lazy time about as usual, as no one was forecasting disaster.|$|E
60|$|Our {{regiment}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} that was broke, and being all in confusion, with the Duke of Savoy's men at our heels, away <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the wood. Never was there so much disorder among a parcel of runaways as when we came to this wood; it was so exceeding bushy and thick at the bottom there was no entering it, and a volley of small shot from a regiment of Savoy's dragoons poured in upon us at our breaking into the wood made terrible work among our horses.|$|E

60|$|We {{were off}} Nice, early next morning, and coasted along, {{within a few}} miles of the Cornice road (of which more in its place) nearly all day. We could see Genoa before three; and {{watching}} it as it gradually developed its splendid amphitheatre, terrace rising above terrace, garden above garden, palace above palace, height upon height, was ample occupation for us, till <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the stately harbour. Having been duly astonished, here, by the sight of a few Cappucini monks, who were watching the fair-weighing of some wood upon the wharf, we drove off to Albaro, two miles distant, where we had engaged a house.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes, sir," [...] says he; [...] "leastways we knew of him by hearsay; {{and this}} was how: About eight weeks ago <b>we</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a cove on the south shore of Mauritius to clean both ships, which had grown mightily foul. While we lay there on the careen a parcel of the crew who had been off hunting for game fetched back one of the self-same fellows we had marooned two months and more before. He told us that England and his shipmates had made a little craft out of bits of boards and barrel-staves, and had crossed over to the Mauritius in a spell of fair weather, though it was five leagues and more away." ...|$|E
