Drusus and Germanicus held all their offices at the same age, and progressed through the cursus honorum at the same pace.

Tickets were also made available via Amadeus, a ticket reservation system in Norway previously only used for airlines. Prices became differentiated, with prices between Oslo and Kristiansand varying between NOK250 and 780, depending on time of travel and class. NSB stated that they hoped to compete with airlines between the two cities, as travel time from city center to center <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as by plane.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E

5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> size {{as that of the}} hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E

There are some indications of even larger individuals, probably over 50 meters long and with a mass around 100 tonnes making it possibly the largest known dinosaur. Barosaurus was differently proportioned than its close relative Diplodocus, with a longer neck and shorter tail, but <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> length overall.

25|$|It is {{a common}} belief in the United States that red cars are stopped for {{speeding}} more often than other color cars. However, there is no statistical evidence that this is true. Many police departments have denied it, saying their officers stop drivers for their behavior, not {{the color of their}} cars. The one survey that was made on this subject in 1990 by a St. Petersburg, Florida newspaper showed that the number of speeding tickets given to drivers of red cars <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the proportion of red cars on the road in the community.|$|E

Colonel Tucker told General Grant's superior, Major General Henry W. Halleck, that Camp Douglas could accommodate 8,000 or 9,000 prisoners, which <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number as the recruits it had been built for.

25|$|Agrippa {{was born}} between 64–62 BC, in an {{uncertain}} location. His father was perhaps called Lucius Vipsanius Agrippa. He had an elder brother {{whose name was}} also Lucius Vipsanius Agrippa, and a sister named Vipsania Polla. The family had not been prominent in Roman public life. However, Agrippa <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> age as Octavian (the future emperor Augustus), and the two were educated together and became close friends. Despite Agrippa's association with the family of Julius Caesar, his elder brother chose another side in the civil wars of the 40s BC, fighting under Cato against Caesar in Africa. When Cato's forces were defeated, Agrippa's brother was taken prisoner but freed after Octavian interceded on his behalf.|$|E
25|$|Lufthansa {{started a}} service to Kjeller Airport {{during the summer of}} 1936 as a {{tentative}} solution while their seaplane was being overhauled. They there put a seventeen-passenger Junkers Ju 52 into the service to London, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Amsterdam. The service was especially popular with travelers to London, as {{they did not have to}} transfer at Copenhagen, and the route saw a typical ten to twelve passengers for each of the daily departures. Ground transport was carried out by motor coach, which used twenty-five minutes from Oslo. This <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the ferry used to Gressholmen Airport. Regular services started on 1 June 1938 and lasted until 10 October. The following year the route was transferred to the newly opened Oslo Airport, Fornebu. Lufthansa also carried out a trial flight with a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 on 13 August 1938.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} losses affected everyone. Banks {{and insurance companies}} were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. The billions of dollars invested in slaves vanished. Most debts were also left behind. Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> whether or not fighting took place nearby. The loss of infrastructure and productive capacity meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a depleted stock of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves. During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock. The North, by contrast, absorbed its material losses so effortlessly that it appeared richer {{at the end of}} the war than at the beginning.|$|E
