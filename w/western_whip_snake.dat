40|$|Ectothermic {{vertebrates}} {{depend on}} ambient temperatures for their activities. Thus, {{global warming is}} expected to influence several aspects of their ecology. Here, we use a > 20 year (1990 - 2011) dataset on monthly numbers of roadkills {{in an area of}} central Italy in order to document whether the phenology of a Mediterranean population of <b>Western</b> <b>whip</b> <b>snakes</b> (Hierophis viridiflavus) has changed over time. Annual variation of roadkills was correlated to five climatic variables: (i) mean annual air temperature, (ii) mean February air temperature, (iii) mean July air temperature, (iv) yearly number of rainy days, and (v) number of rainstorm days. Increases in mean annual temperature were positively related to the number of roadkills at the early (February and March) and late (December) phases of above-ground activity, but were negatively related to the number of roadkills during summer (June and July). Intriguingly, we documented a shift in the annual mortality peak over the study period, possibly indicating temporal changes of the mating season due to global warming. Increasing mean air temperatures apparently caused an earlier onset of above-ground activity of snakes and delayed hibernation, but reduced the intensity of snake above-ground activity during the hottest and driest period of the year. Rainfall variables had no impact on snake activity...|$|R
50|$|Ahaetulla prasina is {{a species}} of snake in the family Colubridae native to {{southern}} Asia. Its common names include Asian vine <b>snake,</b> Boie's <b>whip</b> <b>snake,</b> Gunther's <b>whip</b> <b>snake,</b> and Oriental <b>whip</b> <b>snake.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Whip</b> <b>snakes</b> eat mainly lizards. <b>Whip</b> <b>snakes</b> are diurnal (active in the day), and {{use their}} keen {{eyesight}} to hunt. The prey dies quickly {{from the effects of}} the snake's venom.|$|R
40|$|Islands {{provide an}} {{evolutionary}} window, where a simplified natural network combined with unusual environmental conditions promote selective processes that trigger rapid changes in biological constituents of a species. The Mediterranean island of Montecristo, Italy, provides {{such a situation}} with a reduced fauna and flora compared to the mainland. We measured body size (SVL) and recorded diet of the two snake species oc- curring on the island, the Asp Viper (Vipera aspis) and the <b>Western</b> <b>Whip</b> <b>Snake</b> (Hierophis viridiflavus), and compared these data with populations of conspecifics from the mainland. Compared to mainland populations, the three principal results are: (1) no obvious niche shift along the food or habitat axes between the two snake species; (2) significant body size shift (insular dwarfism) of the whip snake by 30 %, and ca. 10 % in the viper; and (3) arboreal ambushing in the viper to add an al- ternative diet (birds) compared to mainland populations, (more mice) {{to compensate for the}} lack of suitable mi- cro-mammals on Montecristo Island...|$|E
40|$|Parasite assemblages of the <b>Western</b> <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> Hierophis viridiflavus carbonarius were {{investigated}} from the Calabria region in southern Italy. A total of 14 parasite taxa including 6 nematodes, 3 acanthocephalans, 2 cestodes, 2 digeneans {{and a single}} pentastomid was identified. Within the study area, H. v. carbonarius serves as the final host for seven species of helminths, of which only four (Hexametra quadricornis, Kalicephalus viperae, Paracapillaria sonsinoi and Renifer aniarum) {{can be considered as}} snake specialists, while one (Oswaldocruzia filiformis) is shared with other reptiles and amphibians, and two (Paradistomum mutabile and Rhabdias fuscovenosa) with lizards. A large proportion of larval forms of six helminth taxa (about 95 % of all helminths collected) was found, for which H. v. carbonarius serves as an intermediate and/or paratenic host; however, adult stages of helminths were prevalent in snakes with snout-to-vent length greater than 70 cm. Our results suggest that ontogenetic and ecological factors should exert a strong influence upon the helminth assemblage of Western whip snakes. We concluded that H. v. carbonarius {{plays an important role in}} southern Italy as an intermediate/paratenic host for species of helminths infecting vertebrate groups which may include this snake species within their feeding chain. Eleven taxa, including three potential agents of zoonosis, were added to the poorly known parasite fauna of this host...|$|E

50|$|The red <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> is a slender, long-tailed snake {{that grows}} to {{a length of}} 70 cm in Europe but up to 100 cm {{in the eastern part}} of its range in Asia. It closely resembles Dahl's <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> but differs in having a smaller, flatter head. The upper surface is reddish-brown or reddish grey, with a dark band with pale margins on the neck and scattered, smaller dark bands with pale rims on the fore-parts, these {{markings}} being more widely spaced than those of Dahl's <b>whip</b> <b>snake.</b> Another distinguishing feature is the fact that the scales on the belly of that species have a keel on each side whereas the belly scales on the red <b>whip</b> <b>snake</b> do not. The eye is surrounded by a ring of pale skin and the area of skin in front of and behind this is dark. The underparts are whitish-yellow.|$|R

5000|$|Signal whips (or signalwhips) are {{a type of}} single-tailed whip, {{originally}} designed to control dog teams. A signal whip usually measures between 3 and 4 feet in length. Signal <b>whips</b> and <b>snake</b> <b>whips</b> are similar. What distinguishes a signal <b>whip</b> from a <b>snake</b> <b>whip</b> {{is the absence of}} a [...] "fall". A fall is a piece of leather attached {{to the end of the}} body of the <b>whip.</b> In a <b>snake</b> <b>whip,</b> the [...] "cracker" [...] attaches to the fall. In a signal whip, the cracker attaches directly to the body of the whip.|$|R

40|$|All snakes {{currently}} {{present on}} the Maltese Islands belong to the family Colubridae, all members of which are non-poisonous to man.

The other Maltese snakes include the harmless Black <b>Whip</b> <b>Snake,</b> the Leopard Snake and the Algerian <b>Whip</b> <b>Snake.</b> Snakes are usually fairly timid creatures and they only bite humans in defence, when touched, trodden upon or cornered. When they strike, they do so with amazing speed, usually at the legs or hands of their attacker. In the majority of instances snakes prefer to avoid human contact. N/...|$|R
