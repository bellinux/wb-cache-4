He concurrently wrote to Thompson, who was still in Bulawayo, to ask if there was any sign that the king had been misled during the repudiation letter's drafting. Around the same time, Robinson's strident attacks on parliamentary opponents of the Rudd Concession led to Lord Salisbury replacing him with Sir Henry Brougham Loch. Rhodes claimed not to be worried, telling Shippard in a letter that [...] "the policy will not be altered". Indeed, by the end of June 1889, despite the removal of Robinson and the sensation caused by Lobengula's letter rejecting the concession, Rhodes had got his way: Lord Salisbury's concerns of Portuguese and German expansionism in Africa, coupled with Rhodes's personal exertions in London, prompted the Prime Minister to approve the granting of a royal charter. Rhodes returned victorious to the Cape in August 1889, while back in London Cawston oversaw the final preparations for the chartered company's establishment.|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{the goal}} of {{removing}} trusted setup assumptions from cryptography, we introduce the notion <b>of</b> <b>witness</b> <b>signatures.</b> This primitive allows any party with a valid witness to an NP statement to sign a message on behalf of that statement. We also require these signatures to be unforgeable: that is, producing a signature on a new message (even given several message, signature pairs) should be as hard as computing {{a witness to the}} NP statement itself. Witness signatures are closely related to previously well-studied notions such as non-malleable non-interactive zero knowledge arguments, and <b>signatures</b> <b>of</b> knowledge. In this work, we formalize this notion and show that most natural definitions are impossible in the plain model without any setup assumptions. While still wanting to avoid a central trusted setup, we turn to the tamper proof hardware token model of Katz (Eurocrypt 2007). Interestingly, we show witness signatures in the hardware token model are closely related to what we call non-malleable multi-prover zero-knowledge proofs in the plain model (i. e. without hardware tokens). We initiate the study of non-malleable multi-prover zero-knowledge proofs, and, provide an unconditional construction of single round non-malleable two-prover zero-knowledge proofs.

50|$|He was {{the elder}} son of Roger de la Zouche and Margaret Biset and the {{grandson}} of Alain de Porhoet who took the name Alan la Zouche {{when he arrived in}} England. This elder Alan, the first of the family to be established in England, was a younger son of Geoffrey, viscount of Porhoet in Brittany (d. 1141); his elder brother, Eudes de Porhoet, was for a few years Count of Brittany, by marriage. Under Henry II Alain de Porhoet, or Alan la Zouche, established himself in England, and married Adeline de Belmais, sole heiress of the house of Belmais, her inheritance including Tong Castle in Shropshire, Ashby (afterwards called Ashby-de-la-Zouch) in Leicestershire, North Molton in Devonshire, and other lands in Cambridgeshire and elsewhere. Their son Roger la Zouche (1182-1238), succeeded in turn to these estates. Roger's support for Arthur of Brittany was almost fatal to him in 1203, but he managed to regain King John's favour.

40|$|The secret keys of {{critical}} network authorities - such as time, name, certificate, and software update services - represent high-value targets for hackers, criminals, and spy agencies wishing {{to use these}} keys secretly to compromise other hosts. To protect authorities and their clients proactively from undetected exploits and misuse, we introduce CoSi, a scalable witness cosigning protocol ensuring that every authoritative statement is validated and publicly logged by a diverse group <b>of</b> <b>witnesses</b> before any client will accept it. A statement S collectively signed by W witnesses assures clients that S has been seen, and not immediately found erroneous, by those W observers. Even if S is compromised in a fashion not readily detectable by the witnesses, CoSi still guarantees S's exposure to public scrutiny, forcing secrecy-minded attackers to risk that the compromise will soon be detected by one <b>of</b> the W <b>witnesses.</b> Because clients can verify collective signatures efficiently without communication, CoSi protects clients' privacy, and offers the first transparency mechanism effective against persistent man-in-the-middle attackers who control a victim's Internet access, the authority's secret key, and several witnesses' secret keys. CoSi builds on existing cryptographic multisignature methods, scaling them to support thousands <b>of</b> <b>witnesses</b> via <b>signature</b> aggregation over efficient communication trees.
