5|$|During {{one of the}} cutscenes of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is impaled by the Edea in battle. This {{created a}} theory that Squall dies in battle. When asked about this, Kitase laughed at this and denied this theory. However, he found it {{interesting}} if a remake of the game was ever proposed and the staff <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> changing elements from the story.|$|E
5|$|Hines {{went to the}} Confederate {{capital of}} Richmond, Virginia, after his escape in January 1864. He {{convinced}} Confederate President Jefferson Davis {{of a plan to}} instill mass panic in the Northern states, by means of freeing prisoners and causing arson in larger Northern cities. Impressed by Hines' plan, Davis agreed to back him. Davis urged Hines to tell Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin and Secretary of War James Seddon his plan. Both men agreed to the plan, and encouraged Hines to proceed, with the only hesitation by Davis, Benjamin and Sheldon being the effect on public opinion on such a plan, including what Great Britain and France <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Hines' actions.|$|E
5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E

25|$|The Turner-Ownbey long {{distance}} telepathy experiment was discovered to contain flaws. May Frances Turner positioned {{herself in the}} Duke Parapsychology Laboratory whilst Sara Ownbey claimed to receive transmissions 250 miles away. For the experiment Turner <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a symbol and write it down whilst Ownbey would write her guesses. The scores were highly successful and both records {{were supposed to be}} sent to J. B. Rhine; however, Ownbey sent them to Turner. Critics pointed out this invalidated the results as she could have simply written her own record to agree with the other. When the experiment was repeated and the records were sent to Rhine the scores dropped to average.|$|E
25|$|From {{the time}} Helen was young, the Foster family moved quite {{frequent}}ly. After Helen's birth in Cedar City, the Fosters moved to Chicago so John could attend law school. Several years later, the family once again moved to Idaho. The frequent moves helped to shape Helen's outgoing personality {{as she was}} constantly concerned about what her new peers <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her. Being the oldest child and only daughter of the family, she took {{on a lot of}} responsibility as the family expanded. She often worked alongside her mother to care for her three younger brothers and complete chores, especially when financial circumstances were difficult for the Fosters.|$|E

500|$|In The Independent, {{television}} reviewer Tom Sutcliffe {{discussed the}} documentary, noting {{that it was}} likely to court controversy and cause problems for Holland. Although remarking {{that he did not}} know what devout Muslims <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Holland's arguments, he asserted that they did not have [...] "a monopoly on literalist affront". John Crace reviewed the documentary for The Guardian, noting that Holland was no [...] "attention-seeking, neo-Conservative, Niall Ferguson lookalike" [...] but was probably a social liberal. Crace opined that while most Westerners would find Holland's findings uncontentious, many devout Muslims would consider it blasphemous. Considering Holland excessively cautious, he thought the presenter [...] "was looking over his shoulder, half expecting a fatwa at any minute." ...|$|E
500|$|The M was unpopular {{with local}} people and mine owners {{who saw it}} as a would-be {{monopolist}} that served narrow commercial interests rather than the wider public good. During Parliamentary discussions into the Cleveland Railway's proposed route, a Select Committee of the House of Commons was told that the M was [...] "unwilling to give facility for people carrying traffic not connected with the furnaces with which they are connected." [...] The M's attitude aroused strong local resentment. When one of those testifying to the Select Committee was asked what the local landowners <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a new railway independent of the S, he replied that [...] "they would all jump at having such a proposal made to them." ...|$|E

[...] Hicks {{felt that the}} song's funniest moments involved the jokes revolving around lawyers and the mention of Barney. Amanda Cohen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote that it combined [...] "the schlock of the original song with schtick about the dinosaur movie" [...] and proved that [...] "Yankovic is as funny as ever". Furthermore, she noted that it was evidence that [...] "his voice improves with every new release". In {{a review of the}} Spike and Mike's Festival of Animation, Arthur Salm called the piece a [...] "knockout" [...] and praised the humor, specifically highlighting the claymation cameo of Steven Spielberg and the [...] "goofy velociraptor" [...] from the opening of the video.|$|E
500|$|Six months later, Rachel {{returns to}} Manchester, and moves into Karen and David's spare room. After Pete spots {{her at the}} supermarket, Adam prepares for what he thinks will be her {{homecoming}} with his child. Instead, Rachel reveals {{that she had the}} pregnancy terminated, unable to cope with not knowing whether the father was Adam or Kris. The abortion story was devised to avoid having all three couples in the series having children. Bullen and the executive producers Andy Harries and Christine Langan all agreed that having Rachel suffer a miscarriage would be a [...] "cop out" [...] but they split on whether she should terminate the pregnancy; Harries worried about the effect it would have on the character within the narrative, and what the audience <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her, while Langan convinced him that it would be braver and more realistic for the character to go through with it.|$|E
500|$|His feat {{earned him}} {{promotions}} and finally commands, but {{a period of}} ill-health forced his temporary retirement from active service. Recovering quickly, he was given command of the new 38-gun , and was assigned in 1801 to Sir Hyde Parker's expedition to the Baltic. Riou worked closely with Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson during the approach to the Battle of Copenhagen, earning Nelson's trust and admiration. Nelson appointed Riou to command his frigate squadron during the battle, but when the engagement began badly for the British, Riou used his initiative to attack the Danish forts, despite being heavily outgunned. When Parker sent the signal to withdraw, Nelson ignored it and Riou felt {{he had no choice}} but to obey his commanding officer, despite his despair at what Nelson <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> retreat. As the Amazon swung away, she exposed her vulnerable stern to the Danish batteries. Riou [...] was encouraging his men to the end when he was cut down by a round shot. Nelson, on learning of Riou's death, called the loss 'irreparable'. A monument was erected to his memory in St Paul's Cathedral, while a poem commemorated the loss of the 'gallant, good Riou'.|$|E

500|$|At the 2004 San Diego Comic-Con International, she {{encountered}} now-former Tokyopop editors Mark Paniccia and Lillian M. Diaz-Przybyl, who helped to pitch 12 Days to their publisher. Kim later expressed surprise for her successful pitch of 12 Days, and commented: [...] "It made me {{believe there is}} room for diverse stories." [...] Resuming work on 12 Days in early 2005, Kim felt that her [...] "slow speed, other projects and family matters" [...] delayed [...] its production. Additionally, the South Korean-native Kim, who speaks Korean, English, and Japanese fluently, <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> ideas in Korean that did not translate well over to English, ultimately leading her to change her method of thinking for the comic. She considered her creation of a global manga [...] "a bit ironic," [...] because she [...] "wanted to do something different from manhwa or manga," [...] which she had grown up around. Completed in the middle of August 2006, 12 Days was published by Tokyopop in North America in November of the same year. However, in May 2011, Tokyopop shut down its North American branch, with the status of global manga titles left unclear. 12 Days is also published in Germany by Tokyopop Germany.|$|E
500|$|BBC America {{described}} Gilly {{on their}} official website stating: [...] "His most endearing quality is his honesty {{and despite his}} countless flaws, {{what you see is}} what you get. He's hardly a ladykiller but what he lacks in appearance he makes up for with charisma." [...] E4 publicity describe Gilly as fun-loving and always trying to woo females but hardly manages to impress them and has also been described as unlucky-in-love after his failed relationships. Initially he failed to impress females and didn't have much in common with them. Gilly has been portrayed as a strong supporter of Manchester City F.C., it was this single thing that drew him and Beth Clement (Sinéad Moynihan) together. Gilly was later made a fool by Beth and his best friend Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) after they continued an affair despite the fact they were siblings, they split, Beth subsequently died and due to Gilly's forgiving personality he later forgave Rhys. Holy Soap opined that this was a stand out moment of the character's duration. Another storyline showing his timid personality was when he was mugged by a group of teenagers and was left fearing for his safety and even let them pick on him on the streets. In a further twist Gilly was left feeling so ashamed of the attack he pretended it was adult attackers fearing what people <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{had been}} {{approached}} at a British Academy Television Awards ceremony by director Paul Greengrass, who {{wanted him to}} star in a television drama he was making about the 1972 [...] "Bloody Sunday" [...] shootings in Derry. Nesbitt was only seven years old when the shootings happened and was ignorant of its cause; he believed that there was [...] "no smoke without fire" [...] and that the Catholic marchers {{must have done something}} to provoke the British Army. He was filming Cold Feet in Manchester when he received the script. He read it and found that had [...] "an extraordinary effect" [...] on him. Nesbitt played Ivan Cooper in Bloody Sunday, the man who pressed for the march to go ahead. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Cooper and spent many hours talking to him about his motives on that day. He met with relatives of the victims and watched the televised Bloody Sunday Inquiry with them, and also read Don Mullan's Eyewitness Bloody Sunday and Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson's Those Are Real Bullets, Aren't They?. Greengrass compared Nesbitt's preparation to an athlete preparing for a race, and told The Observer, [...] "For an Irish actor, doing the Troubles is like doing Lear." [...] Nesbitt had questioned whether he was a good enough actor to effectively portray Cooper and was worried what Derry Catholics <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a Protestant playing the lead, although Ivan Cooper himself is a Protestant.|$|E
