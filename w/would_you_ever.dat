2500|$|In 1923, {{shortly after}} their arrival in Paris, Caresse {{introduced}} Crosby {{to her friend}} Constance Coolidge, also a Boston Brahmin, an American expatriate. She was the niece of Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair, and had been married to American diplomat Ray Atherton. Constance didn't care what others thought about her. She loved anything risky and was addicted to gambling. Crosby nicknamed her the [...] "Lady of the Golden Horse." [...] Crosby immediately began {{a sexual relationship with}} her that continued for several months. Harry rationalized their affair, telling Constance, [...] "One should follow every instinct no matter where it leads."

6000|$|There was a {{dedication}} {{of a great}} town-hall, a public building, and we were there in the afternoon. This great building was filled, like this great theatre, with rejoicing villagers, and my friend and I started down the centre aisle. He saw a man standing in that aisle, and he said [...] "Now, look at that bronzed veteran--at that mahogany-faced man. Now, tell me, do you see anything about that man's face that is emotional?

Well, we have; and now, soon, back it must go, back it must go, and try its best to whistle the day out. And yet, do you know, perhaps the very freedom does a little shake its--its monotony.

The {{occasion}} would never be foreseen. What strange creatures brothers are! You would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world; and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill, or such a relation dead, it is done in the fewest possible words. You have but one style among you. I know it perfectly. Henry, who is in every other respect exactly what a brother should be, who loves me, consults me, confides in me, and will talk to me by the hour together, has never yet turned the page in a letter; and very often it is nothing more than--'Dear Mary, I am just arrived. Bath seems full, and everything as usual. Yours sincerely.' That is the true manly style; that is a complete brother's letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mistress Thankful {{remained}} at the wall until her lover had disappeared. Then she turned, a mere lissom shadow in that uncertain light, and glided under the eaves of the shed, and thence {{from tree to tree}} of the orchard, lingering a moment under each as a trout lingers {{in the shadow of the}} bank in passing a shallow, and so reached the farmhouse and the kitchen door, where she entered. Thence by a back staircase she slipped to her own bower, from whose window half an hour before she had taken the signalling light. This she lit again and placed upon a chest of drawers; and, taking off her hood and a shapeless sleeveless mantle she had worn, went to the mirror, and proceeded to re-adjust a high horn comb that had been somewhat displaced by the captain's arm, and otherwise after the fashion of her sex to remove all traces of a previous lover. It may be here observed that a man is very apt to come from the smallest encounter with his dulcinea distrait, bored, or shame-faced; to forget that his cravat is awry, or that a long blond hair is adhering to his button. But as to Mademoiselle--well, looking at Miss Pussy's sleek paws and spotless face, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> know that she had been at the cream-jug? ...|$|E

5000|$|When you're {{a passionate}} content creator... giving up your {{property}} is like giving up your kids.

Taking that into consideration... why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> give up your kids to organizations that don't share your values? No sane person would, but most people don't look at intellectual property that way. They see it more like commercial real estate property. Something that comes and goes. Something that hits or misses and you just move on.

5000|$|Hollis {{denied that}} there was any problem with Polydor, saying [...] "the whole {{structure}} of the deal we have with this record company is understanding how we work. I suppose because it's on Verve some people will think we've been stuck under 'Jazz' but what on earth does jazz mean? It's such a vague term, isn't it? Without any question there are certain areas of jazz that are extremely important to me. Ornette Coleman is an example. But jazz as a term is as widely used and abused as soul - it no longer means what it should mean. Jazz has almost been bastardised to such an extent that, if you've got a saxophone on a record, it's jazz, which is a terrifying idea. It's like, where <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> place Can? To me Tago Mago is an extremely important album that has elements of jazz in it, but I would never call it jazz. Basically, the deal is that I promise to give them the best album I can. I think they have options across four albums which, at the pace we work, is the next 12 years. What more can you say?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Since {{fans of the}} pairing {{often come}} up with [...] "perfect scenarios" [...] for the couple, Riegel and Hendrickson {{were asked if they}} had the {{opportunity}} to create their own storyline for the pairing, what would Bianca and Maggie be doing at the moment.

Hendrickson believed that they would have been proud.
