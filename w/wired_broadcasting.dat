5000|$|<b>Wired</b> <b>broadcasting</b> {{had several}} {{advantages}} over conventional broadcasting: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{nationwide}} {{network of}} wire lines and loudspeakers transmitted radio programs into virtually all rural communities and many urban areas. By 1984 {{there were over}} 2,600 <b>wired</b> <b>broadcasting</b> stations, extending radio transmissions to rural areas outside the range of regular broadcasting stations.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand there were {{practical}} and economic difficulties in extending such services to remote or thinly populated regions. <b>Wired</b> <b>broadcasting</b> {{could also be used}} by governments as a tool of censorship through promoting ownership of wire-only receivers which could not receive foreign stations.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the success}} of Bicol <b>Wire</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> System (BWBS), and {{although}} technology was {{still in its infancy}} in the 60s, Bicol <b>Wire</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> System evolved into People’s Broadcasting System (PBS) with the establishment of 1960 DZGB-AM, the pioneer commercial radio station in Legaspi. For over 40 years, DZGB-AM has reigned at the top of delivering news, information, live special events coverage, public affairs programs and entertainment to the Bicolanos. DZGB-AM is an institution, and was awarded [...] "Best Provincial AM Station Nationwide" [...] by the prestigious KBP Golden Dove Awards for Radio and Television in 2000.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1930s some {{towns in}} Great Britain used <b>wire</b> <b>broadcasting</b> {{experimentally}} either over dedicated cables (sometimes as baseband audio) or through power lines. However as {{the coverage of}} conventional broadcast stations improved the popularity of these [...] "radio relay" [...] or [...] "rediffusion" [...] systems waned and local councils were often hostile to their installation.|$|R
50|$|The radio {{broadcasting}} network experienced significant expansion. In the early 1930s, the Comintern Radio Station, {{with a power}} of 500 kW, was constructed along {{with a number of}} other stations with a power of 100 kW each. The receiving network was augmented, while a system for <b>wired</b> <b>broadcasting</b> via rebroadcasting centres was arranged. Regular television programming was initiated in 1939.|$|E
50|$|Marked {{improvements}} occurred by {{the mid-1980s}} with an influx of foreign technology and increased domestic production capabilities. International and long-distance telephone links by cable and satellite of high quality multiplied. Telegraph, facsimile, and telex were all in use. International satellite ground stations in Beijing and Shanghai were built and a domestic satellite communication network was operational in 1986. Over 160 radio stations existed {{by the mid-1980s}}, and transistorized radio receivers were common. A vast <b>wired</b> <b>broadcasting</b> system included over 2,600 stations carrying radio transmissions into all rural units and many urban areas. The television system grew rapidly in 1980s, with 90 television stations and 80 million sets by 1987.|$|E
50|$|On September 1, 1926, {{the first}} {{experimental}} radio programme (25 minutes duration) called “Voice of Yerevan” was transmitted in Armenia. The first test programmes were mainly folk music programmes regularly interrupted by local news, putting into operation the first {{radio station in}} Armenia. This created new wide-range perspectives for moving the amateur radio movement forward, radiofication and planned development of radio and <b>wired</b> <b>broadcasting</b> networks. The creation of radio station {{made it possible to}} use radio broadcasting {{as one of the most}} efficient mass media for informing and educating the population. That is why radio programs were expected to cover such topics, which would interest people of different specialties and meet their needs.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{established}} by Jorge D. Bayona in 1958, when the people of Legazpi City and the province of Albay had only heard radio from faint broadcast signals from Metro Manila stations. PBN pioneered the broadcast industry in the Bicol region by operating the first cable radio station, [...] "Radyo Balagon", {{under the banner of}} Bicol <b>Wire</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> System (BWBS), the parent company of what PBN Broadcasting Network, Inc. is today.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s {{the first}} cable network {{operators}} started to broadcast {{a variety of}} radio channels to households via cable. One of these cable network operators was Rediffusion S.A., established in 1931, which disseminated radio programmes per <b>wire</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> At {{the end of the}} 1950s Rediffusion began to broadcast the first black/white television channels from the Üetliberg antenna tower in Zürich. In 1994 Rediffusion and other independent cable network companies merged to form Cablecom, owned by Siemens, VEBA and Swisscom.|$|R
50|$|Microwave {{radio relay}} lines and buried cable lines were {{constructed}} {{to create a}} network of wideband carrier trunk lines, which covered the entire country. China {{was linked to the}} international telecommunications network by the installation of communications satellite ground stations and the construction of coaxial cables linking Guangdong Province with Hong Kong and Macau. Provincial-level units and municipalities rapidly expanded local telephone and <b>wire</b> <b>broadcasting</b> networks. Expansion and modernization of the telecommunications system continued throughout the late-1970s and early 1980s, giving particular emphasis to the production of radio and television sets and expanded broadcasting capabilities.|$|R
40|$|CATV {{carrying}} only broadcasting signals has rapidly {{been developing}} since {{the inauguration of}} TV, but those systems which have functions of self-broadcasting and two-way communication, {{are on their way}} to full development. Therefore the concepts of public character and citizen participation in CATV are still new and immature. This paper aims at clarifying their outlines and problems. In general, public character is closely connected with monopolization of public corporation in opposition to commercialism. Besides there are problems of freedom of communication, speech and expression in mass communication. The argument only for public monopolistic enterprise of broadcasting is far from setting the problem. CATV is provided for as wired TV broadcastig by the law of <b>wired</b> <b>broadcasting,</b> but the trait of CATV is that it can offer manifold public services because it has many channels and two-way communication in addition to broadcasting function. So we have to make efficient use of it as cable communication system to meet the various needs of community. Citizen participation means the right of access not to be contended with the position of recipient oi mass communication, but to assert his thought and opinion and to put it into action. It is necessary for CATV to provide for suitable services and to admit citizen participation in its management for the purpose of becomming communication system in close cooperation with local residents. The forms of citizen participation arranged from data of Hi-Ovis are as follows : Management participation (direct, indirect) Program participation (direct, indirect) and program participation is classified into three activities, that is participation before, during and after broadcasting. We can refer to many examples of CATV in the United States and European countries, but what CATV should be is necessarly dependent upon the broadcasting system, community life and the consciousness of local residents. The most important thing is to promote the citizens desire for self-government and learning for themselves and it should be expected that CATV receive public financial help so they may play an active part in it...|$|E
50|$|Rediffusion Television (RTV), the {{predecessor}} to ATV, {{began as a}} <b>wired</b> radio <b>broadcasting</b> service in 1949. The original office was located on Arsenal Street and Hennessy Road. It launched its subscription-based TV service on 29 May 1957. In 1959, Rediffusion {{was moved to the}} offices that was occupied by Fortis Bank Tower.|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} of wireless systems require energy-aware networking. Energy efficiency {{is of particular}} importance in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, where the networking units have {{a limited amount of}} energy resource. Broadcast is the type of communication process of delivering messages from a source node to all the other nodes in a network. Unlike <b>wired</b> networks, <b>broadcasting</b> is an inherent characteristic of wireles...|$|R
5000|$|... "Public {{transmission}}" [...] means [...] "the {{transmission of}} radio communication or wire-telecommunication intended for direct reception by the public". In order {{to deal with}} the new context of the Internet, the (already existing) concept of interactive transmission (websites, video-on-demand, etc.) made a theoretical move, and is now considered as residing under public transmission (besides <b>wire</b> diffusion and <b>broadcasting)</b> (Japan Copyright Office 2001, 30).|$|R
5000|$|The first {{broadcast}} of the WOAS radio station started at 8:00 AM on Friday, December 15, 1978. The station was managed by the Ontonagon Area High School librarian, Thomas Graham Lee. At the time, the station featured two reel-to-reel players and a vinyl record turntable as well as <b>wiring</b> for remote <b>broadcasting</b> in the cafeteria and gymnasium {{of the high school}} building.|$|R
50|$|King {{was born}} in Bloomington, Illinois and was {{stationed}} {{on the island of}} Guam at the end of World War II when he began his broadcasting career with the Armed Forces Radio Network, converting play-by-play accounts of games as they came in over the <b>wire</b> and <b>broadcasting</b> them in a manner that made it sound as if he were actually at the game. After the war, he began his professional sportscasting career in Pekin, Illinois, broadcasting high school football and basketball games as well as minor league baseball games. He later announced basketball games for Bradley University and basketball and football games for the University of Nebraska. King moved to the Bay Area in , when the San Francisco Giants hired him as an announcer.|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid advance}} of {{wireless}} communication technologies {{and the increasing}} popularity of portable devices {{have resulted in a}} rise in demand for information by mobile users. Owing to this fact, different channel operators have started providing services to disseminate useful data and subscribers’ advertisements to mobile users. However, most existing indexing algorithms on multiple channels were designed for a homogeneous environment where it is relatively difficult for mobile users to fetch their expected data from the various data channels operated by different entities. In a heterogeneous multiple channel environment, locating the required data for mobile clients is a power- and time-consuming process. In this thesis, indexing methods are proposed {{in order to reduce the}} time and energy used to search for data in multiple data channels. In our environment, broadcast agents disseminate data through wireless data broadcast services provided by different channel operators. They are connected to a centralized index server through a <b>wired</b> network for <b>broadcasting</b> index information on the index channel. Basically, mobile clients read index information from the index channel and then look for the broadcast data by tuning into the channel according to the index information. Three indexing models are described in the thesis and simulation results are obtained to evaluate the performance of the three proposed methods...|$|R
