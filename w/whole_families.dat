5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Okello had given orders to kill no whites, the Americans living in Stone Town {{fled to the}} English Club, where the point for {{evacuation}} was. Those travelling in the car convoy to the English Club were shocked to see the battered bodies of Arab men lying {{out on the streets}} of Stone Town with their severed penises and testicles shoved into their mouths. As part of Okello's carefully laid out plans, all over the island, gangs of Africans armed with knives, spears and pangas (machetes) went about systemically killing all the Arabs they could find. The American diplomat Don Petterson described his horror as he watched from his house as he saw a gang of African men storm the house of an Arab, behead him in public with a panga, followed by screams from within his house as {{his wife and three children}} were raped and killed, followed by the same scene being repeated at the next house of an Arab, followed by yet another and another. After taking control of Stone Town on the first day, the revolutionaries continued to fight the Manga for control of the countryside for least two days afterwards with <b>whole</b> <b>families</b> of Arabs being massacred after their homes had been stormed.|$|E

25|$|To a great extent, the {{soldiers}} at the Fort were peacetime soldiers - and {{as has been}} said, 'soldiers in peace are like chimneys in summer'! Though always part of the town, {{the soldiers}} (leathernecks) could always find opponents such as the fishermen (squids) and rivalries, not always healthy, resulted.

25|$|Faced with {{opposition}} from the general public the regime took brutal measures against any form of resistance. After the general strike of 1942, Gustav Simon proclaimed {{a state of emergency}} and introduced the German Standgerichte. Thousands were arrested and tortured. Hundreds died in the concentration camps. <b>Whole</b> <b>families</b> were deported to eastern Germany and replaced by German families, mainly from South-Tyrol and Eastern Europe.

The crime was perpetrated by the Soviet occupation regime on the orders of high authorities in Moscow. Prior the deportation, the Peoples Commissariat established operational groups who performed arrests, search and seizure of the property. Arrests took place in all parts in Latvia including rural areas.|$|E
25|$|In 1918, the Jerome's parlors {{served as}} morgues during the flu epidemic. The next year Elisha threw a welcome-home dance for local {{soldiers}} returning from World War I in 1919.

25|$|Partisan {{activities}} {{centred on}} sabotaging economic targets and communications; engaging the Germans in combat; intelligence gathering; and terrorist activities. The primary partisan targets in 1941–42 {{were not the}} German invaders but rather the local police, who were under German direction, and civilian collaborators. The years 1943–44 were the peak of partisan activity within the territory of present-day Ukraine, as the Soviets battled the far-right, nationalistic OUN and the UPA, both of whom collaborated with the Nazis. Reprisal measures for attacks on Soviet partisans or support for Ukrainian nationalists included burning down villages and executions. <b>Whole</b> <b>families</b> were killed, and children, even babies, were sometimes bayoneted or burned alive.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{protests in}} Istanbul on 28 May 2013 {{were led by}} about 50 environmentalists against {{replacing}} Taksim Gezi Park with a reconstruction of the Ottoman Era Taksim Military Barracks (the scene of pro Sultan riots in 1909). The current protests developed into riots after the heavy handed police intervention which featured significant use of tear gas and water cannons. The oppressive reaction to the protests caused the protests to widen with many more people to become involved, people from many different walks of life including {{a wide range of}} political interest groups, secular and religious people, students, gays, feminists, football fans, women in head scarves, <b>whole</b> <b>families,</b> all finding reason to join the protests.|$|E
25|$|Japanese-Canadian {{women and}} {{children}} faced {{a specific set of}} challenges that greatly affected their way of life and broke down the social and cultural norms that had developed. <b>Whole</b> <b>families</b> were taken from their homes and separated from each other. Husbands and wives were almost always separated when sent to camps and, less commonly, some mothers were separated from their children as well. Japanese-Canadian families typically had a patriarchal structure, meaning the husband was the centre of the family. Since husbands were often separated from their families, wives were left to reconfigure the structure of the family and the long established divisions of labour that were so common in the Japanese-Canadian household.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days later}} the first deaths were reported. No attempt {{was made by the}} New Zealand administrators to quell or contain the spread, and after one week it had spread through the whole of Samoa. <b>Whole</b> <b>families</b> were killed, with such {{alarming}} speed that corpses lay around for weeks without being buried. They were either thrown in mass graves or left in houses which were torched. However, in American Samoa, where quarantine precaution measures had been adequately taken, there were no deaths. Upon learning of the current situation in Western Samoa, the American Governor offered help to Colonel Logan who was in charge; Logan was British born and hated Americans. He destroyed the telegram and cut off any other contact to American Samoa. The Americans had a large medical team who could have saved many lives.|$|E

25|$|In the U.S., about 28% of the {{population}} suffered, and 500,000 to 675,000 died. Native American tribes were particularly hard hit. In the Four Corners area alone, 3,293 deaths were registered among Native Americans. Entire villages perished in Alaska. The influenza epidemic across the Seward Peninsula in 1918 and 1919 wiped out about 50 percent of the native population of Nome (later an epidemic diphteria during 1925 serum run to Nome), and 8 percent of the native population of Alaska. More than 1,000 people died in northwest Alaska, and double that across the state, and the majority were Alaska Natives. The Alaska Natives had no resistance to either of these diseases. Native tribes had no immunity. As a result of epidemics, the Yup'ik world would go upside down; it would end. From there it spread like a wildfire to all corners of Alaska, killing up to 60 percent of the Eskimo and Alaskan Athabaskan people with the least exposure to the white man. This epidemic killed <b>whole</b> <b>families</b> and wiped out whole villages. Many Kuskuqvamiut also migrated to Bristol Bay region from the Kuskokwim River region {{to the north of}} Bristol Bay, especially after the influenza epidemic of 1918-19.|$|E
25|$|Largely due to {{the company}} nature of the settlement, {{development}} was slow, with the first bank not opening until 1859 and the town's first newspaper being printed in 1876. Until the National Bank established the first branch in Kooringa, most exchange was either {{in the form of}} company scrip or at shops operating as money exchanges. All towns, except Kooringa, were built outside the mining lease but were still close to the mine as it was at the northern edge of the lease. The formation of the townships was forced by the refusal of SAMA to grant any freeholds within Kooringa, so miners began moving into other townships from the end of 1849. During their early lives each of the townships largely had their own hotels, churches, post offices, schools, and shops and identity. In 1851 the gold rush near Bathurst, New South Wales, emptied the town of many miners. <b>Whole</b> <b>families,</b> government officials and other townspeople left for the gold fields and by 1854 the town appeared largely deserted. The number of townships increased dramatically {{as a result of an}} 1858 proposal to extend a railway line from Gawler. When the railway failed to be built most of the new townships failed and, in 1876, the remaining townships formed the Corporation of Burra.|$|E
25|$|When Boris I {{assumed the}} throne of Bulgaria in 852, the country was still pagan, with the ruling Bulgar elite being Tengriists while the Slavic {{population}} practised its own religion. Christianity was already widespread in Bulgaria as the country was established on former territories of the Byzantine Empire, and {{seems to have been}} influential. Even one of the sons of Khan Omurtag (r. 814–831), Enravota, converted to Christianity. The Bulgarian nobility was strongly opposed to any form of Byzantine influence in the country and was therefore hostile to Christianity as it was directly associated with the Byzantine Empire. Boris I, however, had many reasons to consider conversion— Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and East Francia; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth; and finally, Boris also saw Christianity as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs. The geopolitical situation in the mid 9th century was also favourable because of the increasing friction and rivalry between the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople for influence in Central Europe. That struggle between the two churches would give the Bulgarian ruler the opportunity to manoeuvre and negotiate with both, thus extracting favourable concessions while keeping the country out of direct foreign influence. When the Byzantines invaded Bulgaria in the autumn of 863 and demanded conversion to Christianity from Constantinople as the single condition to retreat, Boris I readily accepted and was baptised in the beginning of 864, assuming the Christian name Michael after his spiritual godfather, the Byzantine Emperor Michael III. That step was very unpopular among the nobility, but when they rebelled Boris I dealt decisively with them and executed 52 magnates along with their <b>whole</b> <b>families.</b> When in the following year the Byzantines sturdily demonstrated their determination not to allow the existence of an autocephalous Bulgarian Church, Boris I decided to turn to the Papacy.|$|E
