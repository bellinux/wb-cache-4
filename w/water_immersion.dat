This study intends to find preferences of resources that contribute for the well-being of cattle and how they alterdaily behaviour. During summer, six Caracu and six Red Angus bulls were submitted to two different treatments: availability of artificial shade and <b>water</b> for <b>immersion</b> and availability of <b>water</b> for <b>immersion.</b> The categories observed were: positions (in the sun, under the shade, in the water), posture (standing, lying down) and activities (grazing, ruminating, leisure). The behavioural patterns were recorded using the focal sampling method every 15 minutes (from 6 : 00 a. m. to 6 : 00 p. m.). When shade and <b>water</b> for <b>immersion</b> coexists, cattle in this study prefer shade to avoid solar radiation. Both breeds had remained more time grazing, followed by ruminating in the Caracu breed, and by resting in the Red Angus breed.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} use a steel/aluminum {{tailored}} blank in actual practice, galvanic corrosion due to the contact of dissimilar metals should be examined. However, few studies have reported the influence of galvanic corrosion on a steel/aluminum laser butt-welded joint. In this study, the effect of galvanic corrosion {{on the strength of}} SPCC/A 1100 -O laser butt-welded joints was investigated by immersion tests in air, distilled water, and salt water. The appearance was observed and tensile tests were conducted. In addition, the joint interface and the surface near the joint interface were observed and analyzed by FE-SEM and EDS. During the <b>immersions</b> in distilled <b>water</b> and in salt water, specimens were covered with an oxide film and the joint strength decreased. In the salt <b>water</b> <b>immersions,</b> the strength of the SPCC base materials decreased. And a large reduction of the cross-sectional area of the A 1100 -O side of the joints was seen in the salt <b>water</b> <b>immersions.</b> From the results of the observations and analyses by FE-SEM and EDS, a layer of brittle intermetallic compounds formed in the joint interface during the immersion test, and corrosion progressed as the oxide film sloughed off...|$|R

25|$|Blood flow to {{skin and}} fat are {{affected}} by skin and core temperature, and resting muscle perfusion {{is controlled by the}} temperature of the muscle itself. During exercise increased flow to the working muscles is often balanced by reduced flow to other tissues, such as kidneys spleen and liver. Blood flow to the muscles is also lower in cold water, but exercise keeps the muscle warm and flow elevated even when the skin is chilled. Blood flow to fat normally increases during exercise, but this is inhibited by immersion in cold water. Adaptation to cold reduces the extreme vasoconstriction which usually occurs with cold <b>water</b> <b>immersion.</b> Variations in perfusion distribution do not necessarily affect respiratory inert gas exchange, though some gas may be locally trapped by changes in perfusion. Rest in a cold environment will reduce inert gas exchange from skin, fat and muscle, whereas exercise will increase gas exchange. Exercise during decompression can reduce decompression time and risk, providing bubbles are not present, but can increase risk if bubbles are present. Inert gas exchange is least favourable for the diver who is warm and exercises at depth during the ingassing phase, and rests and is cold during decompression.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, it was {{believed}} that in order to create dreadlocks, an individual had to refrain from brushing, combing or cutting. This lack of hair grooming results in what is called [...] "free form" [...] or [...] "neglect" [...] dreads, where the hair matts together slowly of its own accord. Such dreads tend to vary greatly in size, width, shape, length, and texture. If the wearer is interested in any uniformity of their dreads, they must pull the matted strands of hair apart to ensure large clumps don't form. In addition, if the wearer wishes for their dreads to be neat and tight, they must continue to separate the matted sections of hair and palm roll them regularly for a period of between [...] 6 to 12 months before their hair is well locked. Generally with this free form dread style, the dreads will remain loose and fluffy until the process of long term rolling has tightened them and they have reached a mature status. Until they reach this mature status, they are at risk of coming open especially with lots of <b>water</b> <b>immersion</b> (showers, swimming or washing). [...] Many people use products or wax to assist in the locking process.

6000|$|Several {{leaves were}} left for 4 hrs. 30 m. in a {{solution}} of one part of white sugar to 146 of water, and no aggregation ensued; on being placed {{in a solution}} of this same strength of carbonate of ammonia, they were acted on in 5 m.; as was likewise a leaf which had been left for 1 hr. 45 m. in a moderately thick solution of gum arabic. Several other leaves were immersed for some hours in denser solutions of sugar, gum, and starch, {{and they had the}} contents of their cells greatly aggregated. This [page 52] effect may be attributed to exosmose; for the leaves in the syrup became quite flaccid, and those in the gum and starch somewhat flaccid, with their tentacles twisted about in the most irregular manner, the longer ones like corkscrews. We shall hereafter see that solutions of these substances, when placed on the discs of leaves, do not incite inflection. Particles of soft sugar were added to the secretion round several glands and were soon dissolved, causing a great increase of the secretion, no doubt by exosmose; and after 24 hrs. the cells showed a certain amount of aggregation, though the tentacles were not inflected. Glycerine causes in a few minutes well-pronounced aggregation, commencing as usual within the glands and then travelling down the tentacles; and this I presume may be attributed to the strong attraction of this substance for <b>water.</b> <b>Immersion</b> for several hours in water causes some degree of aggregation. Twenty leaves were first carefully examined, and re-examined after having been left immersed in distilled water for various periods, with the following results. It is rare to find even a trace of aggregation until 4 or 5 and generally not until several more hours have elapsed. When however a leaf becomes quickly inflected in water, as sometimes happens, especially during very warm weather, aggregation may occur in little over 1 hr. In all cases leaves left in water for more than 24 hrs. have their glands blackened, which shows that their contents are aggregated; and in the specimens which were carefully examined, there was fairly well-marked aggregation in the upper cells of the pedicels. These trials were made with cut off-leaves, and {{it occurred to me that}} this circumstance might influence the result, as the footstalks would not perhaps absorb water quickly enough to supply the glands as they continued to secrete. But this view was proved erroneous, for a plant with uninjured roots, bearing four leaves, was submerged in distilled water for 47 hrs., and the glands were blackened, though the tentacles were very little inflected. In one of these leaves there was only a slight degree of aggregation in the tentacles; in the second rather more, the purple contents of the cells being a little separated from the walls; in the third and fourth, which were pale leaves, the aggregation in the upper parts of the pedicels was well marked. In these leaves the little masses of protoplasm, many of which were oval, slowly changed their forms and positions; so that a submergence for 47 hrs. had not killed the protoplasm. In a previous trial with a submerged plant, the tentacles were not in the least inflected. [page 53] ...|$|E

The data concerning to the time spent in different behaviors and different positions were analyzed by the multifactorial variance (ANOVA-GLM). The fixed factors used were the breed and treatment. The results had shown that grazing activity was the behavior in which both breeds had spending more time (especially in the cooler periods), followed by ruminating in the Caracu and by resting in the Red Angus. The results also had shown that shade can be used as a shelter against solar radiation as well against rain. The Caracu had presented a clear preference for the shade, particularly in the hottest hours. However this was not always observed in Red Angus, who sometimes chose to remain in the water.
