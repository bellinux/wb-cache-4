25|$|There are {{problems}} that may hinder the development the modeling of reading behaviours. First, computer models in reading {{tend to make}} assumptions of direct links between lexical properties and saccade attributes (by putting a formula linking the two into the model). These links are descriptive generalizations of existing empirical data and normally do not survive new data. In search for new data to support their models, researcher might have to keep adding and adjusting lexical process assumptions {{and are likely to}} ignore possible parsimonious process that underlies these assumptions. Caution should be taken when adding assumptions of how lexical processes affect saccade programming because reading is not what humans are evolved to do. The modeling of eye-movements in reading should treat reading as special case of visual perception and take into account more basic oculomotor properties(e.g., split fovea, depth perception) before making assumptions about the link between lexical processes and eye movements. Another problem is {{that there has been a}} lack of comparison between models on the same data set. Researcher teams tend to focus on the development of their own model and might not be able to fully appreciate the merits of other models due to the technical difficulties in sharing programs. In the future <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> unifying model that both explains complex reading behaviors well and is parsimonious enough to be generalizable to other eye-tracking fields such as visual search, scene viewing.|$|E

One where <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> {{things that have been}} set up for a long time start to pay off. Not everyone's story is firing on all {{cylinders}} at the moment, Tyrion was actively bored while waiting for news this week, but enough {{is going on in the}} North and at King's Landing to carry the series right now." [...] Likewise, Todd VanDerWerff of Vox wrote, [...] ""Oathbreaker" [...] is a crisp, lean, nicely paced episode of Game of Thrones. It's one of those episodes where the characters are mostly being positioned for future episodes, but it's a solidly executed version of that basic template." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of the Washington Post wrote that she believed this was [...] "The strongest episode of the sixth season of Game of Thrones to date." [...] While Erik Kain of Forbes noted [...] "The season has been full of revelations, but things are still building. That's okay. I love the tension and not knowing exactly what's coming." ...|$|E

[...] Examples {{of this type of}} quality are: [...] “A calm sea might be seen as if it were resting calmly. [...] In the delicate rustling of the leaves of a tree <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> the tree as delicately moving its limbs." ...|$|E

40|$|Up {{until this}} parliament, {{the date of}} {{parliamentary}} elections could be set by the Prime Minister of the day; now {{as part of the}} coalition agreement, election dates are set for every 5 years. In spite of this new rule, Mark Pack looks at the ways that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>seen</b> an election before 2015, and finds that given the current electoral math and polling, such an outcome is unlikely...|$|R

2500|$|Regulated {{genes are}} {{categorized}} {{in terms of}} what they are and what they do, important relationships between genes may emerge. For example, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> evidence that a certain gene creates a protein to make an enzyme that activates a protein [...] to turn on a second gene on our list. This second gene may [...] be a transcription factor that regulates yet another gene from our list. Observing these links we may begin to suspect that they represent much more than chance associations in the results, and that they are all on our list because of an underlying biological process. On the other hand, it could be that if one selected genes at random, one might find many that seem to have something in common. In this sense, we need rigorous statistical procedures to test whether the emerging biological themes is significant or not. That is where gene set analysis comes in.|$|E
2500|$|During his 23 {{years at}} Harvard, Lake {{continuously}} taught one very popular course, the English Bible, familiarly known as [...] "English 35". [...] When he taught {{the course for}} the first time in 1914, the course had less than 40 students, whereas his final year there were over 250—a [...] "625 per cent increase," [...] as the Harvard Crimson touted when announcing his final lecture would be 16 December 1937. [...] His book An Introduction to the New Testament (1937) is a [...] "skeleton of the course." [...] However, [...] "it does not give the flesh put on that skeleton by the lecturer" [...] (p. ix). [...] It was of course that [...] "flesh" [...] which made the course so interesting, due to Lake's lively imagination and engaging wit. [...] As he himself explains: [...] "The most important thing in a teacher's life is not to impart the knowledge of facts—which can be found much better in books—but to encourage another generation to look steadfastly at the vision which it sees, and to face its own problems in the light of that vision, controlled and guided by an understanding of what the past has done or not done" [...] (Paul, His Heritage and Legacy, 1934, p. xii). [...] He seems to have been effective, for James Luther Adams, one of his students during 1924–27, recalls: [...] "It was his characteristic interest to make historical figures come alive, so that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> their significance today and not merely study them as so many items from a dead past." [...] "Something we all recognized in Kirsopp Lake," [...] writes Adams, [...] "was that he had the imagination of a Sherlock Holmes. [...] He took an almost childlike interest in digging out alternative answers to historical questions ... Students who thought themselves completely secularized and immune to any 'religious nonsense' attended his lectures and heard him publicly burrow down into the biblical concepts, taking as his point of departure something highly imaginative in one of the parables, and then rise up to fly with it. [...] The students used to call his courses 'Kirsopp's Fables.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You are welcome, Chippewa," [...] cried le Bourdon, {{shaking his}} friend cordially by the hand. [...] "We were half afraid <b>we</b> <b>might</b> never <b>see</b> you again. Do you bring us {{good or evil}} tidings?" ...|$|R
60|$|Excuse my digression, gentle reader. At first I left it out, {{thinking}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>see</b> {{wood for}} trees. But it doesn't much {{matter what we}} see. It's nice just to look round, anywhere.|$|R

6000|$|... "All right, dear, I am ready. But, if {{you don't}} mind, we might {{go first to}} Mercy. I am anxious about grandfather, and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> that--as yet, at all events--nothing has {{happened}} there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we don't {{care how}} small she {{is if we}} can only go in her; and you {{would be able to}} show us London, and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> even <b>see</b> the queen. Oh, do come up with us and ask father, Master Lirriper." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{on earth}} could we do? This was a painful dilemma. If we once {{lost sight of}} her, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>see</b> her again. Yet if we walked with her openly, and talked like friends, we would betray ourselves, and her, to those fanatical Senoosis.|$|R
6000|$|... "That won't make Mr Rubb ugly. I {{wish you}} {{had asked him to}} come and dine here on Sunday, so that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have <b>seen</b> whether he eats his gravy with his knife. I looked very hard to see whether he'd catch his crumbs in his handkerchief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{signs of}} de Vervillin, hey! Greenly?" [...] the admiral asked, when his {{survey of the}} whole fleet had ended. [...] "I was in hopes <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> {{something}} of him, when the light returned this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] went on Jessie; [...] "he {{said that}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> {{there were some}} flowers just for beauty, all double, and with no fruit or good at all in them, but dying off into a foul mass of decay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{they are}} at last!" [...] exclaimed Victor, with {{sparkling}} eyes, [...] "the elms on the knoll. D'ye see them, Tony? I do believe I see the smoking-box. But for the bushes <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> the chimneys of Willow Creek." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{drive past}} the new house, Si," [...] pleaded his wife. [...] "I couldn't bear to see it. Drive--drive up Bolingbroke Street. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>see</b> where he DOES live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hellish noise!" [...] said Stalky, critically. [...] "'Don't think Colonel Dabney {{will like}} it. I move {{we go into}} the Lodge and get {{something}} to eat. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> as well <b>see</b> the fun out." ...|$|R
60|$|Here {{we slept}} {{without any of}} the frightful things we saw the night before, except that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> the light of the fire in the air at a great distance, like a great city in flames, but that gave us no {{disturbance}} at all.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless, we lost no time {{in getting}} away from the tool house. We walked side by side, I with the pistol in the pocket of my jacket, and Dick with the lantern held aloft, that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> to make rapid {{progress}} over the unaccustomed road.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{sort of a}} {{place is}} Croydon?" [...] Bill asked. [...] "Is there any chance of picking up a living there? 'cause I tells yer fair, if yer goes off I goes with yer.

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, father," [...] Lionel broke in. [...] "If you say yes, {{mother is}} sure to say yes; she always does, you know. And, you see, {{it will be a}} great thing for us to see London. Every one else seems to have seen London, and I am sure that it would do us good. And <b>we</b> <b>might</b> even <b>see</b> the queen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cynthy and I was thinkin' of takin' {{a little}} trip," [...] said Jethro, almost apologetically, [...] "and {{we kind of}} thought we'd like {{to have you with}} us. Didn't <b>we,</b> Cynthy? Er--we <b>might</b> <b>see</b> General Grant," [...] he added meaningly.|$|R
60|$|But if on {{this same}} day, 1851 years ago, {{instead of being}} in the great city of Rome, we had been in the little village of Bethlehem in Judaea, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> have <b>seen</b> a sight {{stranger}} still; a sight which we could not have fancied {{had anything to do with}} that merrymaking of the slaves at Rome, and yet which had everything to do with it.|$|R
60|$|In {{dealing with}} occult laws, however, we must allow {{for our own}} {{complete}} ignorance of the subject. Did we know more <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> {{that there was some}} analogy between that foul bog and the sacrilege which had been committed, and that their ritual and customs demanded that just such a death was the one appropriate to the crime.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did they?" [...] cried Belmont exultantly, his {{responsive}} Irish nature {{catching the}} sunshine in an instant. [...] "Then, be Jove, we'll do them yet, for the garrison {{must have heard}} the firing. What d'ye think, Cochrane? They must be full cry upon our scent this four hours. Any minute <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> the white puggaree of a British officer coming over that rise." ...|$|E
60|$|Now it was I {{realized}} that some one {{well acquainted with}} the locality should have been sent with us, for we were obliged to go on blindly, as it were, trusting that chance, and what <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> of the disposition of the enemy's forces, would bring us to the point we desired to gain, for {{neither of us had}} ever visited Fort Schuyler.|$|E
6000|$|... "What's to be done?" [...] Jerry {{asked as}} we stepped behind {{a clump of}} bushes in a nearby garden where <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not be <b>seen</b> by the fellow who would have rejoiced {{if he could have}} put us in the same place with Darius.|$|R
60|$|At breakfast time Professor M. and his {{daughter}} called, as he said, to place themselves at our disposal for the castle, or whatever <b>we</b> <b>might</b> wish to <b>see.</b> I intimated that we would prefer spending the day in our New England manner of retirement--a suggestion which he took at once.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between subjective well-being and social policy. It reviews efforts to study well-being and then presents some international comparisons of subjective well-being and national UK trends in subjective well-being and discusses what might explain them. It then explores why <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>see</b> a relationship between policy and subjective well-being. Then it asserts that there probable is one and presents some evidence in support. It concludes that exploration of this subject is in its infancy and we need more research...|$|R
