5|$|The square once <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> an iron {{fence that}} was no longer present by 1905. By the 1860s, the square was a heavily wooded park. In 1876-7, trees that lined the square along main street were removed.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a local}} atlas, Mountain Grove Campground was semicircular in shape, with avenues {{radiating}} out {{towards the}} sides.

When this area was filled up, more people would set up tents along the avenues that radiated outward from the camp.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet weather, the airbase was completed and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had to take off after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E

5|$|Brook Farm {{was named}} for the brook that ran near the {{roadside}} and that eventually went to the Charles River. It <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. The land, however, {{turned out to be}} difficult to farm.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar's {{appearance}} in prehistory was very different. Whereas {{today it is}} surrounded by sea, the water level was much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a fertile coastal plain, with marshes and sand dunes supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.|$|E

After an initial advance by the Royalists in 1642, culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green, London <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication. The lines were built by up to 20,000 people, and were completed in under two months.|$|E
5|$|Many of Oldham's present {{divisions}} and suburbs have origins as pre-industrial hamlets, manorial commons and ancient chapelries. Some, such as Moorside, exist as recently constructed residential suburbia, whilst places like Hollinwood exist as electoral wards and thoroughly industrialised districts. Throughout {{most of its}} recorded history, Oldham <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> large swathes of moorland, which {{is reflected in the}} placenames of Moorside, Greenacres moor, Littlemoor, Northmoor among others.|$|E
5|$|Pik Wan Road and Lin Tak Road {{were also}} built in 1992 to {{facilitate}} transport to newly built areas higher up Lam Tin Hill.

50|$|Na2Te, {{like many}} related {{compounds}} with the formula M2X, adopts the antifluorite structure. Thus, in solid Na2Te each Te2− ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> eight Na+ ions and each Na+ ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> four Te2− ions.|$|R
50|$|Kuruman has {{relatively}} mild {{weather patterns}} {{compared to other}} Northern Cape towns, such as Upington and Springbok, and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> more vegetation {{as compared to the}} Upington and Springbok, which <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> desertic environments.|$|R
50|$|The last {{assumption}} {{means that}} each cation <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a spherically symmetric cloud of other ions. The cloud has a net negative charge. Similarly each anion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a cloud with net positive charge.|$|R
5|$|Red Cloud's actions gave E Company {{time and}} warning to blunt the Chinese offensive, {{eventually}} repelling the attack. His actions are also credited with allowing his company to evacuate several others {{wounded in the}} attack.

5|$|Several {{sections}} of the Beijing-Guangzhou railway, a main rail route in China, were blocked by flooding and landslides, causing many delays and diversions. One train <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> floodwaters in Lechang, and passengers had to be evacuated to a nearby school. At least 274 trains were affected and the train company refunded nearly 2million tickets. After three days of repair work, the rail service resumed normal operations on July 18.|$|E
5|$|The Tudor Revival-style Briarcliff Lodge {{was opened}} in 1902 as a premier resort hotel. It <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> Walter Law's dairy barns and greenhouses, and hosted {{numerous}} distinguished guests, including Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The lodge held the Edgewood Park School (1936–1954) and The King's College (1955–1994) before it {{burned to the}} ground on September 20, 2003.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} cause for {{a confrontation with}} the JNA in Split was a blockade of the village of Kijevo, where Croatian authorities had established a new police station, imposed on 29 April. The village <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the JNA, commanded by Colonel Ratko Mladić, and the Serb insurgent forces, cutting access and preventing delivery of supplies. Tuđman called on the public to bring the siege to its end.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. The stage <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a circular ramp, which connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the ramp and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E
5|$|Vrbanja Bridge {{was located}} in no-man's-land during the Siege of Sarajevo (1992–96). It <b>was</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> tall buildings, which made it a target of sniper-fire from the {{beginning}} of the Bosnian War. On 5 April 1992, six protestors were shot on the bridge by Serb snipers. Two women, Suada Dilberović and Olga Sučić, died as a result, and are considered the first victims of the siege by Bosniaks and Croats.|$|E
50|$|The Justizwache corps badge {{shows the}} Austrian coat of arms, which <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> a {{circular}} enclosure.

50|$|An axon is {{the part}} of a neuron which conducts {{electrical}} impulses. Axons <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> myelin, which contain Schwann cells. Schwann cells improve the electrical conduction. The myelin <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> endoneurium, which <b>is</b> a protective sheath of connective tissue. This <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> <b>by</b> perineurium and epineurium, of which the latter is the outmost layer of dense connective tissue. When it comes to nerve repair, it is crucial that those layers make a good connection.|$|R
