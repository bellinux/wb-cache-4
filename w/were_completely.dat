5|$|Three {{people were}} killed, many more were injured, and 600 Martiniquans were left homeless. The banana fields <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed. Officials {{estimated}} the {{damage on the}} island at about €250million (US$337million).|$|E
5|$|Dialogi and Summa Technologiae (1964) are Lem's {{two most}} famous {{philosophical}} texts. The Summa is notable {{for being a}} unique analysis of prospective social, cybernetic, and biological advances; in this work, Lem discusses philosophical implications of technologies that <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> {{in the realm of}} science fiction at the time, but are gaining importance today—for instance, virtual reality and nanotechnology.|$|E

5|$|In early August 1971, several {{consecutive}} days of heavy rainfall led to flooding throughout the area. Several highways {{in the area}} were damaged, including RE 2. Portions of the highway <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> washed out, which took about two weeks to repair.|$|E
5|$|It {{is clear}} that the demoralised and tired Greeks were no match for the Persians, and <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus. Many were killed, {{including}} the Eretrian general, Eualcides. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships and sailed back to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the changes}} {{occurred}} {{in conjunction with the}} opening of the new Archer Avenue Subway. However, some changes <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> coincidental. These changes affected over 3.7 million daily riders. Maps were offered to rush-hour subway riders on December 12, 1988, one day after the initial changes.|$|E

5|$|On 7 March 1949, a {{fire spread}} {{from the library}} roof; over 300 printed books and the manuscripts on {{exhibition}} <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed, and over 3,000 books needed repair, though the main structure suffered little damage and restoration took less than a year.|$|E
5|$|Outside fences in España avenue <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> {{covered with}} tall sawali (woven bamboo matting), while the {{concrete}} walls on all other {{sides of the}} Campus remained high, preventing view between the internees and the outside world. The years of Japanese occupation were years of great suffering for the internees.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit {{initially}} {{estimated that}} 100 to 125 homes were damaged, but in actuality Hurricane Dean damaged many more: 183houses lost their roofs completely, 205houses sustained partial damage to their roofs, 43houses <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed, 115houses suffered significant structural damage to components {{other than their}} roofs, and 225non-dwelling buildings were damaged.

5|$|The Germans rapidly {{realised}} that Pećanac's Chetniks, whose numbers {{had grown}} to 8,000, were inefficient and unreliable, and even the Nedić government had no confidence in them. They <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> disbanded by March 1943. Pećanac himself was interned by the Nedić regime for some time, and was killed by agents of Mihailović in May or June 1944.|$|E
5|$|The {{most severe}} damage from Hurricane Charley {{occurred}} in Charlotte County. In Boca Grande, numerous houses sustained extensive roof damage, while thousands {{of trees and}} power lines were uprooted or snapped. In Port Charlotte and Punta Gorda, many buildings, RVs, and mobile homes <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed, while other buildings were uproofed due to the powerful winds.|$|E
5|$|Thirty five homes <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed, {{with many}} more being unroofed or {{receiving}} {{some sort of}} damage. Damage estimates were around $150,000 from buildings alone; utilities and railway facilities {{received a lot of}} damage as well.

40|$|We study a {{class of}} t-designs which enjoy {{a high degree of}} regularity. These are the subsets of {{vertices}} of the Johnson graph which <b>are</b> <b>completely</b> regular, in the sense of Delsarte [3]. After setting up the basic theory, we describe the known completely regular designs. We derive very strong restrictions which must hold in order for a design to <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> regular. As a result, we <b>are</b> able to <b>completely</b> determine which symmetric designs <b>are</b> <b>completely</b> regular and which Steiner systems with t = 2 <b>are</b> <b>completely</b> regular...|$|R

5|$|A {{key part}} of Blamey's plan was for Australian and US forces to {{maintain}} pressure on the Japanese garrison around Salamaua to the south-west in the lead up to the landing {{in an effort to}} draw Japanese reinforcements away from Lae. In this they <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> successful; the Japanese 51st Division continued to reinforce the position around Salamaua, with thousands of Japanese troops, including elements of several infantry regiments and an artillery regiment, being moved to the area throughout the campaign. Allied intelligence estimated that there were 7,250 Japanese soldiers in Lae, of whom 5,100 were in combat units.|$|E
5|$|Al-Aqsa's dome {{is one of}} the few domes to be {{built in}} front of the mihrab during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus (715) and the Great Mosque of Sousse (850). The {{interior}} of the dome is painted with 14th-century-era decorations. During the 1969 burning, the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost, but <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> reconstructed using the trateggio technique, a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones.|$|E

At least 118 Croat and other non-Serb civilians were killed in Baćin and its vicinity by February 1992. By 1995, numerous Croat-owned houses in Hrvatska Dubica, all Croat-owned houses in Cerovljani and about half the Croat-owned houses in Baćin were torched, dynamited or otherwise destroyed. The Catholic churches in Hrvatska Dubica, Cerovljani and Baćin were destroyed, and {{the foundations of the}} church destroyed in Hrvatska Dubica <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> removed.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} 110-floor Twin Towers, {{numerous}} other buildings at the World Trade Center site were destroyed or badly damaged, including WTC buildings 3 through 7 and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church. The North Tower, South Tower, the Marriott Hotel (3WTC), and 7WTC <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed. The U.S. Customs House (6 World Trade Center), 4 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged. The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished some years later, starting in 2007. The two {{buildings of the}} World Financial Center also suffered damage.|$|E
5|$|Among the few {{remains of}} {{buildings}} {{from the interior}} of the town, most notable are a large monumental staircase and a large church, with dimensions of some , in the northeast. The church was of relatively simple construction, but of unusual size, and A. Bon proposes its identification with the church of the Franciscans, where assemblies of the nobles of Achaea were held in 1276 and 1289. The remaining portions of the church's walls <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation.|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi <b>were</b> <b>completely</b> different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
