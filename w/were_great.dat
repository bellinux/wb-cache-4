5|$|Construction of the B Station began {{shortly after}} the A station was completed. The {{stations}} were built during {{a period in which}} there <b>were</b> <b>great</b> advances in power station technology, and in the scale of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate generator set sizes along with a mix of design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250MW. Their combined capacity of 1,730MW briefly made Blyth Power Station the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation in 1966. The stations were capable of generating enough electricity to power 300,000homes.|$|E

5|$|In 1542, {{the thirty}} year old {{must have been}} feeling {{confident}} about his future prospects when he suffered two major interruptions to his life. First, Leuven was besieged by the troops of the Duke of Cleves, a Lutheran sympathiser who, with French support, was set on exploiting unrest in the Low Countries to his own ends. Ironically it was this same Duke to whom Mercator would turn ten years hence. The siege was lifted but the financial losses to the town and its traders, including Mercator, <b>were</b> <b>great.</b> The second interruption was potentially deadly: the Inquisition called.|$|E
5|$|Saffron {{made its}} way to the New World when {{thousands}} of Alsatian, German, and Swiss Anabaptists, Dunkards, and others fled religious persecution in Europe. They settled mainly in eastern Pennsylvania, in the Susquehanna River valley. These settlers, who became known as the Pennsylvania Dutch, were by 1730 widely cultivating saffron after corms were first brought to Americain a trunk. It was owned by German adherents of a Protestant church known as the Schwenkfelder Church. Schwenkfelders, as members were known, <b>were</b> <b>great</b> lovers of saffron, and had grown it back in Germany. Pennsylvania Dutch saffron was soon being successfully marketed to Spanish colonists in the Caribbean, while healthy demand elsewhere ensured that its listed price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was set equal to that of gold.|$|E

5|$|After the debacles of the Schwarz era {{and brief}} {{control of the}} team by the CFL (see above) the Argos were rescued by David Cynamon and Howard Sokolowski in 2004. There was {{optimism}} surrounding the duo's arrival and attendance figures improved in their six years heading the organization. It was also appreciated that the two were Torontonians after a quarter-century of foreign and/or corporate ownership. But by 2010 losses <b>were</b> <b>great</b> enough that the team was again put on the block and eventually sold to David Braley. There was some controversy surrounding Braley's takeover. He is simultaneously owner of the BC Lions, raising questions of competitive integrity. It was also revealed that Braley had bankrolled half of Cynamon and Sokolowski's initial $2 million buy-in of the Argos in 2004, and covered half their subsequent losses, in exchange for half of the 2007 Grey Cup profits.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{pterosaur}} researcher Alexander Kellner revisited H.W. Miller's classification. Kellner followed Miller's {{opinion that}} {{the differences between the}} Pteranodon species <b>were</b> <b>great</b> enough to place them into different genera. He placed P. sternbergi into the genus named by Miller, Geosternbergia, along with the Pierre Shale skull specimen which Bennett had previously considered to be a large male P. longiceps. Kellner argued that this specimen's crest, though incompletely preserved, was most similar to Geosternbergia. Because the specimen was millions of years younger than any known Geosternbergia, he assigned it to the new species Geosternbergia maysei. Numerous other pteranodont specimens are known from the same formation and time period, and Kellner suggested they may belong to the same species as G. maysei, but because they lack skulls, he could not confidently identify them.|$|E

During the course of the Sydney Olympics, Blackwood won a silver medal. The August 17 qualification round placed the Jamaican sprinter in the sixth heat. He placed fourth out of its eight athletes, displacing Canada's Tyler Christopher (45.67seconds) but falling behind the Bahamas' Michael Mathieu (45.17seconds). The leaders of Blackwood's heat <b>were</b> <b>Great</b> Britain's Andrew Steele (44.94seconds) and Trinidad and Tobago's Renny Quow (45.13seconds).

50|$|It is {{impossible}} {{that the same}} thing should be necessitated by the being and the not-being of the same thing.

5|$|The diverse ethno-linguistic {{groups of}} Tripura have {{given rise to}} a {{composite}} culture. The dominant ethnic groups are Bengali, Tripuri (Debbarma, Tripura, Jamatia, Reang, Noatia, Koloi, Murasing, Chakma, Halam, Garo, Kuki, Mizo, Uchoi, Dhamai, Roaza, Mogh, Manipuri, and other tribal groups such as Munda, Oraon and Santhal who migrated in Tripura as a tea labourers. Bengali people represent the largest ethno-linguist community of the state. Bengali culture, as a result, is the main indigenous, non-Tripura culture. Indeed, many elite tribal families which reside in towns have actively embraced Bengali culture and language in the past, but in today's generation more Tripuris are embracing their culture. The Tripuri kings <b>were</b> <b>great</b> patrons of Bengali culture, especially literature; Bengali language was the language of the court.
