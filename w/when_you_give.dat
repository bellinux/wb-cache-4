500|$|In 2012, Nolan {{directed}} his {{third and final}} Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises. Although he was initially hesitant about returning to the series, he agreed to come back after developing a story with his brother and David S. Goyer which he felt would end the series on a high note. The Dark Knight Rises was released on 20 July 2012 to positive reviews; Andrew O'Hehir of Salon called it [...] "arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen", further describing the work as [...] "auteurist spectacle on a scale never before possible and never before attempted". Christy Lemire of The Associated Press wrote in her review that Nolan concluded his trilogy in a [...] "typically spectacular, ambitious fashion", but disliked the [...] "overloaded" [...] story and excessive grimness; [...] "This is the problem when you're an exceptional, visionary filmmaker. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> people something extraordinary, they expect it every time. Anything short of that feels like a letdown." [...] Like its predecessor it performed well at the box office, becoming the thirteenth film {{in the world to}} gross over $1-billion. During a midnight showing of the film at the Century 16 cinema in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman opened fire inside the theater, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. Nolan released a statement to the press expressing his condolences for the victims of what he described as a senseless tragedy.|$|E
500|$|Barnes {{returned}} for the subsequent fixture against Surrey at The Oval in London, where Australia won the toss and batted first. Barnes attacked immediately, {{and put on}} an opening partnership of 136 with Morris, before the latter fell. Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 for the second wicket before Barnes fell for 176. The tourists continued {{to build on the}} foundation laid by the top order and were eventually bowled out for 632. Bradman’s bowlers dismissed Surrey for 141 and 195 to win by an innings after enforcing the follow on. During the match, Barnes was involved in an oft-recalled incident. After a series of Australian appeals had been turned down in the match against Leicestershire by umpire Alec Skelding, Barnes had remonstrated with him and told him he had problems with his eyesight. Barnes also complained about Skelding adjudging him lbw, saying the ball [...] "wouldn't have hit another set of stumps" [...] and telling the umpire to get a guide dog. A stray dog ran onto the field during the Surrey game. It caused a stoppage in play by evading the players and police for a few minutes. Eventually, Barnes used the ball to bait and trap the dog, which he then [...] presented to Skelding stating: [...] "You must need a dog. You're blind <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> those decisions [...] not out" [...] and [...] "Now all you want is a white stick". Skelding refused the offer, and after Barnes continued to pressure him into taking the dog, he called for an adjournment and left the playing arena. Barnes later wrote [...] "Strange how I suggested he find himself a canine companion at ...|$|E

2500|$|The oral {{evaluations}} {{are intended}} to also help the evaluator improve {{his or her ability}} to give constructive feedback to other Toastmasters. Learning to give feedback develops many skills, some of which include: effective listening; how to motivate, encourage and support other members; and how to develop and present a short evaluation with minimal preparation. Language is an important element of effective evaluation and so too is the structure. The structure of a Toastmaster Evaluation might be referred to as the [...] "feedback sandwich," [...] the [...] "PIP" [...] (praise, improve, praise) method, or the [...] "CRC" [...] (commend, recommend, commend) method.

2500|$|This moves {{onto another}} track called [...] "You've Changed" [...] that {{features}} her ex bandmates Beyoncé and Michelle Williams. Lyrically the song {{talks about a}} relationship that has gone [...] "awry". Rowland takes prominence on the track, though Beyoncé and Williams each get their [...] "own cathartic verse to go off on a clueless ex". The Honesty Hour compared [...] "You've Changed" [...] to the 2004 Destiny's Child single [...] "Girl". Production on the album then moves on to a light midtempo dance track on [...] "I Remember", which was produced by The Runners. Atop a [...] "tinkling piano and propulsive dance beat", Rowland's [...] "characteristically soulful vocals" [...] can be heard. Hampp said that the song incorporated tribal music and a vibe that [...] "consciously stops short of being a full-on four-on-the-floor banger." [...] According to the Honesty Hour, [...] "I Remember" [...] remains firmly a ballad, but incorporates elements of techno and EDM. Rowland dabbles in some 80's funk pop on the Boi-1da and Matthew Burnett-produced [...] "Red Wine". The song features dreamy synths and a soaring chorus, in a vintage throwback. It was compared to songs by Brandy Norwood. The pace continues on the romantic [...] "This is Love" [...] which focuses on a guy that [...] "got [...] goin’ on cloud 9". Over the light production, Rowland sings [...] "I’m waiting and anticipating for you {{to give it to}} me / Boy I’m trying to hold it inside / Heart racing, my body shaking / ‘Cause <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> it to me, boy you are the truth, I can’t lie." [...] According to the Honesty Hour, [...] "This is Love" [...] had crossover appear for both R and pop radio.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Memorandum's {{signing the}} U.S. has {{transferred}} 3,082 detainees to Afghan control according to Afghan Army General Ghulam Farouk. He said on September 10, 2012 that the U.S. {{was in the}} process of transferring the remaining 30 inmates picked up before the memorandum was signed plus another 600 captured after the signing. But a few weeks ago, the U.S. stopped all transfers. A coalition official told CNN the United States is holding on to several Afghan detainees because of concerns about whether Afghan authorities will properly handle their cases and under what circumstances they might be released. The U.S. also is keeping several prisoners of other nationalities who were not part of the agreement the source said. [...] "Some 99 percent of the detainees captured before 9 March have already been transferred to Afghan authority, but we have paused the transfer of the remaining detainees until our concerns are met," [...] said Jamie Graybeal, a spokesman for the U.S.-led military coalition. Graybeal would not describe the concerns, but a report released in early September 2012 by the New York-based Open Society Foundations said the rift was over whether the Afghans will have a so-called [...] "internment" [...] system that allows some detainees to be held without charge or trial. The U.S. has been holding detainees in internment at Bagram for years. Although the Afghan government agreed to embrace an internment system by signing the accord in March, some top Afghan officials and legal experts contend it violates the Afghan constitution, the report said. Moreover, Karzai himself is opposed to administrative detention (Detaines are held without access to lawyers, public trials or other legal rights), according to the report. The U.S. is now worried that the Afghan government will discontinue internment and either release dangerous detainees or forward their cases to the loosely run Afghan judicial system, which is tainted by corruption and secrecy, the group said. [...] "There are concerns on the U.S. side about division in the Afghan government over internment and that it is not constitutional," [...] said Rachel Reid, a senior policy adviser on Afghanistan for the Open Society Foundations. [...] "The basic concern is that if they don't have internment, they will be released." [...] On the flip side of the legal issue, some Afghan legal experts are worried about Afghan officials abusing any authority to hold detainees without trial. [...] "Consider the fact that even our regular laws are ignored by powerful people," [...] said Abdul Qawi Afzali of the Legal Aid Organization Afghanistan. [...] "What will happen <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> them the actual, legal power to detain people like this law does?" ...|$|E
