(First Politics!), de la Rocque invented the motto Social dabord! (First Social!). In his book, Le Service Public (Public Service, published in November 1934), he argued in favour of a reform of parliamentary procedures; cooperation between industries according to their branches of activities; a minimum wage and paid holidays; <b>womens</b> <b>right</b> to vote (also upheld by the monarchist Action française, who considered that women, often devout, would be more favorable to their conservative thesis), etc. The Croix-de-Feu and its satellite organizations gradually took on momentum, reaching 500 members in 1928, 60,000 end of 1933, 150,000 {{in the months following}} the 6 February 1934 riots and 400,000 end of 1935.

The Partys electoral programme, {{for the first time}} in Labours history, did not make any reference to religion. Boffas Government was supported by the General Workers Union, and it carried out a number of reforms, such as the abolition of the Senate, the abolition of plural votes, as well as the introduction of <b>womens</b> <b>right</b> to vote. However, Labour deputies resigned from their posts in July 1946 due to mass redundancies at the Dockyards. In the meantime, the MacMichael Constitution had been introduced, granting self-government to the Maltese. Labours participation in the subsequent October, 1947 elections was once again supported by the General Workers Union. The Party won 59.9% of the vote and twenty-four seats out of the possible forty within the Legislative Assembly.

40|$|Placing <b>womens</b> <b>right</b> to {{education}} within an essentially androcentric international legal framework, this article underpins various legal and social constraints that deter {{the translation of}} this right into a lived experience. Though international law illustrates education lucidly, especially in conjunction with non-discriminatory provisions and emphasises non-derogability, its implementation is dampened by feeble state obligations. Contrasts are drawn between the human rights discourse, which largely propounds claims {{on behalf of the}} dispossessed and the neo-liberal regime, which distances human agency and action. Drawing briefly on constitutional provisions, progressive judicial interpretations and peoples movements for education, this article nevertheless cautions that despite assertions to the contrary, India is still slotted at risk in not reaching minimal thresholds in gender parity. Claims are made to retain the hegemony of this right as an agentive discourse, rather than as one which slots marginalised women as mere statistical references, discounting their subjugation and struggles. In the past decade, global pronouncements and state endeavours to make the right {{to education}} for all a reality offered much scope for optimism. However, a recent review indicates that even gender parity in education is likely to be unattainable for several countries in this decade (UNESCO EFA 2003). Declining gender gap...|$|R

The sample included 52 women and 31 men who were presented with photographs {{of men and women}} while their gaze behavior was measured with an eye tracker. Participants indicated which model was the most attractive, which was the greatest competition, and how likely each model was to agree to date the participant. Contrary to previous research, I found no significant gender differences between men and <b>women???s</b> <b>right</b> or left hand 2 D: 4 D. Overall, male models received longer fixation than female models; this was true for both male and female participants, although the relationship was not significant among the men. Lower, more masculine, left hand 2 D: 4 D was associated with higher scores on the behavior subscale of the Sociosexual Orientation Inventory-Revised. Participants who scored high on the desire and attitude subscale and global sociosexual orientation were more confident in their ratings of how likely the models would be to date them. 2 D: 4 D and sociosexual orientation was not associated with fixation on models deemed most attractive or highest in competition. This study utilizes an uncommon procedure for evaluating mating behaviors. By combining eye tracker data, a measure of prenatal androgen exposure, and a measure of sociosexual orientation, this study has provided a multifaceted approach to the study of mating behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: Contemporary feminist {{scholarship}} has {{done much to}} challenge the many binary constructions {{at the heart of}} Western culture: white/nonwhite, theory/practice, and, most notably, masculine/feminine. Feminist criticism has reshaped these conceptions by breaking them apart and reconfiguring them into intersecting, relational fields of difference. The contributors to this collection look to the future of feminist theory and practice, specifically in terms of their complex relationship with the global and local configurations of postmodernity. In {{the first part of this}} book, current feminist theory is assessed for possible future directions. Part two focuses primarily on political issues and part three on questions of the body. Topics include feminist success versus social backlash, global <b>womens</b> human <b>rights,</b> postcolonial feminism, the politics of reproduction, and narratives of womens aging in postmodern culture...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{whether and}} to what extent the {{relative}} circumstances of men and women following marital dissolution a¤ect sex selection behavior within marriages. Chinas new divorce law, which was enacted in 2001, reduced divorce costs, especially for women, by granting the right to divorce and claim damages in the case of domestic violence and extra-marital relationships and by securing <b>womens</b> property <b>rights</b> upon divorce. I model the legal change as a decrease in womens divorce costs in a household in which all the marital surplus accrues to the husband. I show: (1) that the new divorce law predicts an increase in divorce rates after the birth of a daughter; (2) that the new law results in fewer sex-selective abortions for the second birth if the 8 ̆ 5 rst birth produced a daughter; and (3) that the new law should have a diminishing marginal e¤ect on sex ratio, or that the sex ratio in historically low divorce regions should be a¤ected most. All the predictions are supported by the empirical evidence. Most importantly, I 8 ̆ 5 nd {{that the majority of the}} decline occurred in provinces with divorce rates below the median.

While family planning programs in Bangladesh have substantially improved women???s access to contraception, the emphasis on controlling population growth has comprised women???s health and wellbeing. Furthermore, the context of male-dominance, traditional gender norms, and persistent poverty continue to constrain women???s ability to effectively make and carry out decisions concerning their sexuality and reproduction. Based on data from 12 in-depth interviews with married adolescent women in urban slums of Bangladesh, I aim to explore the factors that continue to shape and constrain reproductive rights. My findings demonstrate three main categories of constraints on women???s reproductive rights: 1) problems with family planning methods and services, 2) husbands??? authority in decision-making and women???s economic dependence on their husbands, and 3) the context of poverty and insecurity in urban slums. Overall, reproductive rights cannot be understood outside of the social, economic, and political context of women???s everyday lives, and reproductive rights for all will only be achieved through a global commitment to social and economic justice.
