30|$|Static {{factors such}} as {{permeability}} and porosity that affect {{the intensity of the}} flow field during the ultra-high water-cut stage in the sedimentary point bar of a meandering river with medium–high permeability are reflected in the geological model and the dynamic parameter changes. For the dynamic parameters of accumulated injection <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> multiple, water saturation, fluid velocity and pressure gradient, the flow velocity can be characterized by the pressure gradient. The injection <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> multiple has a relationship with the water saturation and the fluid flow rate {{is a reflection of the}} accumulated injection <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> multiple derivative over time, so the accumulated injection <b>wash</b> <b>out</b> multiple is selected as the index of flow field strength.|$|R
