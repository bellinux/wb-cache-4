5|$|Arthur, who {{was looking}} to retain the BBBofC Lonsdale Belt, <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> rising star in British boxing. He was a strong {{favourite}} to win the bout against Gomez, who was perceived to have been through too many battles and abused his body too much, and the fight <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stepping stone on Arthur's way to a future world championship. However, Freddie Roach, Arthur's trainer, was criticised when he remained in the United States to coach another boxer instead of continuing to work with Arthur to prepare for his championship match.|$|E
5|$|Abroad in the Netherlands, the Great Fire of London <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> divine {{retribution}} for Holmes's Bonfire, {{the burning}} by the English of a Dutch town during the Second Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had sold}} two million copies by August 2008, Here I Stand <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{commercial}} failure relative to Confessions, which had sold nineteen million copies. Tyler Lewis of PopMatters put the album's limited success down to Usher's and Foster's marriage; {{he believed that}} Usher's fans disliked Foster.|$|E
50|$|Schumpeterian rent <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of {{economic}} rent, although Schumpeterian rent may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> incentive towards greater economic inefficiency.|$|R

5|$|As Shadow Chancellor, Brown as Chancellor-in-waiting <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{good choice}} by {{business}} and the middle class. While he was Chancellor inflation sometimes exceeded the 2% target causing the Governor of the Bank of England to write several letters to the Chancellor, each time inflation exceeded three per cent.|$|E
5|$|Early in his reign, Constantinople {{suffered}} a massive fire, which destroyed houses, churches, and completely incinerated the huge library built by Emperor Julian. The fire <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bad omen {{for the rule}} of Basiliscus.|$|E
5|$|However, Canavan was {{not out of}} {{management}} for long. He was appointed manager of Cavan Gaels in December 2013 and guided them to their 1st Senior Championship in 3 years in October 2014, defeating Kingscourt Stars in the final by a point. This <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> huge success for Canavan and the Cavan Gaels Club.|$|E
40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> amount of matter 2. <b>A</b> hole can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> region of space 3. <b>A</b> building can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> place 4. A biological organ can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> aggregate of molecules 5. An association can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group of people 6. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies. It can be stated as follows: Ontological Distinction Principle: Classes corresponding to different ident...|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> bicone can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{polyhedral}} {{limiting case}} of an n-gonal bipyramid where n approaches infinity. It can also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dual of <b>a</b> cylinder <b>as</b> <b>an</b> infinite-side prism.|$|R
5|$|In {{advance of}} the 2002 elections, he <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> likely {{contender}} to succeed deceased Rep.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to his father, who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme, Bush embraced larger visions and <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man of larger ideas and associated huge risks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the broader}} Arab world, the {{declaration}} <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{betrayal of the}} British wartime understandings with the Arabs.

5000|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {4/2} antiprism; with {4/2} being a tetragram, a {{compound}} of two dual digons, and the tetrahedron <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> digonal antiprism, this can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> compound of two digonal antiprisms.|$|R
50|$|As the {{displacement}} can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mechanical analogue of electric charge, the absement can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mechanical analogue of the time-integrated charge, a quantity useful for modelling {{some types of}} memory elements.|$|R
5|$|Periyar was {{a radical}} {{advocate}} of anti-Brahmanism. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is quite often confused as being anti-Brahmin. Brahmanism is accepting social inequality based on birth. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun brahmanism.|$|E
5|$|The ruling <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} {{victory for}} the video game industry.

5|$|Title VIII of the Act, {{commonly}} known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin (later expanded to include sex, familial status, and disability).

30|$|As already {{explained}} in [12], RS can also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> form of non-orthogonal multi-user transmission. Indeed, in its simplest form, the common message in RS can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> non-orthogonal layer added onto the private layers.|$|R
50|$|The crossed square cupola may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{part of some}} uniform polyhedra. For example, {{the great}} cubicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> six crossed square cupolae {{connected}} at their triangular faces, while the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> blend of six cupolae. Additionally, the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> octagrammic prism with the octagrams excavated with crossed square cupolae, similarly to how the rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> octagonal prism with the octagons augmented with square cupolae. Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron. To this may be added the great rhombihexahedron, as the exclusive or of {{all three of these}} octagrammic prisms which may be used to construct the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R

5|$|A curved line {{of stars}} {{comprising}} Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Beta, Nu and Gamma Phoenicis <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> boat {{by the ancient}} Arabs. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and designated 27 stars with the Bayer designations Alpha through to Omega in 1756. Of these, he labelled two stars close together Lambda, and assigned Omicron, Psi and Omega to three stars, which subsequent astronomers such as Benjamin Gould felt were too dim to warrant their letters. A different star was subsequently labelled Psi Phoenicis, while the other two designations fell out of use.|$|E
5|$|A row {{of fifty}} Norway spruce trees lines the main {{driveway}} {{leading to the}} farm. These trees represent the fifty U.S. states, and were given to Eisenhower as birthday presents {{from each of the}} state Republican Party chairmen in 1955. The furthest one from the house was the tree representing Texas, and it <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mark of Eisenhower's recovery {{that he was able to}} walk that far after his heart attack.|$|E
5|$|Abu Bakar promuglated the Johor State Establishment Constitution (Malay: Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor), {{drafted by}} Abdul Rahman Andak, on 14 April 1895. The state's {{constitution}} <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> turning point {{by many as}} a step in {{laying the groundwork for}} the administration of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in light of his failing health, promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.|$|E
