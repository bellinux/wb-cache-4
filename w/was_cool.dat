25|$|The {{prevailing}} {{weather pattern}} in the Middle Ohio Valley from 1350–1600 CE <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> and wet, followed by a period of frequent drought. In contrast, the upper Ohio Valley experienced milder weather patterns. The frequency of droughts in West Virginia increased in the following decades. Drought frequency during 1250-1400 CE is unknown. North of the Allegheny Plateau, the Till Plains were less affected by drought.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} gastric-brooding frog {{was only}} recorded in pristine rainforests {{where the only}} form of human disturbance was poorly defined walking tracks. As with the southern gastric-brooding frog, the northern gastric-brooding frog was also a largely aquatic species. They were found {{in and around the}} shallow sections of fast flowing creeks and streams where individuals were located in shallow, rocky, broken-water areas, in cascades, riffles and trickles. The water in these streams <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> and clear, and the frogs hid away beneath or between boulders in the current or in backwaters.|$|E

25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E
25|$|This {{process was}} later {{performed}} on the human body (in {{the image on the}} left): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood.|$|E
25|$|Which was, you know, that <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> – {{somebody}} had to get it, I suppose. What happened actually was then I started to ring him up. I thought, here's the guy historically placed to give Lennon–McCartney a good deal at last, 'cos we got signed when we were 21 or something in a back alley in Liverpool. And the deal, it's remained the same, even though we made this company the most famous – hugely successful. So I kept thinking, {{it was time for}} a raise... I did talk to him about it, but he kind of blanked me on it. He kept saying, 'That's just business, Paul.' You know. So, I thought, 'Yeah, it is,' and waited for a reply, but we never kind of got to it... It was no big bust-up. We kind of drifted apart after that".|$|E

50|$|Porphyritic {{rocks are}} formed when {{a column of}} rising magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> in two stages. In the first stage, the magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> slowly deep in the crust, {{creating}} the large crystal grains, with a diameter of 2 mm or more. In the final stage, the magma <b>is</b> <b>cooled</b> rapidly at relatively shallow depth or as it erupts from a volcano, creating small grains that are usually invisible to the unaided eye.|$|R
25|$|Big Bang {{nucleosynthesis}} {{predicts a}} primordial abundance of about 25% helium-4 by mass, {{irrespective of the}} initial conditions of the universe. As long as the universe was hot enough for protons and neutrons to transform into each other easily, their ratio, determined solely by their relative masses, was about 1 neutron to 7 protons (allowing for some decay of neutrons into protons). Once it <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> enough, the neutrons quickly bound with {{an equal number of}} protons to form first deuterium, then helium-4. Helium-4 is very stable and is nearly the end of this chain if it runs for only a short time, since helium neither decays nor combines easily to form heavier nuclei (since there are no stable nuclei with mass numbers of 5 or 8, helium does not combine easily with either protons, or with itself). Once temperatures are lowered, out of every 16 nucleons (2 neutrons and 14 protons), 4 of these (25% of the total particles and total mass) combine quickly into one helium-4 nucleus. This produces one helium for every 12 hydrogens, resulting in a universe that is a little over 8% helium by number of atoms, and 25% helium by mass.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, most of {{the winters}} were milder and usually wetter than average with daytime {{temperatures}} going below freezing a rare occurrence. In fact, the winter of 1995/1996 {{was the only one}} which was defined as below average in terms of the UK as a whole, although February 1991 saw heavy snowfall & January 1997 was cold in the South. The winters of 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11 have however seen a different pattern with these three winters being defined as below or well below average with large snowfall amounts widespread and very low temperatures; {{this was the first time}} three consecutive cold winters in the UK have occurred since the 1960s. Since the winter of 2012/2013, winters have been mild (exceptionally so in 2013/2014 and 2015/2016), although exceptionally wet. The winter of 2014/2015 was an oddity, in that it was generally quiet and sunny. December 2014 & January 2015 were a little milder than the average, February 2015 was close to normal. The winter of 2016/17 was very nearly a very cold winter owing to the presence and position of high pressure, although ultimately only November 2016 was cold widely as a whole. Early December 2016 <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> and January 2017 was cold in the south-east, with much of the rest of England and Wales near the 1961-1990 average. At Northolt, the average minimum for January 2017 was below freezing for the first time since December 2010.|$|E
