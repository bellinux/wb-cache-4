5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{reached the age of}} 21, the prince became {{infatuated}} with Maria Fitzherbert. She was a commoner, six years his elder, twice widowed, and a Roman Catholic. Despite her complete unsuitability, the prince was determined to marry her. This was in spite of the Act of Settlement 1701, which barred the spouse of a Catholic from succeeding to the throne, and the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which prohibited his marriage without the King's consent, which <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> granted.|$|E
5|$|Early 21st-century research, however, {{suggested}} that Master James' role, and Savoyard influence more generally, {{may have been}} overstated. The stonework of the sites in North Wales is of much higher quality than that in North Italy, and key features – such as the gatehouses – are not seen in Savoyard. Research indicates that Master James also appears {{to have had a}} stronger project management function, rather than an architectural design role, {{in the development of the}} sites. Furthermore, in some cases the relevant Savoy structures were built only after James had left the region, and <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> seen by the architect. The similarity in architectural details may, therefore, be the result of the wider role played by Savoy craftsmen and engineers on the projects, rather than that of a single individual.|$|E
5|$|Gordianus {{had been}} Roman emperor {{for six years}} when Philip, with his son Philip, succeeded him. It is {{reported}} that he, being a Christian, desired, {{on the day of}} the last paschal vigil, to share with the multitude in the prayers of the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For if he had not done this, he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.|$|E

Following the conferral of her degree, Smith delivered the commencement address and sang/played two songs accompanied by long-time band member Lenny Kaye. In her remarks, Smith explained that in 1967 {{when she moved}} to New York City (Brooklyn), she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accepted into Pratt, but most of her friends (including Mapplethorpe) were students at Pratt and she spent countless hours on the Pratt campus. She added that it was through her friends and their Pratt professors that she learned much of her own artistic skills, making the honor from the institute particularly poignant for Smith 43 years later.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 general {{elections}} {{had left the}} Liberals as a minority government dependent upon the support of Irish Nationalists. As desired by the Nationalists, Asquith introduced legislation that would give Ireland Home Rule, but the Conservatives and Unionists opposed it. As tempers rose over the Home Rule Bill, which <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> possible without the Parliament Act, relations between the elderly Knollys and the Conservatives became poor, and he was pushed into retirement. Desperate to avoid the prospect of civil war in Ireland between Unionists and Nationalists, George called a meeting of all parties at Buckingham Palace in July 1914 {{in an attempt to}} negotiate a settlement. After four days the conference ended without an agreement. Political developments in Britain and Ireland were overtaken by events in Europe, and the issue of Irish Home Rule was shelved.|$|E
5|$|In April, 1972 he was reassigned {{from the}} SAC to TAC {{and to the}} 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was {{familiar}} with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, {{was one of the}} most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very few Americans remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA made it a point to track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely knew exactly who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be a terrific blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he felt sure if he were captured that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> taken to Hanoi.|$|E

5000|$|Right {{from the}} start, the Auswärtiges Amt was very {{socially}} exclusive.

Even if Attlee had personally been prepared to serve under Chamberlain in an emergency coalition government, he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to carry Labour with him.

25|$|Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot (28 May 1888 – 22 January 1947) was an English governess and writer, {{who became}} {{known for her}} {{marriage}} in 1915 to the American poet T. S. Eliot. Her legacy, {{and the extent to}} which she influenced Eliot's work, has been the subject of much debate. She has been seen variously as a femme fatale who enticed the patrician Eliot into a disastrous marriage, or as his muse, without whom some of his most important work <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> written. Valerie Eliot, the poet's second wife (from 1957) claimed the copyright of Haigh-Wood's writings in 1984, including her private diaries, which has complicated the research into her role in Eliot's life.|$|E
