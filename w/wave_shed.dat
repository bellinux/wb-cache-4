The growth of the static heap is investigated in this paper.

Introduction. – The dynamics of granular media appears to be very different from that of usual fluids [1]. In particular such media have the ability to remain static (i. e. a solid-like behavior) at a non-zero tilt angle. When this tilt angle exceeds a critical value a surface flow is observed: most of the pile remains static except for a relatively thin rolling layer [2, 3]. A granular medium can thus display both solid-like and fluid-like behaviors. Very recently [4], i...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} the kinetics of shedding of the soluble TNF receptors (TNF-Rs) {{in response to}} TNF leakage during isolated limb perfusion procedures and correlated them to the resulting hemodynamic effects. Shedding of the TNF-Rs started 7 min after TNF leakage into the systemic circulation. Three <b>waves</b> of <b>shedding</b> were observed peaking at 1, 8 - 12, and 48 - 72 h both in vivo and in cell cultures. The soluble receptors prolonged the half-life of TNF in the systemic circulation to 2. 5 - 6 h. Excess shedding of the p 75 compared with p 55 TNF-Rs was noted during the first wave. The amount and speed of shedding of the p 75 TNF-Rs were proportional to the serum TNF levels (P < 0. 001). A maximal shedding capacity was attained only during the first <b>wave</b> of <b>shedding,</b> at TNF concentrations of approximately 1. 5 ng/ml. Above this level, the linearity between TNF and its soluble receptors was lost. TNF-induced hypotension coincided with the initial imbalance between the concentrations of TNF and its soluble receptors. Despite the spontaneous correction of this imbalance at 8 - 12 h, the hemodynamic and biochemical alterations persisted and were further aggravated at 18 h, suggesting that other factors induced earlier by TNF {{are responsible for the}} perpetuation of the hemodynamic instability.

Gas {{turbine entry temperature}} {{is much higher than}} the allowable material limit and the hot components can survive only using advanced film-cooling systems. Unfortunately these systems are designed without taking into account the interaction with the shock waves and this article would like to address this problem and to evaluate if this assumption is correct or not. A correct prediction and understanding of the interaction between the ejected coolant and the shock waves is crucial in order to achieve an optimal distribution of the coolant and to increase the components’ life. In this work, the numerical investigation of a film-cooling test case, investigated experimentally by the University of Karlsruhe, is shown. An in-house computational fluid dynamics solver is used for the numerical analysis. The test rig consists of a converging–diverging nozzle that accelerates the incoming flow up to supersonic conditions and an oblique shock is generated at the nozzle exit section. Three cases have been studied, where the cooling holes have been positioned before, near and after the shock impingement. The results obtained considering four blowing ratios are presented and compared with the available experimental data. The local adiabatic effectiveness is affected by the shock–coolant interaction and this effect has been observed for all the blowing ratios investigated. A similar trend is observed in the experimental data even if the numerical simulations over-predict the impact of the interaction...|$|R

In the three groups of snails, the number of cercariae per <b>shedding</b> <b>wave</b> peaked at the second wave and subsequently decreased up to the fifth wave. The mean length of interwave intervals ranged from 6. 8 to 7. 8 days and only showed insignificant variations.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the unsteady phenomenon known as transonic buffet. Completely developed in the High Speed Lab of the Aerospace Faculty at TU Delft (The Netherlands), {{the experiments were conducted}} in the transonic/supersonic wind tunnel TST- 27. In order to achieve time and spatial resolution of the phenomenon, high-speed Schlieren and time-resolved particle image velocimetry were used as the main measurement techniques over two aerodynamic models, the NACA 0012 and the OAT 15 A. The aim of the project was to achieve fully developed buffet conditions, to study the time evolution of the flow and the dynamic characteristics of the features involved in the phenomenon, to investigate the wave propagation in the flow that maintains the self-sustained character of buffet and to study the origin and dynamic development of these waves. An spectral analysis of the shock wave motion was done over all the experimental test cases to analyze the influence of different aerodynamic parameters (Ma, Re, AoA) over the phenomenon and {{to come up with the}} cases were buffet is most fully developed. The results showed that, as expected, there is a range of values of these aerodynamic parameters under which buffet develops, and out of this range it just vanishes. Buffet was fully achieve for the OAT 15 A model at Ma= 0. 70, AoA= 3. 5 º and fixed transition at x/c= 7 %, on the other hand, buffet about the NACA 0012 was not fully developed, but it was found to be stronger at Ma= 0. 70, AoA= 4 º and free transition. From the PIV results, the instantaneous and the phase-average velocity fields showed how the actual flow development takes place and all the features involved in the buffet cycles. It was shown that under fully developed buffet conditions, massive separation takes place from the shock foot and extends beyond the trailing edge during the upstream motion of the shock wave, whereas reattachment occurs in that region during the downstream motion of the shock. Finally, a correlation analysis of the velocity fields demonstrated the presence of the so called upstream traveling <b>waves</b> <b>shed</b> at around 2000 Hz and traveling upstream at - 80 m/s. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the vortices shed from the shock foot when full separation occurs are not the cause for the upstream traveling waves, instead they are originated by another type of disturbances shed when reattachment occurs at the shock foot. This made possible a reformulation of the hypothetical dynamic evolution of the features involved in the buffet cycles, explaining the links between them and the physical mechanisms that cause their self sustained development.

40|$|A recent {{focus in}} studies of vortex {{shedding}} behind circular cylinders {{has been on the}} use of low-order dynamical systems such as circle maps to predict wake dynamics. These purely temporal models have been limited by their inability to describe three-dimensional spatial flow variations along the cylinder span, a hallmark of transitional flows such as the cylinder wake. In the present work this limitation is overcome through development of a spatial-temporal map lattice which utilizes a series of coupled circle map oscillators along the cylinder span. This model allows for the study of vortex shedding patterns and wake dynamics behind vibrating flexible cables. Required input for the model includes the forcing frequency, amplitude, mode shape, aspect ratio and wavelength of the cable, Reynolds number, vortex convection velocity, and various phase angles, Model output parameters studied in this work include vortex shedding patterns and wake response frequency.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} wall-bounded {{open cavity}} {{may be considered}} as a simplified geometry found in industrial applications such as leading gear or slotted flats on the airplane. Understanding the three-dimensional complex flow structure that surrounds this particular geometry is therefore of major industrial interest. At the light of the remarkable former investigations in this kind of flows, enough evidences suggest that the lateral walls have a great influence on the flow features and hence on their instability modes. Nevertheless, even though there is a large body of literature on cavity flows, most of them are {{based on the assumption that}} the flow is two-dimensional and spanwise-periodic. The flow over realistic open cavity should be considered. This thesis presents an investigation of three-dimensional wall-bounded open cavity with geometric ratio 6 : 2 : 1. To this aim, three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and global linear instability have been performed. Linear instability analysis reveals that the onset of the first instability in this open cavity is around Recr 1080. The three-dimensional shear layer mode with a complex structure is shown to be the most unstable mode. I t is noteworthy that the flow pattern of this high-frequency shear layer mode is similar to the observed unstable oscillations in supercritical unstable case. DNS of the cavity flow carried out at different Reynolds number from steady state until a nonlinear saturated state is obtained. The comparison of time histories of kinetic energy presents a clearly dominant energetic mode which shifts between low-frequency and highfrequency oscillation. A complete flow patterns from subcritical cases to supercritical case has been put in evidence. The flow structure at the supercritical case Re= 1100 resembles typical wake-shedding instability oscillations with a lateral motion existed in the subcritical cases. Also, This flow pattern is similar to the observations in experiments. In order to validate the linear instability analysis results, the topology of the composite flow fields reconstructed by linear superposition of a three-dimensional base flow and its leading three-dimensional global eigenmodes has been studied. The instantaneous wall streamlines of those composited flows display distinguish influence region of each eigenmode. Attention has been focused on the leading high-frequency shear layer mode; the composite flow fields have been fully recognized with respect to the downstream <b>wave</b> <b>shedding.</b> The three-dimensional shear layer mode is shown to give rise to a typical wake-shedding instability with a lateral motions occurring downstream which is in good agreement with the experiment results. Moreover, the spanwise-periodic, open cavity with the same length to depth ratio has been also studied. The most unstable linear mode is different from the real three-dimensional cavity flow, because of the existence of the side walls. Structure sensitivity of the unstable global mode is analyzed in the flow control context. The adjoint-based sensitivity analysis has been employed to localized the receptivity region, where the flow is more sensible to momentum forcing and mass injection. Because of the non-normality of the linearized Navier-Stokes equations, the direct and adjoint field has a large spatial separation. The strongest sensitivity region is locate in the upstream lip of the three-dimensional cavity. This numerical finding is in agreement with experimental observations.

40|$|International audienceWe {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of self-steepening and higher-order dispersion {{on the process of}} optical wave thermalization. This study is aimed at developing a thermodynamic formulation of supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers. In the highly nonlinear regime of supercontinuum generation, the optical field exhibits a turbulent dynamics that may be described by the kinetic wave theory. In this respect, the phenomenon of spectral broadening inherent to supercontinuum generation may be interpreted as a natural process of thermalization, which is characterized by an irreversible evolution of the optical field toward a thermodynamic equilibrium state. The numerical simulations show that, under certain conditions, the intensity of the field spontaneously concentrates around two specific frequencies. The theory reveals that these particular frequencies are selected {{in such a way that}} the corresponding wave packets propagate with the same group velocity, which is shown to also match the average group velocity of the optical field. This “velocity-locking” effect and the underlying process of spectral fission are interpreted in the light of a fundamental property of statistical equilibrium thermodynamics. It is shown that a velocity locking is required, in the sense that it prevents “a macroscopic internal motion in the wave system. ” Furthermore, the kinetic <b>wave</b> theory <b>sheds</b> light on the role of self-steepening in the incoherent regime of supercontinuum generation.

The tower is subjected to <b>wave,</b> current, vortex <b>shedding,</b> wind and Coriolis acceleration loads. Geometrical non-linearities as well as non-linearities due to wave drag force, which is assumed to be proportional to the square of the relative velocity between the tower and the waves, were considered. The governing coupled differential equations of motion are highly non-linear, and have time-dependent coefficients. The tower’s response to the external forces is found, that is, equilibrium position due to wind and current and response to wave excitation. Resonances (harmonic and subharmonic) and also chaotic response are investigated. Copyright 0 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{nature of}} {{turbomachinery}} flows and {{the scale of}} associated flow phenomena such as shock <b>waves</b> and vortex <b>shedding,</b> apply constraints to the methods by which the flow can be analysed experimentally. Computational techniques have quite successfully been applied to the flow around turbine blades, but the transient and periodic phenomena observed in experimental studies have not been fully investigated. In this work an original working computational code is presented for time-resolved flows around turbine cascades. The code has been verified using test cases relevant to transonic flow. Some of {{the problems associated with}} computational techniques have been highlighted; these include the large number of schemes that are available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The code has been applied to a geometry representing highly loaded turbine blading currently under study at the National Research Council of Canada; this was also used extensively in previous computational and experimental investigations. The blading chosen has a relatively thick trailing edge, necessitated by cooling considerations. A distribution of the flow properties {{on the surface of the}} blade has been determined, from which an equivalent water table model ha...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the “dead” zone of a protoplanetary disk fills with robust 3 D {{vortices}} from a purely hydrodynamic instability. This new instability is not linear and requires a weak finite-amplitude initial perturbation. The instability was not seen previously either {{due to a lack}} of numerical spatial resolution, or because many previous simulations either ignored vertical gravity or had initial flows with constant density. Our new finite-amplitude instability is due to a family of previously-unknown critical layers that form in rotating, shearing, vertically stratified flows like those in protoplanetary disks. Initial perturbations of white noise (with Mach numbers much less than unity), waves, or vortices can trigger the instability. A small-volume, small-amplitude initial vortex confined to one part of the disk can fill the disk with vortices by exciting a nearby critical layer. The critical layer produces an intense vortex layer that rolls-up to form vortices with large-amplitudes and volumes. This 1 st generation of vortices then <b>sheds</b> <b>waves</b> that excite nearby critical layers, which in turn, create a 2 nd generation of vortices with large amplitudes and volumes. The mechanism of exciting nearby critical layers and turning them into large vortices self-similarly, self-replicates until large vortices fill the disk at all radii...|$|R
40|$|Experimental infections of six {{riverbank}} {{populations of}} Galba truncatula with Fasciola hepatica {{were carried out}} {{to determine if the}} poor susceptibility of these populations to this digenean might be due to the scarcity or the absence of natural encounters between these snails and the parasite. The first three populations originated from banks frequented by cattle in the past (riverbank group) whereas the three others were living on islet banks without any known contact with local ruminants (islet group). After their exposure, all snails were placed in their natural habitats from the end of October up to their collection at the beginning of April. Compared to the riverbank group, snails, which died without cercarial shedding clearly predominated in the islet group, while the other infected snails were few in number. Most of these last snails released their cercariae during a single <b>shedding</b> <b>wave.</b> In islet snails dissected after their death, the redial and cercarial burdens were significantly lower than those noted in riverbank G. truncatula. Snails living on these islet banks are thus able to sustain larval development of F. hepatica. The modifications noted in the characteristics of snail infection suggest the existence of an incomplete adaptation between these G. truncatula and the parasite, probably due to the absence of natural contact between host and parasite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Individual infections of Egyptian and French Pseudosuccinea columella {{with five}} miracidia of Calicoph-oron daubneyi {{were carried out}} to {{determine}} whether this lymnaeid was capable of sustaining larval development of this parasite. On day 42 post-exposure (at 23 C), infected snails were only noted in groups of individuals measuring 1 or 2 mm in height at miracidial exposure. Snail survival in the 2 -mm groups {{was significantly higher than}} that noted in the 1 -mm snails, whatever the geographic origin of snail population. In contrast, prevalence of C. daubneyi infec-tion was significantly greater in the 1 -mm groups (15 – 20 % versus 3. 4 – 4. 0 % in the 2 -mm snails). Low values were noted for the mean shell growth of infected snails at their death (3. 1 – 4. 0 mm) and the mean number of cercariae (< 9 in the 1 -mm groups, < 19 in the 2 -mm snails). No significant differences between snail populations and snails groups were noted for these last two parameters. Most infected snails died after a single cercarial <b>shedding</b> <b>wave.</b> Both populations of P. columella showed an age resistance to C. daubneyi infection and only juveniles measuring 2 mm or less in shell height at exposure can ensure larval development of this digenean up to cercarial shedding...|$|R
40|$|Bubble sweep-down is a {{significant}} issue for the oceanographic vessels, which affect the acoustic sur- veys. Experimental trials, {{carried out in the}} Ifremerwave and current circulating tank on a 1 / 30 model of the Pourquoi pas?, are presented. The results demonstrate that this kind of experimental facility is well suited to study the phenomenon of bubble sweep-down encountered around the bow of a ship under specific conditions. From these results, two kinds of bubble clouds formation have been observed and analysed: bubble clouds generated by vortex <b>shedding</b> and breaking <b>waves.</b> The vortex <b>shedding</b> bubble clouds appear randomly in all the configurations tested, even without waves or motions. This phe- nomenon is due to the interaction between the turbulent flow and the specific bow shape of the Pourquoi pas?. On the other hand, the breaking wave clouds appear in the presence of relative motions between the free surface and the bow ship and more significantly under wave sollicitations. A complementary paper presents a parametric study carried out to quantify the influence of the test conditions. The authors gratefully acknowledge the DGA (the French Government Agency for Defense) and Ifremer for the financial support of co-financed PhD theses. We also would like to thank Thomas Bacchetti and Jean-Valery Facq for their assistance in the design and set-up of these experiments...|$|R
