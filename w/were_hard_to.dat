5|$|From 1929 to 1934 {{she studied}} at Columbia University, where Edward Kasner stoked an {{interest}} in mathematics, and co-authored Way's first published academic paper. She graduated with her BS in 1932. She next went to the University of North Carolina, where John Wheeler stimulated {{an interest in}} nuclear physics, and she became his first PhD student. Because jobs <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> come by during the Great Depression, she stayed on {{as a graduate student}} after completing the requirements of her PhD.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{was back}} where he started. Park's {{handling}} of the actions was a masterpiece of aggressive defence, yet he was not under the same pressure {{as he had been}} in the battles during August when air battles were so confusing they <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> control. A big set-piece offensive played into his hands.|$|E
5|$|After a poor debut {{season for}} Victoria, Harvey did not gain {{first-class}} selection in 1948–49 and vacancies <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> come by {{as the season}} was purely domestic with no touring Test team, so all of Australia's international representatives were available for the whole season. Harvey was selected for a Second XI match against New South Wales but failed to make an impact, scoring two runs in each innings as the Victorians completed a 195-run win. Harvey took the wicket of H Hinman in the first innings, ending with 1/24 from four overs.|$|E
50|$|Membrane {{proteins}} <b>are</b> inherently <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> design, {{in large}} part because it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> validate the designs experimentally for several reasons. Membrane proteins <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> purify. Their structure <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> characterize because they adopt their native conformation only {{in the presence of a}} membrane. Crystallization <b>is</b> inherently <b>hard,</b> and NMR studies of membrane proteins can fail because of their size.|$|R

5|$|By the 1990s, new {{historical}} research (especially by Air Force historians Earl Tilford, Bernard Nalty, and Jacob Van Staaveren) and the publications of the Military Institute of Vietnam finally opened new perspectives on aerial interdiction during the Vietnam War. During Commando Hunt for example, the Air Force claimed that 46,000 PAVN trucks {{had been destroyed}} or damaged by air strikes in Laos. These figures <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> reconcile with the 6,000 trucks imported annually into North Vietnam between 1965 and 1970 – {{for all of its}} operations. American claims that 80 percent of the materiel that started down the trail was destroyed while en route to the southern battlefields had to be altered in the face of loss claims of only 15 percent by the Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|Equipping the Salt Wells Pilot Plant {{involved}} its own challenges. Some facilities {{had to be}} fabricated for the purpose. Some items <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> locate, {{while others}} were in short supply in the wartime economy. The Manhattan Project's overriding priority overcame this problem. In some cases, the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them for use by Project Camel. Groves felt that his fears about excessive safety were realized: reinforced concrete, blast proof doors and electrical shielding drove up costs. In the end, after 115 days, the first explosives were melted, mixed and poured on 25 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|Georgine Milmine {{was born}} in Ontario, Canada. Before joining McClure's as a researcher, she worked for the Syracuse Herald in New York. She had been {{collecting}} material about Eddy for years—newspaper articles from the 1880s, court records, and a first edition of Science and Health, all of which <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> obtain—but lacked the resources to check and write it up herself, so she sold it to McClure's. Apparently when McClure's was sold, the new publisher threw away the research, including the first edition.|$|E

5|$|On 13 October {{the weather}} was more {{uncooperative}} than on the previous day. Even though a wider array of targets {{was assigned to the}} task groups, from the Pescadores to northern Luzon and Formosa, far fewer enemies were encountered in the air. Results of the day's strike operations <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> ascertain due to the overcast. Pilots' reports from these two days of strikes helped uncover a larger network of air bases on Formosa than previously anticipated. This knowledge, combined with radio intercepts and the dusk strikes fended off the previous evening, led Commander Task Force 38 Mitscher to cancel any strikes scheduled to take off after 14:00 hours. Instead, the task groups prepared to defend against another night assault.|$|E

5|$|When it {{came time}} to kill off Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time to}} create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E
5|$|Winton {{organised}} {{the transfer}} of the children from the Nazi-appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain, in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure, and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children. Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland. For each child to be accepted, British officials required a confirmed foster home and a £50 guarantee. Winton returned to Great Britain in March to arrange the reception of the children, but his task was hampered {{by the fact that the}} domestic evacuation of children was already occurring, and places <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Young {{became an}} {{industrial}} research chemist, {{working in the}} lacquer industry at Van Schaack Brothers Chemical Works in Chicago. In 1930, she became {{an assistant professor of}} chemistry at Texas State College for Women, where she taught nutrition and biochemistry. In 1934, she resigned to take up an offer from Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, but when she arrived the director found out that she was a woman, and refused to hire her. Jobs <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> find during the Great Depression, and she was a consultant with no regular employment until 1938, when she took a position with Pure Oil. There she worked with Cary R. Wagner, Jr., on a book on petroleum refining. The project went on for six years, but it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, and the book was never published.|$|E

5|$|Though the Teton Range {{was never}} {{permanently}} inhabited, pioneers began settling the Jackson Hole valley {{to the east}} of the range in 1884. These earliest homesteaders were mostly single men who endured long winters, short growing seasons and rocky soils that <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> cultivate. The region was mostly suited for the cultivation of hay and cattle ranching. By 1890, Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60. Menor's Ferry was built in 1892 near present-day Moose, Wyoming to provide access for wagons to {{the west side of the}} Snake River. Ranching increased significantly from 1900 to 1920, but a series of agricultural related economic downturns in the early 1920s left many ranchers destitute. Beginning in the 1920s, the automobile provided faster and easier access to areas of natural beauty and old military roads into Jackson Hole over Teton and Togwotee Passes were improved to accommodate the increased vehicle traffic. In response to the increased tourism, dude ranches were established, some new and some from existing cattle ranches, so urbanized travelers could experience the life of a cattleman.|$|E
5|$|During {{its initial}} development, Versus XIII used Crystal Tools, a {{proprietary}} game engine created by Square Enix for seventh-generation gaming hardware {{that would be}} used throughout the company for multiple games, including XIII and Final Fantasy XIV. Later, Tabata described the Crystal Tools hardware {{as an extension of the}} technology of the previous gaming generation. During 2010, Nomura revealed that the team were using read world-based physical calculations to determine weather and cloud behavior in-game. By 2011, Nomura announced that the game was no longer using Crystal Tools, and instead used a specially designed proprietary gameplay engine combined by lighting technology from Luminous Studio, an engine built for eighth-generation gaming hardware. The focus on realism influenced the decision to incorporate the more advanced lighting technology, while the specially designed engine had a limited area of use. The planned scale of the open world increased so much that the older technology eventually became obsolete as it was restricting the developers. The need to create new technology to cope with these problems further added to initial development difficulties. The original plan was to have interactive real-time event scenes. Nomura felt that regular storytelling cutscenes in other games interrupted gameplay and caused players to skip them. Furthermore, the development frame could theoretically be shortened as there was no need to create cutscenes-exclusive high-polygon character models. However, seamless transitions of these events into the gameplay <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> achieve and instead increased the time that had to be invested by the team. After the full shift onto eighth-generation platforms, multiple planned elements were influenced by the new Luminous technology: the in-game cutscene camera was optimized to work similarly to the one used in pre-rendered movies, and more environmental and gameplay elements could be included such as an increased number of destructible environments and the player character's warping to faraway spots on the game maps. It also enabled Nomura to start experimenting with higher facial detail for enemies such as behemoths.|$|E
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} set {{detailed requirements}} for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, {{particularly if they}} rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces <b>were</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> break off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a sounding line with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand.|$|E
