The science team studying WASP-15 found that, after running best-fit models, WASP-15's radial velocity and transit shifts <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> due {{to the existence of}} a planet.|$|E
5|$|All {{recipes are}} written in the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form {{that would not have}} been used to address a person of high rank. The instructions <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E
5|$|The Lincolnshire and Yorkshire Wolds {{around the}} Humber Estuary were settled and farmed in the Bronze Age, and the Ferriby Boats – {{one of the}} best-preserved finds of the era – were {{discovered}} near Hull in 1937. In the more mountainous regions of the Peak District, hillforts were the main Bronze Age settlement and the locals <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> pastoralists raising livestock.|$|E

5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> {{aware of}} her writing, {{it was not until}} after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Beetle-pollinated {{flowers are}} usually large, greenish or off-white in color, and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to {{decaying}} organic material. Beetles <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> the first insects to pollinate flowers. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, {{although they may}} include traps to keep the beetle longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators. The beetle families that habitually pollinate flowers are the Buprestidae, Cantharidae, Carambycidae, Cleridae, Dermestidae, Lycidae, Melyridae, Mordellidae, Nitidulidae and Scarabeidae. Beetles may be particularly important {{in some parts of}} the world such as semiarid areas of southern Africa and southern California and the montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Little Applegate River {{watershed}} for approximately 11,000 years, based on Clovis points discovered in the area. The first inhabitants <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> the Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede tribes of Native Americans, descendants of the first humans who traveled across the Bering land bridge from Siberia. They fished for salmon, trout, and lamprey, and hunted for deer and elk. They also often set fires to clear brush from prairies and oak savannas, and to promote the growth of certain crops. The fires were limited by the Native Americans, creating a patchwork of burned and unburned land, thus increasing the biodiversity of the watershed.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{at what point}} among the extant fragments the division between books 1 and 2 fell, but {{at least some of}} the Aeolid families were covered in the second book. The families of Perieres, Deion and Sisyphus (in that order) <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> found in the 2nd book because there does not appear to be enough room left in book 1 to accommodate them as a group after the children of Neleus and Pelias. It was once thought that the Ehoie of Atalanta opened the book, but recently published evidence casts doubt upon this view (see Book 3, below).|$|E
5|$|On 16 October, Kennedy was {{informed}} that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, {{could come up with}} no way of doing this that would not appear weak. On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|One {{can also}} {{calculate}} auto fatalities per driver's license. From 1990 to 2009, this number {{has also been}} improving: from 1 death per 3,745 driver's licenses in 1990 to 1 per 6,200 driver's licenses in 2009. Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to have car accidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through its Fatality Analysis Reporting System stated that auto fatalities {{continue to be the}} leading cause of death for young adults.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} tournament ended, the ICC {{announced}} that the World Cups in 2015 and 2019 would contain ten teams; the Associate countries, who <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to miss out in a tournament with fewer teams strongly objected, and, led by Ireland, urged the ICC to reconsider. In June the decision was reversed. After the World Cup Ireland played Pakistan, England, and Scotland in ODIs but lost each match. A further ODI against Sri Lanka was rained off. In all, Ireland played 12ODIs in 2011, winning four.|$|E
5|$|Some {{specimens}} of M. yaotunensis preserve {{traces of the}} reddish brown pigment protoporphyrin and the blue-green pigment biliverdin, the same pigments used in the eggs of many modern birds. The eggs <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> an intense blue-green color, {{as shown by the}} predominance of biliverdin in the shell. The purpose of the coloration is uncertain, but in modern birds it can serve as coloration or as a post-mating sexual signal. Colored eggs are also correlated with active paternal care in modern birds, lending further support to the hypothesis that oviraptorid males cared for their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The Gnome Motion Picture Company was a film {{production}} {{company that is}} credited with three productions between 1910 and 1911. The purpose of the company to was to produce stories about gnomes. Alice in Funnyland, The Birth of the Gnomes and Alice's New Year's Party were all productions that <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> never released. Announcements in trade publications ceased in January 1911 and the company treasurer, Frederick Kalmbach, was later sued by the City of New York for taxes. Of the three planned productions, two official synopses were released in The Nickelodeon. Despite no evidence of an actual release, the American Film Institute still recognizes all three films as being released in January 1911.|$|E

5|$|The life {{habits of}} Ypresiomyrma {{would have been}} {{similar to that of}} extant Myrmeciinae ants. Colonies nested in the soil or in trees, making them an {{arboreal}} nesting species. Workers <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto low vegetation and trees while preying on arthropods or consuming nectar. Workers most likely did not recruit or lead nestmates to food sources, nor did workers lay down pheromone trails. Ypresiomyrma ants most likely used their large eyes to find prey and for navigational purposes.|$|E
5|$|Clan chieftains, like clan chiefs, may {{wear their}} own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their own motto or slogan. Clan chieftains may also wear two small eagle feathers (unlike the chief's three). On certain occasions real eagle feathers may be worn behind the crest badge. If a clan chieftain {{is a member of}} the British Peerage or a feudal baron they are permitted to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge. Recently feudal barons have taken to wearing two eagle feathers behind their armiger's badge but there is no ancient tradition of this and it is solely based upon the fact that anciently feudal barons <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> to have been chiefs or chieftains. If the feudal baron is a member of a clan it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief who approves the number of feathers worn by members of the clan.|$|E
5|$|In December 1943, {{following}} official protests, the Japanese government {{issued a}} statement formally denying responsibility for the sinking of Centaur. Records provided by the Japanese following the war also did not acknowledge responsibility. Although Centaurs sinking was a war crime, no one was tried for sinking the hospital ship. Investigations into the attack were conducted between 1944 and 1948, and included the interrogation of the commanders of the submarines operating in Australian waters at the time, their superiors, plus junior officers and crewmen from the submarines who had survived the war. Several of the investigators suspected that Nakagawa and I-177 <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> responsible, but {{they were unable to}} establish this beyond reasonable doubt, and the Centaur case file was closed on 14 December 1948 without any charges laid.|$|E

5|$|In medieval Europe, {{any effort}} to halt {{pregnancy}} was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church, although {{it is believed that}} women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina. Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy. The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640. They were made of animal gut, and <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> used {{to prevent the spread of}} sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War. Casanova, living in 18th century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a popular}} myth that {{so-called}} murder-holes– openings in {{the ceiling of the}} gateway passage– were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was impractical. This method was, however, a common practice in the MENA region and the Mediterranean castles and fortifications where such resources were abundant. They <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> used to drop objects on attackers, or to allow water to be poured on fires to extinguish them. Provision was made in the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation so the gate was never left undefended, although this arrangement later evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of defence.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{continue}} to debate whether Chacoan organization {{was based on}} primarily political or primarily ritual considerations. Archeological {{evidence suggests that the}} residents of great houses like Chetro Ketl were of a higher social class than those living in smaller settlements, which may indicate a systemic inequality that is considered a hallmark of hierarchal political systems. Others view Chaco as an egalitarian society, with an economy driven by its function as the region's ceremonial center. Because there has been little to no modern excavation in the canyon, the question remains largely unanswered. Lynne Sebastian suggests that any analysis based on a strict dichotomy of ritual versus political purpose is inherently misguided, because the Chacoans <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> deeply influenced by both.|$|E
