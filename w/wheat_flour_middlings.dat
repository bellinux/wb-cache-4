Compositions (kg/head/d) of low (LS) and high silage diets (HS) were the following: maize silage 3. 0 vs 10. 5; alfalfa hay 0 vs 2. 0; barley 0. 25 vs 0. 75; <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> <b>middlings</b> 1. 0 vs 1. 0; wheat straw 3. 0 vs 0; commercial concentrate for lactating buffalo cows 0 vs 2. 5; commercial concentrate for young buffalo bulls 4. 5 vs 0. The diets were approximately isoenergetic [0. 92 vs 0. 91 Milk FU/kg dry matter (DM) ] and isonitrogenous (14. 7 vs 14. 7 CP% DM). Fourteen young buffalo bulls (316 ± 70 days of age and 436 ± 67 kglive weight) were assigned into the two dietary groups. Average daily gain (ADG) was calculated every 2 weeks, along with DM intake (DMI), calculated on pen basis. On a subgroup of 4 individuals per groups, carcass traits were recorded at slaughter. Meat quality (hardness, cohesion, chewiness, WB shear force) and meat colour (L*, a*, b*) were evaluated on 7 -day aged muscles (Longissimus dorsi, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus). DMI and carcass traits were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. ADG and meat quality parameters were analyzed by a linear mixed model for repeated measures. No differences were observed for diet DMI (8. 41 vs 8. 64 kg DM/day for LS and HS diets, respectively; SE 0. 44), as a consequence ADG did not differ between the groups (0. 92 vs 0. 89 kg/day; SE 0. 04). All carcasses had the same carcass conformation (O) and fatness (4) scores. No differences were observed for carcass traits (carcass weight 250 vs 249 kg; SE 8. 13; dressing percentages 52. 1 vs 50. 6 %; SE 1. 1) and any meat quality parameters. Therefore, maize silage can be either used as the primary source of roughage or in combination with other forages without affecting growth performance and meat quality...|$|E

40|$|Background: E {{valuation}} of foods protein quality {{is of great}} importance for their biological and economical impacts. Different biological, microbiological, chemical and combined methods have been introduced and used to determine this item. Among these True Protein Digestibility (TPD) has been suggested as an appropriate method for the determination of protein quality. Considering the importance of protein quality in foods, especially in low income families, {{this study was designed}} to evaluate TPD of <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> and <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> mixture plus soy protein in comparison with casein standard protein in Kashan in 2003. Materials and Methods: This e xperimental study was carried out on 32 male Wistar rats, aged 21 days under 4 regimens including <b>wheat</b> <b>flour,</b> and <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> plus soy protein as case group, casein+methionine (standard) and protein free (basal) diets in order to determine TPD. The period of study for TPD was 9 days. To calculate TPD, nitrogen intake and fecal nitrogen were determined and TPD of the group casein+methionine with <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> and <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> mixture plus soy protein were analyzed using t-test. Results: TPD was 93. 4 ± 2. 3, 93. 9 ± 3. 6 and 80. 3 ± 5. 9 for casein+methionin, <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> and <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> mixture with soy (P<. 0001) respectively.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryYong Cheng ShiTo {{realize the}} full {{potential}} of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> in food applications, six advanced hard waxy wheat lines were studied. Pasting properties of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> {{as well as}} factors governing the pasting properties were investigated. Waxy wheat starch granules swelled more extensively and were more prone to α-amylase degradation than normal wheat starch. A combination of endogenous α-amylase activity and protein matrix contributed to a large variation of pasting properties of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours.</b> Bi-axial extension properties classified dough from waxy wheat as in-elastic. Waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> had higher water absorption and lower mixing time than normal <b>wheat</b> <b>flour.</b> Waxy <b>wheat</b> starch affected protein hydration but not protein extractability after optimum dough mixing. Presence of some non-protein free thiol contents and some gliadins acting as chain terminators could be the underlying reasons for waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> producing slack dough. In an effort to improve functionality of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours,</b> hydro-thermal processing was used. Two temperatures (140 and 160 °C), three moisture contents (0, 12. 4 and 20 %), and four exposure times (0, 5, 15, 30 and 60 min) were employed. Hydrothermal processing resulted in non-cohesive waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> with high viscosity and greater acid stability than native waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flour.</b> A closer investigation revealed the possible role of endosperm proteins in improving pasting properties of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours.</b> Upon thermal processing, waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> demonstrated a long hydration time before forming dough. Heating decreased protein solubility while no changes in starch molecular weight distribution were observed. Our results indicate that hydro-thermal processing results in increased starch protein interaction. As part of application of waxy wheat, bread was baked by replacing normal <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> with two hard waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> at 15, 30, and 45 % levels. Substitution with waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> resulted in higher loaf volume and softer loaves.

Factors Governing Pasting Properties of Waxy <b>Wheat</b> <b>Flours.</b> Cereal Chemistry, 92 (5), 529 - 535. doi: 10. 1094 /cchem- 10 - 14 - 0209 -rWaxy wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) {{contains}} endosperm starch {{lacking in}} amylose. To realize the full potential of waxy wheat, the pasting properties of hard waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> {{as well as}} factors governing the pasting properties were investigated and compared with normal and partial waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours.</b> Starches isolated from six hard waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> had similar pasting properties, yet their corresponding flours had very different pasting properties. The differences in pasting properties were narrowed after endogenous alpha-amylase activity in waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours</b> was inhibited by silver nitrate. Upon treatment with protease, the extent of protein digestibility influenced the viscosity profile in waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours.</b> Waxy <b>wheat</b> starch granules swelled extensively when heated in water and exhibited a high peak viscosity, but they fragmented at high temperatures, resulting in more rapid breakdown in viscosity. The extensively swelled and fragmented waxy wheat starch granules were more susceptible to a-amylase degradation than normal wheat starch. A combination of endogenous a-amylase activity and protein matrix contributed to a large variation in pasting properties of waxy <b>wheat</b> <b>flours...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractWheat {{is one of}} {{the most}} common cereals used in the world. However, due to greater public {{awareness}} of celiac disease and gluten intolerance as well as consumers demands for healthy food and variety in food products, in many widely consumed staples, such as bread, <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> is fully or partially replaced with flour from other cereals, pseudocereals or legumes. Although <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> alternatives are readily available in the market, these products are often of inferior quality. The aim of this paper was to predict the suitability of alternative crops such as rice, corn, buckwheat, amaranth and soya for the production of quality bread. Their rheological properties were studied, and compared to the properties of <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> which served as a benchmark. The tested alternative cereals, pseudocereals and legumes were selected in order to represent the widely used ones in gluten-free products as well as the ones found to be nutritionally improved according to recent publications. Moreover, the differences between <b>wheat</b> and buckwheat <b>flour,</b> and their wholegrain counterparts were also studied. The determination of rheological properties of <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> dough as well as the dough from other raw materials (rice, corn, buckwheat, amaranth and soya) was performed by Mixolab. According to results obtained by Mixolab measurements, flours from different raw materials exhibited Mixolab profiles which greatly differ from <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> profile. Samples of rice and both types of buckwheat flour expressed the most similar rheological behaviour to <b>wheat</b> <b>flour.</b> However, since, there was no tested material which exactly mimic <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> dough properties, it was concluded that their mixtures would give the optimal rheological profile. Although it is a very challenging task to mimic <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> unique breadmaking properties, it is possible to create products having similar rheological behaviour to <b>wheat</b> <b>flour</b> dough, but improved functional properties...|$|R
