40|$|Objective: We {{examined}} (a) {{the demographic}} and clinical correlates of <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia in adult {{family members of}} adults with diabetes, and (b) the association of these worries with measures of diabetes support. Methods: The second multinational Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs (DAWN 2) study cross-sectionally surveyed 2057 family members from 17 countries. Participants completed questions about demographics, diabetes, and psychosocial functioning, including <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia. Analyses included hierarchical ordinal and linear regression. Results: Eighty-five percent of family members (n = 1661) were at least occasionally very <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the risk of hypoglycemic events overall. Correlates of <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia included female gender, higher age and lower education in the family member, younger age of the person with diabetes and this person being a parent or another adult (versus spouse or partner), insulin or non-insulin injectable treatment, severe or non-severe hypoglycemia in the past 12 months, and family member recognition of hypoglycemia. Elevated <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia had a significant independent association with increased odds of diabetes-related family arguments and family member frustration in providing helpful support (OR range 1. 60 – 3. 72). High levels of <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia <b>were</b> associated with increased odds of attending diabetes-related health-care visits. <b>Worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia <b>were</b> not associated with family member involvement in diabetes care. Similar results <b>were</b> found for <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> nocturnal events. Conclusion: <b>Worries</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia <b>were</b> common in family members and were associated with suboptimal diabetes support. This issue therefore deserves increased clinician attention...|$|R
