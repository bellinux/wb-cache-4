5|$|Defence against torpedo boats was {{provided}} by eight QF 6-pounder guns, although the exact type of gun is not known.

Hood also mounted a dozen QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns mounted in the superstructure and fighting tops. Like her sisters, the ship <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with seven 18-inch Torpedo tubes. Two of these were mounted in the bow below the waterline, four were placed in the sides of the hull, two on each broadside, and one in the stern. These last five tubes were all above water.

5|$|Each module <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with {{external}} components {{specific to the}} experiments that were carried out within that module, the most obvious being the Travers antenna mounted to Priroda. This synthetic aperture radar consisted of a large dish-like framework mounted outside the module, with associated equipment within, used for Earth observations experiments, as was {{most of the other}} equipment on Priroda, including various radiometers and scan platforms. Kvant-2 also featured several scan platforms and <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a mounting bracket to which the cosmonaut manoeuvring unit, or Ikar, was mated. This backpack was designed to assist cosmonauts in moving around the station and the planned Buran {{in a manner similar to}} the US Manned Maneuvering Unit, but it was only used once, during EO-5.|$|E

5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were introduced}} throughout the Merlin range: 1943 saw {{the introduction of}} a Bendix-Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at 5 pounds per square inch (34kPa; 0.34 bar) through a nozzle directly into the supercharger, and <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> to Merlin 66, 70, 76, 77 and 85 variants. The final development, which <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> to the 100-series Merlins, was an S.U. injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures.|$|E
5|$|Havelock was {{completed}} without a director-control tower (DCT) so the three remaining 4.7-inch low-angle guns fired in local control using ranges {{provided by a}} rangefinder. She <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with an ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water.|$|E

5|$|Hesperus was {{completed}} without a director-control tower (DCT) so the three remaining 4.7-inch low-angle guns fired in local control using ranges {{provided by a}} rangefinder. She <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with an ASDIC set to detect submarines by reflections from sound waves beamed into the water.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the car <b>was</b> <b>fitted</b> with a GPS {{tracking}} device, and the Astoria-Warrenton Chamber of Commerce makes {{location information}} {{available to the public}} on its website. The data is updated online every two minutes while the trolley is running.|$|E
