40|$|The imitating {{model of}} the system of loose {{material}} automated batching, including the robust system of engine control of auger feeder has been considered. The model is described in space of conditions by means of the programming language MATLAB, the interface of S-functions and the Simulink environment. The Kalman filter is used for noise filtration in the channel of measurement. Graphic representation of modeling results proves adequacy of the imitating batching model, the efficiency of the method of regulator parameter retuning and expediency of using the algorithm of measured signal filtration. A weight error at parametrical indignations influence on the <b>worm</b> <b>feeder</b> engine without retuning regulator parameters amounts to 0, 3 kg (+ 3 %) at the set 10 kg, and with retuning regulator parameters amounts 0, 01 kg (+ 0, 1 %) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{appreciate}} {{the efforts of}} many of you that are helping to monitor corn for western bean cutworm (WBC) damage and notify us of counties not previously infested. The follow-ing map shows the known distribution of larvae and damage so far in 2009. Please let us know if you find an infestation in a county not yet identified. It is likely that damaged ears will be noticed near, or at, the time of harvest by producers. At that time, with worms absent, it cannot be certain that other <b>worm</b> <b>feeders,</b> e. g., corn earworm, fall armyworm, didn’t cause that damage. Therefore, our time for confirming WBC damage is soon ending, as mature larvae drop from the plant and burrow into the soil for overwintering. Remember: the damage alone is NOT diagnostic and infestations are extremely patchy so a good subsampling of different field areas is essential. By far, the highest, and most severe infestations of WBC have been in sandier soil areas. However, this past week we have been made of aware of fields with silty-loam soils also with significant infestations. Next summer’s moth flight num-bers may help us ascertain whether larvae in these heavier soils were able to successfully overwinter. If you are inter-ested in tracking this moth next summer with a pheromone trap, please let us know. Known counties with WBC infestation...|$|R
50|$|Many acorn <b>worms</b> are {{detritus}} <b>feeders,</b> eating sand or mud and extracting organic detritus. Others feed on {{organic material}} {{suspended in the}} water, which they can draw into the mouth using the cilia on the gill bars. A groove lined with cilia lies {{just in front of}} the mouth and directs suspended food into the mouth and may allow the animal to taste.|$|R
50|$|Phoronis {{is one of}} the two genera of the {{horseshoe}} worm family (Phoronidae), in the phylum Phoronida. The {{body has}} two sections, each with its own coelom. There is a specialist feeding structure, the lophophore, which is an extension of the wall of the coelom and is surrounded by tentacles. The gut is U-shaped. The diagnostic feature that distinguishes this genus is the lack of epidermal invagination {{at the base of the}} lophophore. These <b>worms</b> are filter <b>feeders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chaetopterus or the {{parchment}} worm or parchment tube worm is a genus of marine polychaete worm {{that lives in}} a tube it constructs in sediments or attaches to a rocky or coral reef substrate. The common name arises from {{the parchment}}-like appearance of the tubes that house these worms. Parchment tube <b>worms</b> are filter <b>feeders</b> and spend their adult lives in their tubes, unless the tube is damaged or destroyed. They are planktonic in their juvenile forms, as is typical for polychaete annelids. Species include the recently discovered deep water Chaetopterus pugaporcinus and the well-studied Chaetopterus variopedatus.|$|R
40|$|Orbinia johnsoni {{were studied}} {{from a small}} sandy beach near Mussel Pt., Pacific Grove, California, where they are most {{abundant}} at low tide levels in fine sand. They {{were found to have}} a mean length of 190 mm. The orbiniids were found with their guts the fullest during incoming to high tides. It is plausible that this is when they are feeding. It takes about 3 to 3. 5 hours for food to travel through the length fo the gut. The orbiniids eat 93 percent sand and seven percent organic detritus. Special note should be taken that some food selectivity appears to be involved and that high percentages of organic matter in the feces are found in worms collected during low, outgoing tides. Evidence suggests that the <b>worms</b> are bottom <b>feeders,</b> not coming to the surface to feed...|$|R
