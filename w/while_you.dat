We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, and once in a <b>while</b> <b>you</b> see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E

25|$|Aspect {{is unusual}} in ASL in that {{transitive}} verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity.

25|$|For Kangaroo Books (their logo looked amazingly {{like that}} of America's Pocket Books), McLoughlin painted a few {{paperback}} covers but primarily produced joke books. The publisher paid £18 each for these which included writing about 50 jokes, illustrating them, and producing the cover. After doing the first joke book, probably Laughter for the Home Front, solo, McLoughlin enlisted the aid of his brother Colin (b. 2 November 1925) with the writing chore. Thus began a working relationship between the McLoughlin brothers that would last at least into the 1950s and that produced New Laughs for All, Laugh <b>While</b> <b>You</b> Work, You've Had It, and This Is It for Kangaroo.|$|E

25|$|The {{amount of}} {{redundancy}} {{is based on}} a length of service calculation and age. For each year you have worked <b>while</b> <b>you</b> were under 21 years old, you get half a week's pay. For each year between ages 21 and 40, one week's pay. For each year over 40, one and a half week's pay (s.162). However, there is an upper limit set on what can be considered a week's pay, which is approximately the same as a week on the minimum wage (if you were made redundant on or before 31 January 2011, it was £380 per week - from 1 February 2011 to 31 January 2012, it was £400 - currently it is £450, before tax).|$|E
25|$|Historian J.M. Andre {{concludes that}} the {{original}} sense of otium was related to military service and the idleness {{that happened in the}} winter, as opposed to the business (negotium) {{of the rest of the}} year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual otium. Andre shows that the beauty of the individual otium poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play Mercator says that <b>while</b> <b>you</b> are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).|$|E
25|$|A magic {{ring that}} {{provides}} invulnerability to death is encountered {{not only in}} this tale of Sir Eglamour of Artois. In a 12th-century romance Floris and Blancheflour, Floris's mother gives her son a ring when he departs, disguised as a merchant, {{to look for the}} maiden Blancheflour, whose tomb he has just seen to be empty. ‘Take this ring, son. <b>While</b> <b>you</b> are wearing it, you need fear nothing. Fire will not burn you, the sea will not drown you and steel {{will not be able to}} cut you,' she urges him. And the boy Perceval, in the Middle English romance Sir Perceval of Galles, steals a ring from the finger of a sleeping maiden, and only after having travelled to a Land of Maidens and defeated an entire Saracen army singlehandedly, does he learn that it is a magic ring that confers invulnerability to its wearer. In the late-14th century Middle English alliterative poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Sir Gawain refuses the offer of a ring from Sir Bertilak's amorous wife before accepting, instead, another circular adornment, a girdle, that will protect him from ever being killed, and which he wears when he goes to suffer a return stroke of the axe from the Knight of the Green Chapel.|$|E

500|$|When it came {{to writing}} [...] "Happy Working Song", Menken and Schwartz were {{directly}} influenced by the song [...] "Whistle <b>While</b> <b>You</b> Work" [...] from Disney's first full-length animated feature film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), with Schwartz describing [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] as a [...] "spoof" [...] and [...] "one of the funniest sequences of the film". According to Schwartz, [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] was written rather quickly, having come [...] " [...] really fast". Schwartz elaborated, [...] "'Happy Working Song' is... pretty much out of Snow White and 'Whistle <b>While</b> <b>You</b> Work' and that little thing where they do the dishes and Dopey with the soap bubbles and everything." [...] In addition to this, [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] features references to both the musical number [...] "The Work Song" [...] and [...] "the busy little mice" [...] from Disney's Cinderella (1950), but to a significantly lesser extent. Lyrically, Schwartz decided to approach the song comically as demonstrated by its phrase [...] "Even though you are vermin." ...|$|E

500|$|A guest {{appearance}} by English actor and comedian Steve Coogan as Rowan Priddis, {{the director of}} the cruise, is also featured. In the episode, when the Simpsons are having dinner at the restaurant on the ship, the character makes a stage performance of a song called [...] "Enjoy It <b>While</b> <b>You</b> Can" [...] that prompts Bart to make sure the cruise lasts forever. This song was a contribution by [...] Broadway composer and lyricist Robert Lopez, who produced it in New York City in 2011 for the episode. Coogan recorded the song in New York as well. The writers of the show provided Lopez their suggestion for the song's lyrics, which [...] "he then tweaked", according to William Keck of TV Guide. Lopez told Keck that he and the Simpsons staff decided to create something [...] "cheesy that actually could be performed on a cruise ship. We went in a Carnival Cruise, 'Feelin' Hot Hot Hot' direction." [...] According to The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma, Lopez produced [...] "Enjoy It <b>While</b> <b>You</b> Can" [...] with a [...] "synthesizer band" [...] and The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen [...] "added a Vegas-style house orchestra arrangement for the final version." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Happy Working Song" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} {{composer}} Alan Menken and lyricist Stephen Schwartz for Walt Disney Pictures' musical film Enchanted (2007).

Similarly, Todd McCarthy of Variety called [...] "Happy Working Song" [...] "a hilarious variation on 'Whistle <b>While</b> <b>You</b> Work'". Sun Media's Kevin Williamson hailed the musical number {{as one of the}} film's [...] "stand-outs", elaborating, [...] "Happy Working Song a crowd-pleaser." [...] The Mountain Xpress Ken Hanke allotted particular praise to Adams', writing that when the actress is [...] "singing her 'Happy Working Song' with her makeshift 'forest friends'... she is the perfect cartoon heroine made flesh".
