25|$|The {{state of}} the art in sensory {{intelligence}} for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E
500|$|Fischer {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} play in the Third Lessing J. Rosenwald Trophy Tournament in New York City (1956), a premier tournament limited to the 12 players considered the best in the country. Although Fischer's rating was not among the top 12 in the country, he received entry by special consideration. Playing against top opposition, the 13-year-old Fischer could only score 4½/11, tying for 8–9th place. Yet, he won the [...] for his immortal game against International Master Donald Byrne, in which Fischer sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack. Hans Kmoch called it [...] "The Game of the Century", writing: [...] "The following game, a stunning masterpiece of [...] play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies". According to Frank Brady, The Game of the Century' has been talked about, analyzed, and admired for more than fifty years, and it <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> part of the canon of chess for many years to come." [...] "In reflecting on his game a while after it occurred, Bobby was refreshingly modest: 'I just made the moves I thought were best. I was just lucky.|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy's Lewis Corner {{gave the}} song a four (out of five)-star rating, and wrote that its {{production}} {{was of a}} [...] "summer anthem level". Corner said the track felt [...] "slightly lighter" [...] than Azalea's previous releases, adding: [...] "... but if it means she crosses over into superstardom territory, it's a job well done". While Robert Copsey of the same website believed that it [...] "felt like a somewhat needless moment of pop frivolity". Complex reviewers were also divided; Brian Josephs considered the track a [...] " [...] club banger", but David Drake criticized Azalea's [...] "nimble rapping and forced accent". According to Drake, [...] " [...] {{is the kind of}} thing that might work in the UK, where a digitally-animated frog once had a No. 1 hit with a cover of the theme to Beverly Hills Cop, but this <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> long shot at getting stateside club play". John Robinson of The Guardian felt it was [...] "second-division" [...] and [...] "sheeeeeit". Karen Lawler of Blues & Soul opined that it recalled [...] "a lost track" [...] from Miley Cyrus' 2013 album, Bangerz, and dismissed its [...] "nod" [...] to 2 Unlimited as [...] "cringe worthy". While Clash called [...] "Bounce" [...] an inferior version of [...] "No Limit" [...] and [...] "criminal in every way", and opined that it lacked tune; [...] "No Auto-Tune, though, because you need a tune to Auto".|$|E

500|$|Science {{fiction writers}} had {{a range of}} {{reactions}} to the film. Ray Bradbury praised the film's photography, but disliked the banality {{of most of the}} dialogue, and believed that the audience does not care when Poole dies. Both he and Lester del Rey were put off by the film's feeling of sterility and blandness in all the human encounters amidst all the technological wonders, while both praised the pictorial element of the film. Del Rey was especially harsh, describing the film as dull, confusing, and boring, predicting [...] "t <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> box-office disaster, too, and thus set major science-fiction movie making back another ten years." [...] However, the film was praised by science-fiction novelist Samuel R. Delany who was impressed by how the film undercuts the audience's normal sense of space and orientation in several ways. Like Bradbury, Delany picked up on the banality of the dialogue (in Delany's phrasing the characters are saying nothing meaningful), but Delany regards this as a dramatic strength, a prelude to the rebirth {{at the conclusion of the}} film. Without analyzing the film in detail, Isaac Asimov spoke well of Space Odyssey in his autobiography, and other essays. The film won the Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation, an award heavily voted on by science fiction fans and published science-fiction writers. James P. Hogan liked the film but complained about the ending that didn't make any sense to him, leading to a bet about whether he could write something better or not; [...] "I stole Arthur's plot idea shamelessly and produced Inherit the Stars." ...|$|E
2500|$|John O'Hara {{wrote in}} the New York Times; [...] "The most {{important}} author living today, the outstanding author {{since the death of}} Shakespeare, has brought out a new novel. The title of the novel is Across the River and Into the Trees. The author, of course, is Ernest Hemingway, the most important, the outstanding author out of the millions of writers who have lived since 1616." [...] Tennessee Williams, in The New York Times, wrote: [...] "I could not go to Venice, now, without hearing the haunted cadences of Hemingway's new novel. It is the saddest novel in the world about the saddest city, and when I say I think it is the best and most honest work that Hemingway has done, you may think me crazy. It <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> popular book. The critics may treat it pretty roughly. But its hauntingly tired cadences are the direct speech of a man's heart who is speaking that directly for the first time, and that makes it, for me, the finest thing Hemingway has done." ...|$|E

Milk buyers typically have had more market power than dairy farmers.

A worldwide consensus on reduction of border measures for protecting dairy products is unlikely, and dairy <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exception in ongoing World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations.
