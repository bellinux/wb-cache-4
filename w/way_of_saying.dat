5|$|Tini {{discovers that}} Tono has been having an affair, and is furious. She then goes to meet Yah. However, {{after a long}} talk she decides that Yah is better for Tono and tells the former prostitute to marry him; Tini then moves back to Surabaya, leaving Tono in Batavia. However, Yah feels that she would only ruin Tono's {{respected}} status as a doctor because of her history. She decides to move to New Caledonia, leaving a note for Tono {{as well as a}} record with a song recorded especially for him as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> goodbye. On the way to New Caledonia, Yah pines for Tono and hears his voice calling from afar, giving a speech on the radio. Tono, now alone, dedicates himself to his work in an attempt to fill the void left in his heart.|$|E

25|$|This {{assumption}} {{means that}} producing the same output of either commodity {{could be done}} with the same level of capital and labour in either country. Actually, it would be inefficient to use the same balance in either country (because of the relative availability of either input factor) but, in principle this would be possible. Another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> this is that the per-capita productivity is the same in both countries in the same technology with identical amounts of capital.|$|E
25|$|The {{eigenvalues}} of unitary matrices {{are pure}} phases, {{so that the}} value of a unitary conserved quantity is a complex number of unit magnitude, not a real number. Another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> this is that a unitary matrix is the exponential of i times a Hermitian matrix, so that the additive conserved real quantity, the phase, is only well-defined up to an integer multiple of 2π. Only when the unitary symmetry matrix is part of a family that comes arbitrarily close to the identity are the conserved real quantities single-valued, and then the demand that they are conserved become a much more exacting constraint.|$|E
25|$|A {{function}} or map {{from one}} topological space to another is called continuous if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the real numbers {{to the real}} numbers (both spaces with the Standard Topology), then this definition of continuous {{is equivalent to the}} definition of continuous in calculus. If a continuous function is one-to-one and onto, and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties, and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and the doughnut. But the circle is not homeomorphic to the doughnut.|$|E

25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. Slip rings and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

40|$|The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) {{is being}} {{designed}} to provide a uniform user interface to heterogeneous machine-readable bio-medical information resources, such as bibliographic databases, genetic databases, expert systems and patient records. 1 Such an interface will have to recognize different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> the same thing, and provide links to <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>saying</b> related things. One way to represent the necessary associations is via a domain thesaurus. As no such thesaurus exists, and because, once built, it will be both sizable and in need of continuous maintenance, its design should include a methodology for building and maintaining it. We propose a methodology, utilizing lexically expanded schema inversion, and a design, called T. Lex, which together form one approach to the problem of defining and building a bio-medical thesaurus. We argue that the semantic locality implicit in such a thesaurus will support model-based reasoning in bio-medicine. ...|$|R
