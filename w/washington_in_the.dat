5|$|Goat Rocks is an extinct {{stratovolcano}} in the Cascade Range, {{located between}} Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in southern <b>Washington,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.

The volcano was active from 3.2 million years ago until eruptions ceased between 1 and 0.5 million years ago. Throughout its complex eruptive history, volcanism shifted from silicic explosive eruptions to voluminous, mafic activity.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton's {{resignation}} as Secretary of the Treasury in 1795 did {{not remove}} him from public life. With the resumption of his law practice, he remained close to Washington as an advisor and friend. Hamilton influenced <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> composition of his Farewell Address by writing drafts for Washington to compare with the latter's draft, although when Washington contemplated retirement in 1792, he had consulted James Madison for a draft {{that was used in}} a similar manner to Hamilton's.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Shaughnessy hired {{his former}} {{teammate}} Bernie Bierman {{as an assistant}} coach. Bierman remained on the staff for three seasons before he left to become head coach at Mississippi A. In 1924, Tulane set a new school record for wins and finished with an 8–1 record. The following season, the Green Wave bested the prior year's mark and posted a 9–0–1 record. School officials declined an invitation to face <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Rose Bowl, because they believed the Tulane players were too small. Indiana University attempted to hire Shaughnessy after his undefeated season, but he instead chose to sign a ten-year extension with Tulane.|$|E
5|$|Logging {{settlements}} {{were established}} {{on the northern}} shore of Lake <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily on the water for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.|$|E

5|$|On 26January 2010, nearly 14years later, the World Meteorological Organization {{announced}} that the wind gust was the highest recorded worldwide. This gust surpassed the previous non-tornadic wind speed of 372km/h (231mph) on Mount <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States in April 1934. The long delay was {{partly due to the}} anemometer not being owned by the BoM, and as a result the agency did not enact a follow-up investigation. Despite the high winds, the anemometer and a nearby building were not damaged due to the winds occurring over a very short time.|$|E
5|$|The North Coast Hiawatha was a {{streamlined}} {{passenger train}} operated by Amtrak between Chicago, Illinois, and Seattle, <b>Washington,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. It operated from 1971 to 1979. The train was {{a successor to}} the Northern Pacific Railway's North Coast Limited and Mainstreeter, although it used {{the route of the}} Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad ("Milwaukee Road") east of Minneapolis–Saint Paul. The train's name combined the North Coast Limited with the Milwaukee Road's famed Hiawathas. Created {{at the behest of the}} United States Congress, the North Coast Hiawatha enjoyed an uncertain existence before being discontinued in 1979. Since then there have been several attempts to restore the service, without success.|$|E
5|$|The Pioneer Mother Memorial, {{also known}} as Pioneer Mother and Pioneer Mothers, is a 1928 bronze {{sculpture}} by American artist Avard Fairbanks, installed at Esther Short Park in Vancouver, <b>Washington,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. The memorial depicts a mother and three children, and commemorates pioneer mothers who settled in the Pacific Northwest. The main female figure may depict Esther Short, {{one of the first}} U.S. citizens to arrive in Fort Vancouver. Commissioned by Vancouver banker Edward Crawford and his wife Ida for $10,000, {{it is one of the}} city's oldest works of public art, acquired in 1928 and unveiled in 1929. The sculpture was renovated around the start of the 21st century and is maintained by the City of Vancouver's Parks & Recreation department.|$|E

5|$|The Residence Act {{authorized}} {{the president to}} select a specific site along the Potomac for the permanent seat of government. It also authorized him to appoint three commissioners to survey and acquire property for the federal city. Washington announced his selection of a site on January 24, 1791, and planning for the new city began afterward. Washington personally oversaw this effort {{through the end of}} his presidency. In September 1791, the commissioners named the nascent city <b>Washington,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> president's honor, and the district Columbia, which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time.|$|E
5|$|Cristina Yang, M.D., Ph.D., is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{from the medical}} drama television series Grey's Anatomy, which has aired for over 12 years on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes, and is portrayed by actress Sandra Oh. Introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Yang worked her way up to resident level, eventually becoming a cardiothoracic surgical fellow, while her relationships with colleagues Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) formed a {{focal point of the}} series. Yang earlier in the series got engaged to Preston Burke (Isaiah <b>Washington),</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past had a relationship with renowned surgeon and mentor Colin Marlow, and wed but later divorced Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd).|$|E
5|$|In North America, A. altissima {{is present}} from Massachusetts in the east, west to {{southern}} Ontario, southwest to Iowa, south to Texas, and {{east to the}} north of Florida. On the west coast it is found from New Mexico west to California and north to <b>Washington.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> east of its range it grows most extensively in disturbed areas of cities, where it was long ago present as a planted street tree. It also grows along roads and railways. For example, a 2003 study in North Carolina found the tree of heaven was present on 1.7% of all highway and railroad edges in the state and had been expanding its range at the rate of 4.76% counties per year. Similarly, another study conducted in southwestern Virginia determined that the tree of heaven is thriving along approximately 30% of the state's interstate highway system length or mileage. It sometimes enters undisturbed areas as well and competes with native plants. In western North America it is most common in mountainous areas around old dwellings and abandoned mining operations.|$|E

5|$|Letitia Woods Brown (October 24, 1915 – August 3, 1976) was an African American {{researcher}} and historian. Earning a master's degree in 1935 from Ohio State University and a Ph.D. in 1966 from Harvard University, {{she served as}} a {{researcher and}} historian for over four decades {{and became one of}} the first black woman to earn a PhD from Harvard University in history. As a teacher, she started her career in Macon County, Alabama between 1935 and 1936. Later in 1937, she became Tuskegee Institute's instructor in history but left in 1940. Between 1940 and 1945 she worked at LeMoyne-Owen College in Memphis, Tennessee as a tutor. From 1968 to 1971, she served as a Fulbright lecturer at Monash University and Australia National University followed by a period in 1971 working as a consultant at the Federal Executive Institute. Between 1971 and 1976 she served as a history professor in the African-American faculty of George Washington University and became the first full-time black member. She also served as a primary consultant for the Schlesinger Library’s Black Women Oral History project during the course of her professional career. Aside from teaching history, Brown wrote and contributed to books on Washington DC such as Washington from Banneker to Douglas, 1791 – 1870 and <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> New Era, 1870 – 1970.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{served under}} George <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Braddock Expedition, a {{failed attempt to}} capture Fort Duquesne from the French. For most of 1756 and {{the early part of}} 1757, he divided his time between Fort Cumberland and Fort Washington, {{conducting}} scouting and escort missions. In April 1757, David Bell was relieved of his command as part of a general downsizing of Washington's regiment, and Scott was assigned to Captain Robert McKenzie at Fort Pearsall. In August and September, Washington sent Scott and a small scouting party on two reconnaissance missions to Fort Duquesne in preparation for an assault on that fort, but the party learned little on either mission. In November, Scott was part of the Forbes Expedition that captured the fort. He spent {{the latter part of the}} year at Fort Loudoun, where Washington promoted him to ensign.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) in central Florida {{is a major}} attraction for fishermen {{from all over the}} country. The St. Johns is home to 183 species of fish, 55 of which appear in the main stem of the river. One, the southern tessellated darter (Etheostoma olmstedi) is found only in the Ocklawaha. Some are marine species that either migrate upriver to spawn or have found spring-fed habitats that are high in salinity, such as a colony of Atlantic stingrays (Dasyatis sabina) that live in Lake <b>Washington</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper basin. Ocean worms, snails, and white-fingered mud crabs (Rhithropanopeus harrisii) have also been found far upriver where tidal influences are rare. In contrast, American eels (Anguilla rostrata) live in the St. Johns and Ocklawaha and spawn in the Sargasso Sea {{in the middle of the}} Atlantic Ocean. After a year living in the ocean, many of them find their way back to the St. Johns to live, then, prompted by the phases of the moon, make the return journey to spawn and die.|$|E
