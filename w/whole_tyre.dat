Grafting of the WTR with maleic anhydride also resulted in the improved tensile strength, abrasion resistance, compression set and resilience.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of waste tyres has become an increasing problem in many countries worldwide. It is a costly issue for the <b>whole</b> <b>tyre</b> manufacturing and automobile industry, while the environmental costs {{over the years have}} reached significant levels. Current government’s regulations which ban landfilling in some developed countries such as United Kingdom have sparked an increased interest in finding new ways to dispose of waste tyres in environmentally safe manner. First part of this thesis explores the current status of the industry and identifies the most promising technologies which could provide a suitable solution for safe {{disposal of}} tyres. Once identified, the technology with the biggest potential is screened through a series of experiments which will form a basis for further process development. Finally, an in-depth economic analysis will evaluate the commercial feasibility of newly developed process and identify key recommendations for further work. After careful consideration, the pyrolysis of waste tyres was chosen for further process development and experimental research. The main goal of this work was to develop a suitable process for safe disposal of tyres and develop a unique tool which will provide a guideline on the process conditions required in order to optimize the production of a specific product. This tool, known as POT (Product Optimization Table) will play major part in identifying key operating conditions required for optimizing the overall process economics. Key findings in this report concentrate on identifying best possible process conditions required to make the process as economically favorable as possible at current market conditions. This is achieved by completing a case study together with a number of different economic models and looking at what makes the particular model economically viable. The result of this economic analysis points out a few major limitations of waste tyre pyrolysis process and dwells deeper into finding the key causes for this. Key recommendations presented {{at the end of this}} report are aimed at tyre manufacturing industry as well as relevant government bodies. Federal governments of developed nations are to play a major role in promoting the commercialization of the waste tyre pyrolysis technology. It is clear that new technology such as pyrolysis which is characterized by high risk and minimal returns is going to struggle in today’s market. Implementing the recommendations given in this report is crucial in order to encourage significant investments into technology such as pyrolysis and aid the further development and commercialization in the near future...|$|E
40|$|Mobility {{and traffic}} safety {{is a major}} concern in the society today. Many {{accidents}} take place because the vehicle is not following the trajectory that the driver desires. To avoid such accidents, an increasing number of active safety systems are introduced in modern vehicles. Still, most of the time, those systems are designed independently, which can lead to non-optimal performances and unexpected interactions. To properly consider the coupling between the different actuators like the brakes and steering, coupling coming for example from the nonlinear tyre dynamics, a Global Chassis Control strategy is necessary. This thesis defines a new 2 -level framework for Global Chassis Control. At the chassis level, the distribution of the total control action to all the actuators is formulated as a constrained convex optimization problem, independent from uncertain parameters. As the driver is constantly changing his inputs to the vehicle, the solution of the optimization should be constantly updated. For that purpose, a new continuous optimization method, the Hybrid Descent Method, has been developed. This method defines a dynamical system such that its trajectory converges, first to a solution allowed by the constraints, and then to the optimum of the related optimization problem. In order to introduce the right number of degrees of freedom in the optimization, the actuators are grouped into building blocks depending on their coupling with the different tyre forces. Tyre constraints are handled in a realistic way, without the common assumption that the <b>whole</b> <b>tyre</b> characteristic in known long in advance. At the wheel level, the control of the tyre forces is made simple and robust to uncertainties in the road conditions thanks to the use of tyre force measurement. Such tyre forces measurement is at the moment too expensive to be implemented. In current production vehicles, only sensors measuring motion are available, like accelerometers or gyroscopes. At the moment, SKF is developing a technology enabling the measurement of the load in their bearings. This technology allows the introduction of cheap force sensors in all vehicles, which will allow the implementation of new control algorithms like those presented in this thesis. A particularly critical problem in vehicle dynamics control is to get the largest possible braking force out of the tyres while maintaining vehicle stability. This thesis contributes to the development and experimental validation of Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS). As a result of a collaboration with CNRS/Supelec, Paris, France, a theoretical hybrid ABS based on wheel deceleration has been improved to handle actuation delay; and a new wheel slip regulator based on a cascaded approach has been implemented. Furthermore, new algorithms using force measurement are shown to be simpler to tune, better performing and more robust to road conditions than acceleration-based alternatives. The first ABS algorithm directly considering the loss of potential to generate lateral tyre forces because of braking is an achievement of this thesis. All algorithms for straight-line braking have been validated on the tyre-in-the-loop experimental facility, which was made suitable for ABS testing during this research.

40|$|Whole or {{shredded}} {{scrap tyres}} are sometimes proposed {{as an alternative}} to conventional aggregates in landfill drainage systems. Landfill basal drainage systems are, however, subjected to large overburden stresses from the overlying waste, which may compress a tyre drainage layer reducing its porosity and hence it effectiveness. Previous work has indicated that tyre drainage layers will remain effective under high stresses, but tests have in the main been restrictred to small (< 100 mm) shred sizes. The use of coarser shreds or even <b>whole</b> <b>tyres</b> for landfill drainage systems may be advantageous as they are more economical to produce and may be less prone to clogging than smaller shreds.

Generally <b>whole</b> <b>tyres</b> and larger-size segments compress more in overall volume terms on initial loading than smaller size shreds. At vertical stresses greater than about 80 kPa, however, the differences on a graph of dry density or porosity plotted against vertical stress are much smaller. The proportion of voids that are not free-draining decreases with compression for <b>whole</b> <b>tyres,</b> as cup-like structures capable of retaining water flatten out. For tyre chips, the proportion of non-drainable voids increases with compression, suggesting that flow pathways are being lost.

Method: To speed up the leachate recirculation and reduce its adverse impact on slope stability, this paper proposes a new method which constructs a spatial net consisted of bonded <b>whole</b> <b>tyres</b> in the municipal waste during landfilling. Results and Conclusion: In this study, a numerical two-permeability flow model was used to investigate the effects of tyres embedding on the outflow rate of leachate injection. Furthermore, it was coupled with momentum balance equations to determine the local factor of safety of slope stability. The established model was applied to a simplified bioreactor landfill. The simulation results demonstrated that the tyre net can accelerate the rate of leachate injection and contribute to distribute the liquid more uniformly. Meanwhile, the slope stability was improved due to the enforcement of waste {{in the presence of}} tyres. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|This is a Conference paper. Worldwide {{there are}} at least 1. 6 billion scrap tyres {{produced}} each year. Of these Britain is responsible for 50 million, equating to an annual production of 700, 000 tonnes of waste. Tyres have traditionally been disposed of in landfill sites and illegal dumping has caused problems. As a result many countries have implemented legislation and set objectives to reduce, and in some cases eliminate, the dumping and land-filling of waste tyres, EU legislation bans the disposal of <b>whole</b> <b>tyres</b> in landfill this month, and that of shredded tyres by 2006. To meet these requirements alternative uses of scrap tyres must be developed. Currently the most common of these are re-treading, burning for electricity generation/incineration in cement kilns and for surfacing for sports arenas and play areas. In the construction industry the tyres are shredded and used as lightweight fill, landfill drainage layers and as an alternative to aggregate in concrete and road pavements. Another option is to use the shredded tyres as a drainage material. Shredded tyres are a lightweight material which can be graded to suit requirements, are free-draining and very permeable. Under load the shredded tyres behave in an elastic manner and are highly compressible. Shear strength parameters {{are similar to those of}} a granular soil. Permeability reduces when loaded but remains higher than that of many other granular drainage materials. In light of these findings it is considered that shredded tyres could be used as a drainage material in many types of construction project and could in some circumstances be a viable alternative to aggregates or geotextiles. There are at present certain cases where traditional drainage materials are better to use but with further research to thoroughly establish the properties and behaviour of this new material, shredded tyres could be used with greater confidence in a widespread range of drainage applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} {{of rubber}} on {{ice and snow}} surfaces is complex. Deeper scientific understanding is important for optimising performance of tyres in winter. Rubber, ice and snow systems exhibit frictional behaviour which depends on their material properties. The viscoelastic nature of rubber results in a higher real contact area compared to most other solids. At temperatures close or below the glass transition temperature, the frictional behaviour of rubber changes and its hardness increases. Thus, the real area of contact decreases, while the dissipation in {{the bulk of the}} rubber increases. Sliding of rubber on ice or snow leads to a temperature increase at the interface because of frictional heating, this can cause the surface to melt which decreases friction significantly. In this study we measured the friction of rubber on ice and snow and related the behaviour to mechanisms that occur. Key parameters affecting friction were examined and quantified. For this work a cold room and a new linear tribometer were specially designed and constructed. The rubber samples were made from various compounds and had different geometries. Typically they were the size of a “tread block element”. The geometries were chosen systematically to investigate the effects of surface area, sharp/rounded edges and sipes (small slits in the tread block that are used on snow tyres). A significant part of the work was developing consistent and reproducible ice and snow surfaces. New protocols were devised for these. The ice surfaces were made of de-ionised water, tap water and de-ionised water with salt. For the snow surface production: artificial snow was made and then compacted in a specially manufactured press, resulting in hard packed snow tracks for testing. Static and dynamic friction were investigated. Both were affected by speed, load, temperature and ice composition. The dynamic friction behaviour on ice was explained in terms of melt-water formation and the real area of contact of the rubber. The static friction was significantly affected by the losses inside the rubber bulk, the adhesive forces at the interface, and the time of stationary contact before the test. The investigation of rubber sliding on snow showed some similarities with sliding on ice; the surface of the rubber block slides over snow particles resulting in similar mechanisms as are seen on ice. However with snow there can also be a “ploughing” effect, where snow is cut by the leading edge of a sharp tread block. This effect contributes to friction. Experiments were made with simple rounded edged samples to avoid ploughing; the results showed the same trends as seen on ice, i. e. lower friction with increased speed, load and temperature. Investigations of siped tread blocks showed the same friction at low speeds as tread blocks without sipes. At higher speeds siped blocks exhibited less, or no, decrease in friction; more sipes gave less friction decrease. Our industrial collaborator, Michelin, made vehicle tests on snow using <b>whole</b> <b>tyres</b> with similar tread blocks. The trends they found were identical to our tests despite the dynamics of the system being more complex. This indicates how powerful the approach of using simple systematic experiments is for generating deeper understanding of the processes involved in sliding on ice and snow...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{reclaimed}} and devulcanised {{material in}} virgin rubber compounds has {{attracted the attention}} of many rubber industries due to increasing raw material costs, diminishing resources and growing awareness of environmental issues. Several methods have been developed to reclaim rubber waste, for example, thermo- and chemo-mechanical processes, microwave regeneration, microbial action and ultrasonic regeneration.

40|$|The {{combustion}} of coal {{for power}} generation {{will continue to}} play a major role in the future, however, this must be achieved using cleaner technologies than we use at present. Scrap tyre arisings in the UK are 400, 000 tonnes per year amounting to 30 million tyres and in the EU as a whole, more than 2. 5 million tonnes of tyres per year are scrapped. The recent EC Waste Landfill Directive (1999) sets a deadline for the banning of <b>whole</b> and shredded <b>tyres</b> from landfill sites by 2006. Consequently, there is an urgent need to find a mass disposal route for tyres. We describe, in this paper, a novel use for tyre rubber pulverised fuel in a NOx reburning process which may have an application in power station boilers. This method of disposal could represent a way of combining waste disposal, energy recovery and pollution control within one process. A preliminary study of micronised tyre combustion was undertaken to identify the suitable size ranges for application in NOx reduction by reburning. Tests were performed in a down-fired, pulverised fuel combustor (PFC) operating at about 80 kW. Superior combustion characteristics, i. e. burnout were achieved with particle sizes less than 250 μm. A South African coal was used as the primary fuel in the reburn tests and the tyre was fed pneumatically via a separate feed system. Parameters studied, were, reburn zone stoichiometry and reburn fuel fraction. Additionally, the carbon content of the ash was carefully monitored for any effect on burnout at the fuel rich reburn stoichiometries. The NOx reductions achieved with tyres are compared with reburning with coal. NOx reductions up to 80...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the impact}} of staged {{combustion}} on the operation of a precalciner cement kiln, is considered. Mathematical modelling and full-scale experiments at the Norcem cement works in Brevik, Norway, {{is the basis for}} the thesis. The goal of the work was to characterize and explain operational disturbances related to the application of alternative solid fuels in staged combustion, and to take actions to avoid such disturbances. A mass and energy balance of a precalciner cement kiln system, Mebcem, was implemented in Matlab, and used as a tool for analysis of the kiln system, planning of experiments and interpretation of experimental data. The mass balance was calibrated and validated by means of process data collected during tests. Full-scale experiments using plastic as reburning fuel in the kiln inlet proved a NOx reduction potential of about 40 %. However, operational disturbances related to an alteration of the internal material cycles in the kiln system, were also experienced. To be able to analyse the sulphur chemistry at the kiln inlet, a program for the calculation of thermodynamic equilibria, Seacem, was implemented in Matlab. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that contact between fuel, precalcined meal and kiln gas caused the operational disturbances. This was supported by thermogravimetric analyses. Furthermore, CFD calculations conducted with FluentR, and laboratory experiments carried out to determine the entrainment velocity of various alternative fuels, demonstrated that, in the kiln system that was studied, such contact is hard to avoid. Based on these findings, a mechanism explaining the phenomena observed in the experiments was suggested, and a re-location of the feeding point for alternative fuels was prescribed. In subsequent experiments with a new feeding point location where precalcined meal, reburning fuel and kiln gas was not brought into simultaneous contact operational impacts were avoided or strongly reduced. However, the NOx reduction efficiency was at the same time reduced to about 20 %. One trial with so-called lean reburning was conducted. <b>Whole</b> car <b>tyres</b> were fed to the rotary kiln, and a 25 % reduction in NOx emissions was demonstrated by this technique. As part of the experimental program, the distribution of sulphur, sodium, potassium and chlorine all circulating elements in the kiln system, was determined. This was achieved by analysing a large number of meal and gas samples from the process, in combination with a program for the calculation of internal material cycles, Circcem, implemented in Matlab. For S, K and Na, the balance errors were in the interval 5 - 7 %, while the chlorine imbalance was much larger. The very intense circulation of chlorine explains why it is difficult to obtain a material balance for chlorine in a cement kiln system. A procedure for optimizing the degree of sulphatization of the alkalis in the clinker was also developed. By means of this procedure it is possible to control the internal material cycles of the kiln system, and hence have an improved basis for staged combustion...|$|R
