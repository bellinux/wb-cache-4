2500|$|Bush {{administration}} Press Secretary Dana Perino stated {{just after}} the incident that “I saw the reports about the school. I don’t have any information about that. I {{think that we should}} not jump to conclusions and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> {{to find out what the}} evidence says... What we do know is that Hamas often hides amongst innocents and uses innocent people, including children, as human shields." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao {{scored a}} decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu in 200. Yuan Shao {{died two years}} after his defeat and his sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang started {{fighting}} each other for control over their father's vast domain. Cao Cao defeated Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang at the Battle of Liyang in 202–203 and won several consecutive battles. At the time, many of Cao Cao's generals urged Cao {{to take advantage of}} his successes to continue attacking the Yuans, but Guo Jia said, [...] "Yuan Shao loved both sons so he couldn't decide between them who would succeed him. With advisers like Guo Tu and Pang Ji to assist the Yuans, internal conflict will definitely break out between them. If we press on our attacks, the Yuans will unite to resist us. If we withdraw our forces, the Yuans will start fighting among themselves. Why don't we turn south and attack Liu Biao in Jing Province first? <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> until the Yuan brothers start fighting each other and then attack them. We'll achieve victory in this way." [...] Cao Cao agreed and prepared for a campaign against Liu Biao.|$|E

6000|$|... "It will be dark soon," [...] said Tip, {{observing that}} the sun was low on the horizon. [...] "Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>waited</b> until morning. I wonder if the Gump can fly in the night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{three more}} rounds, Cochrane," [...] said he, {{with the little}} brass {{cylinders}} upon {{the palm of his}} hand. [...] "We've let them shoot too soon, and too often. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> have <b>waited</b> for the rush." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{answered}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>wait</b> any longer than that, {{but in my}} own mind I could not see any advantage in putting them on at all. Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> wish to lengthen our lives by a few hours of helpless floating upon the ocean? ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{follow the}} head of our house,” says Castlewood, bowing gravely. “At what time shall it please the prince that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> upon him in the morning?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{follow the}} head of our house," [...] says Castlewood, bowing gravely. [...] "At what time shall it please the Prince that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> upon him in the morning?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We are {{the three}} {{officers}} of the Emperor, madame,' said I, in a low voice, leaning my face down to the open window. 'You have already been warned that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> upon you.' ...|$|E
60|$|While {{this portion}} of the battle was at its height, we {{suddenly}} heard the reports of firearms {{from the direction of the}} fort, and my heart leaped into my throat, for I understood that Colonel Gansevoort was making the sortie for which <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>waited.</b>|$|R
60|$|At Canterbury, therefore, we alighted, only to {{find that}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have to <b>wait</b> an hour before we could get a train to Newhaven.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] another said, [...] "there {{would be}} plenty to do, but I would not mind wagering that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>wait</b> for him; and after all, I {{am not sure}} if it would not be the best thing to do, for these Germans with us are little better than a rabble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I quite {{understand}} his feelings," [...] Cassandra replied. [...] "I quite agree with them. I {{think it would}} be much better, if you intend to marry Mr. Denham, that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> as William says." ...|$|E
6000|$|Illo. War is {{a violent}} trade; one cannot always [...] Finish one's work by soft means; every trifle [...] Must not be {{blackened}} into sacrilege. [...] 110 [...] If <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> till you, in solemn council, [...] With due deliberation had selected [...] The smallest out of four-and-twenty evils, [...] I'faith, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> long.-- [...] 'Dash! and through with it!'--That's the better watch-word. [...] 115 [...] Then after come what may come. 'Tis man's nature [...] To {{make the best}} of a bad thing once past. [...] A bitter and perplexed 'what shall I do?' [...] Is worse to man than worst necessity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{it not be}} well," [...] said John, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> here, and {{see what}} manner of {{greeting}} you have from your brother. You {{may prove to be}} as welcome as the king's purveyor to the village dame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never! You shall not! Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> even <b>wait</b> a day, Francoise? I am ready. You are ready. Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> not {{be married}} now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{leave me}} no option in that case. As you have remarked before, citizen Heron, why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>wait</b> any longer? Surely {{we can now}} go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why {{can we not}} {{run away}} at once?" [...] Virginie said. [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>wait</b> here till they come and take us and carry us away and kill us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't, {{deny that}} <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> for the President because he's {{a kind of}} king too. I don't know that we shall ever get over wanting to see kings of some kind. Or at least my wife won't. May I present you to Mrs. March?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The body of our force stays {{here with}} me. [...] And I am much surprised, your Highness, much, [...] You mark not how {{destructive}} 'tis to part! [...] If we wait on, for certain <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> [...] In our full strength, compacted, undispersed [...] By such partition as your Highness plans.|$|E
6000|$|... "As if <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> to be starved," [...] {{another of}} the {{students}} said scoffingly. [...] "If the time comes when there's nothing to eat, we would set Paris on fire and hurl ourselves every man upon the Germans, and fight our way through. Do {{you think that they}} could block every road round Paris?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>wait</b> {{for them}} to punish us for our first success. I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> follow up our little victory, and attack the republicans, at Beauprieu, perhaps, or at Cholet; <b>we</b> <b>should</b> so teach our men to fight, teach them to {{garrison}} and protect their own towns, and then, perhaps, before very long, we might fly at higher game; we might endeavour to drive these wolves from their own strong places; from Angers perhaps, or Nantes, or better still, from Saumur." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Joe, why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> not <b>wait</b> for you? You {{never did}} send us away all forlorn before!" [...] she said, pleadingly. [...] "We are all quite well, and I can't bear going without you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{excellent}} {{as far as}} it goes, if we happen to be in the right valley at the time, Dias, but it would not help us in the slightest if we were in any other valley. And <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have to <b>wait</b> a year before trying in another place." ...|$|R
60|$|Saul was {{for setting}} off at once, {{although}} {{the sun was}} no more than two hours' high, while Frenchie argued strongly that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> until the forenoon was half spent, when there would likely be many visitors in the village, and we would attract less attention than if we were the first comers.|$|E
60|$|As we were {{returning}} Billali met us, and {{informed us that}} it was She's pleasure that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> upon her, and accordingly we entered her presence, not without trepidation, for Ayesha was certainly {{an exception to the}} rule. Familiarity with her might and did breed passion and wonder and horror, but it certainly did not breed contempt.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{it would}} be as well that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> another month," [...] he replied. A little pretended {{opposition}} strengthened this view, and the return was postponed. At {{the end of the month}} he had made so much progress that, when the longing for London was again expressed, Dr. Leeds offered no opposition, and two days later the whole party went up.|$|E
40|$|I {{agree with}} the point of an {{anonymous}} reviewer arguing that a pro-found discussion on the prerequisites of a viable global market society has too many facets to be contained {{within the bounds of}} a single journal article. Yet, in order to enter the debate now <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>wait</b> until book length treatments become available-often only after years. This is, therfore, an essay attempting to overview various conflicts and contradictions within the global social system. It sythesizes arguments developed in more detail else-where...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marjorie," [...] he said, [...] "we've {{done our}} job. Why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>wait</b> {{here on this}} frosty shelf outside the world? My leg's getting sounder--if it wasn't for that feeling of ice in it. Why shouldn't we make another sledge from the other bunk and start down--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now this I call quite a {{remarkable}} coincidence!" [...] exclaimed the {{smaller and more}} talkative of the two sisters--the one whose legal knowledge had annihilated the cab-driver. [...] "Not only that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be <b>waiting</b> for the same train, {{and at the same}} station--that would be curious enough--but actually on the same day, and the same hour of the day! That's what strikes me so forcibly!" [...] She glanced at the fatter and more silent sister, whose chief function in life seemed to be to support the family opinion, and who meekly responded-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has been}} bidding {{me to do}} you no harm. It was not necessary. I would sooner pluck out my eye than hurt you. My uncle is an old man,--a very old man. She cannot {{understand}} that it is better that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait,</b> than that I should have to think hereafter that I had killed him by my unkindness." ...|$|E
60|$|Prudence {{dictated}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> until daybreak; but I believe of a verity {{it would have}} made me wild to remain in that spot inactive, thinking only of my folly, and now, as when we left the canoe, I pressed on with but one idea in mind; but, fortunately, yet retaining so much of common sense as to understand that we must be on the alert to gain such information as was possible during the journey.|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't {{know how}} well armed Jenkins may be, nor what he {{will be willing to}} do in aid of his friend. My idea is that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>wait</b> here until the owner goes to his work, leaving the traitor with the women folks, and even then the task won't be an easy one, for we must come out in sight of all hands a full three minutes before {{arriving}} at the house, however fast we run." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Then {{your eyes}} are better than mine, Joyce, for I can’t say I can read it yet. Row easy, men, and you in the bow keep a sharp {{look-out}} on the water. If we were to come bow-on to a hidden rock <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have to <b>wait</b> ashore until another boat came out to fetch us.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Precisely. Therefore must we be speedy. All Paris {{knows it}} by this time, for the fellow went {{straight}} to the English Ambassador; and I trust my son has been wise enough to set off already; for <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>wait</b> till after Lent, Monsieur le Baron himself might be upon us.' ...|$|R
40|$|Proposed {{alternatives}} to GDP {{as a measure}} of social welfare or human progress are briefly evaluated. Four main categories are considered, namely ISEW and GPI based on corrections of GDP, sustainable or green(ed) GDP, genuine savings/investments and composite indexes. All these alternatives turn out to suffer from various shortcomings. Nevertheless, several of them represent a considerable improvement over GDP information in approximating social welfare. This gives support to the idea that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not <b>wait</b> to give less importance and attention to GDP (per capita) information in public decision-making until a perfect alternative indicator is available...|$|R
