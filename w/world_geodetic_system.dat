40|$|The normal gravity {{fields of}} Nigeria have been modeled {{exploiting}} the <b>Geodetic</b> Reference <b>System</b> 1930 (GRS- 30), <b>Geodetic</b> reference <b>system</b> 1967 (GRS- 1967) and the <b>world</b> <b>geodetic</b> reference <b>system</b> 1984 (WGS- 84). The {{determination of the}} normal gravity fields from the three <b>Geodetic</b> Reference <b>Systems</b> were carried out to evaluate the accuracy of one reference datum with respect to another. Descriptive statistics of the normal gravity field values modeled on regional and local scales showed a large difference (16. 11 mGal) between the 1930 reference earth model (GRS- 30) and 1967 reference earth model (GRS- 67). A large difference was also established between the 1930 and 1984 reference earth models. The large difference in the mean of normal gravity field is attributed to error inherent in the Potsdam value (16 mGal). However, the small difference in normal gravity field values between the 1967 and 1984 reference systems is a pointer that the choice of either application in geophysical exploration or geodetic applications is of minor importance. The trends in discrepancies between the 1930 and 1967 reference earth models and 1930 and 1984 reference earth models {{are reflected in the}} standard deviation and standard error (S.

40|$|Much local {{government}} has been utilizing the large scale digital map with Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS {{will be able to}} efficiently work and to reduce mapping costs.

The {{purpose of this study is}} establishment to update of the large scale map for {{local government}} by using a mobile GPS, REAL TIME GIS and its collaboration. REAL TIME GIS is one of the examples of mobile mapping technology. REAL TIME GIS, which definition decided by our laboratory, is a technology that updates the digital map instantly by using RTK-GPS and the cellular phone. Map revise by using REAL TIME GIS is a major purpose of this study. RTK-GPS data use Japanese Geodetic Datum 2000 (JGD 2000) of WGS- 84, but most of the digital map of local government is still Tokyo Datum of old <b>geodetic</b> <b>system.</b> In order to correspond with two kinds of data which have different <b>geodetic</b> <b>system,</b> it is necessary to transform coordinates. Geographic Survey Institute of Japan (GSI) opened a website for the conversion parameters and programs. GPS data is able to apply to digital map in small scale. However, Base Map and thematic map which has made by the large scale (1 / 500 or 1 / 1000) on the old <b>geodetic</b> <b>system</b> did not obtain sufficient accuracy.
