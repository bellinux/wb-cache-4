5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those <b>who</b> <b>choose</b> to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those <b>who</b> <b>choose</b> God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} Class C retail {{licenses}} for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores {{is limited by}} population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees <b>who</b> <b>choose</b> to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by public auction. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating {{several hundred thousand dollars}} of revenue from the highest bidder.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} relevant characteristics associated with service choice at the United States Naval Academy (USNA). Specifically, this study compared male midshipmen from the classes of 2000 - 2006 <b>who</b> <b>chose</b> the United States Marine Corps as a first choice and male midshipmen <b>who</b> <b>chose</b> the submarine force upon graduation as a first choice, and measured the predictability of these service choices using appropriate independent variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson Chisquare goodness-of-fit tests measured the independent variables before including them in the binary logistic regressions used to measure predictability. The {{data were collected from}} the Office of Institutional Research. This study concludes that there are differences between the midshipmen <b>who</b> <b>chose</b> USMC and the midshipmen <b>who</b> <b>chose</b> the submarine force in terms of personality, family experience, academic performance, military performance, physicality and prior experience.

5|$|The {{reform plan}} adopted in 2005 envisaged the {{formation}} of eighteen integrated brigades through the brassage process as its first of three stages. The process consists firstly of regroupment, where fighters are disarmed. Then they are sent to orientation centres, run by CONADER, where fighters take the choice of either returning to civilian society or remaining in the armed forces. Combatants <b>who</b> <b>choose</b> demobilisation receive an initial cash payment of US $110. Those <b>who</b> <b>choose</b> {{to stay within the}} FARDC are then transferred to one of six integration centres for a 45-day training course, which aims to build integrated formations out of factional fighters previously heavily divided along ethnic, political and regional lines. The centres are spread out around the country at Kitona, Kamina, Kisangani, Rumangabo and Nyaleke (within the Virunga National Park) in Nord-Kivu, and Luberizi (on the border with Burundi) in South Kivu. The process has suffered severe difficulties due to construction delays, administration errors, and the amount of travel former combatants have to do, as the three stages' centres are widely separated. Following the first 18 integrated brigades, the second goal is {{the formation of}} a ready reaction force of two to three brigades, and finally, by 2010 when MONUC is anticipated to have withdrawn, the creation of a Main Defence Force of three divisions.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode of}} series 1 of Red or Black? {{consisted}} of 10 rounds; in each round, the player {{had to choose}} either red or black, with those <b>who</b> <b>choose</b> incorrectly being eliminated. The rounds are split into three stages. The first is an arena stage, which is recorded at Wembley Arena. The winning contestants move onto the location stage, where the numbers are eventually reduced down to the final eight. Those eight then go forward to the live studio final, where they are reduced down to the final competitor, who {{has a chance to}} play for the £1m prize. The first series was broadcast over seven nights in September 2011, running {{over the course of a}} week, except for the Tuesday night, from Saturday to the following Saturday. Over 100,000 people applied to compete in the show.|$|E
5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers <b>who</b> <b>choose</b> not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E

Senior members who have not yet turned 21years are eligible for flight officer grades, which include flight officer, technical flight officer, and senior flight officer. There is no mandatory retirement age for CAP members, and there are no physical requirements for joining. Members may enter retired status after twenty years of service.

5|$|The Voice is an American singing {{competition}} {{television series}} which premiered on NBC on April 26, 2011. Based {{on the original}} The Voice of Holland, the series features several stages of competition to search for new vocal talent contested by aspiring singers, age 15 or over, drawn from public auditions. The show has four coaches <b>who</b> <b>choose</b> their favourite artists during the audition rounds, and guide their selected teams through {{the remainder of the}} season. The winner is subsequently determined by television viewers; the prizes include $100,000 and a record deal with Universal Music Group. The Voice has been very successful since its premiere, drawing high ratings for the network and becoming one of the highest-rated shows in the country.|$|E
5|$|Trucking {{companies}} (motor carriers) {{can also}} play a role in HOS violations. Certain carriers may choose to knowingly ignore HOS violations made by their drivers, or even encourage their drivers to do so. Allowing drivers to violate the HOS is an effective cost-cutting measure used mostly by non-union, long haul carriers. Permitting HOS violations allows a carrier to hire fewer drivers, and run on fewer trucks than a company which follows the rules. To comply with the HOS, these companies would have to hire more drivers (possibly driving up wages) and purchase additional trucks and trailers. Making a change to comply with the law is complicated by competition with carriers that already comply with HOS regulations. Due to this competition, carriers <b>who</b> <b>choose</b> to switch from non-compliance could not pass on all of their increased costs associated with HOS compliance to their customers.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fictional version of the Shibuya {{shopping}} district in Tokyo, Japan. While everyday life goes on in the Realground (RG), the chosen dead are brought to an alternate plane of existence called the Underground (UG). The UG is also the venue for the Reapers' Game. By offering their most treasured possession to enter the Game, the dead gain the chance to contest for the prize: to be brought back to life or to transcend to a higher form of spiritual existence. Most of those <b>who</b> <b>choose</b> to transcend become Reapers, the opponents of players in future Games. Lasting a week, each Game is a contest to judge the worth of humanity. Players set out to accomplish objectives under the rules created by the Composer, who is a god-like entity who maintains Shibuya. Another Reaper, the Conductor, tasks other Reapers to obstruct the players' efforts. Failure to complete a mission will disperse the mind and spirit of the player or Reaper, thus erasing his or her existence.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to examine the {{relationships}} among the three factors, namely Ibasyo (the person who eases your mind), Individualism and Collectivism.

They were then asked to rate items from revised scales originally developed by Shulruf et al. (2007) for assessing Individualism and Collectivism tendencies. The results indicated that Ibasyo determined the levels of two factors, namely unique tendency in Individualism and advice one in Collectivism. Especially for the score of unique tendency the participants <b>who</b> <b>chose</b> myself had higher scores than those <b>who</b> <b>chose</b> mother or friend. Whereas for the score of advice tendency the participants <b>who</b> <b>chose</b> mother or friend had higer scores than those <b>who</b> <b>chose</b> myself. These results are interpreted as showing that Ibasyo is one of the determinants of Individualism and Collectivism...|$|R
