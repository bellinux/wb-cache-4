The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus {{is the most important}} of the temples. It was built in 509 BC and <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> large as the Parthenon. The hill and the temple of Jupiter became the symbols of Rome, the capital of the world.|$|E

After only eight {{games as a}} setup pitcher, Smith, who was unhappy in California, was traded to Cincinnati for Chuck McElroy on May 27. He resumed setup duty for the Reds—this time for Jeff Brantley, {{who was in the}} midst of his best season—but did not fare as well in his return to the National League. His ERA <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> high as the league average, his strikeout rate was the lowest in 15 years, and the Reds granted him free agency after the season.|$|E

They also supported Gottlieb Duttweiler's 1938popular initiative calling for the purchase of a thousand aircraft and the training of three thousand pilots. After 92,000citizens signed in support, nearly twice the number necessary for a national popular vote, the federal government offered a referendum proposal in 1939that <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> extensive, which was accepted by a 69percent majority.|$|E
5|$|August 15, 1787: The Four-State Tornado Swarm of 1787 was {{the largest}} tornado {{outbreak}} recorded to date, and affected most of New England. The first in the state touched down around 1:30PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the same path as a tornado in 1728 or 1729. This tornado <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> violent as the Wallingford Tornado of 1878. A mother and two of her children were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town. What may have been another tornado caused additional damage as far east as Coventry. Another tornado struck East Windsor, damaging several homes and barns. Yet another touched down near Killingly, moving northeast into Rhode Island and Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Hagiographic {{accounts}} of Harding's life quickly followed his death, such as Joe Mitchell Chapple's Life and Times of Warren G. Harding, Our After-War President (1924). By then, the scandals were breaking, and the Harding administration {{soon became a}} byword for corruption {{in the view of}} the public. Works written in the late 1920s helped shape Harding's historical reputation: Masks in a Pageant by William Allen White mocked and dismissed Harding, as did Samuel Hopkins Adams' fictionalized account of the Harding administration, Revelry. These books depicted Harding's time in office as one of great presidential weakness. The publication of Nan Britton's bestselling book disclosing they had had an affair also lowered the late president in public esteem. President Coolidge, not wishing to be further associated with his predecessor, refused to dedicate the Harding Tomb. Hoover, Coolidge's successor, was similarly reluctant, but with Coolidge in attendance presided over the dedication in 1931. By that time, with the Great Depression in full swing, Hoover <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> discredited as Harding.|$|E

5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Early in his career, Agassi {{would look}} to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis, {{typically}} by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle. His groundstrokes, return of serve, baseline game, anticipation, and eye–hand coordination were always {{among the best}} in the game. On the rare occasion that he charged the net, Agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for the winner. His favored groundstroke was his flat, accurate two-handed backhand, hit well cross-court but in particular down the line. His forehand <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> strong, in particular his inside-out forehand to the ad court.|$|E

25|$|In the 1880 season, Derbyshire's first {{match of}} the season was against the touring Australians, fresh in their {{existence}} as a Test nation and with several young players at their disposal. The Derbyshire bowling pair of Mycroft and Hay dealt soundly with the Australians, but then the same treatment was dealt to the Derbyshire team in a second-innings eight-wicket haul by Fred Spofforth. Hay then played four more non-status games against the Australians – for a scratch Derbyshire team, for Keighley and twice for Wermeth, maintaining his duel with Spofforth who was later to become a Derbyshire captain. Hay appeared in eight county matches for the team during 1880, scoring more runs in this season {{than in any other}} of his career. The 1881 season <b>was</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> successful a season, Hay playing in six county matches, Derbyshire winning two. From here on, Hay was on the playing staff of MCC where he played matches against minor counties, while still putting in five games for Derbyshire over the next five years. His two final first-class matches were in teams made up of a variety of players from all the major cricketing counties.|$|E
