40|$|AbstractThe {{transmission}} {{of infectious diseases}} of livestock does not differ in principle from disease transmission in any other animals, apart from that the aim of control is ultimately economic, with the influence of social, political and <b>welfare</b> <b>constraints</b> often poorly defined. Modelling of livestock diseases suffers simultaneously from a wealth {{and a lack of}} data. On the one hand, the ability to conduct transmission experiments, detailed within-host studies and track individual animals between geocoded locations make livestock diseases a particularly rich potential source of realistic data for illuminating biological mechanisms of transmission and conducting explicit analyses of contact networks. On the other hand, scarcity of funding, as compared to human diseases, often results in incomplete and partial data for many livestock diseases and regions of the world. In this overview of challenges in livestock disease modelling, we highlight eight areas unique to livestock that, if addressed, would mark major progress in the area...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} {{employment}} protection on {{the probability of}} being hired is particularly strong for those workers whose productivity is a priori uncertain, such as new entrants or the long-term unemployed 8. For this reason, {{as well as in}} response to firmsâ€™ demands for more flexibility, reforms of employment protection have often introduced dual protection systems, with high employment protection on permanent contracts coexisting with lighter protection on temporary contracts. In many cases these reforms have had ambiguous effects, both on efficiency and on <b>welfare.</b> <b>Constraints</b> on renewing temporary contracts have led firms to invest little in their temporary workers. And temporary workers have suffered from a high level of employment insecurity, alternating between dead-end jobs and unemployment. While these contracts were initially limited to young workers, they have been spreading to older cohorts over time. Workers on temporary contracts may also suffer in other ways; for example, they often cannot obtain mortgages and their unstable careers put them more at risk of being excluded from the contributory pension system 9.|$|R

Within this equilibrium framework, market participants simultaneously optimize their respective individual and conflicting objectives. This market works under locational marginal pricing, i. e., producers and consumers are paid and pay, res-pectively, the locational marginal prices corresponding to the nodes they are con-nected to. The equilibrium {{is defined as the}} energy transaction levels for which producers maximize their respective profits and consumers maximize their respec-tive utilities. A system operator clears the market maximizing the social <b>welfare.</b> <b>Constraints</b> involving prices such as conditions that ensure minimum revenue for producers can be incorporated into the problems of the producers.

Legal requirements {{in a number of}} geographical regions (Europe, US, and intended in Canada) demand environmental risk assessments (ERA) for new drug substances. Existing regulatory concepts of ERA are based initially on a set of short-term ecotoxicological studies in three to four different species, environmental behavior and the application of assessment factors to correct for the ERA inherent uncertainty. Based on theoretical considerations and the experience with a very limited, but well investigated, number of examples while considering that drugs are highly biologically active compounds, the appropriateness of this risk assessment procedure for all drug substances might be questioned. Indeed, e. g. long-term effects may occur at much lower concentrations and follow different toxicodynamic mechanism than extrapolated from short-term studies., In such cases, the application of assessment factors for deriving chronic no-observed effect concentration (NOECs) appears to be problematic. Although long-term tests with a variety of organisms would provide a complete database for the evaluation of the environmental risks, this is unachievable for all drugs due to time, money and animal <b>welfare</b> <b>constraints.</b> In order to avoid unnecessary testing, a concept is presented, which makes use of pharmacological and toxicological, as wel...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between politics and economic policy {{has a long}} tradition in economic analysis. One important approach links macroeconomic policy decisions to the electoral cycle and has become known in the literature as the political business cycle theory. Rogoff and Sibert (1988) and Rogoff (1990) characterize the political business cycle as the equilibrium of a signaling game that arises due to a temporary information asymmetry between government and fully rational voters. Another important line of research that relates economic policy decisions to the electoral cycle focuses on industry-level issues and treats the regulatory process as the arbitration of conflicting social, economic, and political interests rather than a pure welfare-maximizing effort. This approach originated from the early work of Stigler (1971) and was further developed in Peltzman (1976) with the introduction of a formal model in which the regulated price was chosen so as to maximize political support for the incumbent government-regulator. This paper combines the main ideas of Peltzman (1976) and Rogoff and Sibert (1988) to model the regulatorâ€™s problem as a signaling game where politicians set the regulated price trying to maximize electoral support by signaling to voters a pro-consumer behavior.

40|$|Purpose â€“ The {{value chain}} of the Norwegian meat {{production}} industry {{has recently been}} through major structural changes resulting in increased flows and transportation needs at all levels. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present results of the initial stage of a five-year research project between the Norwegian Meat Research Centre, Norwegian meat companies and Molde University College. The main goal of the project is to develop a decision support system for the transport of live animals to a slaughterhouse to reduce transportation costs while maintaining high level of livestock welfare and meat quality, as these are three main factors for the profitability of both farmers and industry. Design/methodology/approach â€“ The paper presents a mixed integer programming model that combines vehicle routing and inventory control. We introduce the possibility for multiple routes for a given vehicle on a given day in a multiple-period planning perspective. Arrival times of the loaded vehicles to the slaughterhouse are controlled by production (slaughter) rate and inventory level at the abattoirs so that the supply of animals for slaughter is steady and production breaks are avoided. Livestock welfare is secured by the route duration constraints. Findings â€“ The model has been formulated and tested on small data sets. The major future challenge is to solve real-life problems from the involved companies. Research limitations/implications â€“ The main limitation is the present inability to solve large cases.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} on flapping flight in animals {{have shown that}} a variety of unrelated species shed a wake behind left and right wings consisting of both tip and root vortices. Here we present an investigation using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) of the behaviour and interaction of trailing vortices shed by paired, fixed wings that simplify and mimic the wake of a flying animal with a non-lifting body. We measured flow velocities at five positions downstream of two adjacent NACA 0012 aerofoils and systematically varied aspect ratio, the gap between the wings (corresponding to the width of a non-lifting body), angle of attack, and the Reynolds number. The range of aspect ratios and Reynolds number where chosen to be relevant to natural fliers and swimmers, and insect flight in particular. We show that the wake behind the paired wings deformed {{as a consequence of the}} induced flow distribution such that the wingtip vortices convected downwards while the root vortices twist around each other. Vortex interaction and wake deformation became more pronounced further downstream of the wing, so the positioning of PIV measurement planes in {{experiments on}} flying animals has an important effect on subsequent force estimates due to rotating induced flow vectors. Wake deformation was most severe behind wings with lower aspect ratios and when the distance between the wings was small, suggesting that animals that match this description constitute high-risk groups in terms of measurement error. Our results, therefore, have significant implications for experimental design where wake measurements are used to estimate forces generated in animal flight. In particular, the downstream distance of the measurement plane should be minimised, notwithstanding the animal <b>welfare</b> <b>constraints</b> when measuring the wake behind flying animals...|$|R

It generalizes the results of Bajari et al (2005), who find that in a credit unconstrained economy with exogenous housing prices there is no effect of housing price appreciation on aggregate welfare. However, I demonstrate that if the households are credit-constrained and housing price is endogenous its appreciation implies a non-zero change in aggregate <b>welfare.</b> First, credit <b>constraints</b> are incorporated into Bajari et alâ€™s model and it is shown {{that if they are}} binding housing price appreciation implies an improvement in aggregate welfare. I then construct a model where housing price appreciation is endogenous and is driven by demand and supplyside shocks. The supply shock results from a change in building permit cost. The demand shifts are generated based on dynamics of household income and interest rates. Both credit-constrained and unconstrained versions of this model are considered. Afterwards, using my theoretical results I calculate the aggregate welfare effects of housing price appreciation driven by the combination of demand-side and supply-side shocks observed in the US housing market from 1995 to 2004. The final result implies that housing price appreciation in 1995 - 2004 driven by the given combination of demand and supply-side shocks led to per household improvement of aggregate welfare by an amount equivalent to about 40 % of mean household income in 2004.
