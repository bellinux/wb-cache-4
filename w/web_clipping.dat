5000|$|Although Gmail's {{advertisements}} {{have received}} praise for not obtruding, {{they can take}} up more space than Flash-based banners when up to six [...] "sponsored links" [...] appear next to an email. Additionally, when activated, opening emails makes the <b>Web</b> <b>Clips</b> RSS-feed bar display another sponsored link. Often the number of advertisements displayed in the <b>Web</b> <b>Clips</b> bar outnumbers the number of RSS feeds the user has requested. However, when a Gmail message is sent to another email address of a different provider, {{there will be no}} advertisements in the message unlike most other webmail providers.|$|R

50|$|The Palm VII was a {{personal}} digital assistant made by the Palm Computing division of 3Com. The device featured an antenna used for wireless data communication, a first for a Palm device. Connectivity was provided through the Mobitex network, under the now defunct Palm.net service. <b>Web</b> <b>Clipping</b> applications, also known as Palm Query Applications (PQAs) made use of the network to request and post web data.

50|$|The {{program can}} be used to {{generate}} charts and diagrams, reports, maps, books & booklets, websites, and family tree CDs & DVDs. Reports and books can be saved in rich-text format, suitable for editing in a word-processor. Diagrams, charts, reports and books can all be saved in PDF format. Pictures can be linked to all the people in them (each person is linked directly to their face in the picture). The program also features a map window (with a choice of map types), web hints (automatic matching of data in databases on the Internet), an automatic source citation pane (to make adding sources easy), <b>web</b> <b>clipping</b> tools (for extracting data from web pages), internet search tools, interactive 'smart trees', multi-level undo/redo, and more. Users can extend the program themselves by creating plugins using scripting tools which are included with each copy. Plugins can be shared with other users by uploading them to the Family Historian Plugin Store. All plugins are free for Family Historian users.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-We {{describe}} a unique approach {{to improving the}} performance of a <b>Web</b> <b>clipping</b> portal by exploiting inherent parallelism in the syntax of widely used markup languages, and by employing a parallel computing platform as an in-line proxy between the handheld mobile device and a Web server on the Internet. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend the {{classical}} portal (with static portlets) design with HTML DOM <b>Web</b> <b>clipping</b> on the client browser using dynamic JavaScript portlets: the portal server supplies the user/passwords for all services through [URL] {{and the client}} browser retrieves web pages and cuts/selects/changes the desired parts using paths (XPath) in the Web page structure. This operation brings along a set of advantages: dynamic wrapping of existing legacy websites in the client browser, the reloading of only changed portlets instead of whole portal, low bandwidth on the server, the elimination of re-writing the URL links in the portal, and last but not least, a support for Java applets in portlets by putting the login cookies on the client browser. Our solution is compliant with JSR 168 Portlet Specification allowing portability across all vendor platforms...|$|E
40|$|The abilitytotake information, {{entertainment}} and e-commerce {{on the go}} has great promise. However, the existing Web infrastructure and contentwere designed for desktop computers and are not well-suited for other types of accesses, e. g., devices that have less processing power and memory, small screens, and limited input facilities, or through wireless data networks with low bandwidth and high latency. Thus, {{there is a growing}} need for techniques that provide alternative means to access Web content and services, be it the ability to browse the Web through a wireless PDAor smart phone, or hands-free access through voice interfaces. In this paper, we discuss issues involved in making existing Web content and services available for diverse environments, and describe WebViews, a system that allows casual Web users to easily create customized views of Web sites that are well-suited for differenttypes of terminals. In particular, we describe our approachtoprovide voice access to these Web views and experiences in building the system.

50|$|In 2008, with Apple's {{release of}} iPhone OS 1.1.3 and the January App Pack, the SpringBoard {{underwent}} some substantial changes.

From this view, you can rearrange your icons, delete web apps and <b>web</b> <b>clips,</b> and create multiple pages by dragging an application {{to the side of the}} screen. If the Home button is pressed, the icons will stop wiggling and apps can be opened again.|$|R
50|$|Knight {{contended that}} per the Copyright Act of 1976, his {{uploading}} of the <b>Web</b> Junk 20 <b>clip</b> featuring his own commercial satisfied the four criteria for fair use. and that VH1's segment was a derivative {{work of his}} own, since the <b>Web</b> Junk 20 <b>clip</b> was based on Knight's original commercial and could not have existed without it. Viacom countered that the <b>Web</b> Junk 20 <b>clip</b> was indeed its own copyrighted material, acknowledging that although it used the commercial that Knight had produced himself, that VH1 had added Aries Spears's image and commentary. Viacom asserted that this {{was enough to make}} the entire content of the <b>Web</b> Junk 20 <b>clip,</b> including use of Knight's commercial, their own material protected under copyright.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the World Wide Web {{continued}} to gain popularity as a retail software distribution channel, and several companies pioneered {{the sale of}} clip art through online, searchable libraries, including Clipart.com (part of Jupiter Media), WeddingClipart.com (part of Letters and Arts Incorporated), and GraphicsFactory.com (part of Clip Art Incorporated). Because of the <b>Web,</b> <b>clip</b> art is now not only sold through retail channels as packaged bundles of images, but also as individual images and subscriptions to entire libraries (which allow you to download an unlimited number of images {{for the duration of}} the subscription).|$|R

One {{of these is}} <b>Web</b> <b>Clip,</b> which allows any user to turn a rectangular section of any webpage into a widget (This, however, only works with [...] the Safari Web Browser). The widget updates as the website does, and all links and other interactive material in the widget's selection of the webpage works as if the website is being accessed from the Safari Web Browser. Another new widget is Movies, which allows users to find currently playing movies at local theaters, view trailers, and purchase tickets directly from Dashboard.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} {{areas of}} extraction {{and integration of}} web data aim at delivery of tools and methods to extract pieces of information from third-party web sites and then to integrate them into profiled, domain-specific, custom web pages. Existing solutions rely on specialized APIs or XPath querying tools and are therefore not easily accessible to non technical end users. In this paper we describe our new comprehensive, non-XPath integration platform which allows end users to extract web page fragments using a simple query-by-example approach and then to combine these fragments into custom, integrated web pages. We focus on our two novel similarity-based <b>web</b> <b>clip</b> matching algorithms: Attribute Weight...|$|R
5000|$|A {{combination}} of a fakie laser flip (360 Heelflip) and a frontside half-cab. The invention of this trick has been credited to professional skateboarder Rick Howard; however, Howard has publicly stated {{that he does not}} appreciate the recognition, as he does not believe that he is the trick's inventor. Song has executed the trick numerous times during the period from 2011 to early 2013 (X Games Real Street, 5-Incher, 5-Incher B-Side Edit, [...] "iFun" [...] <b>web</b> <b>clip,</b> and [...] "Who Is Daewon Song?"). Early in his career, Song also performed the trick on transition without the tail hitting the ground—as is usually the case in skateboarding—and the trick also appears in his World Industries Love Child video part.|$|R
50|$|Users {{can also}} add and delete icons from the dock, {{which is the}} same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the first {{generation}} iPhone, 3G, 4 and 4S, while each home screen for iPhone 5 holds up to twenty-four icons due to a larger screen display, and the dock holds up to four icons. Users can delete <b>Web</b> <b>Clips</b> and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes.
