40|$|The {{characterization}} of human drivers ’ performance {{is of great}} significance for highway design, driver state monitoring, {{and the development of}} automotive active safety systems. Many earlier studies are restricted by experimental scope, the number and diversity of human subjects, and the accuracy and extent of measured variables. In this <b>work,</b> <b>driver</b> lateral control performance on limited-access highways is quantified by utilizing a comprehensive naturalistic driving database, with the emphasis on measures of vehicle lateral position and time to lane crossing (TLC). Normative values at various speed ranges are reported. The results represent a statistical view of baseline on-road naturalistic driving performance, and can be used for quantitative studies such as driver impairment and alertness monitoring, the triggering of lane departure warning systems, and highway design...|$|E

40|$|Work {{capacity}} has a weak correlation {{to disease}} concepts, which are insufficient to explain sick leave behavior. With data mainly from Sweden, a welfare state with high sickness absence rates, our {{aim was to}} develop an explanatory theory of work and sick leave. We used classic grounded theory for analyzing data from 130 individual interviews of people working or on sick leave, physicians, social security officers, and literature. More than 60, 000 words and hundreds of typed and handwritten memos were the basis for the writing up of the theory. In this paper we present a theory of “reincentivizing work”. To understand incentives we define work disability as hurt <b>work</b> <b>drivers</b> or <b>work</b> traps. <b>Work</b> <b>drivers</b> are specified as work capacities + work motivators, monetary and non-monetary. Incentives are recognized when hurt <b>work</b> <b>drivers</b> are assessed and traps identified. Reincentivizing is done by repairing hurt <b>work</b> <b>drivers</b> and releasing from traps. In our theory of reincentivizing <b>work,</b> hurt <b>work</b> <b>drivers</b> and traps are recognized and then repaired and released. The theory may add to social psychological research on work and sickness absence, and possibly inform future changes in sick leave policies...|$|R
