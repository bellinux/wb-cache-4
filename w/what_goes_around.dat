Fischer stated that he was happy that the {{airliner}} attacks had happened, while expressing his view on U.S. and Israeli foreign policy, saying [...] "I applaud the act. Look, nobody gets... that the U.S. and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians... for years." [...] He also said [...] "The horrible behavior that the U.S. is committing all over the world... This just shows you, that <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>around,</b> comes around even for the United States." [...] Fischer also referenced the movie Seven Days in May and said he hoped for a military coup d'état in the U.S., [...] " [...] {{the country will be}} taken over by the military, they'll close down all the synagogues, arrest all the Jews, execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders." [...] In response to Fischer's statements about 9/11, the U.S. Chess Federation passed a motion to cancel his right to membership in the organization. Fischer's right to become a member was reinstated in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|An {{admission}} that the tackle {{was in fact}} a premeditated assault, it left the FA with no choice but to charge Keane with bringing the game into disrepute. He was banned for a further five matches and fined £150,000 in the ensuing investigation. Despite widespread condemnation, he later maintained {{in an interview that he}} had no regrets about the incident: [...] "My attitude was, fuck him. <b>What</b> <b>goes</b> <b>around</b> comes around. He got his just rewards. He fucked me over and my attitude is an eye for an eye," [...] and said he would probably do the same thing again.|$|E

2500|$|Rahane {{made his}} first Test ton at Basin Reserve, Wellington, New Zealand on 15 February 2014 against New Zealand. India was in a {{difficult}} position when Rahane came to the crease at 156 for five {{and by the time he}} departed with 118 India were in a match-winning position ruined by Brendon McCullum's famous triple-century. [...] "He had a mountain of first-class runs backing him, of course, but did he have <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>around</b> by the queer name of X-factor? Did he have that extra edge in his game and personality that separates top-class international players from the rest? Was he merely humble, or was he unable to assert himself, unable to absorb real pressure? After his first two Test tours to South Africa and New Zealand, we can safely conclude it must be the former. Underneath that seemingly soft exterior lurks a solid Test batsman, and he was on display at the Basin Reserve", ESPN Cricinfo wrote in their analysis.|$|E
