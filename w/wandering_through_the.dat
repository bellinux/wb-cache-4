His mission was to observe humankind in its most representative state, frequently <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets incognito among the masses of Parisian society to undertake his research. He used incidents from his life and the people around him, in works like Eugénie Grandet and Louis Lambert.|$|E

Frederick, however, is jealous of Adolf and Ervine's relationship and entices the workers at van Kempen's plantation to go on strike until Adolf is fired. Although heartbroken, van Kempen must fire his son.|$|E

At around the same time he lost his parents, he met Lisianthus and Nerine at different times who each were accompanying their fathers on a diplomatic business in the human world.

25|$|Born Albert Léon Gleizes {{and raised}} in Paris, {{he was the son}} of a fabric {{designer}} who ran a large industrial design workshop. He was also the nephew of Léon Comerre, a successful portrait painter who won the 1875 Prix de Rome. The young Albert Gleizes did not like school and often skipped classes to idle away the time writing poetry and <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> nearby Montmartre cemetery. Finally, after completing his secondary schooling, Gleizes spent four years in the 72nd Infantry Regiment of the French army (Abbeville, Picardie) then began pursuing a career as a painter. Gleizes began to paint self-taught around 1901 in the Impressionist tradition. His first landscapes from around Courbevoie appear particularly inspired by Alfred Sisley or Camille Pissarro. Although clearly related to Pissarro in technique, Gleizes' particular view-points as well as the composition and conception of early works represent a clear departure from the style of late Impressionism. The density with which these works are painted and their solid framework suggest affinities with Divisionism which were often noted by early critics.|$|E

500|$|Dozens of hand-painted banners {{with such}} slogans as [...] "Disco sucks" [...] were {{hung from the}} ballpark's seating decks.

[...] The miasma permeated the press box, which both Caray and his broadcast partner, Jimmy Piersall, commented on over the air. The crowds outside the stadium threw records as well, or gathered them together and burned them in bonfires. Detroit won the first game, 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} redemptive ballad for the {{personal}} themes and lyrics which were {{a snapshot of}} Diddy's life.

Singled out as one of the album's highlights, [...] "Coming Home" [...] was promoted with live TV performances including at the American Music Awards on November 21, 2010, the WWE Tribute to the Troops concert, and the March 10, 2011 episode of American Idol which marked the first live performance of the song featuring Skylar Grey.

500|$|Two other {{episodes in}} the Buffy canon are also based on, or have {{elements}} of, fairy tales: [...] "Killed by Death", where only sick children {{can see a}} demon who sucks away their lives, and [...] "Gingerbread", where a demon takes on the forms of Hansel and Gretel to create a moral panic in Sunnydale. [...] "Hush" [...] is often compared to these episodes because they contain similar elements. Whedon intended The Gentlemen to be Brothers Grimm-like monsters, with Giles {{playing the role of}} the wise man, Buffy the princess, and Tara the [...] "little girl <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> woods". In this incarnation, however, Buffy is a swashbuckling princess whose scream saves the town. Instead of being the damsel in distress she is the hero, breaking through a boarded-up window in the belfry, then grabbing a rope and swinging across the room to kill one of The Gentlemen's footmen by smashing her feet into his chest.|$|E

500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
500|$|On 10 May 1943, Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Heinz, {{commander}} of the 4th Regiment of the Brandenburg Division, met Đurišić at Kolašin {{with the intent of}} engaging him to help the Germans against the Partisans. Đurišić said he was willing to do this, and once the Partisans were defeated he said he would be ready to fight alongside the Germans on the Russian Front. During the meeting, Đurišić told Heinz that Mihailović had left Kolašin at the end of 1942 and that he refused to accept Mihailović's current policy. Đurišić said Mihailović had been distracted by propaganda and was over-rated, and described him as [...] "an unsteady visionary <b>wandering</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> land". Đurišić also said Josip Broz Tito and his Partisans were the only serious enemy. On 11 May 1943, Heinz submitted a proposal to General der Infanterie (Lieutenant General) Rudolf Lüters, the German Commanding General in Croatia, regarding the Chetniks who had been [...] "legalised" [...] by the Italians. He suggested the Germans also [...] "legalise" [...] Đurišić's Chetniks and use them to disarm [...] "non-legalised" [...] Chetniks groups. Heinz also proposed that after the Partisans had been destroyed, the Germans [...] "legalise" [...] only weak detachments of Đurišić's Chetniks. Subsequent events indicate Heinz's approach to Đurišić may not have been authorised by his superiors and that his suggestions were not acted upon.|$|E

Too bad they didn't mail them to the insurance company instead of filming them." [...] The film is on Ebert's [...] "Most Hated" [...] list. Caryn James of The New York Times wrote that the film was [...] "the very poor cousin of a dopey Jim Carrey movie". Owen Gleiberman graded the film a [...] "C" [...] on an A+ to F scale, and Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress said that it was [...] "nothing great." [...] Bo Derek was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress.|$|E
