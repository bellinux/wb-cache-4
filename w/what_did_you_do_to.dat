But {{what strikes}} me as being so interesting is that we appear to feel remorse for our misdeeds; and I was almost persuaded the other day by an observer of our species, that remorse had gone out, or rather had never existed, except in the fancy of innocent people; that real criminals like ourselves were afraid of being found out, but weren't in the least sorry. Perhaps, if we are sorry, it proves that we needn't be. Let's judge each other. I've told you what my sin against Barker is, and I know yours in general terms.

50|$|The Sapphic stanza's {{scheme was}} so {{attractive}} to Polish poets that {{they started to}} modify it, and many stanzas based on {{it can be found}} in Polish literature. Already in the 16th century Jan Kochanowski created a three-line stanza, being just a shortened Sapphic stanza (11/11/5), and used it in his Psalm 34. Much later Kochanowski's proposal was used by Cyprian Kamil Norwid in his famous poem Coś ty Atenom zrobił, Sokratesie? (<b>What</b> <b>Did</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> <b>to</b> Athens, Socrates?)Juliusz Słowacki, a romantic poet, frequently used a sexain rhyming a b a b c c, and invented a stanza using this rhyme scheme but suggesting the Sapphic stanza in its metre: 11a/11b/11a/5b/11c/5c.|$|E

After an argument with Ross, Blonsky loses control and transforms into a massive reptilian-like creature. Having become what he hates - a mutant - Blonsky dubs himself the Abomination. The Abomination goes on a rampage until the Hulk arrives, then says [...] "Banner, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> me you freak? You've turned me into an Abomination." [...] Although the Abomination is the stronger of the two, his transformation is not fully stable, and the Hulk beats him in combat knocking him into the wall causing the wall to fall on top of Blonsky. When the battle is over, Blonsky transforms to his human form before his men can arrive and blames the Abomination's rampage on the Hulk.|$|E
