5|$|Various chromatographic {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to detect psilocin in body fluids: the rapid emergency drug identification system (REMEDi HS), a drug screening method based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration), the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction, followed by derivatization of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific immunoassay has also been developed to detect psilocin in <b>whole</b> <b>blood</b> samples. A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in clinical settings.|$|E

40|$|A {{miniaturized}} fiber-optic laser Doppler velocimetry sensor {{has been}} developed to measure the local blood velocity in vivo. The laser beam emitted from the sensor tip can be focused at any distance between 0. 1 and 0. 5 [*]mm from the tip. Consequently, the sensor has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to measure the local velocity in almost any opaque fluid, including blood. The sensor head is inserted in an injection needle or a catheter tube. In the former case, it is inserted {{at an angle to}} the wall of a vessel and is scanned across the vessel to measure the velocity distribution. In the latter case, it is aligned parallel with the flow in a vessel. For all flows of <b>whole</b> human <b>blood,</b> <b>whole</b> caprine <b>blood,</b> and 69 % hematocrit of bovine blood, the velocity distribution across the vessel could be measured very accurately. The insertion angle of the fiber into the flow significantly affects the measurement accuracy; an angle of about 50 ° is suitable when an injection needle is used. When a catheter is employed, an insertion direction opposite to the flow direction is better than parallel to the flow due to the generation of a wake behind the fiber...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{gives the}} results of a series of {{experiments}} made with a special technique for the purpose of testing whether or not so called antiblastic phenomena or bactericidal phenomena play any part in immunity to pneumococcus. The technique employed is that devised by the writer and consists in the isolation of single bacteria and their growth in hanging drops where growth can be continuously observed. From these experiments it may be concluded that: (1) <b>Whole</b> fresh <b>blood,</b> coagulated plasma, or serum of the immunized horse added directly to pneumococci, has considerable inhibiting action on the growth of pneumococci. The inhibiting effect of the fresh blood, coagulated plasma, or serum of a normal horse, however, is as marked as that of a horse highly immunized to pneumococci of the same type. This property, therefore, {{does not seem to be}} of importance in acquired immunity in the horse.

Blockage of lysyl residues and subsequent tryptic hydrolysis at arginyl residues permitted the isolation of fragments containing residues 105 through 146.

40|$|The {{influence}} of different storage temperatures and anticoagulation {{conditions on the}} HIV- 1 RNA load as measured by NASBA-QT was examined. Blood specimens from 14 HIV- 1 infected individuals were processed within 2 h after collection. The HIV- 1 RNA load remained stable for at least 6 months when samples were frozen directly at - 70 degrees C in lysis buffer. This lysis buffer fully inactivated the virus. When <b>whole</b> EDTA <b>blood</b> was stored, the HIV- 1 RNA load was stable for 72 h at 25 degrees C, but it declined within 24 h at 4 degrees C. The HIV- 1 RNA load in <b>whole</b> heparinized <b>blood</b> declined significantly after 24 h at both 4 and 25 degrees C.

At + 30 degrees C, however, the load declined significantly after 2 days. Of clinical significance, the mean load in EDTA plasma was 0. 5 log ml- 1 higher than in serum. This difference was patient dependent (range 0. 1 - 0. 7 log ml- 1).

40|$|P>Aim Short-term and {{long-term}} {{evaluation of the}} effect of <b>whole</b> human <b>blood</b> or serum contamination on the surface microhardness value and microstructure of white and grey mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA). Methodology Three groups of 10 samples for each type of MTA were prepared. The first group was mixed with and exposed to fresh <b>whole</b> human <b>blood.</b> The second and third groups were mixed with distilled water and exposed to fresh <b>whole</b> human <b>blood</b> or human serum, respectively. The control group samples were mixed with and exposed to distilled water. During preparation, 1 g of MTA was triturated with 0. 33 g of the selected liquid using an amalgamator and placed inside borosilicate cylindrical moulds. The samples were treated with ultrasonic energy. Vickers surface microhardness values were compared after 4 and 180 days. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was performed after 4 days. Results White MTA had a greater microhardness value than grey MTA in all groups. There was {{a significant difference between the}} control and the experimental groups (P < 0. 00001). There was no significant difference between the microhardness values obtained after 4 and 180 days, apart from grey MTA mixed with blood or exposed to serum (P < 0. 00001). SEM analysis showed the contaminated samples were devoid of acicular crystals that were prominent in the control groups. Conclusion Blood contamination had a detrimental effect on the surface microhardness of MTA in the short and long term.
