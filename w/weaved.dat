5|$|The {{arts and}} crafts of Marrakesh have had a wide and {{enduring}} impact on Moroccan handicrafts to the present day. Riad décor is widely used in carpets and textiles, ceramics, woodwork, metal work and zelij. Carpets and textiles are <b>weaved,</b> sewn or embroidered, sometimes used for upholstering. Moroccan women who practice craftsmanship are known as Maalems (expert craftspeople) and make such fine products as Berber carpets and shawls made of sabra (cactus silk). Ceramics are in monochrome Berber-style only, a limited tradition depicting bold forms and decorations.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after {{crossing}} into Vaughan, Highway407 encounters {{the first}} of three large interchanges with other 400-series highways in York Region. The Highway427 interchange is a four-level partial stack located just north of Steeles Avenue in Vaughan and adjacent to the 407 ETR Concession Company offices. The interchange features <b>weaved</b> ramps which connect to former Highway27, located just east. The route continues eastward, parallel and between Steeles Avenue and Highway7. It dives through the Humber River valley alongside a CN line and along the northern border of Thackeray Conservation Lands, passing beneath a CP line. After an interchange with Pine Valley Drive (York Regional Road57), the route becomes sandwiched between the industrial lands of the Pine Valley Business Park and the Emery Creek Corporate Park. A partial interchange with Weston Road (York Regional Road56) lies just west of the large four-level stack interchange with Highway400, the only of its kind in Ontario. An interchange with Jane Street (York Regional Road55) is interwoven into {{the east side of the}} Highway400 interchange, below which pass the completed tunnels of the currently under-construction future Line 1 Yonge–University subway line.|$|E
5|$|The third {{practice}} session on Saturday morning was disrupted by two red flag periods. Twenty minutes into practice, Felipe Nasr {{lost control of}} his car when he <b>weaved</b> {{from side to side}} on track to increase his tyre temperatures while his drag reduction system (DRS) was open on {{the first part of the}} Casino straight, and crashed into the barrier at the inside of the track. After the red flag was lifted, only twelve minutes of the session remained and all drivers took to the track to try out the super-soft compound. This did not last long however, as Jenson Button had to park his car at turn seven, reporting a problem with his power unit. This brought out the red flag once again, effectively ending the session. Nico Rosberg was fastest, half a second ahead of Räikkönen, while Hamilton drove just nine laps, ending the practice with the slowest time set.|$|E

5|$|Many {{scholars}} who needed additional funds for education or vied for political office found farming as a decent profession which, although humble, was not {{looked down upon}} by fellow gentrymen. Wealthy nobles, officials, and merchants could own land, but they often did not cultivate it themselves and merely acted as absentee landlords while living in the city. They mostly relied on poor tenant farmers (diannong 佃農) who paid rent {{in the form of}} roughly fifty percent of their produce in exchange for land, tools, draft animals, and a small house. Wage laborers (gunong 雇農) and slaves were also employed on the estates of the wealthy, although they were not as numerous as tenants. During Western Han, the small independent owner-cultivator represented the majority of farming peasants, yet their economic struggle to remain independent during times of war, natural disaster and crisis drove many into debt, banditry, slavery, and dramatically increased the number of landless tenants by late Eastern Han. The social status of poor independent owner-cultivators was above tenants and wage laborers, yet below that of wealthy landowners. While wealthy landowners employed tenants and wage laborers, landowners who managed small to medium-sized estates often acted as managers over their sons who tilled the fields and daughters who <b>weaved</b> clothes and engaged in sericulture to produce silk for the home or sale at market.|$|E
