5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a <b>water</b> <b>sample</b> allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E

40|$|Background: Domestic {{water storage}} {{containers}} constitute major Aedes aegypti breeding sites. We {{present for the}} first time a comparative analysis of the bacterial communities associated with Ae. aegypti larvae and water from domestic water containers. Methods: The 16 S rRNA-temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) was used to identify and compare bacterial communities in fourth-instar Ae. aegypti larvae and water from larvae positive and negative domestic containers in a rural village in northeastern Thailand. <b>Water</b> <b>samples</b> were cultured for enteric bacteria in addition to TTGE. Sequences obtained from TTGE and bacterial cultures were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for analyses. Results: Significantly lower OTU abundance was found in fourth-instar Ae. aegypti larvae compared to mosquito positive <b>water</b> <b>samples.</b> There was no significant difference in OTU abundance between larvae and mosquito negative <b>water</b> <b>samples</b> or between mosquito positive and negative <b>water</b> <b>samples.</b> Larval samples had significantly different OTU diversity compared to mosquito positive and negative <b>water</b> <b>samples,</b> with no significant difference between mosquito positive and negative <b>water</b> <b>samples.</b> The TTGE identified 24 bacterial taxa, belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and TM 7 (candidate phylum). Seven of these taxa were identified in larval samples, 16 in mosquito positive and 13 in mosquito negative <b>water</b> <b>samples.</b> Only two taxa, belonging to the phyla Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, were common to both larvae and <b>water</b> <b>samples.</b> Bacilli was the most abundant bacterial class identified from Ae. aegypti larvae, Gammaproteobacteria from mosquito positive <b>water</b> <b>samples,</b> and Flavobacteria from mosquito negative <b>water</b> <b>samples.</b> Enteric bacteria belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria were sparsely represented in TTGE, but were isolated from both mosquito positive and negative <b>water</b> <b>samples</b> by selective culture. Conclusions: Few bacteria from <b>water</b> <b>samples</b> were identified in fourth-instar Ae. aegypti larvae, suggesting that established larval bacteria, most likely acquired at earlier stages of development, control the larval microbiota. Further studies at all larval stages are needed to fully understand the dynamics involved.
