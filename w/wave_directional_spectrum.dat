40|$|High {{frequency}} surface wave radars are operated as a remote sensor to measure ocean surface parameters to ranges exceeding 200 - 300 km from the coastline. The Bragg {{peaks in the}} power spectrum of backscattered radar electromagnetic signals from ocean waves reveal the Bragg resonant effect and the second order continuum reflect a hydrodynamic and electromagnetic modulation on the radio waves from the ocean waves. The power spectrum is thus utilized to invert the ocean <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum</b> by a non-linear integral equation. Further integrations of the ocean <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum</b> yield the estimates of wave parameters: significant waveheight, mean wave period, mean direction, directional spread, etc. Beside sea echoes, non-sea echoes or interferences (collectively termed ‘clutter'), are also received by radar antenna receivers and included in the power spectrum. Clutters which occupy the second order continuum are treated as sea echoes in the inverse algorithm and cause inaccurate estimation of the ocean <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Thus clutter mitigation is {{the main purpose of}} this thesis and is intensively investigated. A three-step image processing approach is proposed in this thesis which could mitigate visible clutters, e. g. radio frequency interferences and ionospheric interferences, and also invisible clutters. The kernel implements a decomposition of the mixture space and then a projection of the mixture space into a desired subspace. In addition to this main approach, various signal processing methods are also investigated for improving the wave estimates, e. g. wavelet analysis, AR modeling, adaptive filtering algorithm. The clutter mitigation scheme is validated by operational use on a whole month of Pisces data and exhibits some improvements in the accuracy of wave estimates. To aid the operational use, a statistical pattern recognition method is also developed. Finally, the best schemes are chained together for a sequential operational use in terms of providing better wave estimation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

A continuous wave signal is emitted by the surface projector buoy and the resultant signal delays at each hydrophone provide slant range information for triangulating the buoy position. Signals from the buoy and hydrophones are recorded for later processing and analysis. A method for estimating wave amplitude, phase, and direction is also presented. Wave data obtained from a commercial bottom mounted pressure gauge serve as a reference for comparing water particle displacement measurements recorded by the instrumentation system.

The system includes two antennae rotating around a vertical axis, although only {{the results from the}} lower incidence (14 °) antenna are presented here. We also give first results from observations performed during two field campaigns held in 2013 (HyMeX and PROTEVS campaigns). Sea <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectra</b> computed by the radar from tilt modulation of σ° are consistent with those given by the <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> rider moored in the Mediterranean basin, both in terms of significant wave height Hs and main features of the wavenumber spectrum.

40|$|International audience— Simulated radar {{observations}} of the sea surface dynamics as used in the MODENA project, are based on an original methodology for sea states : the " groupy " wave model (GWM). Random wave fields can have very different modulations but nearly identical spectra. Nevertheless, the response of a floating object to waves depends strongly on the likelihood of large wave encounters. Sea surface fluxes also depend on wave breaking and air-flow separation, both being consequences of large-amplitude events. So wave group structure is one key description to simulate radar clutter under various environmental and instrumental configurations. The GWM builds on random distributions of wave groups and conditionally distributed breaking waves over these groups. Each wave group travels across the simulated area, and breaking waves appear dynamically on the wave crest {{at the rear of}} a group, propagating and disappearing at the front of this group. The generation of sea states follows a prescribed sea <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and any breaking wave statistical distribution such as Λ(c) d c describing the total length of breaker per unit area and time with phase speed between c and c + d c. Accordingly, the group density per surface unit can lead to very different sea state structures, and the results will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|High Frequency {{radar systems}} provide a unique {{opportunity}} to measure evolving littoral oceanic dynamics at high temporal and spatial resolution. Backscattered electromagnetic signals from ocean waves are modulated by Bragg resonant scattering. A perturbation analysis yields an expression for the spectral content of radar signals which can be exploited to provide estimates of oceanographic parameters: the radial component of surface current can be extracted from the frequency locations of the first order peaks; the ocean <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum</b> is related to the second order continuum via a non-linear integral equation. The periodogram, based on a Fourier decomposition of radax data, is the standard method used to derive frequency spectra. Limitations in this approach, caused by inhomogeneities in the underlying ocean field, are investigated. An instantaneous frequency technique is proposed in this thesis which mitigates the spectral distortion by demodulating the backscattered radax signals -a filtering procedure is developed which measures the temporally varying Bragg components. Alternative spectral techniques are analysed in order to validate the filter: an autoregressive paxa, metric modelling approach and an eigendecomposition method. The filter is evaluated, using radar and in situ data, which establishes its potential for ocean remote sensing. Significant improvements in the quantity and accuracy of wave measurements are demonstrated. Properties and constraints of the filter are derived using simulated data. Finally, the generic structure of the extracted instantaneous frequency signals is investigated and related to oceanographic processes. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Narrow beam bistatic high frequency (HF) radar data from the ocean surface are simulated and the non-directional ocean wave spectrum is recovered. The water depth is set to be arbitrary. Zero-mean Gaussian noise from external sources is taken into account. [...] The bistatic HF radar cross sections are applied to the general-depth water case. The second-order cross section of patch scattering is a two-dimensional Fredholm-type integral equation of first kind. It contains a non-linear product of ocean <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum</b> factors in its integrand. The energy inside the first-order cross section is derived to normalize this integrand. The unknown ocean wave spectrum is represented by truncated Fourier series. The integral equation is then converted to a matrix equation and a singular value decomposition (SVD) method is invoked to pseudo-invert the kernel matrix. The non-directional ocean wave spectrum is obtained from the Fourier coefficient α₀. [...] The zero-mean Gaussian noise from external sources is added to simulate pulsed HF radar clutter from the ocean surface. The power spectral densities of the clutter and noise are obtained {{by means of a}} periodogram. The combination of power spectral densities of clutter and noise makes the simulated bistatic radar data correspond more closely with actual observations.

None was found to be suitable. The functional and performance objectives are set out for a new system. The evolution of the final design, based on an array of pressure sensors, is described. The whole system is intended to be deployed on the sea-bed. It is fully self contained and independent of shore based services. Located away from the surf zone it is well placed to survive storm conditions and unauthorised interference.

The system has given extensive service at a number of coastal defence sites. The results of subsequent analysis of selected data sets are presented in detail. They show the pronounced nodal structure in amplitude expected in the presence of wave reflection, clearly demonstrating that a single point measurement is likely to give misleading estimates of incident wave height. For near-calm to moderate, shore-normal incident wave conditions the results were found to agree with theoretical predictions both of wave height as a function of distance offshore, and of the structure's frequency-dependent reflection coefficient. For rougher conditions, in which both theoretical and physical models are less applicable, the results agreed with visual observations...|$|E
40|$|The {{direction}} of the sea waves is a difficult parameter to measure on the coast because the wave transformation process can redistribute the energy in very different directions {{with respect to the}} incident waves from deep waters. A practical way to estimate the wave direction is using numeric techniques i. e. the inverse method, which consists in backward ray tracing (inverse refraction), obtaining the inverse direction function and the swell’s refracted <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum</b> a fixed point in shallow water to deep water. The inverse method was used to estimate the wave directions of distant swell that can potentially arrive with high energy to the important touristic zone of Playa Miramar, Tamaulipas, characterizing the swell according to wind conditions, such as, calm, average, cold front and storm. In this work, the convention used for directions, is that indicating the azimuth from the incoming waves. In general, the calculated directional swell spectra, it can be suggested that the directions with high wave energy that approximate from sea range between from 100 ° to 160 ° (quadrant ENE-SSE approximately) and arrive to Playa Miramar between 108 ° and 130 °. Additionally, the range of the numerically directions obtained for Playa Miramar, as well as the range of discussed frequencies were compared with the corresponding from virtual buoys that represent numeric results from the WAVEWATCH-III model of wave propagation. The results from these comparisons are that the interval of directions obtained (15 ° – 130 °) is localized within the corresponding to virtual buoys (0 ° – 174 °), while that range frequencies considerate are localized outside of the buoys (0. 097 Hz – 0. 380 Hz) for low frequencies...|$|E

40|$|The remote {{monitoring}} of the coastal ocean has been a topic receiving much attention from both the scientific and industrial communities in recent years. Among the many devices which {{have come to the}} forefront in providing comprehensive information on ocean surface paramenters is the HF radar operating in the ground wave mode. In particular, a four-element square array known as a CODAR (Coastal Oceans Dynamics Applications Radar) has successfully produced near-shore current maps. The problem addressed in this thesis is that of molding existing theory so as to create an algorithm which would extend the capabilities of this CODAR to include the yielding of directional waveheight spectra from backscattered radiation. [...] General expressions for the first- and second-order broad beam radar cross sections of the ocean surface presented by Barrick and Lipa (1979 b) are applied to the four-element CODAR. Fourier coefficients of both the first- and second-order portions of the radar spectrum are developed with {{all but one of the}} various required integrations being carried out in closed form. The Fourier basis function approach allows the broad beam cross sections to be written as a system of integral equations. The second-order radar return involves a double integral whose integrand contains nonlinear combinations of the unknowns, namely the Fourier coefficients of the ocean <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum.</b> The first-order portion of the radar spectrum is used to linearize this integral, thus allowing the system of equations to be formulated in terms of matrices. The matrix system is solved using a singular value decomposition approach. [...] The analysis is carried out in its entirety for simulated data only.

40|$|Drag {{coefficient}} Cd {{is one of}} {{the most}} important properties used in modelling the air-sea interactions. Most of the dependences employ the sea drag as a function of wind speed U 10. Coupling between the atmospheric boundary layer and the ocean surface is usually parameterised in terms of the drag coefficient Cd, T=Pau 2 =paC 10 U 210 (1), where where T is the wind stress at the ocean surface, Pa is the air density, U 10 is the wind speed measured at standard 10 m height and u is the friction velocity. Routinely, C 10 is parameterized as a function of mean wind speed U 10, but the scatter of experimental data around such parametric dependences is very significant and has not improved noticeably over some 30 years. This scatter imposes a serious limitation on predictions that make use of seasurface-drag parameterisations. Babanin and Makin (2008) suggested that, apart from the wind speed, C 10 depends on a number of other physical properties and phenomena, whose effect on the sea drag should be investigated and incorporated in the final parameterisation in order to reduce the scatter. These properties include, among possible others, the directional spreading of the surface waves. The aim of the present study is to investigate the drag coefficient as a function of such angular spreading. This will be first done by means of numerical modelling with WBLM (Wave Boundary Layer Model, Chalikov and Rainchik, 2010). 1 -D equations derived by Chalikov and Rainchik are used here for extensive calculations of WBL structure in order to investigate dependence of the drag coefficient on wind speed for different directional wave spectra. The results will then be compared with the field measurements conducted during the Lake George experiment (Young et al., 2005, Babanin and Makin, 2008). In the Conclusion, we should say that the wind speed is not the only a parameter which can influence the sea drag coefficient. In particular, in this paper dependence of C 10 on directional spreading of surface waves was investigated. It is shown that this coefficient increases with higher directional widths and stronger wind forcing. Influence of the <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectrum</b> on the sea drag was analysed for the first time, and it is very essential. Comparisons show that the WBL Model and Lake George field experimental data agree, where available, and this fact supports the model and the analysis of sea-drag dependences and asymptotic behaviours. Account for the directional spread is therefore essential to predict the sea drag accurately and to improve parameterisations of C 10. It is apparent that scatter of existing parameterisations cannot be reduced by increasing measurement accuracy; it needs understanding and parameterising multiple physical influences, including the wave directionality...|$|E

40|$|To {{prepare and}} conduct shore {{operations}} in safe environment, {{it is important}} to possess an accurate sea state forecast. In this thesis it is assessed whether it is possible to estimate the real time sea state at a vessel, without using any instruments deployed in the water. As a matter of fact, in-situ measurements are not always possible, for example during pipeline installation, the vessel sails a few kilometres a day, therefore the options are restricted to methods which do not include in-situ instruments. To test and validate the methods developed in this thesis real time measurements were performed on the Audacia, a pipeline installation vessel belonging to Allseas, one of the world leaders in pipeline installation. The Audacia was laying pipe nearby the coast of Australia, close to wave buoy in the Julimar Field. Methods to extract wave field information from conventional nautical radars have been developed. It is possible to estimate a <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum</b> by using a temporal sequence of radar images, and following, statistical data representative of the sea state, such as the significant wave height and wave direction. However there is no unique relation between the radar images and the amount of energy in the <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum,</b> which result in an inaccurate signififcant wave height. In order to improve the <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum</b> estimations given by the X-Band radar used on board of the Audacia (Wavex from Miros), the possibility of using an extra measuring instrument to calibrate the energy is investigated. Two measuring devices are considered. - A down looking radar, recently installed below the helideck of the Audacia, measuring the single point surface elevation in vicinity of the vessel. (Radac WaveGuide) - The MRU sensors, which measure the wave induced vessel motions. (Ixsea Octans) It is investigated whether combining the data measured by one or the other device to the Xband radar data result in an improvement of the radar estimated <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and which combination gives the best results. Method 1 : Use the down looking radar measurements. The one dimensional wave spectrum given by Radac is combined with the <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum</b> given by Wavex. Since the Radac measurement are performed close to the vessel, the water surface is disturbed. In order to use the Radac to improve the estimated wave spectrum these disturbance have to be taken into account. It is possible to determine a frequency dependent ratio between the amount of energy in each frequency band of the different instruments. This frequency dependent ratio is used to correct the estimated amount of energy at each frequency of the <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Method 2 : Use the vessel motion measurements. In this method the measured wave induced vessel motions measured by the MRU are combined with the <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum</b> given by Wavex. To be able to calibrate the amount of energy in the <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum,</b> the radar wave spectrum has to be converted into vessel motions spectra. 1 Since the responses are assumed to have a linear relation with the incident wave, the ratio between the measured energy and the expected energy in the responses can be used to correct the energy estimation in the <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum</b> in a linear way. After correcting the estimated <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum</b> with the two methods described above, the significant wave height was calculated and compared to the significant wave height given by the wave buoy in the Julimar Field. The significant wave height based on method one has a strong correlation to the significant wave height measured by the wave buoy in the Julimar Field. Method two showed that the significant wave height obtained by combining the wave field information from the nautical radar with the measured vessel motions has a less strong correlation to the significant wave height measured by the wave buoy. However, the wave spectrum given by the X-Band radar can be significantly improved in the frequency band in which the vessel responds to incident waves. floating structuresoffshore and dredging engineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The ocean near surface kinematics were measured {{as part of}} the SAXON experiment during the period from 5 to 14 October 1988. A growing wave field due to a passing front with winds up to 17 ms'^ occurred during the first 5 days. A wide range of wind forcing and wave conditions occured during the measurement period. Two orthogonal components of the horizontal velocity were measured using an electromagnetic current meter. The <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> field was measured using a high resolution 2 meter square slope array. The classical Longuet-Higgins et al (1963) method of computing <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectra</b> and the new exact Fourier coefficients representation method (Grauzinis, 1989) are used to compute <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectra.</b> The new method of computing <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectra,</b> which represents bi-modal distributions of wave energy exactly matching the measured Fourier coefficients to second order, demonstrated improved performance over the classical technique. Phase functions between the sea surface elevation and horizontal velocity components compared well with the results predicted by Unear wave theory. The coherence function of the horizontal velocity components and the sea surface elevation confirmed the dependence on the wave field directivity. Spectra of the sea surface elevation computed from pressure and horizontal velocity data compared well using linear theory transfer functions. [URL] Portuguese Nav...|$|R
40|$|The SCR {{was asked}} to {{participate}} in the Frontal Air-Sea Interaction Experiment (FASINEX) to provide <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectra.</b> The NASA P- 3 carrying the SCR, the Radar Ocean Wave Spectrometer, and the Airborne Oceanographic Lidar was one of five aircrafts and two ocean research ships participating in this coordinated study of the air sea interaction in the vicinity of a sea surface temperature front near 28 deg N, 70 deg W. Analysis of data from the February 1986 experiment is still ongoing, but results already submitted for publication strengthen the hypothesis that off-nadir radar backscatter is closely correlated to wind stress. The SCR provided valuable information on the <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum</b> and its spatial variation...|$|R
40|$|Develop and/or {{modify the}} {{real-time}} operating system and analysis techniques and {{programs of the}} NASA Scanning Radar Altimeter (SRA) to process the SRA wave topography data into <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectra</b> during hurricane flights. Upload the spectra and the topography onto a web site immediately post-flight to make them available to ONR investigators. APPROACH The SRA has a long heritage in measuring the energetic portion of the sea surface <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum</b> (Walsh et al. 1985; 1989; 1996, 2002; Wright et al. 2001). The wave spectra {{have been used to}} assess the output of the WaveWatch III numerical wave model (Moon et al., 2003; Fan et al., 2007). To obtain the <b>directional</b> <b>wave</b> <b>spectrum,</b> the energy in the encounter spectrum generated from the SRA wave topography must be doubled everywhere, the artifact lobes deleted, and the real lobes Doppler-corrected. Identifying the artifact lobes for deletion and partitioning the real spectral lobes into the various wave components has been a slow and labor-intensive process and efforts have been made toward eliminating operator decisions in that process to enable unattended operation.

40|$|A {{practical}} {{method is}} suggested to quantitatively retrieve <b>directional</b> <b>spectra</b> of ocean surface waves from high-resolution satellite sun glitter imagery (SSGI). The method builds on direct {{determination of the}} imaging transfer function from the large-scale smoothed shape of sun glitter. Observed brightness modulations are then converted into sea surface elevations to perform directional spectral analysis. The method {{is applied to the}} Copernicus Sentinel- 2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) measurements. Owing to the specific instrumental configuration of MSI (which has a primary mission dedicated to mapping of land surfaces), a physical angular difference between channel detectors on the instrument focal plane array can be used to efficiently determine the surface brightness gradients in two directions, i. e., in sensor zenith and azimuthal directions. In addition, the detector configuration of MSI means that a small temporal lag between channel acquisitions exists. This feature can be exploited to detect surface waves and infer their space-time characteristics using cross-channel correlation. We demonstrate how this can be used to remove directional ambiguity in 2 -D detected wave spectra and to obtain information describing local dispersion relation of surface <b>waves.</b> <b>Directional</b> <b>spectra</b> derived from Sentinel- 2 MSI SSGI are compared with in situ buoy measurements. We report an encouraging agreement between SSGI-derived wave spectra and in situ measurements...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} is presented for measuring ocean <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectra</b> from aircraft using microwave Doppler radar. The technique involves backscattering coherent microwave radiation from {{a patch of}} sea surface which is small compared to dominant ocean wavelengths in the antenna look direction, and large compared to these lengths in the perpendicular (azimuthal) direction. The mean Doppler shift of the return signal measured over short time intervals {{is proportional to the}} mean sea surface velocity of the illuminated patch. Variable sea surface velocities induced by wave motion therefore produce time-varying Doppler shifts in the received signal. The large azimuthal dimension of the patch implies that these variations must be produced by surface waves traveling near the horizontal antenna look direction thus allowing determination of the direction of wave travel. Linear wave theory is used to convert the measured velocities into ocean wave spectral densities. Spectra measured simultaneously with this technique and two laser profilometers, and nearly simultaneous with this technique and two laser profilometers, and nearly simultaneous with a surface buoy, are presented. Applications and limitations of this airborne Doppler technique are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{conducted}} {{experiments in}} the large wind-wave tank at IRPHE to examine the influence of longer waves propagating at oblique angles to the wind direction on microwave backscattering. Measurements were made of wind, <b>wave</b> <b>directional</b> <b>spectra,</b> and cross sections from a 13. 5 -GHz scatterometer at 30 ° from nadir incidence angle. the authors characterize the scatterometric azimuthal scans {{with respect to the}} magnitude and the direction of the maximum backscattered power. Scans of solely wind waves are used to assess the effects of oblique waves, for which the scans yield trends that are related to the oblique-wave direction relative to the wind and the oblique-wave steepness. In particular, cross-section maxima are enhanced by oblique waves and the direction of maxima rotates from the wind axis toward the oblique-wave direction. These scatterometer data, in addition to other oblique-wave studies, led the authors to conclude that wind vectors produced from standard retrieval algorithms for scatterometers should be used with prudence in regions with significant veering winds, such as near meteorological front...|$|R
