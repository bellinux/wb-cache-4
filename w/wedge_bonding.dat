40|$|Flip-chip {{assembly}} and wire bonding {{are the principal}} methods for interconnecting ICs. While each offers strong advantages in certain types of applications, packaging is continuing to evolve into a segmented marketplace, with several factors dictating the most appropriate means of interconnection. CCost, performance and form factor havebecome the key drivers in selecting betweenwire bonding and flip-chip bonding as the“preferred ” IC interconnecting method. Applications such as cellular telecom-munications and wearable portable consumer electronics often {{require the use of}} flip-chip packaging for its small form factor and, in some cases, high speed. In other cases, typically with I/Os in the range of 100 – 600, the existing infrastructure, flexibility and materials/substrate costs of wire bonding provide dominant advantages. Further segmentation is provided by the emergence of several intermediate hybrid interconnect alternatives, such as stud/ball bumping 1, gold and aluminum ribbon <b>wedge</b> <b>bonding,</b> under-bump metalization (UBM) that can be both bumped and wire bonded, wafer-level packages (WLP) with and without underfill, Direct-Chip Attach (DCA) or CSP packaging. Wire-bonded CSPs take advantage of the existing infrastructure to produce packages with near-chip-size form factors 2. These alternatives currently are less widely used and will not be addressed in detail in this article. Figure 1 summarizes the technology choices and associated design issues that typically determine packaging strategy 3. Cost underlies all initial package choices, and cost reduction pressures continue over a product’s lifetime. Table 1 lists advantages for flip-chip and wire bonding. Many of the advantages depend on the specific application details. Often, both processes offer advantages. An example is cost. The total cost for a wire-bonded package in the < 600 -I/O range is typically much less than for an equivalent flip-chip package. But for a high-volume application, with chips designed and die size minimized to take advantage of flip-chip’s efficient use of silicon real estate, wafer cost reductions can significantly lower the total cost per flip-chip package below that of the com-parable wire bonded package...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{transversal force}} transmitted to a chip during ultrasonic bonding {{is derived from}} measurements of the vibration amplitude at the tool tip and the die edge. To proof the derivation, the transversal force is measured as well {{by means of a}} microsensor, which is sensitive to the stress field in the silicon die. The force measured by the microsensor is further referred to as "y-force" To Al-metalized test pads with the integrated microsensors, AlSi 1 wire of 25 mu m diameter was bonded using a wedge/wedge auto-bonder. Measurements of the vibration amplitudes and the y-force during bonding were conducted for nine different bonding parameter settings of force and ultrasound (us) amplitude. They confirm a theory for the friction cleaning phase as it was described earlier and will be partially presented here. Compared to earlier measurements of Au-ball-bonds, the results largely show the same behavior and imply that us <b>wedge</b> <b>bonding</b> and thermosonic ball bonding are similar processes. Furthermore, the data approves former interpretations of the bonding process starting with a stiction phase. A clear break off point was found in all pad amplitude measurements, which is followed by a friction plateau that implicates the need of a minimum friction cleaning power. The discussion made in this paper is interesting fora bond process control system. The transversal force reflects the important stages of the bond process and contains the information to Suit as a control signal. But it is impractical to measure the transversal force in situ under the wedge in industrial production, where chip, Substrate and bonding table create a complex setup with a high geometric variety. An indirect measurement of the transversal force via the tool tip amplitude opens up new possibilities for gaining an efficient control variable, because the geometry and the properties of the bonding machine are well defined. As a first step it is shown by correlating vibration measurements with microsensor signals, that the tool tip amplitude measured by laser vibrometer contains all of the necessary information needed to control the bond process. From that point, process integrable measurement systems - which are cheaper, more handy and more fail safe than the laser vibrometer - might be developed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decades the fields of {{photonics}} and nanotechnology have led to some impressive scientific and technological achievements. Among them, the exploration of yet unexploited spectral regions, such as the Terahertz (THz) range, i. e. wavelengths of 60 micron- 300 micron, {{has been a major}} breakthrough. On the one hand, this was possible after the novel theoretical concept of light amplification in multiple quantum wells and superlattices was proposed in the Seventies, introducing the groundbreaking quantum cascade laser (QCL) idea. On the other hand, the development of new nanofabrication technologies and crystal growth techniques, such as the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), allowed an unprecedented control over the material structure, down to the deposition of nanometer-thick semiconductor layers. This paved the way to the practical realization of electrically pumped multi-stage gain media, the QCL, and to the successful demonstrations of their operation in a broad frequency range, from the mid-IR to the far-infrared. Apart from the purely scientific interest, Terahertz photonics has now a fundamental role in many applications, like metrology, spectroscopy, biomedical and pharmaceutical imaging, quality and process control, communications and security. Nowadays, a lot of effort is made to improve the performance of Terahertz QCL in terms of optical power, efficiency, beam pattern, frequency control and thermal management. Some of these crucial issues can be addressed by the use of photonic structures, i. e. specially designed patterns of dielectric scatterers superimposed to the active region. Such structures can be implemented in one- (1 D), two (2 D) - or three (3 D) -dimensional architectures, to provide a tight control of the frequencies and far-field emission pattern of the laser. Periodic photonic crystals have been studied for long time, providing intriguing insights. More recently, aperiodic patterns have attracted increasing attention due to their greater flexibility and the possibility to study and explore novel physical phenomena. The aim of the present thesis is to design, fabricate and investigate the transport and optical behavior of THz QCLs exploiting distributed feedback, achieved through the use of 2 D quasi-periodic and random resonators. The main goal is to demonstrate multimode emission over a broad frequency bandwidth, centered around 3. 1 THz. Unlike perfect photonic crystals, quasi-crystal geometries do not possess discrete translational invariance, yet they do possess long-range order which gives rise to a rich spectrum. After developing a simulation code based on the generation algorithm called "Generalized Dual Method", we designed the following quasi-crystal geometries: i) a 7 -fold pattern with a perfect symmetry under 2 π/ 7 rotations around a central axis, ii) an imperfect 7 -fold geometry where small defect points are introduced. This allowed to compare the effects of introducing a small amount of disorder {{in the design of the}} photonic structures. In order to understand the effect of a further increase of disorder, a third type of random structures was also studied, whose scatterers positions were extracted from a uniform pseudo-random distribution. We then simulated these photonic structures using the numerical approach of finite elements analysis, to understand how light propagation is affected by the size, the number and the arrangement of the scatterrers. A set of devices for each geometry was selected among those with the largest number of electromagnetic modes with predicted high quality factors Q. They were then nano-fabricated with the same QCL active region in a cleanroom facility, using a combination of UV optical lithography, plasma-assisted etching, metal deposition, chemical processes and ultrasonic <b>wedge</b> <b>bonding.</b> Finally, all lasers were characterized electrically and optically to study how the different physical and geometrical parameters affect the lasing threshold, the slope efficiency, the emitted power and the far-field intensity profile. The emission spectra were probed via Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), demonstrating the predicted multimode emission in most devices. In a future perspective, such multimode emission could be used to mode-lock radiation in a THz QCL, for example using passive optical components. An interesting possibility is the future integration of graphene in QCL to exploit its saturable absorption in the THz region. To this end, the transmission of THz radiation through a few layers of graphene transferred on an intrinsic silicon substrate was measured, reporting saturable absorption in the THz...|$|E

40|$|Wire bonding is {{a widely}} used {{interconnection}} technology in electronic packaging. Due to the advantages of fast bonding process, high productivity, good electrical and thermal performance, Au wire bonding has been widely applied to various electronic packaging applications, such as Multi chip module (MCM), B all grid array (BGA) and Chip-on-board (COB). The organic substrates for Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) have a low glass transitional temperature, Tg, typically 130 °C. This imposes limitations on the wire bonding process because wire bonding must be performed at temperatures far below the Tgof the substrate to avoid softening of the materials. Meanwhile, a substrate with a high Tg incurs additional cost arising from material and fabrication processes. The objective of this thesis is to optimize metallization and process variables to enhance wire bondability and product yields of low temperature Au <b>wedge</b> thermosonic <b>bonding.</b> The wire bond strength with various metallization characteristics were correlated to establish the process window for successful low temperature wire bonding. The technological understanding acquired in this thesis {{can be used as}} a practical guideline for PCB metallization plating and processing conditions. The research was carried out in four stages. The first stage examined the surface characteristics of various metallization schemes on conventional FR- 4 PCBs. The second stage investigated the interrelation between the metallization characteristics and the wire bonding process variables. The third stage studied the improvement in wire bonding by plasma cleaning. The last stage was a study of high temperature wire bonding on Bismaleimide triazine (BT) substrate.

5000|$|A person upon first {{seeing a}} ball bonder will usually compare its {{operation}} {{to that of}} a sewing machine. In fact there is a needle-like disposable tool called the capillary, through which the wire is fed. A high-voltage electric charge is applied to the wire. This melts the wire {{at the tip of the}} capillary. The tip of the wire forms into a ball because of the surface tension of the molten metal.The ball quickly solidifies, and the capillary is lowered to the surface of the chip, which is typically heated to at least 125°C. The machine then pushes down on the capillary and applies ultrasonic energy with an attached transducer. The combined heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy create a weld between the copper or gold ball and the surface of the chip - which is usually copper or aluminum. This is the so-called ball bond that gives the process its name. (All-aluminum systems in semiconductor fabrication eliminate the [...] "purple plague" [...] - a brittle gold-aluminum intermetallic compound - sometimes associated with pure gold bonding wire. This property makes aluminum ideal for ultrasonic bonding.) Next the wire is passed out through the capillary and the machine moves over a few millimeters to the location that the chip needs to be wired up to (usually called the leadframe). The machine again descends to the surface, this time without making a ball so that the wire is crushed between the leadframe and the tip of the capillary. This time the surface is usually gold, palladium, or silver - but the weld is made in the same way. The resulting weld is quite different in appearance from the ball bond, and is referred to as the <b>wedge</b> <b>bond,</b> tail bond, or simply as the second bond.|$|R

The particular behavior of the stress and displacement fields at the close vicinity of each interface corner is studied and the dependence of the order of singularity there was established in relation with the mechanical properties of the wedges coalescing at the particular corner considered. Applications of this general theory to simple cases of a single wedge and a bimaterial wedge gave results coinciding with already existing simple relations. © 1974...|$|R
