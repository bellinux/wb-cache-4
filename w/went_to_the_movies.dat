5|$|After the convention, Willkie {{returned}} to New York. When he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies,</b> {{he received a}} standing ovation, as {{he did when he}} went to see the play Life With Father. He resigned from C on July 8, 1940, confident that even if he lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort in Colorado Springs, but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E
2500|$|Hollywood studios {{also went}} all-out {{for the war}} effort, as studios {{encouraged}} their stars (such as Clark Gable and James Stewart) to enlist. Hollywood had military units that made training films – Ronald Reagan narrated many of them. Most of all Hollywood made hundreds of war movies that, in coordination with the Office of War Information (OWI), taught Americans {{what was happening and}} who the heroes and the villains were. Ninety million people <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> every week. Some of the most highly regarded films during this period included [...] Casablanca, Mrs. Miniver, Going My Way, and Yankee Doodle Dandy. Even before active American involvement in the war, the popular Three Stooges comic trio were lampooning the Nazi German leadership, and Nazis in general, with a number of short subject films, starting with You Nazty Spy! in January 1940, nearly two years before the United States was drawn into World War II.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, by {{the method}} of Experimental Phonetics, we {{analyzed}} an ambiguous Chinese sentence (Tamen xingqitian dou qu kan dianying). This sentence has two meanings. One meaning is “They all <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> Sunday”. Another meaning is “They <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> every Sunday”. Through analysis, {{we found that the}} semantic distinction of the two meanings is reflected in the change of fundamental frequency and duration. When the fundamental frequency of "dou" rises, and its duration is prolonged, this sentence is understood as “They all <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> Sunday”. In reverse, when the fundamental frequency of "dou" falls, and its duration is shortened, this sentence is understood as “They <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> every Sunday”...|$|R

2500|$|Mathis was {{determined}} to become a screenwriter and, accompanied with her mother, she moved to New York City where she studied writing and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> in the evenings. She entered a screenwriting competition; but despite not winning, her entry was so impressive it did bring job offers. Her first script, House of Tears, would be directed by Edwin Carewe in 1915 {{and led to a}} contract in 1918 with Metro studios, later to be merged into MGM. As one of the first screenwriters to include details such as stage directions and physical settings in her work, Mathis saw scenarios as a way to make movies into more of an art form. Much of the standard screenwriting styles can be attributed to her. Mathis later credited her success to a strong concentration on plot and theme: [...] "No story that did not possess a theme has ever really lived.... Occasionally one may make money and perhaps be popular for a time. But in the end it dies." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, DeLillo was not {{interested}} in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant, where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit. In a 2010 interview with The Australian, DeLillo reflected on this period by saying [...] "I had a personal golden age of reading, in my 20s and my early 30s, and then my writing began to take up so much time". Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo's earliest attempts at writing in his late teens. As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music – [...] "guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" [...] – and postwar cinema: [...] "Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the '70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don't know how they may have affected the way I write, but I do have a visual sense." [...] On the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, [...] "European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way I think and feel about things. At that time I was living in New York, I didn't have much money, didn't have much work, I was living in one room....I was a man in a small room. And I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>movies</b> a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When I was little, in the Bronx, I didn't go to the cinema and I didn't think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an indirect way, cinema allowed me to become a writer." [...] DeLillo also credits his parents' leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: [...] "They ultimately trusted me to follow the course I’d chosen. This is something that happens if you’re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case." ...|$|E

Well, she keeps elbowing through the crowd, me after her, feeling good and ashamed, till she's almost up to the velvet rope and ready to be the next let in. But there was a little squirt of a man there--probably been waiting half an hour--I kind of admired the little cuss--and he turns on Zilla and says, perfectly polite, 'Madam, why are you trying to push past me?' And she simply--God, I was so ashamed!--she rips out at him, 'You're no gentleman,' and she drags me into it and hollers, 'Paul, this person insulted me!' and the poor skate he got ready to fight.|$|E
