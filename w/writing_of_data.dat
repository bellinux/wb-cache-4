30|$|As {{mentioned}} in Section 5.3 the internal memory operations are separately handled. That {{is because of}} its distinct execution characteristics. Two categories of memory operations {{are included in the}} instruction set of the C 6416 T DSP load and store. The load instructions represent the read <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from the data cache (if the operand exist in the data cache) to a specific register from the processor's register file.

50|$|Mechanical {{failures}} {{account for}} about 60% of all drive failures.While the eventual failure may be catastrophic, most mechanical failures result from gradual wear and there are usually certain indications that failure is imminent.

50|$|Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) is a {{data file}} {{standard}} for the reading and <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from flow cytometry experiments.

50|$|Destructive reading. Since {{both the}} reading and the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> {{are carried out}} with laser beams, there is a {{potential}} for the reading process to cause a small amount of writing. In this case, the repeated reading of data may eventually serve to erase it (this also happens in phase change materials used in some DVDs). This issue has been addressed by many approaches, {{such as the use of}} different absorption bands for each process (reading and writing), or the use of a reading method that does not involve the absorption of energy.|$|E

5000|$|Nearly all 1/2" [...] tape formats {{today are}} a single hub design, whereby {{the tape is}} wound onto a single hub, entirely within the {{external}} shell and presents one end for the tape drive to engage and thread into the tape drive for reading or writing. The mechanical design of this loading mechanism varies between different types of tape media and is a common source of failures. Usually the tape cartridge incorporates a switch that can be set to permit or forbid <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to the tape.|$|E
50|$|An {{internal}} sort is any data sorting process {{that takes place}} entirely within the main memory of a computer. This is possible whenever the data to be sorted is small enough to all {{be held in the}} main memory. For sorting larger datasets, {{it may be necessary to}} hold only a chunk of data in memory at a time, since it won’t all fit. The rest of the data is normally held on some larger, but slower medium, like a hard-disk. Any reading or <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to and from this slower media can slow the sortation process considerably. This issue has implications for different sort algorithms.|$|E
5000|$|IBM {{introduced}} an on-demand hypervisor, a major serviceability tool, called Dynamic Support System (DSS), {{in the first}} release of MVS. This facility could be invoked to initiate a session to create diagnostic procedures, or invoke already-stored procedures. The procedures 'trapped' special events, such as the loading of a program, device I/O, system procedure calls, and then triggered the activation of the previously defined procedures. These procedures, which could be invoked recursively, allowed for reading and <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> and alteration of instruction flow. Program Event Recording hardware was used. Due to the overhead of this tool, it was removed from customer-available MVS systems. Program-Event Recording (PER) exploitation was performed by the enhancement of the diagnostic [...] "SLIP" [...] command {{with the introduction of}} the PER support (SLIP/Per) in SU 64/65 (1978).|$|E

50|$|MTConnect is a {{protocol}} {{designed for the}} exchange of data between shop floor equipment and software applications used for monitoring and data analysis. MTConnect {{is referred to as}} a read-only standard, meaning that it only defines the extraction (reading) of data from control devices, not the <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to a control device. Freely available, open standards are used for all aspects of MTConnect. Data from shop floor devices is presented in XML format, and is retrieved from information providers, called Agents, using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as the underlying transport protocol. MTConnect provides a RESTful interface, which means the interface is stateless. No session must be established to retrieve data from an MTConnect Agent, and no logon or logoff sequence is required (unless overlying security protocols are added which do). Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is recommended for discovery services.|$|E
50|$|A {{software}} interrupt is caused either by an exceptional condition in the processor itself, or a special {{instruction in the}} instruction set which causes an interrupt when it is executed. The former is often called a trap or exception and is used for errors or events occurring during program execution that are exceptional enough that they cannot be handled within the program itself. For example, a divide-by-zero exception will be thrown if the processor's arithmetic logic unit is commanded to divide a number by zero as this instruction is an error and impossible. The operating system will catch this exception, and can choose to abort the instruction. Software interrupt instructions can function similarly to subroutine calls and are used {{for a variety of}} purposes, such as to request services from device drivers, like interrupts sent to and from a disk controller to request reading or <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> to and from the disk.|$|E
50|$|Lasers {{emitting}} a violet {{light beam}} at 405 nm may be constructed with GaN (gallium nitride) semiconductors. This {{is close to}} ultraviolet, bordering on the very extreme of human vision, and can cause bright blue fluorescence, and thus a blue rather than violet spot, on many white surfaces, including white clothing, white paper, and projection screens, due to {{the widespread use of}} optical brighteners in the manufacture of products intended to appear brilliantly white. On ordinary non-fluorescent materials, and also on fog or dust, the color appears as a shade of deep violet that cannot be reproduced on monitors and print. A GaN laser emits 405 nm directly without a frequency doubler, eliminating the possibility of accidental dangerous infrared emission. These laser diodes are mass-produced for the reading and <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> in Blu-ray drives (although the light emitted by the diodes is not blue, but distinctly violet). , 405 nm blue-violet laser diode modules with an optical power of 250 mW, based on GaN violet laser diodes made for Blu-ray disc readers, had reached the market from Chinese sources for prices of about US$60 including delivery.|$|E

5000|$|With read caches, a {{data item}} {{must have been}} fetched from its {{residing}} location {{at least once in}} order for subsequent reads <b>of</b> the <b>data</b> item to realize a performance increase by virtue of being able to be fetched from the cache's (faster) intermediate storage rather than the data's residing location.

40|$|Reading and <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> is {{fundamental}} in computing, as is its control. However control {{of reading and}} writing has traditionally only been available {{at the level of}} file systems, and not programming language data structures. In this paper a simple imperative language is described which uses type modes to control reading and <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> A type may be labelled read-write or read-only; a read-only type is guaranteed by the type system not to be written. Furthermore a read-write type may be treated read-only in a sub-context. To achieve this implicit aliasing is prevented and the program heap is partitioned into collections. Collections form a unit of read-write control of heap allocated data, by isolating different heap regions. Collections were originally introduced in the Euclid and Turing programming languages for aliasing control; however this was rather restrictive and not strictly enforced. Controlling aliasing is beneficial in its own right since aliasing is a common sou [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{our society}} has seen a shift towards a {{reliance}} on digital means of data storage. This paper considers the problem of digital data integrity protection, which is defined as preventing unauthorized <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> Numerous examples of successful attacks against seemingly secure targets are examined to support the assertion of the author that, {{at least in some}} circumstances, the integrity of digital data is difficult to preserve. An approach to securing data is proposed in which a security administrator first assumes that a system will be compromised. This approach limits its focus to a nuisance-type attack, which is defined as an attempt to obscure shared non-sensitive data by limited-experience attackers. A trusted third party, the Universal Nuisance Defense Object (UNDO), is employed to monitor the system and automatically detect and abate unauthorized <b>writing</b> <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> This approach is further expanded upon by utilizing a tool set of metrics that allows one to measure the performance of UNDO, and appropriately configure it. This allows an administrator to optimize its efficiency, ideally to the point where this category of attack on the data integrity will be nullified...|$|E

40|$|Synchronous small writes play a {{critical}} role in the reliability and availability of file systems and applications that use them to safely log recent state modifications and quickly recover from failures. However, storage stacks usually enforce page-sized granularity in their data transfers from memory to disk.

To address the issue in a journaled file system, we propose wasteless journaling as a mount mode that coalesces synchronous concurrent small <b>writes</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> into full page-sized blocks before transferring them to the journal. Additionally, we propose selective journaling that automatically applies wasteless journaling on data writes whose size lies below a fixed preconfigured threshold.
