Total phenolics, flavonoids, flavan- 3 -ols and hydroxycinnamoyl-tartrates (HCT) were determined on grape extracts (GE) and juices. Total anthocyanins and anthocyanins composition were measured on GE. The antioxidant activity was assessed by means of two different in vitro tests: scavenging of the stable 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical and the inhibition of tyrosine nitration mediated by authentic peroxynitrite (ONOO−). All the juices were analysed after 24 h and 2 weeks of storage by means of two-way anova (factors being cultivar and temperature). Anthocyanins were not detected in MA extract, whereas in SG their content was 534 mg malvidin-equivalent per 100 g of dry matter (d. m.) and malvidin derivatives (glycosylated and coumaroylated) were the most represented (respectively 169 and 41 malvidin-equivalent per 100 g of d. m.). HCT content of the extracts was higher in SG (overall + 33 %). Also in grape juices, HCT were lower in MA and in this variety, the trans-fertaric and cis-coutaric acids were also undetectable. Cultivar effect proved to be highly significant, while {{no significant differences in}} the phenolic composition were observed for storage temperatures (4 and − 20 °C) and cultivar × temperature interaction.

In 2015, SAWIS (South African Wine Information and Systems) reported that the country had 100,146 hectares of vineyards, with about 55% planted with white varieties. Chenin blanc {{has long been the}} most widely planted variety, still accounting for over 18% of all grape area planted in South Africa as of 2015, though it is slowly decreasing in overall share of vineyard area. In the 1980s and 1990s, interest in international varieties saw increase in plantings of Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Other white grape varieties with significant plantings include Colombard (also spelled locally as Colombar), Cape Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Hanepoot, Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains, Riesling and Sémillon. Both red and <b>white</b> mutants of <b>Muscat</b> Blanc à Petits Grains as well as Chenel and Weldra, two Chenin blanc-Ugni blanc crossings, are used for brandy distillation and fortified wine production.|$|R

Moreover, a model wine medium containing isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate and linalool was enriched with each extract at 100 mg/L, and stored in sealed bottles at 20 °C for 45 – 90 days. All samples were analysed for volatiles using SPME along with GC-MS analysis. Phenolic composition of wine extracts was determined using HPLC-DAD. No effect on the concentration of any volatiles was observed {{as a result of}} the addition of each extract in each wine or the model medium. A wine extract rich in phenolic acids and another one rich in anthocyanins and flavanols inhibited the decrease of volatile esters and terpenes in one or both wines and the model medium. Among them were several important for the aroma of wine such as ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate and linalool. The results presented here indicate that wine phenolic acids, and anthocyanins or flavanols may be taken into account as potent inhibitors of the disappearance of volatile esters and terpenes in wines...|$|R
