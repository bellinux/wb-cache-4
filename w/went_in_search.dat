5|$|According to {{the third}} legend, a white horse of the Prince of Lhasa had wandered into Monpa region. People, who <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of the horse, found the horse grazing at the present {{location}} of the monastery. The people of the area then worshipped the horse and the location where it was found and venerated it every year. Eventually, to honour the sacred site, the Tawang Monastery was built at the site.|$|E
5|$|After falling {{pregnant}} by Brett Macklin (Gerry Sont), Ruth Stewart (Justine Clarke) {{gave birth}} to Martha. However, she decided to give Martha up for adoption to a family called the MacKenzies. Martha grew up on her new family's farm. Her adoptive parents died, leaving Martha with the farm and her adoptive brothers. Martha then <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of her biological parents. Brett {{did not want to}} know her, but she managed to form a relationship with Ruth and went to live with her in New York. Her grandfather, Alf, and her great aunt, Morag (Cornelia Frances), came to visit and Martha chose to return to Australia to live with her relatives.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{three of}} the militia's horses wandered off; the next day, June 25, three men <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of the animals while the rest stayed behind. At the cabin, seven Native American braves {{appeared}} in the distance. The troops immediately began pursuing the natives, who fled into the woods, instead of reporting the sighting to Dement. The Native American warriors, as had been done other times {{during the course of}} the war, set an ambush for the militia men in the forest. The militia pursued the natives into the woods and, as they entered the forest, the natives opened fire, the volley instantly killed two militia men and wounded another. The militia retreated and formed a battle line but the native forces would not relent. The rest of Dement's company attempted to rescue the outmatched militia men but were unable to beat back the native warriors. Black Hawk's band attacked the militia men, again forcing the beleaguered force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn.|$|E

5|$|In 1907, Besant {{became the}} {{president}} of the Theosophical Society globally, and set to work with a major expansion of the organisation's headquarters at Adyar, in what was then, Madras. When it was announced that Besant would undertake a speaking tour of Australia in 1908, she was expected to stay with Fuller while in Perth. Some months later in 1908, Fuller left Western Australia and travelled to India, staying at Adyar. Of her time in India, Fuller wrote:I <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> not only of beauty, and light, and colour, and the picturesqueness in general, which delight the eye and emotions of all artists—but of something deeper—something less easily expressed. I spent {{two and a half years}} in a community that is quite unique—perhaps the most cosmopolitan settlement in the world—the headquarters of the Theosophical Society... Well, I painted there, of course, but my art was undergoing a change, and I felt that it could not satisfy me unless it became so much greater.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} 1979, when Deodato was {{contacted}} by German film producers {{to make a}} film similar to Last Cannibal World, which was also directed by Deodato. He accepted the project and immediately <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of a producer, choosing his friend Francesco Palaggi. The two first flew to Colombia to scout for filming locations. Leticia was chosen as the principal filming location after Deodato met a Colombian documentary filmmaker at the airport in Bogotá, who suggested the town as a location ideal for filming. Other locations had been considered, specifically the locations where the film Burn!, directed by Gillo Pontecorvo, had been shot, but Deodato rejected these locations due to lack of suitable rainforest. Leticia was only accessible by aircraft, and from there, the cast and crew had to travel by boat to reach the set. The locale presented many problems for the production, in particular the heat and sudden rain storms, which sporadically delayed filming.|$|E
5|$|Three legends are narrated to the {{establishment}} of the monastery. In the first legend it is said that location of the present Monastery was selected by a horse which belonged to Merag Lama Lodre Gyatso who was on a mission assigned to him by the 5th Dalai Lama to establish a Monastery. After an intense search, when he failed to locate a suitable place, he retired into a cave to offer prayers seeking divine intervention to choose the site. When {{he came out of the}} cave, he found his horse missing. He then <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of the horse and finally found it grazing at the top of a mountain called Tana Mandekhang, which in the past was the palace of King Kala Wangpo. He took this as a divine and auspicious guidance and decided to establish the monastery at that location. Seeking the help of the local people, Mera Lama established the monastery at that location in the latter part of 1681.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{previous}} rebirths {{in which}} Koṇḍañña and Gautama Buddha crossed paths are also noted in Pali literature. The Mahavastu cites a previous birth in which Koṇḍañña was a seafaring merchant {{who had lost}} all his wealth after a mid-ocean shipwreck. Koṇḍañña then <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of the king of Kosala, who had a widely known reputation for philanthropy. However, the Kosalan monarch had left his kingdom and surrendered his kingdom to the neighbouring Kasi king. The king of Kosala had done so to avert bloodshed, since the Kasi king had threatened to invade. Nevertheless, the Kasi king wanted to capture the Kosalan king and decreed a large reward for it. The Kosalan king (Gautama Buddha in a previous rebirth) tied himself and asked the merchant to deliver him to Kasi so that the merchant {{would no longer be}} in poverty. However, when the Kasi king heard this, he withdrew his army and restored the Kosalan monarchy. The Kosalan king subsequently bestowed wealth on the merchant. Gautama Buddha cited this occurrence to illustrate how the ties between living beings extended into their previous existences. In another rebirth described in the Mahavastu, Koṇḍañña and his four colleagues who were to become the first bhikkhus were seafaring merchants under the command of the future Gautama Buddha. The future Buddha sacrificed himself to save them from an ocean death. The Divyavadana describes two further rebirths of Koṇḍañña. In one he was a bird named Uccangama. In another, he was a tigress and Gautama Buddha another tiger. The future Buddha sacrificed his own life by offering himself as meat to the hungry tigress so that it would not eat its own cubs.|$|E

25|$|Parma's next task {{would be}} to take on Grosseto's fellow Serie B side Verona, who had emerged victorious over Sassuolo on a penalty {{shoot-out}} after a 3–3. A much-changed Ducali side included club legend Hernán Crespo, who <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of an 11th Coppa Italia goal for the club that would bring him level with all-time top scorer Alessandro Melli, while Verona sought a first appearance in the last 16 since 1996–97 after six consecutive Serie B victories. The second tier side were successful in realising that first appearance in fifteen years with a goal in either half against a poor Parma side.|$|E

25|$|The legend {{associated}} with the Bealach a' Choin Ghlais {{is part of the}} same story that surrounds the naming of the nearby Gulf of Corryvreckan (English: the speckled cauldron). This is where the Norse Prince Breacan of Lochlann is said to have drowned when his boat sank there, so giving his name to this great whirlpool. The prince's dog managed to swim to land and <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of his master. Failing to find him on Jura or Scarba he tried to leap across the strait to Lunga, but missed his footing on Eilean a' Bhealaich which sits {{in the middle of the}} channel between the two islands. He slipped into the raging current and drowned as well, giving his own name in turn to the strait where he fell - the 'pass of the grey dog'.|$|E
25|$|On Changing Rooms {{he quickly}} gained {{something}} of a reputation for clutter; {{in many ways the}} decluttering trend was a reaction against his style of design. Many times people were filmed in tears of sadness after having seen what he had done to their drawing room: frequently people {{said they were going to}} repaint the room with white paint.This reaction made him use darker colours for the walls which could not be painted over as easily. So infamous was his reputation that some people visibly winced when they realised they had got him as their designer. On 13 April 2009 he presented a documentary on BBC One in the West region in which he <b>went</b> <b>In</b> <b>Search</b> of England's Green & Pleasant Land. The programme explored the threats to the rural way of life from urban creep and the loss of local services.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of Myth, one {{particularly}} celebrated legend is that of Connacht, who, one thousand years ago, saved the world from a race of flesh-eating monsters called the Myrkridia, which had hunted humanity to near extinction over the previous millennium. Coming from the eastern land of Gower {{at the same time}} a comet appeared in the western skies, Connacht was the first human to fight the Myrkridia and survive. However, not only did he survive, he defeated them, ultimately imprisoning them in a magical prison known as the Tain, built for him by the Dwarven smiths of Muirthemne. With the Myrkridia gone, Connacht became Emperor of the Cath Bruig, presiding over a prosperous era known as the Age of Light. However, many years later, he disappeared from the historical records. It is unknown exactly what happened to him, although one theory suggests he <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of powerful magical artifacts, fearful of the ramifications if such items should fall into the wrong hands. Whatever the truth about his disappearance, Connacht was never seen again.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week, Genoa came to Parma led by ex-Parma manager Alberto Malesani as Parma {{looked to}} put an end to their indifferent early season form and Genoa <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of a second win at the Tardini on their twentieth visit. They were able to make their good start to the first half pay with a goal from a delightful Giovinco lob on the half-hour mark after a neat Sergio Floccari assist. As the first half drew to a close, Giovinco's mazy dribble was then illegally halted in the penalty area by Juraj Kucka and Parma were awarded a penalty; Giovinco himself converted the resultant spot kick. As Genoa threw more men forward, the chances continued to come for Parma and a fine counter-attack ended with a Stefano Morrone finish from inches out after he had somehow conspired to hit the bar from 6 yards out. The gloss of a fine victory was taken off when Genoa themselves were awarded a penalty for a Gabriel Paletta tug on Rodrigo Palacio in the last minute and the Argentine got up to score the penalty and round off the scoring at 3–1. This lifted Parma out of the relegation zone and Giovinco to the top of the scoring charts, alongside fellow 5-goal frontman Rodrigo Palacio.|$|E

500|$|None of {{the party}} had any {{remaining}} faith in the Hastings Cutoff as they recovered at the springs {{on the other side}} of the desert. They spent several days trying to recover cattle, retrieve the wagons left in the desert, and transfer their food and supplies to other wagons. Reed's family incurred the heaviest losses, and Reed became more assertive, asking all the families to submit an inventory of their goods and food to him. He suggested that two men should go to Sutter's Fort in California; he had heard that John Sutter was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers, and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip. The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by mongrel teams of cows, oxen, and mules. It was the middle of September, and two young men who <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of missing oxen reported that another [...] long stretch of desert lay ahead.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, Trauma {{traveled}} to Los Angeles {{to perform at}} the Whisky a Go Go.

Upon hearing, as Hetfield described it, [...] "this amazing shredding" [...] (which later became [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth"), the two <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of {{what they thought was}} an amazing guitar player. When they learned that what they had heard was a bass solo by Burton, they decided to recruit him for their own band. They asked him to replace departed bassist Ron McGovney, and since Burton thought that Trauma was [...] "starting to get a little commercial", he agreed. The idea of having to move to Los Angeles did not sit well with him, and said he would join only if the band would relocate from Los Angeles to his native San Francisco Bay Area. Metallica, eager to have Burton in the band, left their origin of Los Angeles to make a home in El Cerrito, a town located across the bay from San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|Paul {{received}} a magnificent welcome at Avignon, {{where he was}} fêted by Clement VII and his cardinals. Clement, moved by his guest's tales of suffering {{at the hands of}} the Roman popes, loaded him with gifts and honours and sent him north to Paris. There, King Charles VI of France likewise prepared a triumphal welcome for his illustrious guest. Paul was an exotic and popular sight in the French capital, and was lavishly hosted and entertained. He obviously enjoyed his long sojourn there, [...] "safe in a place where his past was unknown and his deception was unlikely to be discovered", according to Nicol. For further safety, he communicated only via an interpreter in his employ. On his visit to the Abbey of Saint-Denis, he claimed that there were several relics of the abbey's patron saint—commonly confused with the Athenian saint Dionysius the Areopagite at the time—to be found back in Greece, and promised to help the monks bring them to France. His proposal was enthusiastically taken up, and two monks received permission and funds from the king to accompany Paul back to Greece. When the party arrived in the port in Italy from which they would sail for Greece, however, Paul bribed the captain of the ship to pretend that bad weather would delay their departure. In the same night, he and his servants set sail with their entire baggage, leaving the two monks behind. It was only in Rome, where the monks <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>search</b> of answers for Paul's behaviour, that they learned the true identity of their travelling companion. From them the chronicler of the abbey later received his information.|$|E
