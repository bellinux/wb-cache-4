60|$|DEAR WILLIAM:--Your {{letter of}} the 19th ultimo was {{received}} last night, and for which I am much obliged. The only thing in it that I wish {{to talk to you}} at once about is that because of my vote for Ashmun's amendment you fear that you and I disagree about the war. I regret this, not because of any fear we shall remain disagreed after you have read this letter, but because if you misunderstand I fear other good friends may also. That vote affirms that the war was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the President; and I will stake my life that if you had been in my place <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have <b>voted</b> just as I did. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> have <b>voted</b> what <b>you</b> felt and knew to be a lie? I know <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> have gone out of the House--skulked the vote? I expect not. If you had skulked one <b>vote,</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have had to skulk many more {{before the end of the}} session. Richardson's resolutions, introduced before I made any move or gave any vote upon the subject, make the direct question of the justice of the war; so that no man can be silent if he <b>would.</b> <b>You</b> are compelled to speak; and your only alternative is to tell the truth or a lie. I cannot doubt which <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do.|$|R

30|$|Importantly for our purposes, {{the survey}} {{contains}} data on (self-reported) voting, allowing us to derive measures of vote intention, or at least political sympathy, towards the main parties in the country, including Peronists. Thus, we first divide the sample in Argentina into two groups: between those that declare to vote for Peronists and those that declare to {{want to vote for}} other groups. The precise question asked is: “If there were a national election tomorrow, for which party on this list <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>vote?</b> Just call out the number on this card.” Then a card with “ 1.

40|$|Abstract Throughout history {{participation}} {{in decision making}} through processes like voting vying for leadership position and {{participation in}} decision making meetings has been blinded by discrimination to certain groups of community members including women. This study assessed the social cultural factors affecting Maasai womens participation in decision making a case of Longido district. Purposive sampling was used to select the districts under the study. Decision to select Longido {{was based on the}} inhabitance of pastoral community. A total of 115 respondents were obtained through simple random selection. Data were collected through a questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS. Simple descriptive statistics and cross tabulation were used in the analysis. The results show that majority <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>vote</b> for a woman to be an MP Councilor Village Chairman in your community. A considerable proportion of men refused to be led by a woman. Furthermore women were found not to effectively participate in politics through vying for leadership positions as many respondents voted for male contestant main reasons being no female contestant. Situations in which women are involved in decision making were found mainly to be on issues pertaining women development and family matters. Findings show that women are allowed to vote in the community but often the decision for a woman to vote was found to be determined by men. The study further found that women are not regarded elders and females ideas were not taken into account as male ideas in village meetings. The main barriers for women participation in leadership were found that men do not want women to compete in leadership and women ideas not accepted by most men. The study concluded that Maasai women participation in decision making is limited by social cultural factors like social identity social acceptance social roles and limiting cultural practices. It is recommended that civic education strategy and appropriate programs should be designed and implemented to raise the level of knowledge and understanding of women rights and potentials in leadership and decision making. Continuous and effective sensitization of Maasai men and women on changing of their mindsets to accept the ability of women and their leadership potentials is paramount in influencing mens decision making to accepting women in leadership and decision making organs...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of public}} funds to host major sport events is a {{contentious}} issue that all major cities face. It is expensive to host a major sport event, and the benefits, or lack of, associated with hosting have been widely researched and reported (Kim, Jun, Walker & Drane, 2015; Kim & Petrick, 2005; Ochman, 2013). Therefore, the decision on whether a city should bid to host a major sport event is of critical importance for both the cities elected officials, event owners and organisers, {{as well as the}} local community. Community support is considered an essential part of planning an operating a successful event. The perceived social, economic and environmental impact of hosting a major sport event on the local community is commonly used as a method to understand community support for an event. In addition, it is becoming increasingly common for cities to hold a referendum as a method to gauge community support for a major sport event, and as a result decide if the city should submit a bid to host. Competition between major cities for hosting major sport events is becoming increasingly strong. However, Auckland is known as a desirable location to host such events, having recently hosted successfully the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and the FIFA U- 20 World Cup and Cricket World Cup in 2015. The possibility of Auckland hosting a future Commonwealth Games provides an ideal context to investigate factors affecting community support for the event, and local resident interest in an eventrelated referendum. A mixed-method approach will be taken to achieve the study’s purpose. The quantitative phase of the research will be a cross-sectional study of local residents in Auckland. To make the results relevant to real world decisions, a representative sample of participants will be surveyed through the use of online market research panels. This phase would measure the perceived social, environmental and economic impact of a future Auckland Commonwealth Games. In addition, this phase would also ask local residents three key questions: 1) Should there be a referendum?, 2) Would you participate in the referendum?, 3) How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>vote</b> in the referendum? Scales with established validity and reliability will underpin the survey. The survey will be designed {{so that it can be}} easily replicated in future years to determine if support is changing or applied to other events or stadium developments. The qualitative phase of the research will be semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders that would be involved in a bid to host the Commonwealth Games in Auckland. Interview questions will be formulated based on the results from the crosssectional study of local residents. Data from the interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis...|$|E
