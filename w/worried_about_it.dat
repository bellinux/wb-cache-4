In response, Urlacher has stated [...] "Just watch the film. I don’t know what people are saying, but I’m not too <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> anymore. All I can do is go out there and play hard and try and help my team win, and that's what I’m going to keep doing." ...|$|E
500|$|No {{music video}} was filmed for {{promotion}} of [...] "Nothing Fails". Initially {{it was reported}} by Daily Mirror that Madonna planned to shoot the video in Israel with actor Michael Douglas. According to Polly Graham from the newspaper, Warner Bros. executives {{were concerned about the}} singer's safety in Israel, but Madonna was adamant. [...] "Her record bosses are really <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They are trying to talk her around, but she's having none of it. She has told them it makes sense to shoot it in Israel as the Kabbalah originates from there. Madonna is not particularly bothered about her safety and potential risks. She doesn't think it's as bad as it seems." [...] Her then husband Guy Ritchie was also facing difficulty with his project, Revolver, which was rejected by Sony Pictures executives since it contained references to Kabbalah, and they asked Ritchie to re-write the script. Since the video itself would have included symbolism from Kabbalah, Madonna ultimately decided to not film the music video. These reports were later refuted by the artist during an interview with San Francisco radio station Alice 97.3, where she explained that no music video would be shot for the single.|$|E
500|$|Travolta's manager Jonathan Krane {{denied that}} the Church of Scientology was playing any part in the production: [...] "I've never even dealt with or talked to the church on this. This is an action-adventure, science-fiction story. Period. The movie {{has nothing to do}} with Scientology." [...] Krane stated that the film had been financed [...] "without a dollar coming from the Scientologists." [...] Some people in Hollywood feared that Travolta was using his box office draw to promote Scientology teachings, and one film {{producer}} stated, [...] "This film could encourage kids to embrace the whole strange world of Scientology." [...] Travolta stated, [...] "I'm doing it because it's a great piece of science fiction. This is not about Hubbard. I'm very interested in Scientology, but that's personal. This is different." [...] In a separate interview Travolta commented on the perceived similarities between Battlefield Earth and Scientology: [...] "Well, they are kind of synonymous… L. Ron Hubbard is very famous for Scientology and Dianetics. On the other hand, he's equally as famous in the science fiction world. So for people to think that… look, I don't want everybody to try Scientology. I don't really care if somebody thinks that. I'm not <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> You can't be. The truth of why I'm doing it is because it's a great piece of science fiction. I'm going to be the wickedest 9-foot alien you've ever seen in your life." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{inspired}} Dominic to take {{a conscious}} decision to become a saint. The immediate result of this was that, not being sure how to live a saintly life, and <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he was quiet and worried for the next few days. Noticing this, John Bosco spoke to Dominic and advised him to resume his customary cheerfulness, persevere in his regular life of study and religious practices, and especially not neglect being with his companions in games and recreation. [...] On learning that his first name meant [...] "belonging to God", his desire to be a saint intensified.|$|E

When I told him that to initiate war was a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: 'You were <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> yesterday {{but you do not}} have to worry so much.' Thus, gradually he began to lead to war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more to war. I felt the Emperor was telling me: 'My prime minister does not understand military matters. I know much more.' In short, the Emperor had absorbed the view of the army and the navy high commands." ...|$|E

2500|$|National {{security}} reporter Spencer Ackerman {{said the}} film [...] "does not present torture as a silver bullet {{that led to}} bin Laden; it presents torture as the ignorant alternative to that silver bullet". Critic Glenn Kenny said that he [...] "saw a movie that subverted a lot of expectations concerning viewer identification and empathy" [...] and that [...] "rather than endorsing the barbarity, the picture makes the viewer in a sense complicit with it", which is [...] " [...] whole other can of worms". Writer Andrew Sullivan said, [...] "the movie is not an apology for torture, as so many have said, and as I have <b>worried</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It</b> is an exposure of torture. It removes any doubt that war criminals ran this country for seven years". Filmmaker Michael Moore similarly said, [...] "I left the movie thinking it made an incredible statement against torture", and noted that the film showed the abject brutality of torture. Critic Andrew O'Hehir said that the filmmaker's position on torture in the film is ambiguous, and creative choices were made and the film poses [...] "excellent questions for us to ask ourselves, arguably defining questions of the age, and I think the longer {{you look at them}} the thornier they get".|$|E
