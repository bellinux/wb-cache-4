5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the cardiac cycle, in early diastole, both the atria and ventricles are relaxed. Since blood moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, when the chambers are relaxed, blood <b>will</b> <b>flow</b> into the atria (through the coronary sinus and the pulmonary veins). As the atria begin to fill, the pressure will rise so that the blood will move from the atria into the ventricles. In late diastole the atria contract, pumping more blood into the ventricles. This causes a rise in pressure in the ventricles. As the ventricles reach systole, blood will be pumped into the pulmonary artery (right ventricle) or aorta (left ventricle).|$|E
5|$|The RS-25 engine {{consists}} of various pumps, valves, and other components which work in concert to produce thrust. Fuel (liquid hydrogen) and oxidizer (liquid oxygen) from the Space Shuttle's external tank entered the orbiter at the umbilical disconnect valves {{and from there}} flowed through the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the Space Launch System (SLS), fuel and oxidizer from the rocket's core stage <b>will</b> <b>flow</b> directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.|$|E
5|$|Advanced {{technology}} {{was required for}} the planning and construction of large reservoirs and canals. When constructing reservoirs, the gaps between low ridges in the dry zone plains were used for damming water courses. Two different techniques were used in construction; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to reservoirs. All the reservoirs and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network, so that excess water from one <b>will</b> <b>flow</b> into the other. The locations of these constructions indicate that the ancient engineers were aware of geological formations in the sites as well, and made effective use of them. Underground conduits have also been constructed to supply water to and from artificial ponds, {{such as in the}} Kuttam Pokuna and the ponds at Sigiriya.|$|E

Heiðrún produces vats of mead that liquor cannot be compared to, and from Eikþyrnir's antlers drip liquid into the spring Hvergelmir from which flows forth all waters.|$|E

25|$|The EMF {{generated}} by Faraday's law of induction due to relative movement of a circuit and {{a magnetic field}} is the phenomenon underlying electrical generators. When a permanent magnet is moved relative to a conductor, or vice versa, an electromotive force is created.

25|$|The {{forecourt}} is {{the part}} of a filling station where vehicles are refueled. Fuel dispensers are placed on concrete plinths, as a precautionary measure. Additional elements may be employed, including metal barriers. The area around the fuel dispensers must have a drainage system. Since fuel sometimes spills on the ground, as little of it as possible should penetrate the soil. Any liquids present on the forecourt <b>will</b> <b>flow</b> into a channel drain before it enters a petrol interceptor which is designed to capture any hydrocarbon pollutants and filter these from rainwater which may then proceed to a foul sewer, stormwater drain or to ground.|$|E
25|$|If {{the circuit}} is {{operated}} asymmetrically (as a simple supply voltage {{with just one}} positive pole), both {{the positive and negative}} poles (or the isolated reference potential) are pulsating opposite the center (or the ground) of the input voltage analogously to the positive and negative waveforms of the phase voltages. However, the differences in the phase voltages result in the six-pulse DC voltage (over the duration of a period). The strict separation of the transformer center from the negative pole (otherwise short-circuit currents <b>will</b> <b>flow)</b> or a possible grounding of the negative pole when powered by an isolating transformer apply correspondingly to the symmetrical operation.|$|E
25|$|If {{the tops}} of the {{antennae}} are wired together, the net voltage will be zero when the antenna is face-on to the signal, because the voltages in both vertical sections are opposing each other. When the antenna is rotated, the slight difference in phase, and thus induced voltages, will leave a net voltage in the circuit, and current <b>will</b> <b>flow.</b> This is maximized when the antennae are parallel to the transmitter. If one measures the output at all angles as the antennae are rotated with respect to the signal, a figure-eight reception pattern is produced, with a sharp nul point and an extended area of maximum signal.|$|E

25|$|When {{placed in}} the sun, photons of the {{sunlight}} can excite electrons on the p-type side of the semiconductor, {{a process known as}} photoexcitation. In silicon, sunlight can provide enough energy to push an electron out of the lower-energy valence band into the higher-energy conduction band. As the name implies, electrons in the conduction band are free to move about the silicon. When a load is placed across the cell as a whole, these electrons <b>will</b> <b>flow</b> out of the p-type side into the n-type side, lose energy while moving through the external circuit, and then flow back into the p-type material where they can once again re-combine with the valence-band hole they left behind. In this way, sunlight creates an electric current.|$|E
25|$|Marraffino's design, {{which remains}} in use for single-color stripes, is simple. The main material, usually white, {{sits at the}} crimp end of the {{toothpaste}} tube and makes up most of its bulk. A thin pipe, through which that carrier material <b>will</b> <b>flow,</b> descends from the nozzle to it. The stripe-material (this was red in Stripe) fills {{the gap between the}} carrier material and the top of the tube. The two materials are not in separate compartments, however they are sufficiently viscous that they will not mix. When pressure is applied to the toothpaste tube, the main material squeezes down the thin pipe to the nozzle. Simultaneously, the pressure applied to the main material causes pressure to be forwarded to the stripe material, which thereby issues out through small holes (in the side of the pipe) onto the main carrier material as it is passing those holes.|$|E
25|$|Planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} {{water from}} Greater Irbid in the Jordan Valley. A major water reuse project is being planned to reuse water from three {{wastewater treatment plants}} {{in the area of}} Irbid in the North of Jordan through a project supported in the framework of Jordanian-German cooperation. As of 2006, only 14% of the wastewater from these plants was being reused. An explanation for this is that farmers in the Jordan Valley are reluctant to use the reclaimed water, which they perceive to be of poor quality, for irrigation. The wastewater thus flows into the Jordan River, unused. In the future, the treated effluent from the three plants <b>will</b> <b>flow</b> through a pipe into the Jordan Valley, generating hydropower from the elevation differential of more than 1,000m. It will then be mixed with freshwater and delivered to the farmers in a quality that is acceptable to them.|$|E
