Originally, there were nine villages, but this has been expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The Phoenix Symphony Hall opened in 1972; other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the First National Bank Plaza, the Valley Center (the tallest building in the state of Arizona) and the Arizona Bank building.|$|E

This study {{examines}} the individual differences influencing the patterns of hemispheric asymmetry in the perception of emotional words. This study explores how individuals’ <b>level</b> <b>of</b> depression and anxiety affects how they perceive emotional words varying in valence and arousal. Participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> depression demonstrated more hemispheric asymmetry <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bias toward words presented to the left hemisphere, but participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> depression had no hemispheric differences. Participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> depression demonstrated <b>a</b> bias toward positive words, but participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> depression had no difference in valence. Similarly, participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> anxiety had <b>a</b> positivity bias, but participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>level</b> <b>of</b> anxiety had no difference in valence.

The present preliminary study investigated the association between plasma fibrinogen and bone mineral density (BMD) in perimenopausal women.

This correlation appeared to be more clearly observed in the subgroup <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> high-sensitivity C-reactive protein than in that <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and in the subgroup <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> diacron reactive oxygen metabolites (an oxidative stress marker) than in that <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low <b>level</b> <b>of</b> diacron reactive oxygen metabolites.

Until local training was completed and there were graduates, some teachers immigrated from eastern Canada and Europe to teach at the early one room school houses. Teachers from the 1880s through to 1940s taught in one room school houses which offered grades 1 through 8, and, where needed, also grades 9 through 12 with classroom sizes varying from 10 through to 40 students.
