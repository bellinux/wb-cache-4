5|$|A {{saturation}} {{profile is}} one <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> tissues {{considered by the}} decompression model have become saturated with inert gas from the breathing mixture. Most decompression models will take this to be at six tissue half-times for the slowest tissue considered. Further bottom time at the same depth will not affect the inert gas loading of any tissue and will not affect the decompression required.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} {{division of}} the poem occurs, Tolkien writes, at line 1887, after <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> earlier story is summarized, so a complete account of Beowulf's tragedy is given between 1888 and the end, but without {{the account of the}} gloomy court of Heorot, or of the contrast between the young Beowulf and the old Hrothgar.|$|E
5|$|Elections {{since the}} 1930s have been {{dominated}} by two political parties, National and Labour. Between March 2005 and August 2006, New Zealand became the first {{country in the world}} in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> highest offices in the land—Head of State, Governor-General, Prime Minister, Speaker and Chief Justice—were occupied simultaneously by women. The current Prime Minister is Jacinda Ardern, who has been in office since 26 October 2017.|$|E

5|$|In August 2016, Delta Air Lines {{came under}} fire on social media for airing an {{in-flight}} entertainment version of Carol in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> same-sex love scenes had been deleted. Phyllis Nagy replied on Twitter that, contrary to Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines had provided the full theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum and {{actinium}} {{are sometimes}} considered the remaining members of group 3. In their most commonly encountered tripositive ion forms, these elements {{do not possess}} any partially filled f-orbitals, thus continuing the scandium—yttrium—lanthanum—actinium trend, in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> elements have relationship {{similar to that of}} elements of the calcium—strontium—barium—radium series, the elements' left neighbors in s-block. However, different behavior is observed in other d-block groups, especially in group 4, in which zirconium, hafnium and rutherfordium share similar chemical properties lacking a clear trend. It has however been argued that this is irrelevant because the principle of increasing basicity down the table is more fundamental, and because the behavior of the group 3 elements is more similar to their s-block neighbors than their d-block neighbors.|$|E
5|$|One of Maria Theresa's {{greatest}} wishes {{was to have}} as many grandchildren as possible, but she {{had only}} about two dozen {{at the time of her}} death, of <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> eldest surviving daughters were named after her, with the exception of Caroline of Parma, her eldest granddaughter by Maria Amalia.|$|E

Meanwhile, Stewie’s time machine plans are accidentally discovered by Lois, who shows them around to the bar's patrons. Angered and upset that his plans have been discovered, Stewie runs upstairs. Soon after, the wives storm the bar and Lois tells them that she only wants to feel appreciated and special, something to <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> other women relate. Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally starts a fire.|$|E
5|$|Problems {{with the}} {{reliability}} of early batches of transistors meant that the machine's {{mean time between failures}} was about 90 minutes, which improved once the more reliable junction transistors became available. The Transistor Computer's design was adopted by the local engineering firm of Metropolitan-Vickers in their Metrovick 950, in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> circuitry was modified to make use of junction transistors. Six Metrovick 950s were built, the first completed in 1956. They were successfully deployed within various departments of the company and were in use for about five years.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} arrival of the Belgian {{government}} in exile in London, negotiations began between the Belgians and the British about the role which the Congo would play in the Allied war effort. The British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because, after the fall of Dutch and British colonies in the Far East to Japan, the Allies were desperate for raw materials like rubber which the Congo could produce in abundance. Eventually, the two parties came to an arrangement in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> British demands were accepted, including a 30 percent devaluation of the Congolese franc.|$|E

Punk defeated Knox in their first singles match (qualifying for the Extreme Elimination Chamber at December to Dismember in the process) {{as well as the}} rematch, after which Kelly Kelly celebrated Punk's victory over her boyfriend. Punk then teamed with D-Generation X and the Hardy Boyz in their Survivor Series match against Rated-RKO, Knox, Johnny Nitro and Gregory Helms, a match in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> participants on DX's side survived elimination. At December to Dismember, Punk participated in the Elimination Chamber for the ECW Championship; however, he was the first person eliminated by Rob Van Dam.|$|E
5|$|Strangelets {{are small}} {{fragments}} of strange matter—a hypothetical form of quark matter—that contain roughly {{equal numbers of}} up, down, and strange quarks and that are more stable than ordinary nuclei (strangelets would {{range in size from}} a few femtometers to a few meters across). If strangelets can actually exist, and if they were produced at the LHC, they could conceivably initiate a runaway fusion process in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> nuclei in the planet would be converted to strange matter, similar to a strange star.|$|E

On the plane ride back to Springfield, it is revealed that their former tour guide, Kitenge, is {{now president of the}} country, with the former president now the Simpsons' flight attendant.|$|E

5|$|The {{system of}} Chinese astrology was {{elaborated}} during the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE) and flourished during the Han Dynasty (2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE), during <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture – the Yin-Yang philosophy, {{theory of the}} five elements, Heaven and Earth, Confucian morality – were brought together to formalise the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology and alchemy.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{relatively}} small variety of coats {{in relation to the}} number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in <b>which</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as hairless rats.|$|E
