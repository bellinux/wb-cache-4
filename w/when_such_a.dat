5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). <b>When</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway – the RISC complex, is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside {{the core of the}} virion.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of several}} species of starfish can {{reproduce}} asexually before they reach maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by budding. <b>When</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.|$|E
5|$|Lands {{that were}} exempt from taxes were called manya and {{sometimes}} consisted of several villages. They were granted by local chieftains without {{any reference to}} the overlord, indicating a de-centralised economy. These lands, often given to heroes who perished {{in the line of}} duty were called bilavritti or kalnad. <b>When</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> grant was made for the maintenance of temples at the time of consecration, it was called Talavritti. Some types of taxes on income were kara or anthakara (internal taxes), utkota (gifts due to the king), hiranya (cash payments) and sulika (tolls and duties on imported items). Taxes were collected from those who held the right to cultivate land; even if the land was not actually cultivated.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{illustrates the}} courts' reluctance {{to give effect to}} any legislative provision {{that attempts to}} exclude their jurisdiction in judicial review. Even <b>when</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> exclusion is relatively clearly worded, the courts will hold that it does not preclude them from scrutinising the decision on an error of law and quashing it <b>when</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> error occurs.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. <b>When</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E
5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} in English law {{is an element}} of trusts law dealing with charitable trusts. The doctrine provides that <b>when</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> trust has failed because its purposes are either impossible or cannot be fulfilled, the High Court of Justice or Charity Commission can make an order redirecting the trust's funds to the nearest possible purpose. For charities with a worth under £5,000 and no land, the trustees (by a two-thirds majority) may make the decision to redirect the trust's funds. The doctrine was initially an element of ecclesiastical law, coming from the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), but similar and possibly ancestral provisions have been found in Roman law, both in the Corpus Juris Civilis and later Byzantine law.|$|E

25|$|For {{several types}} of {{intercellular}} signaling molecules that are unable to permeate the hydrophobic cell membrane due to their hydrophilic nature, the target receptor is expressed on the membrane. <b>When</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> signaling molecule activates its receptor, the signal is carried into the cell usually {{by means of a}} second messenger such as cAMP.|$|E
25|$|In {{existing}} properties, tenants may form {{a housing}} cooperative together, {{and then make}} an offer to the owner to buy the property. <b>When</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> cooperative has been formed, it automatically becomes the first prospective buyer should the owner desire to sell.

First, the problem <b>when</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> ideal {{is a prime}} ideal {{as well as the}} problem <b>when</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> ideal possesses a quadratic Gröbner basis is solved. Second, we describe explicitly a primary decomposition of the radical ideal of an ideal {{generated by}} adjacent 2 -minors, and challenge the question of classifying all ideals generated by adjacent 2 -minors which are radical ideals. Finally, we discuss connectedness of contingency tables in algebraic statistics...|$|R

25|$|High-pass filters {{have many}} applications.

25|$|This {{is a rare}} form of synesthesia where {{individuals}} {{feel the}} same sensation that another person feels (such as touch). For instance, <b>when</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> synesthete observes someone being tapped on their shoulder, the synesthete involuntarily feels a tap on their own shoulder as well. People {{with this type of}} synesthesia have been shown to have higher empathy levels compared to the general population. This {{may be related to the}} so-called mirror neurons present in the motor areas of the brain, which have also been linked to empathy.|$|E

Non-celebrities include the lifelong Los Angeles-area resident who challenged the panel with her line, afterward reminiscing how 43 years earlier she had traveled to New York, where Arlene Francis identified her as a meter maid.

25|$|A {{resolution}} to impeach the President {{has to be}} passed by a two-third majority {{of the total number}} of members of the originating house. It is then sent to the other house. The other house investigates the charges that have been made. During this process, the President has the right to defend oneself through an authorised counsel. If the second house also approves the charges made by special majority again, the President stands impeached and is deemed to have vacated their office from the date <b>when</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> resolution stands passed. No president has faced impeachment proceedings so the above provisions have never been used.|$|E
