5|$|Four battles {{large enough}} to be {{recorded}} in Ireland were fought in 728 and 729. Alpín was defeated twice by Óengus, after which Nechtan was restored to power. In 729 a battle between supporters of Óengus and Nechtan's enemies was fought at Monith Carno (traditionally Cairn o' Mount, near Fettercairn) where the supporters of Óengus were victorious. Nechtan was restored to the kingship, probably until his death in 732. On 12 August 729 Óengus defeated and killed Drest in battle at Druimm Derg Blathuug, a place <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been identified.|$|E
5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For that <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, {{there is no}} motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Henderson broke Lou Brock's {{major league}} single season record by {{stealing}} 130 bases, a total <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been approached since.

Henderson's 130 steals outpaced nine of the American League's 14 teams that season. He also led the AL in walks (116), was 4th in runs (119) and 3rd in on base % (.398).|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of ritual in Lingbao Daoism. The first {{is known as the}} heavenly Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the Tang Dynasty, this ritual was carried out in honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The earthly Yellow Register ritual was performed to ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> survived, was the human Jade Register, which was performed to ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.|$|E
5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation {{have resulted in the}} first evidence for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E
5|$|Because Lichfield {{had been}} {{established}} by the papacy, any change in its status required papal assent. Coenwulf's first embassy to Leo III in 797 about demoting Lichfield did not succeed, mainly because Leo seems to have resented the implied criticism of his predecessor Hadrian I, who had approved the elevation of Lichfield. Coenwulf's embassy bore {{a letter to the}} pope that asked for papal advice on how to resolve the problems surrounding Lichfield and Canterbury. The letter reminded the papacy of Pope Gregory the Great's old scheme to have two metropolitans in Britain, one in the north and one in the south, with the southern one being based in London. The letter implied that Coenwulf was asking for Æthelhard's metropolitan see to be moved to London. The same embassy carried a letter from Æthelhard also, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> survived. The pope, however, did not agree with the embassy. The papal reply to Coenwulf stated that the southern archbishopric must remain at Canterbury, as well as excommunicated Eadberht and authorised his expulsion from Kent if he persisted in keeping Æthelhard from Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, so only the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been traced.|$|E
5|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, the {{porbeagle}} is on {{the verge}} of extinction, with a population decline of over 99.99% since the mid-20th century. Its range has contracted to the waters around the Italian Peninsula, where there may be a nursery area. Only a few dozen specimens have been recorded in the past few decades, from scientific surveys, swordfish fishery bycatch, and sport fishers. In 1995, it was included in Annex III ("species whose exploitation is regulated") of the Barcelona Convention Protocol on protected areas and biodiversity in the Mediterranean, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been ratified. In 1997, it was listed on Appendix III of the Bern Convention (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats). However, these listings have yet to result in the implementation of new management plans, despite the recognized need for urgent action.|$|E
5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} manifold, with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure, and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E
