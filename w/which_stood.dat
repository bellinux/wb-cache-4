5|$|An inquest {{was held}} on 22 December; the jury could not {{determine}} whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned.

Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, <b>which</b> <b>stood</b> to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E
