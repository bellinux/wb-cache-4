5000|$|Lead Local Flood Authorities have lead {{responsibility}} {{for managing the}} risk of flooding from surface water, groundwater and ordinary <b>watercourses.</b> They have permissive power to carry out flood defence works at their discretion. [...] This implies that a residual responsibility to maintain ordinary <b>watercourses,</b> and to report any issues with them to lead local flood authorities, (county councils or unitary authorities) rests in tort with riparian owners, that is owners of land adjoining such <b>watercourses.</b> Such <b>watercourses</b> were historically defined as non-navigable <b>watercourses</b> however their designation has changed to those <b>watercourses</b> not included on a 'main rivers map' and whose bed is not owned by an authority.|$|R

It now passes under the oldest {{part of the city}} and it can be visited and walked through. It is also used for cultural and artistic exhibitions.|$|R
40|$|The {{impacts of}} channel {{morphology}} on the residues and ecological risks of 14 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners {{in water and}} sediment were investigated in summer (July) and autumn (September) in the Chahe River, in Nanjing, China. The residual concentrations of tri-chlorobiphenyls (tri-CBs, PCB 18) and tetra-CBs (PCB 52) in water {{were significantly higher than}} those of penta-CBs to deca-CBs, and the average residual concentration of ∑PCBs (sum of 14 PCB congeners) in summer was about six times higher than in autumn. However, the residues in sediment did not change significantly. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that channel morphology and the corresponding environmental indices had significant impacts on PCB residues and their composition profiles in water and sediment. The overflow weir and lake-type <b>watercourse</b> may remarkably reduce the residual concentration and ecological risks of PCBs in water. The highest reduction percentages of the residual concentration and ecological risks of ∑PCBs induced by an overflow weir were 78 % and 67 %, respectively, and those induced by a lake-type <b>watercourse</b> were 36 % and 70 %, respectively. The <b>watercourses</b> with different channel morphologies were ranked by residual ∑PCBs concentrations in the following descending order: the natural ecological <b>watercourse,</b> vertical concrete <b>watercourse,</b> and vegetation-type riprap <b>watercourse.</b> However, they were ranked by residual ∑PCBs concentrations in sediment in the following descending order: the vertical concrete <b>watercourse,</b> vegetation-type riprap <b>watercourse,</b> and natural ecological <b>watercourse...</b>|$|R
500|$|The Environment Agency has {{powers to}} manage flood control on main rivers, which {{are defined by}} a series of {{statutory}} main river maps, and for water quality on all <b>watercourses.</b> Responsibility for <b>watercourses</b> other than the main rivers resides with Internal Drainage Boards (IDBs). The Rother is a main river below Mayfield. Internal Drainage Boards have tended to amalgamate to cover larger areas, and the Romney Marshes Area IDB formed from the Romney Marsh Levels, the Walland Marsh, the Denge and Southbrooks, the Rother and the Pett IDBs. It manages [...] of drainage ditches and <b>watercourses,</b> although most of the pumping stations which pump water from the drainage ditches into the Rother are owned by the Environment Agency.|$|R
40|$|Creation of close-to-nature river beds {{is one of}} {{the results}} of <b>watercourses</b> revitalization. <b>Watercourses</b> are {{segments}} in the country increasing its recreational potential. The recreational potential of <b>watercourses</b> contributes to rich diversity of animal and plant species. They are well-preserved natural environment with a different atmosphere and an interesting psychological effect. The current goal of revitalization measures in the landscape primarily consists of the optimization of landscape water regime, incl. flood control measures and the promotion of biodiversity, but the current philosophy speaks of multifunctional land usage. However, the revitalization is currently underappreciated in the Czech Republic and it is important to increase the recreational potential of the landscape. The subject of this article is evaluation of close to nature watercources {{from the point of view}} of recreation potential. The example locality of close to nature <b>watercourse</b> is part of Váh river near Iľava city. In this area some elements of recreational potential by the proposed methodology are discussed. Two river courses make a possible comparison between a technical canal and a modified one, but close-to-nature water course with all parameters of river phenomenon. Properties of nature and close-to-nature <b>watercourses</b> could be an inspiration for repairing(modifying, adjusting) river stretches within urban space...|$|R
50|$|The {{problem with}} the ancient names {{is that while the}} Karkheh flows a {{kilometre}} or two west of Susa, another major <b>watercourse</b> flows parallel to the Karkheh within a few kilometres east of Susa. When these rivers are in flood stage, the entire area south of Susa can be flooded, as the waters of the two <b>watercourses</b> mingle. The <b>watercourse</b> a kilometre or two east of Susa, now called the Shaur, flows east between the Haft Tepe and Shaur ridges into the Dez River, north of where the Dez and Karun rivers merge. At some previous time, the Karkheh may have joined the eastern end of the Shaur. The timing of these changes is not known with any certainty. The ancient name of the Shaur may have been the Choaspes.|$|R

These are property rights of the shoreland occupant, hence are sometimes called private rights to use water found in a <b>watercourse.</b> When the <b>watercourse</b> is navigable the private rights {{take a back seat to}} rights the public have to use the water. The statement immediately raises questions. What is the test of navigability? Who is included within the term 2 ̆ 2 public 2 ̆ 2 ? What rights do the public have? What remedies are available to vindicate the public rights? Who may invoke the remedies? To what extent do the public rights subordinate private rights? In Maine the answers to these and other questions of public rights in water are controlled by the interplay of state, federal and international law. The interplay is examined in the pages that follow; also, suggestions are offered to improve the quality of public rights which, it is believed, will enrich recreational opportunities in Maine...|$|R
40|$|The use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has {{permeated}} {{almost every}} {{field in the}} engineering, natural and social sciences, offering accurate, efficient, reproducible methods for collecting, viewing and analysing spatial data. GIS do not inherently have all the hydrological simulation capabilities that complex hydrological models do, but are used to determine many of the catchment parameters that hydrological models or design flood estimation methods require. The {{purpose of this study}} was to perform catchment parameter analysis using GIS applications available in the ArcGIS TM environment. The paper will focus on the deployment of special GIS spatial modelling tools versus conventional manual methods used in conjunction with standard GIS tools to estimate typical catchment parameters, e. g. area, average catchment and <b>watercourse</b> slopes, main <b>watercourse</b> lengths and the catchment centroid. The manual catchment parameter estimation methods with GIS-based input parameters demonstrated an acceptable degree of association with the special GIS spatial modelling tools, but proved to be sensitive to biased user-input at different scale resolutions. GIS applications in an ArcGIS TM environment for the purpose of catchment parameter analyses are recommended to be used as the standard procedure in any proposed hydrological assessment...|$|R
5000|$|All {{this region}} round the shats {{has been called}} the [...] "Jerid" [...] {{from the time of the}} Arab occupation. [...] "Jerid" [...] means in Arabic a [...] "palm frond" [...] and inferentially [...] "a palm grove." [...] The fame of this Belad-el-Jerid, or [...] "Country of the Date Palms", was so exaggerated during the 17th and 18th centuries that the European geographers {{extended}} the designation from this small area in the south of Tunisia to cover much of inner Africa. With this country of Jerid may be included the island of Jerba, which lies close to the coast of Tunisia in the Gulf of Gabès. The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) may be indigenous to this district of the Jerid, as it is to countries of similar description in southern Morocco, southern Algeria, parts of the Tripolitania, Egypt, Mesopotamia, southern Persia and north-western India; but that north of the latitude of the Jerid the date did not grow naturally in Mauretania, just as it was foreign to all parts of Europe, in which, as in true North Africa, its presence is due to the hand of man. To some extent it may be said that true North Africa lies to the north of the Jerid country, which, besides its Saharan, Arabian and Persian affinities, has a touch about it of real Africa, some such touch as may be observed in the valley of the Jordan. In the oases of the Jerid are found several species of tropical African mammals and two or three of Senegalese birds, and the vegetation seems to have as much affinity with tropical Africa as with Europe. In fact, the country between the Matmata highlands and the strait separating Jerba from the mainland is singularly African in the character and aspect of its flora. To the south of the Jerid the country is mainly desert - vast unexplored tracts of shifting sand, with rare oases. Nevertheless, all this southern district of Tunisia bears evidence of once having been subject to a heavy rainfall, which scooped out deep valleys in the original table-land, and has justified the present existence of immense <b>watercourses</b> - <b>watercourses</b> which are still, near their origin, favoured with a little water.|$|R
