25|$|Four newly raised ranging companies, {{have all}} been organized, and taken their several {{stations}} on our frontier. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> pleased. We know they are true men, and they {{know exactly what they}} are about. With many of them Indian and Mexican fighting has been their trade for years. That they may be permanently retained in the service on our frontier is extremely desirable, and we cannot permit ourselves to doubt such will be the case.|$|E
500|$|Manor Marussia's Alexander Rossi {{was delighted}} with his result in twelfth, {{feeling that it}} could be [...] "the start of great things", after he had equalled the team's best result of the season. Daniel Ricciardo called for the FIA to clear up the {{regulations}} of the virtual safety car, following him being overtaken easily at the first restart by Nico Rosberg, saying that he had not gotten a warning {{about the end of the}} period. Kimi Räikkönen was equally displeased, complaining about the rules concerning driving standards. Following his on-track battle with Max Verstappen, he demanded clarification on whether Verstappen's aggressive driving style was legal, saying: [...] "I just wanted to ask if it's OK when you are next to another car, at some point on the exit of the corner are you allowed to always push the other car up on the kerbs [...] Apparently it's fine. As long as everybody has the same rules that's OK." [...] Concerning the collision between Nico Hülkenberg and Ricciardo, Force India revealed that damage to Hülkenberg's front wing had caused him to lose downforce and slide into the Red Bull. Following the turn one collision between their two drivers, Sauber's team principal Monisha Kaltenborn announced that she intended to [...] "have a word" [...] with her drivers, saying: [...] "The bottom line of this is that these kind of things simply must not happen. It is OK if you have decent and healthy competition which they do – both drivers are respectful to each other. [...] I'm upset. These mistakes shouldn't happen. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> better than this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bonar Law said [...] "in {{the present}} {{condition}} of Ireland, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{more likely to}} get an impartial inquiry in a military court than in any other". The British military launched its own inquiry, the [...] "Strickland Report" [...] but Cork Corporation instructed its employees and other corporate officials to take no part in it. The report pointed the finger of blame at members of the Auxiliaries' K Company, based at Victoria Barracks. The Auxiliaries, it was claimed, set the fires in reprisal for the IRA attack at Dillon's Cross. However, the British Government refused to publish the report.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> relieved, {{under these}} circumstances, when Mrs. Pardiggle left off.|$|R
60|$|As Ada was {{a little}} frightened, I said, to humour the poor old lady, that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> obliged to her.|$|R
60|$|The {{precious}} {{paper was}} at last finished; {{and a great}} curiosity it <b>was.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> diverted with his reasons for not dating it.|$|R
2500|$|While the {{influence}} of Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites on the Birmingham Group is clear, modern scholarship has also seen links with later movements in art. The Last Romantics exhibition at the Barbican Art Gallery in 1989 positioned the group as the link connecting the romanticism of the Pre-Raphaelites {{to that of the}} later symbolists of the Slade School. Southall himself has been seen as a precursor of surrealism, with John Russell Taylor writing that [...] "there is undoubtedly an authentic strangeness in the way he saw things ... <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more likely to find ourselves thinking of Magritte and Balthus and Chirico than of anyone nearer to this apparently stick-in-the-mud Arts-and-Craftsman." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{a purely}} {{mathematical}} point, if {{economic growth is}} projected far enough into the future, {{it will always be}} better to postpone difficult and expensive problems (like climate change) until an unspecified point in the future when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> richer than today and have more abundant resources available to solve the problem in question. Projecting a paltry 1.5% rate of economic growth one hundred years into the future implies that the global economy will more than quadruple in size and that any large and expensive project should be handled at that time or later. [...] On the other hand, the use of a smaller 1.5% discount rate, rather than a larger discount rate, ironically actually increases the present costs of global warming that occur to future generations, so choosing a larger discount rate would actually make the problem of global warming smaller today, since it is generally understood that the majority of costs of global warming will result in the future, not the present. [...] So it is not entirely clear that Cline was wrong to choose a smaller discount rate of 1.5%. If climate change is posited to have dire economic consequences and negative implications for economic growth long before that point in time, it might have been judged to be a more immediate problem by the Copenhagen Consensus. By not including any negative feedback loops on the world economy from not solving the issue of climate change, the Copenhagen Consensus implicitly states that it does not matter – from an economic point of view – if we solve climate change or not.|$|E
6000|$|... "That may be," [...] {{admitted}} Fredjim, [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> the strongest, {{because our}} right arm {{was by far}} the best before we were patched." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> {{together}} in those days, Monna Giuliana and I. Our intimacy had grown {{over a little}} incident that it were well I should mention.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> {{not without}} our {{fears that the}} waiter rushed out to hang himself; and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> {{relieved}} by his fetching somebody,--in graceful, flowing skirts and with a waist,--who very soon settled Mr. Indignation Cocker's business.|$|R
60|$|After some delay, {{during which}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> {{diverted}} by the hilarious good-nature of our guard--one of our number was called out for, {{followed by an}} order for him to enter the house alone.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{the first}} we {{have heard of the}} {{deceased}} taking strychnine {{at the time of her}} death. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> obliged to you, Mr. Cavendish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} seem to me that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> better off than we were before, so far as finding the path lies. What do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a fine joke--for a Horner--and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{pleased with}} it," [...] said the Champion, {{speaking}} between the pickets. [...] "But please don't do it again." ...|$|E
60|$|That {{night we}} {{examined}} and repaired our arms ere we lay down to rest, although <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> fatigued, {{in order that}} <b>we</b> might <b>be</b> in readiness to set out on our expedition at daylight on the following morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{left the}} Cæsar in a boat, Sir Gervaise; and though <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> nearer {{in with the}} coast, where the wind has not the rake it has here, and the {{strength}} of the gale had not then come, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> nearly swamped." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> {{concerned}} at this; for {{the prospect of}} their setting us, in their own persons, an example of downright hard labour, was anything but agreeable. But it was now too late to repent what we had done.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, we saw {{you when}} you came to Woking,' said Maude. 'I believe that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more likely to come to an {{arrangement}} if we talk it over ourselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mon Feu-Follet!" [...] exclaimed Raoul, {{rising and}} {{actually}} extending {{his arms as}} if to embrace the beloved craft. [...] "Etooelle, they seek us, for <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> behind our time!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{accustomed}} to honor those that come {{of an ancient}} line, and to see {{some part of the}} glory of the ancestor even in the most remote descendant." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Dawson {{arrived in}} less than an hour's time. He was a respectable elderly man, well known all round the country, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> alarmed when <b>we</b> found that he {{considered}} the case to be a very serious one.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So <b>we</b> <b>are</b> very <b>much</b> {{disposed}}, <b>are</b> Mother and I,' said Mr Meagles, 'to pack up {{bags and}} baggage and go among the Allongers and Marshongers once more. I mean, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> very <b>much</b> disposed to <b>be</b> off, strike right through France into Italy, and see our Pet.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I answered, [...] "we did {{something}} of that sort, and were a little more fortunate than our enemies. But, you will recollect <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> favoured by the complaisance of poor Monsieur Le Compte, in leaving us a schooner to work our mischief in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Mrs. Wilson with a laugh, [...] "Emily {{knew that}} ten days ago. Could your friend tell us {{anything}} of Bonaparte? <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> interested in his movements just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, thank our stars! those Gothic {{times are}} fled; [...] Now, well-bred men--and {{you are all}} well-bred-- [...] Most justly think (and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> the gainers) [...] Such conduct neither spirit, wit, nor manners.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{obliged to}} him,' said Florence, 'it {{would be too}} bad to leave mamma and me to spend our Christmas alone, {{when we came to}} the castle on purpose to oblige him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to me, the {{greatest}} desire I have, is {{to forget that}} I belong to it. It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>much</b> alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>much</b> alike in any particular, you and I." ...|$|R
60|$|FEEBLE. Acquainted with him! Yes; he {{came from}} the town of Stupidity, which lieth four degrees to the northward of the City of Destruction, and as many off of where I <b>was</b> born; yet <b>we</b> <b>were</b> well acquainted, for, indeed, he was my uncle, my father's brother. He and I have <b>been</b> <b>much</b> of a temper. He was a little shorter than I, but yet <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> of a complexion.|$|R
5000|$|As we {{got ready}} to make Too Tough To Die, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> focused in the same direction, and it made a difference. We knew {{we needed to get}} back to the kind of harder {{material}} we'd become known for. The pop stuff hadn't really worked, and <b>we</b> knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> better off doing what we did best.|$|R
6000|$|... "Think? Why, I {{think we}} shall have the fowl stole before <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> older, wi' that gell forgetting to lock the pens up o' nights. What's the matter now, Hetty? What are you crying at?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> obliged for the information," [...] said Dick. [...] "Wait, we'll {{soon have}} our biplane {{out of the}} way." [...] And then he and his {{brothers}} wheeled it to one side, so the runabout could pass.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} myself save what I have read or heard. I {{have no desire}} to be discourteous, but you can understand, Mr. Holmes, that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{disturbed}} at present, and I must ask you to hasten this interview to an end." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the release}} Akın {{said of the}} film, {{inspired}} {{by the work of}} Italian-American film director Martin Scorsese, that, “It took Scorsese and the other Italo-Americans 70 years to start making their films. The Maghribi-French needed 30 years for their cinéma beur. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> quicker. We’re already doing it!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've served Mr. Featherstone {{for thirty}} years, sir, and led Mr. Lawrence's first pony and cleaned his first gun. It wasn't my regular duty, sir, {{but he was}} the only son and I looked after him. If I may say so, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>much</b> upset when <b>we</b> heard that he was ill." ...|$|R
60|$|So I went, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> made <b>much</b> of {{in spite}} of the disappointment.|$|R
