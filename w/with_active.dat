5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person <b>with</b> <b>active</b> but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people <b>with</b> <b>active</b> TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission {{from one person to}} another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those <b>with</b> <b>active</b> ("overt") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes three to four weeks before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E

5|$|All {{anticoagulants}} {{are generally}} contraindicated {{in situations where}} the reduction in clotting that they cause might lead to serious and potentially life-threatening bleeds. This includes people <b>with</b> <b>active</b> bleeding conditions (such as gastrointestinal ulcers), or disease states with increased risk of bleeding e.g. low platelets, severe liver disease, uncontrolled hypertension. For patients undergoing surgery, treatment with anticoagulants is generally suspended. Similarly, spinal or lumbar puncture (e.g. spinal injections, epidurals, etc.) carry increased risk so treatment is suspended prior to these procedures.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1590s, the full-length portrait came into vogue and artistic patrons among the nobles began to add galleries of such paintings to their homes as a form of cultural ostentation. Peake {{was one of those who}} met the demand. He was also among the earliest English painters to explore the full-length individual or group portrait <b>with</b> <b>active</b> figures placed in a natural landscape, a style of painting that became fashionable in England. As principal painter to Prince Henry, Peake seems to have been charged with showing his patron as a dashing young warrior.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, Westland's {{experience}} with the Sea King led the company to conduct the British Experimental Rotor Program (BERP), in coordination with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, which applied innovations in composite materials and new design principles to the helicopter rotor. Initial trials carried out <b>with</b> <b>active</b> Sea Kings found several advantages to the BERP rotor, including a longer fatigue life and improved aerodynamic characteristics. Subsequent Westland helicopters, such as the record-breaking Lynx and the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, took advantage of BERP rotors for greater performance. Westland equipped later-built Sea Kings with the new composite rotors as well.|$|E
5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not {{a black and white}} duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous plants <b>with</b> <b>active</b> trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E

The purpose of the coloration is uncertain, but in modern birds it can serve as coloration or as a post-mating sexual signal. Colored eggs are also correlated <b>with</b> <b>active</b> paternal care in modern birds, lending further support to the hypothesis that oviraptorid males cared for their eggs.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{intended}} to reveal the differential isoesterase expression in leaves and roots of Vigna unguiculata L. in response to saline stress. Influence of NaCl (0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 %) on seedlings of Vigna unguiculata L. was analyzed. The seedlings were grown in the centre {{for a period of}} 30 days. The randomly collected whole plants were used as a source for isoesterase isolation. The seedlings showed the maximum tolerance up to 10 % of NaCl. The Poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by Anbalagan method. The staining and fixation of the enzyme was performed by the Sadasivam and Manickam method. Seedlings treated with various concentrations of NaCl showed different banding profile based on the concentration (0 - 10 %) and duration (5 - 30 days) of salt treatment as follows: 32 bands <b>with</b> five <b>active</b> regions, 56 bands <b>with</b> eight <b>active</b> regions, 102 bands <b>with</b> eight <b>active</b> regions, 47 bands <b>with</b> seven <b>active</b> regions, 64 bands <b>with</b> nine <b>active</b> regions and 84 bands <b>with</b> nine <b>active</b> regions on 5 th, 10 th, 15 th, 20 th, 25 th and 30 th day respectively.

5|$|The {{petrogenesis}} of Lastarria rocks, {{like those}} of other volcanoes in the Central Volcanic Zone, involves the prolonged interaction with crustal rocks in magma chambers {{as well as the}} fractionation of certain minerals.
