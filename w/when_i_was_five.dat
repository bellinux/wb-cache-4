6000|$|Previously to quitting the {{province}} of Nova Scotia, my father placed Harriet and myself {{in the house of}} a Mr. Marchinton, to live. This gentleman was a clergyman, who had no regular parish, but who preached in a chapel of his own. He sent us both to school, and otherwise took charge of us.

I {{collided}} with people, fell down; {{and all the time}} I was screaming with terror. My father caught me and soothed me. He pointed to the crowd of people, all careless of the roaring, and cheered me with assurances of safety.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the age of}} three, Maria's musical talent {{began to}} {{manifest}} itself, and after Evangelia discovered that her youngest daughter also had a voice, she began pressing [...] "Mary" [...] to sing.

[...] George was unhappy with his wife favoring their elder daughter, {{as well as the}} pressure put upon young Mary to sing and perform.

I was overlooked, and escaped without hurt. When the savages were gone I crept out and cried the night away watching the burning houses; and I was all alone, except for the company of the dead and the wounded, for the rest had taken flight and hidden themselves.|$|E
60|$|It was {{something}} like this. Physiologically, {{from the standpoint of}} palate and stomach, alcohol was, as it had always been, repulsive. It tasted no better than beer did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five,</b> than bitter claret did when I was seven. When I was alone, writing or studying, I had no need for it. But--I was growing old, or wise, or both, or senile as an alternative. When I was in company I was less pleased, less excited, with the things said and done. Erstwhile worth-while fun and stunts seemed no longer worth while; and it was a torment to listen to the insipidities and stupidities of women, to the pompous, arrogant sayings of the little half-baked men. It is the penalty one pays for reading the books too much, or for being oneself a fool. In my case it does not matter which was my trouble. The trouble itself was the fact. The condition of the fact was mine. For me the life, and light, and sparkle of human intercourse were dwindling.|$|E
60|$|My name is Edward George Eden. I {{was born}} at Trentham, in Staffordshire, my father being {{employed}} in the gardens there. I lost my mother when I was three years old, and my father <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>five,</b> my uncle, George Eden, then adopting me as his own son. He was a single man, self-educated, and well-known in Birmingham as an enterprising journalist; he educated me generously, fired my ambition {{to succeed in the}} world, and at his death, which happened four years ago, left me his entire fortune, a matter of about five hundred pounds after all outgoing charges were paid. I was then eighteen. He advised me in his will to expend the money in completing my education. I had already chosen the profession of medicine, and through his posthumous generosity and my good fortune in a scholarship competition, I became a medical student at University College, London. At the time of the beginning of my story I lodged at 11A University Street in a little upper room, very shabbily furnished and draughty, overlooking the back of Shoolbred's premises. I used this little room both to live in and sleep in, because I was anxious to eke out my means to the very last shillings-worth.|$|E

CP: I became a naturalist by being {{brought up in a}} Devonshire valley, in the late thirties and during the war, and my father was the country parson. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the only child, and next door, there was a beautiful farm, Devon farm, with three children, with whom I became very friendly, and I almost became one of the family, so I spent almost my entire life <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t at school with the family, my own family, next door, on this farm, and that’s where I really learnt about the countryside I suppose. In a curious way, I may have learnt more through my own parents in my garden about natural history than the farming community because, both parents had an interest in natural history and I can remember being fascinated by the humming-bird hawkmoths that visited the flower garden. Then I remember one day {{there used to be a}} shrubbery, a laurel shrubbery, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about <b>five</b> or six, I found a stone, in which there was a beautiful print of what later <b>I</b> found out <b>was</b> a brachiopod and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so enthralled with this stone that I didn’t know what it was and my Dad told me all about fossils and things like that and that’s kind of really turned me on.
