40|$|Real-Time <b>Whiteboard</b> Capture System captures <b>whiteboard</b> lecture {{video in}} real time and {{extracts}} newly written pen strokes. Unlike other systems, {{it does not require}} special instruments such as electronic pen or <b>whiteboard.</b> The captured video images are classified into pen strokes on the <b>whiteboard,</b> foreground (person in front of the <b>whiteboard)</b> and <b>Whiteboard</b> Background Model (<b>whiteboard</b> without the text). The newly written pen strokes are extracted from current image frame and updated to the <b>Whiteboard</b> Background Model. <b>Whiteboard</b> Balancing is done where the colour of the <b>whiteboard</b> is corrected and made completely white. The captured video is processed at 8 frames per second (fps) instead of 25 fps that is output from the camera. <b>Whiteboard</b> balancing and reducing the processing frame rate provide a reduced bandwidth when transmitting <b>whiteboard</b> contents to remote meeting participants. This system can be used in conjunction with other teleconferencing tools such as voice conference and application sharing to improve online meeting experience.

Wesley's IT infrastructure includes over 4,000 notebook, 1,000 desktop computers and 850 network printers. In 2005 wireless internet was launched college-wide. In 2007 Wesley introduced tablet styled notebook computers and was the first educational institution in Australia to do so, but by 2010 were no longer being issued. In 2008, Art students were using Wacom pen-tablets for drawing use. Wesley introduced interactive <b>whiteboards</b> across all classrooms and some lecture theatres in 2008, allowing notes to be printed to a nearby printer or emailed to students. The College also began trialling electronic reading devices in 2008.|$|E
40|$|A <b>whiteboard</b> {{can be an}} easy {{tool for}} {{collaboration}} such as brainstorming, and is widely used, but the content on a <b>whiteboard</b> is hard to archive and share. While digital cameras {{can be used to}} capture <b>whiteboard</b> content, the images are usually taken from an angle, resulting in undesired perspective distortion. They may contain other distracting regions such as walls and shadows. The visual quality of those images is usually poor. This paper describes a system that automatically locates the boundary of a <b>whiteboard,</b> crops out the <b>whiteboard</b> region, rectifies it into a rectangle, and corrects the color to make the <b>whiteboard</b> completely white. In case a single image is not enough (e. g., large <b>whiteboard</b> and low-resolution camera), we have developed a robust feature-based technique to automatically stitch multiple overlapping images.

25|$|With a {{score of}} 0.943 on the Education Index, its overall rank is 37, but ranks third in the Caribbean after Cuba and Barbados, and second in South America after Argentina. According to DFID, Guyana has {{achieved}} the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education but continues to struggle with the provision of increased access to satisfactory secondary education. As {{one of the poorest}} countries in the Western Hemisphere, instruction in Guyana's schools makes little or no use of instructional technologies such as interactive <b>whiteboards</b> or other multimedia tools. Indeed, many schools are short on basic resources, especially in the areas of science and technology, and this sometimes puts students at a disadvantage when compared to their counterparts in the region.|$|E
25|$|The {{story was}} nearly {{finished}} on the <b>whiteboards</b> when Chibnall began writing the script. After about two weeks, Chibnall had {{a draft of}} the first few episodes. But he had not yet settled on a killer. About two weeks later, Chibnall woke one morning and realised the main suspect should be Joe Miller, DS Ellie Miller's husband. By making Joe the main suspect, Chibnall focused the series more closely on Ellie, and improved the narrative structure of the series so that it became about two families (the Millers and the Latimers). He then redrafted the first script and re-plotted and re-outlined the series. However, Chibnall kept the script loose enough that he could choose another character as the murderer, in case his preferred solution leaked to the press during shooting.|$|E

Chibnall was assisted in this process by his good friends, Sam Hoyle (a television script executive) and television director James Strong. The series was influenced by two American television shows, Twin Peaks (created by Mark Frost and David Lynch) and Murder One (created by Steven Bochco, Charles H. Eglee, and Channing Gibson).|$|E

[...] The game contained about 290 quests, each of which had to be tested in both single player and multiplayer modes. BioWare used a method, introduced to them by Feargus Urquhart, Douglas Avery, and Chris Parker of Black Isle Studios, in which the game's quests were listed on <b>whiteboards,</b> with a cross placed beside each quest. Pairs consisting of a developer and a tester were allotted each a quest, and upon their believing the quest to be stable, its cross was deleted.|$|E
500|$|Originally, {{the writers}} {{developed}} two potential plotlines for the episode: {{one in which}} Clark and Lana would get married, and another in which one of Clark's parents would die. The producers eventually chose only to kill one of the parents. The producers also debated the idea of other characters dying, but realized that none would have as much resonance as one of Clark's parents. Once the basic plot was decided, a group of Smallville writers used <b>whiteboards</b> to flesh out the story, and the details were arranged. After the main story line was developed, the supervising producers presented it to several of the executive vice presidents at The WB Television Network.
