5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video. That left {{less than a}} year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> scenes in order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical aspect ratio. The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E

Liverpool managed to score in the last minute through Lawler, but they were unable to score any further goals and lost the match 5–1.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. {{struggled}} {{to move to}} the offense, and finally managed a shot on goal in the 25th minute, which was blocked by English goalkeeper Bert Williams. The English counterattacked with three successive clear shots at the goal in minutes 30, 31, and 32, but failed to score. Mortensen twice <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> crossbar, and Tom Finney's header to the top corner was tipped away by Borghi.|$|E
5|$|A minute later, West Ham {{went ahead}} again; defender Paul Konchesky {{received}} {{the ball on}} the left flank, and played a ball into the Liverpool penalty area, only to see it sail over goalkeeper Reina and into the goal.

The ball broke back to Rooney 30 yards from goal, but his shot <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bar. The second half finished with a Wes Brown cross from the right wing that made its way across the penalty area to Ronaldo, but the Portuguese could only head the ball straight at Lehmann.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was {{not fully}} {{fit for the}} final against Brazil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, after pulling his {{hamstring}} during the semi-final and playing {{with the aid of}} a painkiller injection. Despite being far less dominant than in previous matches, he still tested Brazilian goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel and was able to set up a few chances for his teammates. The match ended 0–0 after extra time; he took Italy's last penalty in the resulting shootout, but his kick <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cross-bar and the Brazilians won the title in one of the most upsetting moments in World Cup history.|$|E

After conceding four goals against Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace in September, Given lost {{his place in the}} side to Lee Grant.

One of Miller's sixes travelled over 170m {{in the air to}} Block Q next to the pavilion. He then aimed a lofted shot over long on from the bowling of Hollies, directly at the pavilion. It was still rising when it narrowly <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> press box and clipped the top of the roof. Test spinner James Langridge was brought on and Miller deposited two drives over the fence in his first over.|$|E
5|$|However, Liverpool did {{score from}} their next attack. Gerrard played a {{ball into the}} West Ham penalty area, which <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> head of defender Scaloni and was met by striker Djibril Cissé, who scored to make it 2–1. Ashton came close to {{extending}} West Ham's lead in the 37th minute, but his effort went wide of the post after beating goalkeeper Reina. The last chance of the half came in the 44th minute when Liverpool defender Steve Finnan sliced a clearance straight to striker Harewood, however his shot {{went out for a}} throw-in.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball {{trickling}} along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably. The first half finished with a foul on Rooney, who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole, Vieira and Senderos, who eventually brought Rooney down. The English forward took the free kick himself, but it <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bar to cheers from the Arsenal fans {{and the sound of}} the referee's half-time whistle.|$|E

However, a goal line {{stand by the}} Rockets' defense kept the Redskins out of the endzone on a failed fourth-and-one running play. In the fourth quarter, Miami scored the final points of the game on a five-yard Terry Carter touchdown run to make the final score 20–14. The victory improved Toledo's all-time record against Miami to 16–22.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{continued}} to press forward following their goal. Carroll found Gerrard with a headed {{pass in the}} 71st minute, but Gerrard's shot <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> crossbar. Two minutes later a shot by Suárez was saved by Čech and out for a Liverpool corner, but Agger's header from the resulting corner went wide. Carroll {{had a number of}} chances in the subsequent minutes, but none of his headers were on target. Chelsea replaced goalscorer Ramires with midfielder Raul Meireles in the 76th minute and a minute later Bellamy was replaced by Dirk Kuyt for Liverpool. A minute after the substitution Suárez worked his way into the Chelsea half, his pass to Kuyt was cleared, but it fell to Henderson, whose shot <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Chelsea goal. Carroll thought he equalised in the 81st minute when his header from a Suárez cross was then palmed by Čech onto the underside of the bar and away to safety. Carroll ran away celebrating his second goal, but after consulting with his assistant, referee Phil Dowd did not award the goal. Replays of the incident remain ambiguous. Liverpool {{continued to}} push forward for the equaliser in the closing minutes, but they were unable to score and the match finished 2–1 to Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool got {{the first}} half of extra time under way, but the start was slow as players {{suffered}} with cramp, Carragher in particular. In the 97th minute, Liverpool won a corner, which West Ham cleared to Liverpool defender John Arne Riise {{on the edge of the}} penalty area, but his shot <b>went</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> crossbar. Liverpool won another corner in the 99th minute, which was cleared by West Ham; the ball came back into the penalty area and Morientes headed down for Cissé, but he was unable to control the ball.
