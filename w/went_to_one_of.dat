25|$|The two {{original}} Chinese maps portray Japan {{as a set}} {{of three}} islands that lie from east to west. They would be influenced by the legend of Xu Fu. According to the Records of the Grand Historian, Xu Fu claimed that there were three divine mountains in the sea and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the mountain-islands, which were later believed to be Japan.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{medication}} {{in the treatment}} of children also began in the 1930s, when Charles Bradley opened a neuropsychiatric unit and was the first to use amphetamine for brain-damaged and hyperactive children. But it wasn't until the 1960s that the first NIH grant to study pediatric psychopharmacology was awarded. It <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Kanner's students, Leon Eisenberg, the second director of the division.|$|E

25|$|After {{death the}} soul of the Aztec <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> three places: Tlalocan, Mictlan, and the sun. The Aztec idea of the afterlife for fallen warriors and women who died in {{childbirth}} was that their souls would be transformed into hummingbirds that would follow the sun on its journey through the sky. Those who drowned would go to Tlalocan, the first level of the upper worlds. Souls of people who died from less glorious causes would go to Mictlan, the lowest level of the underworld, taking four years and passing through many obstacles to reach this place.|$|E

25|$|Similar to Atlantis, the Destiny has a {{built-in}} dialing computer which can automatically dial the gate and stores a list of addresses. It locks out certain addresses, presumably because they are either dangerous or inconsequential to the current problem. Two expedition members who <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the locked-out addresses could not be contacted upon redialing. The Destiny also has hand-held dialing computers for those that travel through the Gate to make use of, as there {{do not appear to}} be on-site DHDs thus far. Gates on planets are each equipped with a platform, which transmits information about planet through subspace to Destiny. Since DHDs are absent, it is presumed the platforms are used to power the Gates.|$|E
25|$|On Friday 19 April 1991, Marriott and Poulton flew {{home from}} the United States, where Marriott had {{recorded}} songs for a future album with Frampton. During the flight, according to Poulton, Marriott was drinking heavily, was in a foul mood, and the two argued constantly. After arriving in the UK, a mutual friend met them and they all <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Marriott's favourite restaurants, The Straw Hat {{in the village of}} Sawbridgeworth for dinner, where he consumed more alcohol. After dinner, they returned to their friend's house and decided to stay overnight, since it was late, but upstairs in bed, Marriott and Poulton continued to argue. Poulton finally fell asleep and later woke to discover that Marriott had taken a taxi to his home in the nearby village of Arkesden.|$|E
25|$|Lamphere {{represented}} an unresolved danger to Gunness; now Asle Helgelien was making inquiries that {{could very well}} send her to the gallows. She told a lawyer in La Porte, M.E. Leliter, that she feared for her life and that of her children. Ray Lamphere, she said, had threatened to kill her and burn her house down. She wanted to make out a will, in case Lamphere went through with his threats. Leliter complied and drew up her will. She left her entire estate to her children and then departed Leliter's offices. She <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the La Porte banks holding the mortgage for her property and paid this off. She {{did not go to}} the police to tell them about Lamphere's allegedly life-threatening conduct. The reason for this, most later concluded, was that there had been no threats; she was merely setting the stage for her own arson.|$|E

25|$|In the 18th century {{only the}} nobility and wealthy had bathtubs in their homes, at the Marais and Faubourg Saint-Germain, the fashionable districts of the time. Other Parisians either did not bathe at all, bathed with a bucket, or <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the public bath houses, which {{provided}} hot tubs {{of water for}} a fee. They were heavily taxed by the government, and only a dozen survived {{until the end of}} the century. The more popular alternative, especially in summer, was bathing in the river from one of the large flat-bottomed bathing barges which were moored along the Seine, particularly on the right bank between the Cours-la-Reine and the Pont Marie. They were mostly former lumber barges, which were covered with wooden or straw roofs. Bathers paid an admission charge, then went down wooden steps from the barge into the river. Wooden pilings marked the limits of the bathing area, there were ropes to the pilings for the assistance of the numerous bathers who couldn't swim. In 1770 there were twenty such bathing barges, located at the Cours-la-Reine, the quai du Louvre, the quai Conti, across from the Palais-Bourbon, and at the western end of the Île-de-la-Cité, an establishment opened by the Canons of Notre-Dame. There were separate barges for men and women, and the bathers were offered bathing costumes for rent, but many preferred to bathe nude, men frequently swam into the women's area or swam along the river in full view of the people on riverbank. In 1723 the Lieutenant-General of Police condemned the baths as an offense to public morality and urged that they be moved from the center of the city, but they were popular and remained. In 1783 the police finally restricted bathing in the river during the day, but bathing at night was still allowed.|$|E

500|$|After Sill let Bettis and Lind {{know that}} Madonna was singing the song, some time elapsed before {{either of them}} heard {{anything}} from Warner Bros. Records. In between, they <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the recording sessions and were not impressed {{with the process of}} recording the song. Bettis commented, [...] "We <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the sessions, and to be honest, that particular session did not go all that well. [...] Jon and I were depressed about the way the song had come out. We heard nothing else about it and we were a little nervous that the song was going to be dropped from the picture." [...] Bettis went to England to work on the 1985 fantasy film Legend with music producer Jerry Goldsmith. It was there he received a call from Lind, who informed Bettis that a new version of [...] "Crazy for You" [...] was recorded and was made ready for a single release. Bettis was surprised and went over to Lind's house, where he warmly received the new recorded version of the song. It had a different arrangement from the demo version, and the arrangement was done by composer Rob Mounsey who rearranged the original track and added the background vocals. Bettis said: [...] "We owe a big debt of gratitude to [...] He really made a hit record out of [...]" [...] Mounsey was introduced in the project by record producer John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez who was producing [...] "Crazy for You".

2500|$|On 17 June General Ramon Tabera Commanding-General of the Second Army Corps {{began to}} make contact with Díaz, though {{returned}} without accomplishing anything. He assumed high command when Márquez disappeared from the city on the evening of 19 June {{with the rest of the}} treasury. A theory suggested he was smuggled alive by foreign Republican volunteers in a coffin to one of the cemeteries and set to travel at midnight. He was dressed as a fruit peddler to reach safely Vera Cruz. Other account claims he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his confidant, a miller with his compatriot O'Horán. Otterbourg, the United States Consul General tried to deliver a truce proposition that the city would surrender in exchange for the prohibition of death sentences upon the garrison. Díaz refused to listen to the proposition, and allowed a few minutes for him to return. After he passed the Equestrian statue of Charles IV the shelling resumed. After realising the absence of Márquez white flags were raised on the city buildings, and the call for a capitulation was signaled to the besiegers. The official message was delivered to Díaz by Miguel Peña, Díaz de la Vega and Carlos Palafox on the behalf and consent of Tabera. The agreement was as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|At the Hungarian {{left wing}} the Hungarian advance, {{covered by the}} cannons from the fortress, was stopped by the enemy cavalry, and pushed back to the {{so-called}} Star Fort of Komárom. The retreating Liebler-brigade was pursued towards Nagyigmánd by two regiments of the Hungarian hussars led by Major General József Nagysándor, supported by the 47th battalion and a 12-pound battery, but they were attacked from two sides by 4 enemy heavy cavalry regiments, which put the Hungarian cavalry in the danger of being obliterated, but {{the resistance of the}} infantry battalion, which entered quickly in a square formation, stopped the imperial cavalry. The Hungarian infantry from the Hungarian left wing retreated in square formations while shooting towards the center led by Damjanich. The 26th Hungarian battalion with a bayonet attack, forced the imperial heavy cavalry to retreat, saving the 47th battalion from a difficult situation, and holding until Damjanich sent the Ferdinánd Hussars to help them. With this on the left wing the Hungarians managed to hold the powerful imperial advance, so the battle here continued with artillery duel, until they run out of cannonballs. One of the adjutants of the Hungarian headquarters, Kálmán Rochlitz, wrote in his memoirs: Our field artillery run out of ammunition in such a way that, when I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the batteries of the I. corps, I saw with my own eyes, that our artillerymen picked up from the ground the cannon balls fired at us , wrapped them in the rags, made of the clothes ripped from the dead bodies of the fallen , and in this way they put them in the cannon tubes, on the blank gunpowder, they put in them [...] before.|$|E
