40|$|Background: How {{do people}} decide which sites {{to use when}} seeking health advice online? We can assume, from related work in e-commerce, that general design factors known to affect trust in the site are important, but {{in this paper we}} also address the impact of factors {{specific}} to the health domain. Objective: The current study aimed to (1) assess the factorial structure of a general measure of <b>Web</b> <b>trust,</b> (2) model how the resultant factors predicted trust in, and readiness to act on, the advice found on health-related websites, and (3) test whether adding variables from social cognition models to capture elements of the response to threatening, online health-risk information enhanced the prediction of these outcomes. Methods: Participants were asked to recall a site they had used to search for health-related information and to think of that site when answering an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a general <b>Web</b> <b>trust</b> questionnaire plus items assessing appraisals of the site, including threat appraisals, information checking, and corroboration. It was promoted on the hungersite. com website. The URL was distributed via Yahoo and local print media. We assessed the factorial structure of the measures using principal components analysis and modeled how well they predicted the outcome measures using structural equation modeling (SEM) with EQS software. Results: We report an analysis of the responses of participants who searched for health advice for themselves (N = 561). Analysis of the general <b>Web</b> <b>trust</b> questionnaire revealed 4 factors: information quality, personalization, impartiality, and credible design. In the final SEM model, information quality and impartiality were direct predictors of trust. However, variables specific to eHealth (perceived threat, coping, and corroboration) added substantially to the ability of the model to predict variance in trust and readiness to act on advice on the site. The final model achieved a satisfactory fit: χ 25 = 10. 8 (P =. 21), comparative fit index =. 99, root mean square error of approximation =. 052. The model accounted for 66...|$|E
40|$|When people {{rely on the}} web {{to gather}} and {{distribute}} information, they can build a sense of trust in the websites with which they interact. Understanding the correlates of trust in most websites (general website trust) and trust in websites that one frequently visits (familiar website trust) is crucial for constructing better models of risk perception and online behavior. We conducted an online survey of active Internet users and examined the associations between {{the two types of}} <b>web</b> <b>trust</b> and several independent factors: information technology competence, adverse online events, and general dispositions to be trusting or cautious of others. Using a series of nested ordered logistic regression models, we find positive associations between general trust, general caution, and the two types of <b>web</b> <b>trust.</b> The positive effect of information technology competence erases the effect of general caution for general website trust but not for familiar website trust, providing evidence that general trust and self-reported competence are stronger associates of general website trust than broad attitudes about prudence. Finally, the experience of an adverse online event has a strong, negative association with general website trust, but not with familiar website trust. We discuss several implications for online behavior and suggest website policies that can help users make informed decisions about interacting with potentially risky websites...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Webs</b> of <b>trust</b> {{constitute}} a decentralized infrastructure for establishing {{the authenticity of}} the binding between public keys and users and, more generally, trust relationships among users. This paper introduces the concept of anonymous <b>webs</b> of <b>trust</b> – an extension of <b>webs</b> of <b>trust</b> where users can authenticate messages and determine each other’s trust level without compromising their anonymity. Our framework comprises a novel cryptographic protocol based on zero-knowledge proofs, a symbolic abstraction and formal verification of our protocol, and a prototypical implementation based on the OpenPGP standard. The framework is capable of dealing with various core and optional features of common <b>webs</b> of <b>trust,</b> such as key attributes, key expiration dates, existence of multiple certificate chains, and trust measures between different users. ...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{collaborative}} filtering (CF) based recommender systems {{on the basis}} of user similarity often suffer from low accuracy because of the difficulty in finding similar users. Incorporating trust network into CF-based recommender system is an attractive approach to resolve the neighbor selection problem. Most existing trust-based CF methods assume that underlying relationships (whether inferred or pre-existing) can be described and reasoned in a <b>web</b> of <b>trust.</b> However, in online sharing communities or e-commerce sites, a <b>web</b> of <b>trust</b> is not always available and is typically sparse. The limited and sparse <b>web</b> of <b>trust</b> strongly affects the quality of recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel method that establishes and exploits a two-faceted <b>web</b> of <b>trust</b> {{on the basis of}} users' personal activities and relationship networks in online sharing communities or e-commerce sites, to provide enhanced-quality recommendations. The developed <b>web</b> of <b>trust</b> consists of interest similarity graphs and directed trust graphs and mitigates the sparsity of <b>web</b> of <b>trust.</b> Moreover, the proposed method captures the temporal nature of trust and interest by dynamically updating the two-faceted <b>web</b> of <b>trust.</b> Furthermore, this method adapts to the differences in user rating scales by using a modified Resnick's prediction formula. As enabled by the Pareto principle and graph theory, new users highly benefit from the aggregated global interest similarity (popularity) in interest similarity graph and the global trust (reputation) in the directed trust graph. The experiments on two datasets with different sparsity levels (i. e., Jester and MovieLens datasets) show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the predictive accuracy and decision-support accuracy of the trust-based CF recommender system. 16 page(s...|$|R

Then, we present two applications that combine the computed trust values with the provenance of other annotations to personalize websites. The FilmTrust system uses trust to compute personalized recommended movie ratings and to order reviews. An open source intelligence portal, Profiles In Terror, also has a beta system that integrates social networks with trust annotations.

40|$|The {{growth of}} eCommerce is being {{hampered}} {{by a lack}} of trust between providers and consumers of Web-based services. While <b>Web</b> <b>trust</b> issues have been addressed by researchers in many disciplines, a comprehensive approach has yet to be established. This thesis proposes a conceptual trust-profiling frameworkW 3 TFwhich addresses issues of trust and user confidence through a range of new user-centred trust measurestrust categories, trust domains, transitivity of trust, fading factor analysis, standalone assessment, hyperlinked assessment and relevance assessment. While others now use the concept of transitivity of trust, it was first introduced by this research in 1998. The thesis also illustrates how W 3 TF can narrow the gap/disconnection between the hierarchical PKI trust environment and the horizontal Web referral environment. The framework incorporates existing measures of trust (such as Public Key Infrastructure), takes account of consumer perceptions by identifying trust attributes, and utilises Web technology (in the form of metadata), to create a practical, flexible and comprehensive approach to trust assessment. The versatility of the W 3 TF is demonstrated by applying it to a variety of cases from trust literature and to the hypothetical case study that provided the initial stimulus for this research. It is shown that the framework can be expanded to accommodate new trust attributes, categories and domains, and that trust can be weighed (and therefore evaluated) by using various mathematical formulae based on different theories and policies. The W 3 TF addresses identified needs, narrows the gaps in existing approaches and provides a mechanism to embrace current and future efforts in trust management. The framework is a generic form of trust assessment that can help build user confidence in an eCommerce environment. For service providers, it offers an incentive to create websites with a high number of desired trust attributes. For consumers, it enables more reliable judgments to be made. Hence, <b>Web</b> <b>trust</b> can be enhanced...|$|E

When a peer receives a query, an attempt to solve the query by using both linguistic and contextual knowledge is made. In our proposal, each peer analyzes the result of its queries and increases the trust of those peers who reply with more appropriate semantic contents. In this respect, our approach is adaptive. As queries are resolved, the routing strategy of each peer becomes more and more trust-based, namely, based on the semantics of contents rather than on a mere syntactic matching of keywords. This leads to the emergence of communities of peers semantically related, which in turn corresponds to a peer-to-peer network clustered by contents, capable to resolve queries with a reduced number of hops.
