5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E
25|$|With this Classical style {{came the}} {{willingness}} to expose the breast. With the new iconography of the Revolution {{as well as a}} change in emphasis on maternal breast-feeding, the chemise dress became a sign of the new egalitarian society. The style was simple and appropriate for the comfort of a pregnant or nursing woman as the breasts were emphasized and their availability was heightened. Maternity became fashionable and it was not uncommon for women to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> their breasts exposed. Some women took the “fashionable maternity” a step further and wore a “six-month pad” under their dress to appear pregnant.|$|E
25|$|On the SmackDown! {{before the}} Royal Rumble, Kane was {{involved}} in a six-man elimination over-the-top-rope battle royal, with King Booker, MVP, The Miz, Chris Benoit and Finlay. This match went to a no contest as The Undertaker interrupted after Kane had been eliminated and punished by the remaining opponents. At the Royal Rumble, Kane eliminated King Booker, but Booker re-entered the ring and eliminated Kane. A couple weeks later on SmackDown!, while receiving the key to the city in his hometown of Houston, Booker was attacked by Kane starting a feud between the two. At No Way Out, Kane defeated King Booker. On February 23, Kane lost to King Booker in a Falls Count Anywhere Money in the Bank Qualifying match after interference from The Great Khali, sparking a feud between the two. Prior to WrestleMania 23, Kane started to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> a hook, similar to the hook he used as Jacob Goodnight in See No Evil. At the event, Kane was defeated by Khali. During the match, in homage to Hulk Hogan slamming André the Giant twenty years earlier at WrestleMania III, Kane picked up Khali {{for the first time and}} body-slammed him to the mat. After WrestleMania, he began to feud with William Regal and Dave Taylor. The Boogeyman then joined the feud, teaming up with Kane. On the May 4 episode of SmackDown!, Kane competed in a number one contender's match for the United States Championship held by MVP. Kane lost due to interference by Regal and Taylor. On the May 25 episode of SmackDown!, Kane competed in a fatal four-way number one contender's match for the World Heavyweight Championship which was won by Batista. Kane then entered a short feud with Mark Henry. Kane was defeated by Henry in a Lumberjack match at One Night Stand due to interference from lumberjacks Kenny Dykstra and Chavo Guerrero and then took a short hiatus.|$|E

500|$|The album's next {{track is}} {{a version of}} the Chris Montez song [...] "Let's Dance". The song {{features}} Leon playing Radio City's large Wurlitzer pipe organ. The 13th track on the record, [...] "I Don't Want to <b>Walk</b> <b>Around</b> <b>with</b> You", consists of two lyric lines and three major chords. It is one of the group's earliest compositions. [...] It is the first song on their first demo tape, written at the beginning of 1974. [...] "I Don't Wanna <b>Walk</b> <b>Around</b> <b>with</b> You" [...] fades into the album's final track, [...] "Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World", a song that refers to a Hitler Youth member. Seymour Stein complained about the song's original lyrics—"I'm a Nazi, baby, I'm a Nazi, yes I am. I'm a Nazi Schatze, y'know I fight for the Fatherland"—insisting that the track was offensive. When Stein threatened to completely remove the track from the album the band put together alternate lyrics: [...] "I'm a shock trooper in a stupor, yes I am. I'm a Nazi Schatze, y'know I fight for the Fatherland." [...] Stein accepted the revision and it was published in the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} Ramones {{addressed}} several lyrical themes including violence, male prostitution, drug use, and Nazism.

Leigh sang backing vocals on [...] "Judy Is a Punk", [...] "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend", and in the bridge of [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop". Tommy sang backing vocals on [...] "I Don't Wanna <b>Walk</b> <b>Around</b> <b>with</b> You", [...] "Judy Is a Punk", and during the bridge of [...] "Chainsaw".

500|$|The {{last two}} decades of Gibbons's life were uneventful and lived almost entirely beyond the public eye. She kept her health and looks [...] until almost {{the end of her}} life—in a biographical sketch, Jill Neville {{recorded}} that [...] "her beauty endured, as did her upright carriage, typical of Edwardian ladies who were forced as girls to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> a book balanced on their heads." [...] As well as her unpublished novels she wrote occasional short stories, two of which were rejected by the BBC, and contributed three new poems to Richard Adams's 1986 anthology Occasional Poets, a work which included verses from part-time poets such as Iris Murdoch, [...] William Golding, [...] Alan Ayckbourn and Quentin Crisp. [...] These were Gibbons's last published works. One of Gibbons's poems in the anthology was [...] "Writ in Water", inspired by her love for the poetry of [...] Keats. In 2013 the manuscript of this poem was presented to the Keats-Shelley Memorial House museum in Rome.|$|E

The release, along with the Ramones 2001 Expanded Edition, featured [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop" [...] remixed as a single version, although it maintains a time of two minutes and twelve seconds. On January 6, 2004, Rhino Entertainment re-released [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop" [...] as a CD single, using [...] "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker" [...] as its B-side. [...] "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" [...] was released in February 1976 as a 7" [...] single.

500|$|Lo {{found the}} {{shooting}} difficult and exhausting {{because she had}} to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> a 22-pound camera strapped around her waist for the three days of the filming. She also stated that it was [...] "draining" [...] to represent the pain she felt when she wrote the track. At one point during the filming, Lo was drunk and tired, so {{she decided to go}} into the bathroom stall; concerning this, the singer confessed that: [...] "I was wasted and tired and it was a tough recording and I really just went into the bathroom and sat there by myself. There weren't any people around then and I was just really alone in that stall. I just sat there and thought of anything that was happening during that time. The tears just came." [...] She also confessed that she barely remembered half of the recording. On 19 February 2014, she posted a teaser of the video on her Facebook account. On 17 March 2014, the music video was released via Lo's VEVO channel on YouTube, and was made available for consumption on the iTunes Store the next day.|$|E

500|$|For the film's look, the Coens {{wanted to}} avoid the usual retro 1960s clichés like lava lamps, Day-Glo posters, and Grateful Dead music and {{for it to be}} [...] "consistent with the whole bowling thing, we wanted to keep the movie pretty bright and poppy", Joel said in an interview. For example, the star motif {{featured}} predominantly throughout the film, started with the film's production designer Richard Heinrichs' design for the bowling alley. According to Joel, he [...] "came {{up with the idea of}} just laying free-form neon stars on top of it and doing a similar free-form star thing on the interior". This carried over to the film's dream sequences. [...] "Both dream sequences involve star patterns and are about lines radiating to a point. In the first dream sequence, the Dude gets knocked out and you see stars and they all coalesce into the overhead nightscape of L.A. The second dream sequence is an astral environment with a backdrop of stars", remembers Heinrichs. For Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach house, he was inspired by late 1950s and early 1960s bachelor pad furniture. The Coen brothers told Heinrichs that they wanted Treehorn's beach party to be Inca-themed, with a [...] "very Hollywood-looking party in which young, oiled-down, fairly aggressive men <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> appetizers and drinks. So there's a very sacrificial quality to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Emerson did not own {{a record}} player, he enjoyed {{listening}} to music on the radio, particularly Floyd Cramer's 1961 slip note-style [...] "On the Rebound" [...] {{and the work of}} Dudley Moore. He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books. He also listened to boogie-woogie, and to country-style pianists including Joe [...] "Mr Piano" [...] Henderson, Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell. Emerson later described himself: [...] "I was a very serious child. I used to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> Beethoven sonatas under my arm. However, I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies. That was because I could also play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs. So, they thought I was kind of cool and left me alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 1995, Cuomo had {{extensive}} surgery {{to extend his}} left leg, which was 44mm shorter than the right. This involved the surgical breaking of the leg bone, followed by months of wearing a steel brace and painful physiotherapy sessions; the procedure affected his songwriting, as he would spend long periods hospitalized {{under the influence of}} painkillers. At the end of 1995, Cuomo enrolled in Harvard University to study classical composition. His right leg was still in a brace following surgery, and he required a cane to walk; he described it as [...] "like having, I think, about seven arrows lodged into your leg bone, and then having to <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> them lodged in like that for thirteen months, with only Advil." [...] Between classes, Cuomo took painkillers, rested in bed, and listened to opera. He told The New York Times: [...] "The only time I could write songs was when my frozen dinner was in the microwave. The rest of the time I was doing homework." [...] He auditioned for the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum chorus but was not selected.

2500|$|Wolverine {{was tough}} for Jackman to portray {{because he had}} few lines, {{but a lot of}} emotion to convey in them. To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Road Warrior. [...] "Here were guys who had {{relatively}} little dialogue, like Wolverine had, but you knew and felt everything. I'm not normally one to copy, but I wanted to see how these guys achieved it." [...] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. [...] "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine. I kept saying to the writers, 'Don't give me long, choreographed fights for the sake of it. Don't make the fights pretty." [...] Jackman also had to get used to wearing Wolverine's claws. [...] "Every day in my living room, I'd just <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> those claws, to get used to them. I've got scars on one leg, punctures straight through the cheek, on my forehead. I'm a bit clumsy. I'm lucky I didn't tell them that when I auditioned." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager would look at me and all the doors were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. I was drinking on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but walking around with drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and <b>walk</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It frightened me and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I found the courage. My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because one drink isn’t going to do anything for me except start it all again." ...|$|E
