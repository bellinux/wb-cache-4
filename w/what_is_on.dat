5|$|During her {{short-lived}} presidency, a {{truck with}} nuclear energy goes missing and puts D.C. into lock-down, a scheme devised by {{several members of}} Frank's cabinet and Conway's campaign. During the emergency, Claire is visited by diplomat Jane Davis (Patricia Clarkson), who says that she can track down a leader of ICO for the Underwoods. Claire is also faced {{with a series of}} diplomatic crises: Russian soldiers have also taken over an American base, and the Russians and Chinese are vying for possession of a boat in Antarctica that has a stowaway American working for the Russians. After making a deal with the Chinese, Claire orders for the boat to be destroyed so that neither the Chinese nor the Russians can get <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> board. Around this time, Claire agrees to an open election in Ohio for not only the President, but also the Vice President, in order to avoid a possible Conway-Underwood administration.|$|E
5|$|Saori, nicknamed , is a {{girl who}} is a fifth grader in Shuichi's class at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son. She takes an interest in encouraging Shuichi to cross-dress, even {{going so far as to}} buy Shuichi an expensive dress for Shuichi's birthday, which Shuichi later returns, much to her displeasure. Saori finds it difficult to associate with others; she has few friends, though becomes close to Shuichi. She tends to convey <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> her mind and disregards how others may take what she says. As Saori grows up, she gradually becomes more standoffish and stoic; she even has bad relations with her teachers. Despite her self-centered attitude, she remains popular among her male classmates due to her physical attractiveness. She is a sensitive girl whose temper sometimes gets the better of her when reprimanding bullies that tease Shuichi, because of Shuichi's femininity and cross-dressing. Saori is often emotionally affected by circumstances involving Shuichi, because of her feelings for Shuichi. Saori converts to Christianity partly because of this influence to seek forgiveness for her previous actions, though she only attends mass when feeling guilty about her behavior.|$|E

25|$|Bach wrote virtuoso {{music for}} {{specific}} instruments, {{as well as}} music independent of instrumentation. For instance, the Sonatas and partitas for solo violin are considered the pinnacle {{of what has been}} written for this instrument, only within reach of accomplished players: the music fits the instrument, pushing it to the full scale of its possibilities, requiring virtuosity of the player, but without bravura. Notwithstanding that the music and the instrument seem inseparable, Bach made transcriptions for other instruments of some pieces of this collection. Similarly, for the cello suites, the virtuoso music seems tailored for the instrument, the best of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> offer for it, yet Bach made an arrangement for lute of one of these suites. Likewise for much of his most virtuoso keyboard music. Bach exploited the capabilities of an instrument to the fullest while keeping the core of such music independent of the instrument on which it is performed.|$|E

25|$|In 1971 Konstantīns Raudive wrote Breakthrough, {{detailing}} what {{he believed}} was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP {{has been described as}} auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that one when the first sound (word or syllable) is coming from the speaker on the left, the second sound is coming from the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.|$|E

500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 35 seconds. It draws influence from the music genre of R and pop, while instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The song is written in the key of A minor and is set in simple time with a metronome of 76 beats per minute. Burke's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5. In an interview with Peter Andre on The Paul O'Grady Show on 3 November 2009, Burke explained {{the meaning of the}} songs lyrics, saying [...] "I'm sure everyone has been in that situation where you are in a relationship, it might not be going so well and you kinda want your other half to speak out and say <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> their mind, and I've had relationships like that." [...] Burke continued to explain that {{when she was in the}} recording studio with RedOne, her Aunt was experiencing problems in her relationship which related to the lyrics in [...] "The Silence," [...] and that she felt that her Aunt's partner should not [...] "let the silence do the talking? Why doesn't he let you know how he feels?," [...] and that [...] "The Silence" [...] was written as a result. The songs begins with the lyrics [...] "Oh, you lift me up." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{widespread}} {{success has}} made it indispensable to the band's live setlists and has been performed over 640 times since 1991 making it the band's second most performed song behind [...] "Give it Away". Unlike several of the Chili Peppers' other songs, [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] is not interpreted in a different manner than <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the record—aside from being played acoustically, the track is performed {{the same as it}} appears on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Kiedis is, however, notorious for being incapable of achieving several high notes in live performances; the vocalist has noted that he sometimes forgets or rearranges song lyrics in the verses. Therefore, the song has sometimes suffered from his limitations as a singer. After being released as a single in March 1992, the song would be included in virtually all concerts; Frusciante, however, began to resent the song's popularity and would play convoluted intros, purposefully throwing Kiedis off. An example of this was during a televised performance on the highly rated program Saturday Night Live on February 22, 1992. Kiedis said that it [...] "felt like I was getting stabbed in the back and hung out to dry in front of all of America while [...] was off in a corner in the shadow, playing some dissonant out-of-tune experiment." [...] The guitarist used a distortion pedal for the ending verse and screamed incomprehensibly into the microphone when providing backup vocals, neither of which were originally planned or typical of live performances. Nevertheless, sales of Blood Sugar Sex Magik skyrocketed following the show.|$|E

500|$|Very {{soon after}} its initial release {{in the spring}} of 1968, several critics began championing the film in the UK and US. Robin Wood wrote that [...] "Witchfinder General is {{certainly}} [...] most successfully achieved work ... what one is immediately struck by is the assurance and intensity of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the screen... the English countryside is felt as a real presence: it is difficult to think of other films in which it has been used so sensitively and meaningfully. With it is associated Paul Ferris’ theme-music, which suggests a traditional air without being actual quotation. Against the peace and fertility of nature is set the depravity of men." [...] David Pirie, who wrote extensively and enthusiastically about the film in his 1973 book A Heritage of Horror, reviewed the film in 1971 for Time Out, commenting: [...] "...one of the most personal and mature statements in the history of British cinema... The performances are generally excellent, and no film before or since has used the British countryside in quite the same way." [...] Danny Peary noted, [...] "The Conqueror Worm is a stunning film in many ways, but probably Reeves's greatest achievement is {{that he was able to}} maintain an extraordinary momentum throughout, until the film ends as it began, with a woman (this time Sara) screaming." [...] In 2000, Derek Malcolm included Witchfinder General as part of his series The Century of Films, a list of what he considered to be the one hundred most [...] "artistically or culturally important" [...] movies of the 20th Century. Malcolm asserted that the film [...] "is one of the most compulsively watchable ever made in Britain" [...] and [...] "transcends its genre with the sheer panache of its making." [...] In 2005, J. Hoberman of the Village Voice stated that the film [...] "...has long been a cult item– in part because its talented 25-year-old director, Michael Reeves, died of a drug overdose before [...] the film's release, but mainly because it is an extraordinarily bleak story of political evil... Reeves shot on location and the movie has a robust autumnal quality perfectly matched by Price's overripe performance... it remains contemporary, and even frightening, in its evocation of cynical Puritanism and mass deception." ...|$|E
