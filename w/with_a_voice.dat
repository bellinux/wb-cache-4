It concerned an alien operating from a supermarket <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> coming over a tannoy into the empty store. The focus of story would be Luke and K9, with Luke combating the alien alone like the 1988 action movie Die Hard.|$|E
5|$|Josquin {{frequently}} used imitation, especially paired imitation, in writing his motets, with sections akin to fugal expositions occurring on successive {{lines of the}} text he was setting. An example is his setting of Dominus regnavit (Psalm 93), for four voices; each of {{the lines of the}} psalm begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> singing a new tune alone, quickly followed by entries of other three voices in imitation.|$|E

25|$|A papal {{privilege}} dated 26 January 1386, {{admitted the}} Provost of St Mary's to the chapter of St Andrews; {{he became one}} of the three secular dignitaries of the chapter, along with the diocese's two archeadecons:Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. At the petition of king Robert, the pope hereby constitutes as a secular dignity with cure of the cathedral of St Andrews, that dignity of the Chapel Royal of St Andrews, immediately subject to the Apostolic See, which is commonly known as the provostship of St Andrews, assigning to the provost and his successors a stall in the choir and a place in the chapter, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> in the election of the bishop, or of any other office, and in all capitular acts and negotiations, and the said provost nevertheless remaining subject to the bishop, who has the power to correct him, and if necessary even deprive him of office. Although in the cathedral there are no dignities, there are two archdeaconries which are reckoned as dignities, and the seculars holding them have stalls in the choir and places in the chapter, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> in all capitular matters. Avignon, 9 Kal. Feb., anno 9. In the 1440s, the Chancellor of the Church of St Mary was added to the chapter of the cathedral (1447 x 1449), but this lasted less than two decades, being dissolved between 1461 and 1462.|$|E
25|$|Planar {{magnetic}} speakers (having printed or embedded conductors {{on a flat}} diaphragm) {{are sometimes}} described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> coil printed or mounted on it. The current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field of carefully placed magnets {{on either side of}} the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, Sutherland had already established a reputation as a diva <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> out of the ordinary. She sang Lucia to great acclaim in Paris in 1960 and, in 1961, at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera. In 1960, she sang a superb Alcina at La Fenice, Venice, where she was nicknamed La Stupenda ("The Stunning One"). Lucia di Lammermoor generated so much excitement that standees began lining up at 7:30 that morning. Her singing of the Mad Scene drew a thunderous 12-minute ovation. Sutherland would soon be praised as La Stupenda in newspapers around the world. Later that year (1960), Sutherland sang Alcina at the Dallas Opera, with which she made her US debut.|$|E

25|$|One {{must not}} mistake the Mozartian {{dramatic}} coloratura soprano with the Italian dramatic coloratura soprano. A singer that sings Konstanze, Donna Anna or Fiordiligi can not necessarily sing the Italian dramatic coloratura parts, due to other vocal demands. Imogene, Leonora and Violetta require a dramatic soprano voice and {{are most often}} sung by dramatic sopranos with an agile voice that can easily produce coloratura and high notes. Roles like Norma, Lady Macbeth, Odabella or Abigaille are good examples of Italian roles that are not necessarily a coloratura soprano (even though the score calls for coloratura singing), but a full bodied dramatic soprano <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>voice</b> that can handle extreme dramatic singing and that is flexible enough to sing coloratura. Giuseppe Verdi wrote many parts like this in his early years.|$|E

A mayor and deputy mayor are selected by the council from among its members.

If an animated character looks more human than its movement, this gives a negative impression. Human neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance and motion kinematics are important.|$|R
