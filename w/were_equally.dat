5|$|Cats {{are common}} pets {{throughout}} the world, and their worldwide population exceeds 500million. Although cat guardianship has commonly {{been associated with}} women, a 2007 Gallup poll reported {{that men and women}} in the United States of America <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> likely to own a cat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the other}} direction, between Kehl and the Schutter, which lay downstream, the fortifications <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> secured. The redoubt there held about 8 cannons and 400 men, {{and covered the}} street between the hamlet of Auenheim and Kehl.|$|E
5|$|Spafford {{supported}} {{many of the}} movement's causes such {{as equal}} pay for equal work and non-discrimination in hiring practices when both individuals <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> qualified.

5|$|Although he had stated an {{interest}} in playing the trumpet, Marmarosa's parents persuaded him {{to take up the}} piano, which he began at the age of 9. He received classical music lessons, but was influenced by the jazz playing of Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and others after fellow pianist Erroll Garner, four years Marmarosa's elder, introduced him to their music. Marmarosa practiced a lot, until his left and right hands <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> strong.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the second round. The majority of Liverpool's matches were close affairs, {{with the exception of}} a 4–1 victory over Burnley in the second round. Otherwise, their biggest margin of victory was by two goals over Blackburn Rovers in the fourth round. Bolton's matches <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> close. Their biggest margin of victory was three goals in the second round against Ipswich Town, while they beat Norwich City by a single goal in the quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|Drysdale also {{oversaw the}} first civil {{litigation}} trial, {{in which the}} owners of the two ships sought damages from each other. His decision (27 April 1918) found Mont-Blanc entirely at fault. Subsequent appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada (19 May 1919), and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London (22 March 1920), determined Mont-Blanc and Imo <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> to blame for navigational errors that led to the collision. No party was ever convicted for any crime or otherwise successfully prosecuted for any actions that precipitated the disaster.|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneity in the {{underlying}} population places {{difficulties in the}} way of interpretation of all statistical data based on averages. No two persons <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> likely to die in the next year; no two marriages <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> likely to <b>be</b> broken up by divorce; no two businesses <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> likely to fail; no two automobiles <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> likely to break down. That on the average a given make of automobile will travel 50, 000 miles without major repairs offers little assurance for any particular automobile. Averages can be applied to individual cases only at great risk. This gross aspect of heterogeneity is not the subject of the present chapter...|$|R
40|$|There are {{at least}} two views on what relativism is. One is a view that relativism is a {{position}} that claims any positions <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> wrong or equally false as well as equally right or <b>equally</b> true. Another <b>is</b> a view that relativism is not the position that claims any positions <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> wrong or equally false but a position that claims any positions <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> right or equally true. This paper critically examines the two views and concludes the latter is a more proper concept of relativism according to critical rationalism, and the position that claims any positions <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> wrong or <b>equally</b> false <b>is</b> not relativism but relativizationism, which is compatible with criticism in Popper’s sense...|$|R

5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E
5|$|First Nations peoples have lived, hunted, and {{traveled}} across {{the area for}} at least 10,000 years, as shown by archaeological evidence on Walpole Island. These peoples were drawn from an amalgamation of Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potowatami clans, which formed the Three Fires Confederacy, also called the Council of Three Fires, in A.D. 796. These clans came together through common links in both language and culture, developing a self-sufficient society where tasks and responsibilities <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> shared among all members.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the layoff of Icos employees, {{other aspects of the}} acquisition <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> controversial, such as assertions that Icos was being sold too cheaply and that conflicts of interest existed. The latter related to Icos senior executives, who– despite poor stock performance, in part from failed clinical development programs and an inability to successfully license drugs over the preceding years– were to be massively compensated upon a successful acquisition.|$|E

5|$|The 1951 and 1952 seasons <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> {{successful}} for Willis, although the Browns {{lost in the}} NFL championship to the Los Angeles Rams and Detroit Lions. He was an all-pro selection and {{was named to the}} Pro Bowl in both years. In 1953, when the Browns lost a third championship game in a row, Willis was named an all-pro but did not make the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The Scandinavian {{trade routes}} <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> {{important}} for the Batavian Navy, and to protect their merchant shipping from attack by British frigates, the Batavian authorities also sent a frigate squadron to the region, consisting of the 36-gun frigates Alliantie and Argo and the 16-gun cutter Vlugheid. On the afternoon of 22 August 1795 the Batavian force was sailing southeast {{along the coast of}} Norway, then part of Danish Norway, tacking to port towards the land, when the British squadron was spotted approaching from the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{effective}} {{tax rate}} for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax rebate {{that are used to}} rebate taxes paid on purchases up to the poverty level. The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new goods and services. Critics argue that the sales tax rate defined in the legislation would not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect less for the government than the current tax system), and thus would increase the budget deficit, unless government spending <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> reduced.|$|E

5|$|The {{reforms of}} Sejanus most {{significantly}} included {{the founding of}} the Castra Praetoria, which established the Praetorian Guard as the powerful political force, for which it is primarily known today. Henceforth the Guard was at the disposal of the emperors, and the rulers <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> {{at the mercy of the}} Praetorians. The reality of this was seen in AD 31, when Tiberius was forced to rely upon the vigiles against the soldiers of his own guard. Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius, their potential political power had been made clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{successful}} {{resistance of}} Dvin {{put an end}} to the Byzantine advance in Armenia, helping preserve the independence of the smaller Armenian realms of Syunik, Tashir and Khachen. Soon after, the regional balance of power was permanently altered with the first large-scale raid of the Seljuk Turks under Qutlumush ibn Arslan Isra'il and Ibrahim Inal into Byzantine Armenia in 1048. While the Shaddadids may have been tempted to see in them welcome allies against the Byzantines, they <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> likely to be a threat, as demonstrated by the attack on Ganja by Qutlumush in 1046/47.|$|E
5|$|Variety in texture, {{height and}} timing of floral display <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> {{important}} horticultural considerations. The beds around each headstone are planted {{with a mixture of}} floribunda roses and herbaceous perennials. Low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of plants are used instead.|$|E

5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that the stars were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of the stars being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that the stars <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E
5|$|However, {{before the}} start of the 1947–48 NBL season, Maurice White, the {{president}} of the American Gear Company and the owner of the American Gears NBL team, pulled the team out of the league. White planned to create a 24-team league called the Professional Basketball League of America, in which he owned all the teams and arenas. However, the league folded after just a month, and the players of White's teams <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> distributed among the 11 remaining NBL franchises. As a consequence, every team had a 9.09% chance of landing Mikan, who ended up on the Minneapolis Lakers, playing for coach John Kundla.|$|E
5|$|In England, the seventh-century bishop Aldhelm was {{the most}} {{influential}} hermeneutic writer; Latin scholarship declined in the ninth century, and when it revived in the tenth, the hermeneutic style became increasingly influential. Unlike in continental Europe, where it was used only by a minority of writers, in tenth-century England it became nearly universal. It was the house style of the English Benedictine Reform, the most important intellectual movement in later Anglo-Saxon England. The style fell out of favour after the Norman Conquest, and the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic. Historians <b>were</b> <b>equally</b> dismissive until the late twentieth century, when scholars such as Michael Lapidge argued {{that it should be}} taken seriously as an important aspect of late Anglo-Saxon culture.|$|E
