25|$|If a {{glass of}} water is placed so that the beak dips into it on its descent, the bird will {{continue}} to absorb water and the cycle <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> long as there is enough water in the glass to keep the head wet. However, the bird will continue to dip even without a source of water, as long as the head is wet, or as long as a temperature differential is maintained between the head and body. This differential can be generated without evaporative cooling in the head; for instance, a heat source directed at the bottom bulb will create a pressure differential between top and bottom that will drive the engine. The ultimate source of energy is the temperature gradient between the toy's head and base; the toy is not a perpetual motion machine.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{economist}} for Japan at Credit Suisse, Hiromichi Shirakawa, {{said in a}} note to clients that the estimated economic loss may be around $171 billion–$183billion just to the region hit by the quake and tsunami. On 14 March, the Bank of Japan, {{in an attempt to}} maintain market stability, injected 15trillion yen into the money markets to assure financial stability amid a plunge in stocks and surge in credit risk. After it set up an emergency task force to ensure liquidity {{in the aftermath of the}} disaster, governor Masaaki Shirakawa and the bank's board also enlarged a programme to buy government bonds to exchange-traded funds to the tune of 10trillion yen. The BOJ chief told reporters cash injections <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> needed. However, following the further nuclear leaks, its actions were read by the market as insufficient despite 8trillion yen being pumped into the market. On 15 March, the Topix index fell again marking a two-day plunge not seen since 1987 as Japan's default risk surged after Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned of further leaks from the damaged nuclear power plant. Commodities were also significantly lower. Residents of Tokyo were reported to have gone on panic shopping sprees as daily necessities were sought after and gasoline was stocked up with the increasing risk of radioactivity releases.|$|E

In week seven of the Premier League, Van Barneveld defeated Taylor 7–4, despite Taylor averaging 115.80, the highest losing average in the history of televised darts. Van Barneveld survived relegation by leg difference, but then went on a stunning run by winning six of his last seven matches to qualify for the play-offs. It included 7–2, 7–3 and 7–2 victories over Taylor, Van Gerwen and Lewis respectively. From 4–4 in the semi-finals against Van Gerwen, Van Barneveld won three successive legs which included missing double 12 for a nine-darter. However, Van Gerwen then took five legs on the trot and went on to win 10–8. The pair were knocked out in the semi-finals of the World Cup in a doubles match against Scotland's Anderson and Wright. He was eliminated at the first round stage of the World Matchplay {{for the first time}} in his career when Andy Hamilton beat him 10–7. Van Barneveld's search for a first World Series of Darts title <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>as</b> he missed five championship darts in the final of the last leg of the Auckland Darts Masters to lose 11–10 against Lewis.

In a motion filed August 5, 2016, Vann's attorneys argued that Indiana's death penalty law is unconstitutional. In November 2016, Judge Samuel Cappas denied Vann's motion to declare the state's death penalty statute unconstitutional. In January 2017, a Lake County judge decided that Vann could make an appeal with his claims that Indiana's death penalty statute is unconstitutional. In April 2017, the Indiana Supreme Court turned down Vann's request to look at the constitutionality of the state's death penalty statute before he goes to trial. At a status hearing in April 2017, Judge Samuel Cappas set jury selection to begin the week of February 12, 2018, with the actual jury trial beginning around March 12, 2018. In October 2017, Lake Superior Court Judge Samuel Cappas delayed the trial date, with jury selection being scheduled to begin September 17, 2018, and the trial beginning October 22, 2018.|$|E

Instead, they chose [...] "to turn our biggest card up - [...] "What if Dexter's bodies were discovered?" [...] - and just chart that course throughout the season."

[...] Speaking about Dexter's situation {{at the beginning of the}} second season, Hall said, [...] "I think his world is pretty rocked. He encountered , a person he never anticipated encountering, someone who sees him for who he is, accepts him as such, and he really has no choice but to do him in ... he's still reeling from that, and any footing he's able to establish for himself is pretty much immediately pulled out from under him." ...|$|E
