40|$|Jakarta Bay and its {{neighbouring}} {{waters of}} Seribu Islands are categorized as fullly exploited water areas which theirs coastal areas accomodate multifunction services. Therefore, it needs precautionary approach to manage fisheries activity in that locations. The objectives {{of this study}} are to determine optimum allocation of fishing gears and fisheries development areas based on potential fishing gears in Jakarta Bay. The methods used in this study are Linear Goal Programming (LGP) and Locations Quotient (LQ). The result revealed that the potential fishing gears to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>were</b> pelagic danish seine, drift gillnet, boat lift net, set bottom long line, portable trap and muroami which have the optimum allocation for each fishing gear; 7 units, 98 units, 23 units, 18 units, 8547 units, and 798 units. The potential fishing gears for pelagic danish seine could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan and North Seribu Island Districts; drift gillnet could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Cilincing District; boat lift net could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan District; set bottom long line could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan District; portable trap could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Cilincing and South Seribu Island Districts while muroami could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan and South Seribu Island Districts...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} from the war, the new ports of Fulton and Rockport <b>were</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> the later 1860s. At first, Rockport was intended as a deep-water port, but after a series of mishaps, Aransas Pass was selected when deepening was approved in 1879. By 1912, a 100 feet wide and 8½ feet deep channel was operational. After hurricanes ransacked the port in 1916 and 1919, the United States Army Corps of Engineers chose Corpus Christi as the preferred deepwater port for the lower Gulf coast.|$|E
5|$|Because silver was {{extensively}} used as {{a decorative}} material and an exchange medium, lead deposits came to be worked in Asia Minor since 3000BCE; later, lead deposits <b>were</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> the Aegean and Laurion. These three regions collectively dominated production of mined lead until c. 1200BCE. Since 2000BCE, the Phoenicians worked deposits in the Iberian peninsula; by 1600BCE, lead mining existed in Cyprus, Greece, and Sardinia.|$|E
5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel <b>were</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part of the culture of the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals.|$|E

5|$|Danvers carrots. These {{have strong}} foliage and the roots are longer than Chantaney types, {{and they have}} a conical shape with a {{well-defined}} shoulder, tapering to a point. They are somewhat shorter than Imperator cultivars, but more tolerant of heavy soil conditions. Danvers cultivars store well and are used both fresh and for processing.

An extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world, consisted of small divisions separated by dry-stone walls. The fields were farmed for several centuries between 3500 BC and 3000 BC. Wheat and barley were the principal crops.|$|E

5|$|Lettuce {{appears in}} many medieval writings, {{especially}} as a medicinal herb. Hildegard of Bingen mentioned {{it in her}} writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179, and many early herbals also describe its uses. In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces– head lettuce, loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine (or cos) lettuce. Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century. Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century, many varieties <b>were</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Europe, particularly Holland. Books published in the mid-18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today.|$|E
