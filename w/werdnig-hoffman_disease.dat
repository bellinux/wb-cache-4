40|$|During an {{epidemic}} of respiratory syncytial (R. S.) virus in Newcastle upon Tyne 13 children developed R. S. virus infections while in hospital with other conditions. R. S. virus infection was also noted in {{four members of the}} staff. In two of the hospital wards outbreaks developed. All children infected with R. S. virus developed symptoms. The symptoms varied with age; two children aged 2 months or less developed colds, as did five children over 1 year of age. One child of 15 months with <b>Werdnig-Hoffman</b> <b>disease,</b> though suffering from a cold, later developed pulmonary collapse. All five children aged 3 to 8 months developed bronchiolitis. The effectiveness of special nursing in cubicles was probably diminished because adults with mild colds were excreting virus. The dangers of R. S. virus infection to other children in the ward, especially those with congenital heart disease, is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|Werdnig-Hoffmann Disease: Report of {{the first}} case {{clinically}} identified and genetically confirmed in Central Africa (Kinshasa-Congo) : Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA 1) or <b>Werdnig-Hoffman</b> <b>disease</b> is rarely described in black populations. We report on one black patient diagnosed in Kinshasa. This patient was referred to Paediatric consultation {{at the age of}} 5 months 1 / 2 with extreme hypotonia progressing since birth, severe muscular weakness in his trunk and proximal parts of the extremities, ASD type II, and repeated episodes of pulmonary infections. He died of severe respiratory failure at the age of 10 months. EMG analysis revealed motor neuron a defect without nerve conduction anomaly, suggesting the diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy disease. The diagnosis of SMA 1 was definitely confirmed by a quantitative PCR-based testing that demonstrated homozygous deletion of SMN 1, the primary disease-causing gene for spinal muscular atrophy, while two normal SMN 2 alleles were present. There was a history of similar clinical symptomatology in a patient's older brother, suggesting a familial involvement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented Werdnig-Hoffman case ever reported from Central Africa people. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) is characterised by {{degeneration}} of anterior horn {{cells of the}} spinal cord and represents the second most common, lethal, autosomal recessive disorder after cystic fibrosis. Based on the criteria of the Internatinal SMA Consortium, childhood SMAs are classified into type I (Werdnig-Hoffmann disease), type II (intermediate form), and type III (Kugelberg-Welander disease). Recently, two genes {{have been found to}} be associated with SMA. The survival motor neurone gene (SMN) is an SMA determining gene as it is absent in 98. 6 % of patients. A second gene, XS 2 G 3, or the highly homologous neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein gene (NAIP) {{have been found to be}} more frequently deleted in type I than in the milder forms (types II and III). We investigated the correlation between the clinical phenotype and the genotype at this loci. A total of 106 patients were classified into type I (44), type II (31), and type III (31) and analysed using SMN, markers C 212 and C 272, and NAIP mapping upstream and downstream from SMN respectively. The combined analysis of all markers showed a large proportion of type I patients (43 %) carried deletions of both SMN and its flanking markers (C 212 / 272) and NAIP exon 5), as compared with none of the patients with type II or III SMA. The presence of large scale deletions involving these loci is specific to <b>Werdnig-Hoffman</b> <b>disease</b> (type I) and allows one to predict the severity of the disease in our series...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{reports by}} a number of authors have {{suggested}} that electroencephalographic (E. E. G.) abnormalities are often found in patients with pro-gressive muscular dystrophy. Winfield, Britt, and Raskind (1958) reported the finding of nine abnormal records in 12 children with muscular dystrophy sub-jected to E. E. G. study. The abnormalities consisted of the pattern designated by Gibbs and Gibbs (1952) as 14 and 6 per second positive spikes. Wayne and Browne-Mayers (1959), in a study of 57 dystrophic patients of whom 21 were adults and 36 were children, found a total incidence of definite abnormality in 17 cases. The changes consisted of generalized abnormalities of various kinds and there was no correlation between the severity of the E. E. G. abnormalities and the clinical severity of the dys-trophy. Ascione, Matano, and Serra (1959) found E. E. G. changes in five boys with muscular dystrophy, all in the same sib-ship. Thechanges consisted ofgeneral-ized abnormalities which developed during photic stimulation and hyperventilation. Perlstein, Gibbs, Gibbs, and Stein (1960) reported a large series of examinations on patients suffering from what the authors referred to as various forms of myopathy. Unfortunately, not all of their 101 patients were in fact cases of muscular dystrophy. Included in this series were 22 cases of amyotonia congenita; this is a clinical diagnosis, the syndrome commonly embracing primary neuropathic dis-orders such as infantile spinal musuclar atrophy (<b>Werdnig-Hoffman</b> <b>disease),</b> as well as various myopathic disorders. A further nine patients are reported to have had 'probable myopathies ' but no further details are given. Of the 70 remaining patients, eight were suffering from facioscapulohumeral dystrophy and 62 were children with pseudohyper-trophic dystrophy. In these two groups the incidence of abnormalities in the E. E. G. was 45 % (28 patients) in the children and 37 % (three patients) in the group with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy. The most commonly observed abnormalities were 14 and 6 per second positive spikes and these were seen particularly in the children...|$|E
