50|$|It is also {{mentioned}} that once {{when the people}} were not knowledgeable regarding the Yantra, the white rock where the Suyambu Linga appeared in nature was tried to be removed to build a Vinayagar Temple nearby. In spite of seven explosions by Subramaniam, an experienced man in blasting rocks, the rock was safe without any damage.

50|$|Offerings such as sandal paste, garland {{of cotton}} beads, saffron paste, ittar {perfume}, turmeric, kumkum, abir, and gulal {{are made to}} the Goddess. Flowers, such as {{marigold}} flowers, and leaves of Bael (<b>wood</b> <b>apple</b> <b>tree)</b> are also offered. An incense stick is lit and dhoop is performed. An offering of sweets, coconut, fruits, and tambul is made later. Puffed rice and batasha (varieties of Indian sweets) are placed near the idol. Puffed rice, batasha, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds are poured over the idol. Swastika are made on the safe in which the worshiper keeps their valuables and it is worshiped {{as a symbol of}} Lord Kubera.|$|E

50|$|This {{temple was}} {{discovered}} and named Ubayakathirgamam by Lady T.S.Logambal devotee of Muruga, who hails from Tirunelveli, {{a city in}} Tamil Nadu. The Lady Logambal publication mentions that in the year 1909, God Muruga appeared in a dream to Lady Logambal and informed {{the existence of the}} Chakkara Yantra on the surface of a rock by the side of a <b>wood</b> <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> at Pachchima Pulavar Kana Nagaram. He told her to draw a picture of the yantra and keep it with her for her daily prayers. It was impossible for her to locate the village which was in Sri Lanka (then named as Ceylon), as she is an Indian.|$|E
5000|$|Ubayakathirgamam Moolavar is a Chakkara Yantra, which {{appeared}} on a white rock itself. As unlike in other temples of Muruga, the Moola Linga {{is in the form}} of a Chakkara Yantra, hence the temple got its name [...] "Ubayakathirgamam Sri Chakkara Shanmugar Alayam". The noticeable feature of this Chakkara Yantra is it was not made by hand of man. It is a Suyambu Linga, the Holy one revealing himself in nature on the white rock. There are a few projections and letters representing God Vinayagar and the Shakties of Siva, to the right of the yantra. The <b>Wood</b> <b>apple</b> <b>tree,</b> which is also said to have divine power as the Thala Viruksha of the temple, is named as Vilatheeswaran.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{prevention}} and treatment of drug-resistant malaria is becoming increasingly difficult. On the Thai-Myanmar border multi-drug resistant strains of falciparum malaria are increasing and, because the malaria vector Anopheles bite outdoors during early evening, insecticide house-spraying or impregnated bednets provide only limited protection. Therefore, the protective efficacy of repellent formulations containing di-methyl bensamide (deet) and permethrin against local vectors was estimated, when applied to the skin, and their acceptability amongst pregnant Karen women who are at relatively high risk from malaria was assessed. Human landing catches of mosquitoes showed that almost complete protection was achieved using different formulations of 20 % deet and 0. 5 % permethrin for up to 6 h. All-night collections from human subjects indicated that this repellent combination reduced exposure to malaria parasites by at least 65 and 85 % for those transmitted by Anopheles minimus and An. maculatus, respectively, the two principal vectors in this area. Pregnant women in the camps preferred repellents which were mixed with ‘thanaka’, a root paste made from pulp of the <b>wood</b> <b>apple</b> <b>tree,</b> Limonia acidissima, used locally as a cosmetic. Apart from a temporary warming sensation where repellent thanaka {{was applied to the}} skin, the repellents were well tolerated...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this methodology is to provide to farmers, agricultural consultants, manufacturers of shaped solid biofuels, operators of boilers using biofuels, workers in research and agricultural education, and to all others interested persons in growing and processing agricultural biomass as a renewable source of raw materials and energy, the basic information about the energetic use of <b>wood</b> from <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> pruning and some other fruit woods. Applying of this methodology in practice can provide environmentally acceptable and economically effective use of such wood waste. At the introduction, this work provides a basic overview of literary information on relevant issues.

40|$|Characteristics of {{briquettes}} {{made from}} various biomass resources (staghorn sumac <b>wood,</b> vineyard and <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> pruning biomass, pine cones, corn stalk and corn cobs) were investigated {{in the present}} paper. The moisture content of raw materials was first determined, before compacting them in a hydraulic briquetting machine. Briquettes with diameter of 40 mm and various lengths were obtained. Five replicates of each briquette type were selected for the determination of density, compression strength and calorific value. The results were compared to those of beech and pine briquettes obtained under similar conditions. Based on the experimental results, mathematical correlations between density and compression strength and density and calorific value were investigated...|$|R

This treatment would therefore also provide some personal protection against dengue, which is increasing locally, transmitted by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus biting during the daytime...|$|E

40|$|The powdery {{nature and}} high alkali content of {{vegetable}} ashes make them ideal raw materials {{to be used}} as modifiers of silicate compositions (glasses, enamels and ceramics). Their utilisation since ancient times is described in the literature of the history of glasses, but studies on the analyses of their composition are still limited. We discuss here the compositions of tree and shrub ashes (wattle, hawthorn, oak, green oak, olive <b>wood,</b> elm, poplar, <b>apple</b> <b>tree,</b> vine shoot), of plants (carex, fern, dogwood), of cereals (wheat, maize, rice), threshing waste and hay, mainly harvested in Maconnais, near Taizé (Saône-et-Loire, France), by the potter Brother D. de Montmolin. The contributions in alkali modifiers (Na 2 O, K 2 O), alkaline-earth (CaO, MgO) and in silica are discussed in view of the data gathered from the literature of the history of techniques used in the production of ceramics, enamels and glasses. The huge variation in composition is usually attributed to recycling and is questioned by the very broad range of compositions that we obtained in the analyses of the ashes...|$|R
40|$|Biochar {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as an efficient tool for carbon sequestration and soil fertility. The understanding of its chemical and physical properties, which are strongly related {{to the type of}} the initial material used and pyrolysis conditions, is crucial to identify the most suitable application of biochar in soil. A selection of organic wastes with different characteristics (e. g., rice husk (RH), rice straw (RS), <b>wood</b> chips of <b>apple</b> <b>tree</b> (Malus pumila) (AB), and oak tree (Quercus serrata) (OB)) were pyrolyzed at different temperatures (400, 500, 600, 700, and 800 °C) in order to optimize the physicochemical properties of biochar as a soil amendment. Low-temperature pyrolysis produced high biochar yields; in contrast, high-temperature pyrolysis led to biochars with a high C content, large surface area, and high adsorption characteristics. Biochar obtained at 600 °C leads to a high recalcitrant character, whereas that obtained at 400 °C retains volatile and easily labile compounds. The biochar obtained from rice materials (RH and RS) showed a high yield and unique chemical properties because of the incorporation of silica elements into its chemical structure. The biochar obtained from wood materials (AB and OB) showed high carbon content and a high absorption character...|$|R
