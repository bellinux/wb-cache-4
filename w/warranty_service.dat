40|$|Purpose: In this paper, {{the minimal}} repair-replacement {{warranty}} policy {{is used to}} carry out a warranty cost analysis with <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> times and failure times that are statistically correlated to bivariate distributions. Methods: Based on the developed approach by Park and Pham (2012 a), we investigate the property of the Freund’s bivariate exponential distribution and obtain the number of <b>warranty</b> <b>services</b> using the field data to conduct the warranty cost analysis. Results: Maximum likelihood estimates are presented to estimate the parameters and the warranty model is investigated using a Freund’s bivariate exponential distribution. A numerical example is discussed to deal with the applicability of the developed approach in the paper. Conclusion: A novel approach of analyzing the warranty cost is proposed for a product in which failure times and <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> times are used simultaneously to investigate the eligibility of a warranty claim...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe cost of <b>servicing</b> a <b>warranty</b> depends, amongst other factors, on {{the type}} of repair {{performed}} under warranty. Although “all minimal repair” and “all replacement” policies are easy to implement and analyze, they are not always feasible and/or practical. Having a combination of different types of repair often leads to lower <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> costs. In this article, to reduce the <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> cost, we study a servicing strategy that involves performing imperfect repairs in place of some of the minimal repairs of an “all minimal repair” strategy; the effect of an imperfect repair is characterized by a drop in the conditional intensity function of the failure process. We consider both fixed and random degrees of repair. For a given type of product, we partition the warranty region so that the expected total <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> cost is minimized. We provide a numerical illustration and a comparison with previously-studied repair–replacement strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{expected}} <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> cost {{is critically}} {{dependent on the}} reliability of the product. One way of improving product reliability is through redundancy but this is achieved at the expense of increased manufacturing cost. Redundancy is worthwhile if the reduction in expected <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> cost exceeds the increase in the manufacturing cost. This paper examines optimal strategies with quality uncertainty where nonconforming items have inferior performance characteristics relative to conforming ones. It also examines the effect of life testing on the optimal strategies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We herein {{propose a}} repair-replace {{strategy}} {{to minimize the}} expected <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> costs for manufacturers when the items sold with a free repair-replacement warranty policy. Manufacturers usually rectify a failure either by repairing the failed item or by {{replacing it with a}} new one when a repairable product fails under warranty. In addition, the rectification action influences the repair and <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> cost. Except for the time or age, the usage intensity is often another essential factor that accounts for the failure of the product, which varies the population of users. Our strategy classified the usage population into several groups and provided different repair actions for various groups...|$|R
40|$|For {{repairable}} items, {{the manufacturer}} has {{the option to}} either repair or replace a failed item that is returned under warranty. In this paper, we look at a new <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> strategy for items sold with two-dimensional warranty where the failed item {{is replaced by a}} new one when it fails {{for the first time in}} a specified region of the warranty and all other failures are repaired minimally. The region is characterised by two parameters and we derive the optimal values for these to minimise the total expected <b>warranty</b> <b>servicing</b> cost. We compare the results with other repair-replace strategies reported in the literature. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
