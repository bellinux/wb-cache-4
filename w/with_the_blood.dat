During the fighting, Æthelfrith and Rædwald's son Rægenhere were both slain. Edwin then succeeded Æthelfrith as the king of Northumbria, and Æthelfrith's sons were subsequently forced into exile.|$|E
5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors {{of male and female}} gametes. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are injected into the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.|$|E

Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario’s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> of Ray. Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard.

40|$|Although several {{reports have}} shown that two to three 20 -ml blood {{cultures}} are adequate {{for the detection of}} bacteremia and fungemia in adults, a recent study (F. R. Cockerill et al., Clin. Infect. Dis. 38 : 1724 - 1730, 2004) found that two blood cultures detected only 80 % of bloodstream infections and that three blood cultures detected 96 % of episodes. We reviewed data at two university hospitals to determine whether the recent observations by Cockerill et al. are applicable more widely. We assessed all blood cultures obtained from adult inpatients from 1 January 2004 through 31 December 2005 at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Duke University Medical Center. All instances in which ≥ 3 blood cultures per patient were obtained during a 24 -h period were included. The medical records of patients who met the inclusion criteria were reviewed retrospectively to determine the clinical significance of <b>the</b> positive <b>blood</b> culture (true infection versus contamination). Data were analyzed to determine the cumulative sensitivity of blood cultures obtained sequentially during the 24 -h time period. Of 629 unimicrobial episodes with ≥ 3 blood cultures obtained during the 24 -h period, 460 (73. 1 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first <b>blood</b> culture, 564 (89. 7 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first two <b>blood</b> cultures, 618 (98. 2 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first three <b>blood</b> cultures, and 628 (99. 8 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first four <b>blood</b> cultures. Of 351 unimicrobial episodes with ≥ 4 blood cultures obtained during the 24 -h period, 257 (73. 2 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first <b>blood</b> culture, 308 (93. 9 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first two <b>blood</b> cultures, 340 (96. 9 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first three <b>blood</b> cultures, and 350 (99. 7 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first four <b>blood</b> cultures. Among unimicrobial episodes, Staphylococcus aureus was more likely to be detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first <b>blood</b> culture (approximately 90 % detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first <b>blood</b> culture). There were 58 polymicrobial episodes in which ≥ 3 blood cultures were obtained. Forty-seven (81. 0 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first <b>blood</b> culture, 54 (93. 1 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first two <b>blood</b> cultures, and 58 (100 %) were detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first three <b>blood</b> cultures. <b>The</b> results {{of this study indicate that}} two blood cultures in a 24 -h period will detect approximately 90 % of bloodstream infections in adults. To achieve a detection rate of > 99 %, as many as four blood cultures may be needed. The previously held axiom that virtually all bloodstream infections can be detected with two to three blood cultures may no longer be valid but may also depend on the definition of <b>the</b> “first” <b>blood</b> culture obtained (see Materials and Methods and Discussion in the text) ...|$|R
50|$|Nitrates are {{of concern}} because it interferes <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood's</b> {{ability to carry}} oxygen, and can have severe health effects on {{pregnant}} women, infants under 6 months, and children using tap water for their formula.

5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile in contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and {{gives rise to the}} systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E

When the eggs hatch, several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflict erupts between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Celtic and Chopper are killed by an Alien, and Weyland buys Alexa and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bova) enough time to escape from Scar, giving his life in the process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and an Alien with a shuriken before unmasking and marking himself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> of the facehugger.
