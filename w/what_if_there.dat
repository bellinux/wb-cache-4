Talent agent Leslie Grade had since approached Anderson {{with a proposal}} for a film starring actor Arthur Haynes, but discussions between Grade and Anderson had not produced a commission. In the summer of 1967, during the production of Anderson's Supermarionation television series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Universal Pictures executive Jay Kanter arrived in London from the United States. Planning to establish a European production office, Kanter expressed his willingness to provide funding for promising film ideas. Lew Grade, brother to Leslie and Anderson's financier at his TV distributor ITC Entertainment, arranged a meeting with Kanter for Anderson to pitch a story concept concerning the hypothesis of a [...] "replicated" [...] or [...] "mirror" [...] Earth.

That idea then developed into the planet being a replicated Earth and that's how it ended up, a mirrored planet...
