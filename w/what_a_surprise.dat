50|$|<b>What</b> was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{for some}} of the {{population}} may have been obvious for another part (such as the total deaths accumulated in a military activity).|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{it was to}} everybody. It wasn't one {{of those}} cases where half the school suspects what's going on. Those cases always come out sooner or later. But Patterson nobody knew about." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{glad you}} like it, Mrs. Macallister," [...] said Mr. Willett, with the clumsiness of American middle-age when summoned to say {{something}} gallant. [...] "If I'd told you <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> I had for you, it wouldn't have been one." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well,' said he, 'here we are, {{arrived at}} the fag-end of my holiday. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} <b>surprise</b> my old home, which I have not thought worth coming to see {{for three or four}} years, had in store for me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good gracious me!' cried Tom, patting him tenderly on the back. 'How {{delightful}} {{it is to}} {{hear his}} old voice again! My dear Martin, sit down. My sister, Martin. Mr Chuzzlewit, my love. Mark Tapley from the Dragon, my dear. Good gracious me, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> this is! Sit down. Lord, bless me!' ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, I {{leave it to}} any {{considering}} man to judge, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> it must be to me to meet with all the public clamour that informers could invent, as being guilty of writing against the Hanover succession, and as having written several pamphlets in favour of the pretender.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom, let the door-knob alone,--there's a man! Mary! Mary! don't {{pull the}} cat's tail,--poor pussy! Jim, you mustn't climb on that table,--no, no!--You don't know, my dear, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{it is to}} us all, to see you here tonight!"

50|$|Pérez {{made his}} Sunderland debut, aged 29 on 19 October 1996, as a {{substitute}} for Tony Coton, in a 3-0 away defeat against Southampton. He stayed with Sunderland for a further two years, before signing for rivals Newcastle United, in <b>what</b> was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> move at the time.|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>a</b> {{bright and}} startling {{spectacle}} {{one of those}} blazing white country palaces, with its brown-tinted window-caps and ledges, and green shutters, and its wealth of caressing flowers and foliage, would be in black London! And <b>what</b> <b>a</b> gleaming <b>surprise</b> {{it would be in}} nearly any American city one could mention, too! ...|$|R
50|$|As usual, the Tour {{started with}} a prologue, a short {{individual}} time trial, this time one of 7 km in Luxembourg. Armstrong won, which was not <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> since he {{is known as a}} very good time trialist. <b>What</b> was <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> was the second place of Frenchman Laurent Jalabert. Of the favourites, Moreau had a disappointing race, ending only 40th, 24 seconds behind Armstrong.|$|R
6000|$|The {{ruler of}} these people was combing his eyebrows when our friends entered the throne room and stood before him, but he put the comb {{in his pocket and}} {{examined}} the strangers with evident curiosity. Then he said, [...] "Dear me, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise!</b> You have really shocked me. For no outsider has ever before come to our City of Herku, and I cannot imagine why you have ventured to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{got over}} the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs, for I was very weary, and fell asleep: but judge you if you can, that read my story, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> I must be in when I was awaked out of my sleep by a voice calling me by my name several times, [...] "Robin, Robin, Robin Crusoe, poor Robin Crusoe! Where are you, Robin Crusoe? Where are you? Where have you been?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have not}} time {{here to take}} notice <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> it was to me to see my child; how it worked upon my affections; with what {{infinite}} struggle I mastered a strong inclination that I had to discover myself to her; how the girl was the very counterpart of myself, only much handsomer; and how sweetly and modestly she behaved; how, on that occasion, I resolved to do more for her than I had appointed by Amy, and the like.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Clarkson groaned. [...] "And {{her sister}} is hinting that she can't {{leave the house}} where she spent so many happy years," [...] he said, [...] "and says <b>what</b> <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} <b>surprise</b> {{it would be for}} Mrs. Phipps if she was to come home and find it done up." ...|$|R
5000|$|In <b>what</b> was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to {{the court}} room, Shamapande's defense didn't call a single witness.

The prosecution wasn't even close to meeting its burden, so I felt no need to call any witnesses." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Glen {{seemed to}} specialise in songs about unfashionable American Towns”, recalls Kruger. “So {{it was no}} {{surprise}} that his next 45, and Ember’s first release of 1969, was called ‘Wichita Lineman’. <b>What</b> was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> was that this time we hit the jackpot. The record was unstoppable, hitting the Top Ten and sparking off a string of hit singles and LP’s for Glen.|$|R
60|$|During {{the last}} day of the trip, Hendon's spirits were soaring. His tongue ran constantly. He talked about his old father, and his brother Arthur, and told of many things which {{illustrated}} their high and generous characters; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith, and was so glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and brotherly things about Hugh. He dwelt a deal on the coming meeting at Hendon Hall; <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> it would be to everybody, and what an outburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be.|$|E
60|$|When, {{after several}} hours, all his {{attempts}} had failed, poor Little Tim groaned in spirit, {{and began to}} regret his having undertaken the job; but {{a sense of the}} humorous, even in that extremity, caused him to give vent to a short laugh as he observed that Bruin had managed to get several feet of the indigestible rope down his throat, and fancied <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> it would give him if he were to get hold of {{the other end of the}} rope and pull it all out again.|$|E
60|$|There {{was great}} {{scrubbing}} and dusting among the matrons as they set their houses {{in order not}} only for Class Day, but to receive the bride and groom, who were to come to them for the honeymoon trip. Great plans were made, gifts prepared, and much joy felt {{at the prospect of}} seeing Franz again; though Emil, who was to accompany them, would be the greater hero. Little did the dear souls dream <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> was in store for them, as they innocently laid their plans and wished all the boys could be there to welcome home their eldest and their Casablanca.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{admit that}} I {{have ever been}} bored, Miss Van Teyl," [...] Molly Holderness assured her, [...] "but Dick has {{certainly}} told me all sorts of wonderful things about you--how kind you were in New York, and <b>what</b> <b>a</b> delightful <b>surprise</b> it was to see you down at the hospital at Nice. I am afraid {{he must have been}} a terrible crock then." ...|$|R
50|$|Abdel-Safhy {{was called}} to join the Egypt {{national}} football team on 31 December 2009. In <b>what</b> was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to some, the Egyptian team coach, Hassan Shehata, listed Abdel-Shafy among the players heading to Angola for the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. Abdel-Shafy became a substitute for Sayed Moawad in this tournament, and managed to participate in 5 matches. He grabbed his first goal for Egypt in the 4-0 semi-final win against Algeria.|$|R
5000|$|Our {{movies and}} {{television}} programs in the fifties were full {{of the idea of}} going into space. <b>What</b> came as <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> was that it was the Soviet Union that launched the first satellite. It is hard to recall the atmosphere of the time. John Logsdon ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'It {{was in this}} way. We {{had gone}} on the May Day for a round voyage of seven days, but a {{hogshead}} got loose and started one of our plates, so {{that we had to}} put back into port for twelve hours. I left the ship and came home, thinking <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> it would be for my wife, and hoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon. The thought was in my head as I turned into my own street, and at that moment a cab passed me, and there she was, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two chatting and laughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching them from the footpath.|$|E
60|$|His enthusiasm warmed Lucy's interest, yet it {{made her}} thoughtful. Ideas flashed into her mind. If the rider {{attended}} the races he would have that fleet stallion with him. He could {{not be separated from}} the horse that had cost him so dearly. What would Bostil and Holley and Farlane say at sight of Wildfire? Suppose Wildfire was to enter the races! It was probable that he could run away from the whole field--even beat the King. Lucy thrilled and thrilled. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> it would be! She had the rider's true love of seeing the unheralded horse win over the favorite. She had for years wanted to see a horse--and ride a horse--out in front of Sage King. Then suddenly all these flashing ideas coruscated seemingly into a gleam--a leaping, radiant, wonderful thought. Irresistibly it burst from her.|$|E
60|$|But <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{will it be}} to {{them that}} now have come to God by Christ to see {{themselves}} in heaven indeed, saved indeed, and possessed of everlasting life indeed. For alas! what is faith to possession? Faith that is mixed with many fears, that is opposed with many assaults, and that seems sometimes to be quite extinguished; I say, what is that to a seeing of myself in heaven? Hence it is said, that he shall then come to be admired in them that now believe, because they did here believe the testimony; then they shall admire that it was their lot to believe {{when they were in}} the world. (2 Thess 1:10) They shall also admire to think, to see, and behold, what believing has brought them to, while the rest, for refusing to come to God by Christ, drink their tears mixed with burning brimstone.|$|E
60|$|Scarce had he {{advanced}} {{toward the}} wood {{when all the}} great trees, the bushes, and brambles gave way of themselves to let him pass through; {{he walked up to}} the castle which he saw {{at the end of a}} large avenue which he went into; and <b>what</b> <b>a</b> little <b>surprised</b> him was that he saw none of his people could follow him, because the trees closed again as soon as he had passed through them. However, he did not cease from continuing his way; a young and amorous prince is always valiant.|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{resignation}} of Hosni Mubarak, a number of NDP officials and members resigned following the filing {{of a number of}} lawsuits calling for the party's dissolution. On 12 April, in <b>what</b> was considered <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> move, Talaat Sadat, nephew of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who was not a party member and who had been long considered an opposition member, was selected as the new party chairman.|$|R
50|$|<b>What</b> was <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{was that}} the amount of energy needed to move a given vehicle could be lower than steel wheeled vehicles, at least at high speeds. Over 140 mph, {{conventional}} trains suffered from a problem known as hunting oscillation that forces the flanges {{on the sides of the}} wheels to hit the rail with increasing frequency, dramatically increasing rolling resistance. Although the energy needed to keep a hovercraft in motion also increased with speed, this increase was slower than the sudden (and sometimes catastrophic) increase due to hunting. That implied that for travel above some critical speed, a hovercraft could be more efficient than a wheeled vehicle running on the same route.|$|R
