[...] Though the musical {{received}} favorable reviews, “an unforgettable character and some of the best and most memorable songs you are likely to hear for years to come,” stated Chicago’s Outlines, and “His raspy voice evoking Joe Cocker and his down-home songs recalling John Prine, Kamys offers a true-blue slice of Americana,” declared Chicago Reader theater critic Lawrence Bommer, low attendance and high production costs would close the show in six weeks. [...] However, his exploration of the Alt-Country/Americana sound and some of the songs from Future City Homosexual Tells All, would inform and inspire his second solo effort Guns (2001) and the single There Just <b>Wont</b> <b>Be</b> a Christmas This Year (2001) recorded by vocalist and actress Catherine Smitko.|$|E
2500|$|Rock Band 3 {{introduces}} [...] "Pro Mode" [...] to the Rock Band franchise {{for both}} guitar and bass players, where players finger specific strings and frets instead of colored buttons in Easy to Medium mode, while on Expert mode players {{are required to}} play the actual guitar chords and solos, note for note. [...] Two completely new guitar controllers were developed for use in this mode - both of them legitimate MIDI guitars. The first one MadCatz created {{was based on the}} bass version of the Fender Mustang, featuring 105 buttons each representing every spot possible on the neck up to 17 frets, and a [...] "string box" [...] where the player strums strings, it was made of plastic and can be a step up from the legacy five lane controllers. [...] The second takes an authentic, actual Squier Stratocaster guitar by Fender, the complete guitar with strings and up to the standard 22 frets, added a [...] "string box" [...] near the strumming area for hit detection, and rebuilt the neck to have a fret-sensing feature in order to tell the game where the player's fingers are on the fret board. [...] There is also a [...] "mute bar" [...] built into the guitar which can be raised or lowered; in the raised position the strings of the guitar are softly muted so as to not ring out. [...] This mute bar is what allows the string box to detect and translate individual string hits for the game. [...] In the lowered position, the guitar strings <b>wont</b> <b>be</b> muted and therefore lets the strings ring out for normal guitar playing outside of the Rock Band game. [...] Tuning this specialized guitar is not necessary for playing Rock Band, as for the game the guitar functions in MIDI mode and the guitar's sound comes from sound files of the actual guitar playing in the songs painstakingly designed from audio master stems of each song for the game. [...] Both of these officially made MIDI guitars utilize Pro Mode, allowing for accurate fingering while playing with the added effect of learning how to play the song for real on guitar, either alone or with friends playing the song with you on any other instrument or controller, even online. [...] Of the two Pro guitars, only the MadCatz Mustang model - with 105 buttons - was capable of playing [...] "legacy" [...] (5-lane) guitar or bass charts. The Mustang was the first available unit, with the Squier becoming available in March 2011.|$|E
