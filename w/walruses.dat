5|$|The {{isolated}} {{population of}} Laptev <b>walruses</b> is confined year-round {{to the central}} and western regions of the Laptev Sea, the eastmost regions of the Kara Sea, and the westmost regions of the East Siberian Sea. The current population of these <b>walruses</b> has been estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000.|$|E
5|$|The walrus {{has played}} a {{prominent}} role in the cultures of many indigenous Arctic peoples, who have hunted the walrus for its meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. During the 19th century and the early 20th century, <b>walruses</b> were widely hunted and killed for their blubber, walrus ivory, and meat. The population of <b>walruses</b> dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region. Their population has rebounded somewhat since then, though the populations of Atlantic and Laptev <b>walruses</b> remain fragmented and at low levels compared with the time before human interference.|$|E
5|$|The limited diving {{abilities}} of <b>walruses</b> brings them {{to depend on}} shallow waters (and the nearby ice floes) for reaching their food supply.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Walrus</b> or Pacific <b>walrus</b> Odobenus rosmarus divergens (asveq sg asverek ~ asevrek dual asveret ~ asevret pl in Yup'ik kaugpak in Cup'ik, kaugpag in Cup'ig). Hunting of <b>walrus</b> {{and other}} marine mammals in western Bristol Bay, {{including}} Round Island (Yup'ik Qayaciq literally [...] "place {{to go in}} a kayak") as part of the <b>Walrus</b> Islands State Game Sanctuary, by the native people (Yupâ€™ik-speaking Tuyuryarmiut) of the Togiak area over the last 2,500 years is documented by archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence. Until the late 1930s and early 1940s, well-organized groups of hunters from Togiak traveled in kayaks to Round Island (the most reliable hunting location) and other islands armed with spears and harpoons to harvest <b>walrus.</b> Most parts of the <b>walrus</b> were used for food, raw materials, and sharing with inland villages. Another use of <b>walrus</b> which began in the early 19th century and has continued is the taking of <b>walrus</b> for their ivory for trade and sale. <b>Walrus</b> hunting was an important activity in Nushagak Bay and surrounding area during the Russian period. In addition to hunting for food, <b>walrus</b> ivory was traded at the Russian America company post, Alexandrovski, on Nushagak Bay. <b>Walrus</b> were hunted off Hagemeister Island, among other places. The Russian-era trade in <b>walrus</b> ivory peaked from 1821-1842. The Aglegmiut Eskimos of Bristol Bay were known for their skill as ivory carvers.|$|R
5|$|The rest of {{the year}} (late summer and fall), <b>walruses</b> tend to form massive aggregations of tens of {{thousands}} of individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between the ice and the beach can be long-distance and dramatic. In late spring and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific <b>walruses</b> migrate from the Bering Sea into the Chukchi Sea through the relatively narrow Bering Strait.|$|E
5|$|Odobenidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the modern walrus. This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, <b>walruses</b> are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks external ear flaps. <b>Walruses</b> have pterygoid bones that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are V-shaped at the anterior end and calcaneuses with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} Odobenus {{comes from}} odous (Greek for 'tooth') and baino (Greek for 'walk'), based on observations of <b>walruses</b> using their tusks to pull {{themselves out of}} the water. The term divergens in Latin means 'turning apart', referring to their tusks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Walrus</b> tusk ivory {{comes from}} two {{modified}} upper canines. It {{is also known}} as morse. The tusks of a Pacific <b>walrus</b> may attain a length of one meter. <b>Walrus</b> teeth are also commercially carved and traded. The average <b>walrus</b> tooth has a rounded, irregular peg shape and is approximately 5 cm in length.|$|R

5|$|The {{majority}} {{of the population of the}} Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of Alaska south to Unimak Island, and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula, and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west of the Alaska Peninsula. In the spring and fall, <b>walruses</b> congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in the Bering Sea along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and along the southern coast of Alaska. A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of San Francisco Bay, indicating Pacific <b>walruses</b> ranged that far south during the last ice age. There were roughly 200,000 Pacific <b>walruses</b> according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{pinnipeds}} are widespread, {{most species}} prefer the colder {{waters of the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They {{spend most of their}} lives in the water, but come ashore to mate, give birth, molt or escape from predators, like sharks and killer whales. They feed largely on fish and marine invertebrates; but a few, like the leopard seal, feed on large vertebrates, such as penguins and other seals. <b>Walruses</b> are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling mollusks. Male pinnipeds typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), although the degree of polygyny varies with the species. The males of land-breeding species tend to mate with a greater number of females than those of ice- or water-breeding species. Male pinniped strategies for reproductive success vary between defending females, defending territories that attract females and performing ritual displays or lek mating. Pups are typically born {{in the spring and summer}} months and females bear almost all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively short period of time while others take foraging trips at sea between nursing bouts. <b>Walruses</b> are known to nurse their young while at sea. Seals produce a number of vocalizations, notably the barks of California sea lions, the gong-like calls of <b>walruses</b> and the complex songs of Weddell seals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to humans, three primarily terrestrial mammalian species inhabit the archipelago: the Arctic fox, the Svalbard reindeer, and accidentally introduced southern voles, which are {{found only in}} Grumant. Attempts to introduce the Arctic hare and the muskox have both failed. There are fifteen to twenty types of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, <b>walruses,</b> and polar bears.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>walrus</b> {{refers to}} Lewis Carroll's poem [...] "The <b>Walrus</b> and the Carpenter" [...] (from the book Through the Looking-Glass). Lennon later {{expressed}} dismay upon belatedly realising that the <b>walrus</b> was a villain in the poem.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Walrus</b> {{are often}} hunted {{during the winter}} and spring since hunting them in summer is much more dangerous. A <b>walrus</b> is too large to be {{controlled}} by one man, so it cannot be hunted alone. In Uqalurait: An Oral History of Nunavut, an Inuit elder describes the hunt of a <b>walrus</b> in these words: [...] "When a <b>walrus</b> was sighted, the two hunters would run to get close to it and at a short distance it is necessary to stop when the <b>walrus's</b> head was submerged... the <b>walrus</b> would hear you approach. [...] then tried to get in front of the <b>walrus</b> and it was harpooned while its head was submerged. In the meantime, the other person would drive the harpoon into the ice through the harpoon loop to secure it." ...|$|R
5|$|The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) {{was passed}} on October 21, 1972 under {{president}} Richard Nixon {{to prevent the}} further depletion and possible extinction of marine mammal stocks. It prohibits the taking ("the act of hunting, killing, capture, and/or harassment of any marine mammal; or, the attempt at such") of any marine mammal without a permit issued by the Secretary. Authority to manage the MMPA was divided between the Secretary of the Interior through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), and the Secretary of Commerce, which is delegated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) was established to review existing policies and make recommendations to the Service and NOAA to better implement the MMPA. The Service is responsible for ensuring the protection of sea otters and marine otters, <b>walruses,</b> polar bears, the three species of manatees, and dugongs; and NOAA was given responsibility to conserve and manage pinnipeds (excluding <b>walruses)</b> and cetaceans.|$|E
5|$|The {{much smaller}} {{population}} of Atlantic <b>walruses</b> ranges from the Canadian Arctic, across Greenland, Svalbard, {{and the western}} part of Arctic Russia. There are eight hypothetical subpopulations of <b>walruses,</b> based largely on their geographical distribution and movements: five west of Greenland and three east of Greenland. The Atlantic walrus once ranged south to Sable Island, Nova Scotia, and as late as the eighteenth century was found in large numbers in the greater Gulf of St. Lawrence region, sometimes in colonies of up to 7,000 to 8,000 individuals. This population was nearly eradicated by commercial harvest; their current numbers, though difficult to estimate, probably remain below 20,000. In April 2006, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the population of the northwest Atlantic walrus in Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador as having been eradicated in Canada.|$|E
5|$|<b>Walruses</b> prefer shallow shelf {{regions and}} forage {{primarily}} on the sea floor, often from sea ice platforms. They are not particularly deep divers compared to other pinnipeds; their deepest recorded dives are around 80m (260ft). They can remain submerged {{for as long as}} half an hour.|$|E

5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, <b>walruses</b> feed solitarily but are often near other <b>walruses</b> in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E

5|$|Sound {{technicians}} {{spent the}} early part of the year trying to find the right sounds. Some, such as animal sounds like those of tigers and <b>walruses,</b> were bought. Human voices were also used. Fran Walsh contributed to the NazgÃ»l scream and David Farmer the Warg howls. Other sounds were unexpected: the fell beast's screech is taken from that of a donkey, and the mÃ»makils bellow comes from the beginning and end of a lion's roar. In addition, ADR was used for most of the dialogue.|$|E
5|$|The Inuit of the Thule cultureâ€”whose {{descendants}} {{form the}} majority of the current populationâ€”arrived nearly a thousand years ago, with the first arrivals dated to approximately 13th and 14th century. The Thule people were more technologically advanced than their Dorset predecessors, although they still relied on subsistence hunting, with <b>walruses,</b> reindeer, and particularly the fur seals constituting the base of the economy in the early period.|$|E
5|$|Male {{pinnipeds}} generally play little role {{in raising}} the young. Male <b>walruses</b> may help inexperienced young {{as they learn}} to swim, and have even been recorded caring for orphans. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats {{to the safety of}} pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E
