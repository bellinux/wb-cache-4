5|$|A {{small number}} of copies of Ashen were sent to various people. Marty Rytkonen, of Bindrune Recordings, {{was the only person}} {{attached}} to a record label to receive one, and Celestiial was then taken on by Bindrune. Anderson was very happy with this, as he had been an avid reader of <b>Worm</b> <b>Gear</b> (a magazine attached to the label) when he was younger. Despite the fact that Anderson had not written Desolate North with the intention of it ever being released, in 2006, it was released by Bindrune Recordings. The CD version released by Bindrune Recordings is now out of print. However, in 2011, the album was rereleased in vinyl LP format by Handmade Birds, and the album remains available in digital format.|$|E
25|$|Worm gears {{resemble}} {{helical gear}} seats, the difference {{being that the}} shafts of a worm train are aligned perpendicularly. In this case, the helix angle of the worm meshes with the lead angle of the <b>worm</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cylinder phonographs {{generally}} used a <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> to {{move the}} stylus in synchronization with the grooves of the recording, whereas most disc machines relied on the grooves to pull the stylus along. This resulted in cylinder records played {{a number of times}} having less degradation than discs, but this added mechanism made cylinder machines more expensive.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{complicated}} tooth geometry of <b>worm</b> <b>gears,</b> their design to achieve high capacity and favourable performance is a tedious task, and the optimum design is hardly to obtain. In order {{to overcome this}} problem, the authors developed an integrated approach which consists of three modules: numerical analysis, three-dimensional simulation and finite element analysis. It provides {{a powerful tool for}} optimum design of <b>worm</b> <b>gears</b> and is a general approach applicable for various types of <b>worm</b> <b>gears.</b> As case studies, two designs using the approach have been conducted, one for cylindrical involute <b>worm</b> <b>gearing</b> and the other for double enveloping <b>worm</b> <b>gearing...</b>|$|R
50|$|The first are non-throated <b>worm</b> <b>gears.</b> These don't have a throat, or groove, {{machined}} {{around the}} circumference of either the worm or worm wheel. The second are single-throated <b>worm</b> <b>gears,</b> in which the worm wheel is throated. The final type are double-throated <b>worm</b> <b>gears,</b> which have both gears throated. This type of gearing can support the highest loading.|$|R

25|$|The <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> roller cotton gin {{was invented}} in the Indian subcontinent during the early Delhi Sultanate era of the 13th14th centuries, and is still used in India through to the present day. Another innovation, the {{incorporation}} of the crank handle in the cotton gin, {{first appeared in the}} Indian subcontinent some time during the late Delhi Sultanate or the early Mughal Empire. The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns in the form of yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the spinning wheel across India during the Delhi Sultanate era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton. The diffusion of the spinning wheel, and the incorporation of the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> and crank handle into the roller cotton gin, led to greatly expanded Indian cotton textile production.|$|E

The production of cotton, which may have largely been spun in the villages and then taken to towns {{in the form of}} yarn to be woven into cloth textiles, was advanced by the diffusion of the spinning wheel across India shortly before the Mughal era, lowering the costs of yarn and helping to increase demand for cotton.

2500|$|The disc is {{supported}} by a spindle which has a <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> which drives the register. The register is a series of dials which record the amount of energy used.

With the dial pointer type, adjacent pointers generally rotate in opposite directions due to the gearing mechanism.|$|E
50|$|A {{worm drive}} is a gear {{arrangement}} {{in which a}} worm (which is a gear {{in the form of}} a screw) meshes with a <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> (which is similar in appearance to a spur gear). The two elements are also called the worm screw and worm wheel. The terminology is often confused by imprecise use of the term <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> to refer to the worm, the <b>worm</b> <b>gear,</b> or the worm drive as a unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{long drive}} shaft {{ran along the}} full length of the port beam of the lifting frame. It entered a <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> at the pivot clamp, then {{continued}} to the nose clamp where it entered another <b>worm</b> <b>gear.</b> A shift lever at the nose clamp disengaged the drive shaft to allow either simultaneous or independent operation of the two worm gears. The <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> at the pivot clamp operated a pair of scissor arms, one {{on each side of the}} lifting frame to insert or extract the trunnion pins from the rocket. The <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> at the nose clamp operated the jaws of the nose clamp to either open or close, thus enclosing or releasing the rocket.|$|E

50|$|The {{recirculating}} ball steering mechanism contains a <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> inside a block with a threaded hole in it; this block has gear teeth {{cut into the}} outside to engage the sector shaft (also called a sector gear) which moves the Pitman arm. The steering wheel connects to a shaft, which rotates the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> inside of the block. Instead of twisting further into the block, the <b>worm</b> <b>gear</b> is fixed so that when it spins, it moves the block, which transmits the motion through the gear to the Pitman arm, causing the roadwheels to turn.|$|E

40|$|Coupling <b>worm</b> <b>gears</b> {{in large}} machine tool {{manipulator}} units (axes) {{can lead to}} overload damages under some operating conditions, like asymmetrical driving and emergency stop. This behaviour {{is caused by the}} self locking characteristic of <b>worm</b> <b>gears</b> with small pitch. If operated in the direction opposite to the designated one, self-locking can occur in the gears, subjecting the gears to an arbitrary torque which can be destructive. This condition can occur without counter torque on the driving side. In most gears, tooth engagement is based on a rolling motion. The slip component increases with a growing axis angle between the paired gears. In case of <b>worm</b> <b>gears,</b> the axis angle is 90 _, and therefore the coupling is purely frictious. This friction coupling is important in modelling. Especially the transition between the static and dynamic friction, where the system parameters change abruptly by a factor of two, should not be neglected. Based on the evaluated model a synchronous controller has been developed. This controller gives the oppertunity to drive swiveling axes with coupled selflocking gears by a standard gantry topology with an overlayed state changing master-slave topolog...|$|R
