5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake chase The Lich through a {{dimensional}} portal where they meet Prismo, a wish granter, who tells them that the Lich wished for the extinction of all life. This leads Finn to wish that the Lich had never existed. Finn is then transported to an alternate timeline, {{where he is a}} normal human living with his family and his dog, Jake, on a farm. In the alternate reality, Finn discovers a magical ice crown, which he attempts to use to repay his family's debt. After placing it on his head, he is magically imbued <b>with</b> <b>power</b> <b>over</b> ice and snow. Prismo tells Jake that if he can change The Lich's original wish, everything will go back to normal. Jake—with help from Prismo—eventually wishes that the Lich had actually desired for Finn and Jake to return home. Thus, the world is righted again.|$|E

Hera tried to bribe Paris <b>with</b> <b>power</b> <b>over</b> all Asia and Europe, and Athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but Aphrodite promised Paris that, {{if he were}} to choose her as the fairest, she would let him marry the most beautiful woman on earth. This woman was Helen, who was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. Paris selected Aphrodite and awarded her the apple. The other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the Greeks in the Trojan War.|$|E
25|$|Naaman, the {{commander}} of the army of the king of Aram, was a great warrior, but he was a leper. The girl who waited on Naaman's wife was an Israelite whom the Arameans had taken captive, and she told Naaman's wife that if Naaman went to Elisha in Samaria, then Elisha would cure Naaman of his leprosy. Naaman told his lord the king of Aram what the girl said, and the king of Aram sent Naaman on his way with a letter to the king of Israel. Naaman departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, 6,000 pieces of gold, and ten changes of clothes. Naaman brought the king of Israel the letter, which asked the king of Israel to cure Naaman of his leprosy. When the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and complained that he was not God <b>with</b> <b>power</b> <b>over</b> life and death, but the king of Aram must have been seeking some pretext to attack Israel.|$|E

500|$|Second Son {{takes place}} in 2016, seven years after Infamous 2s Conduit protagonist Cole MacGrath sacrifices himself to cure {{humanity}} of a plague and destroy The Beast. Cole uses the powerful Ray Field Inhibitor weapon, which kills him {{and most of the}} other Conduits. The United States government establishes the D.U.P. to hunt down and capture the world's remaining Conduits, dubbing Conduits with the pejorative [...] "Bio-Terrorists". [...] The protagonist is Delsin Rowe (Troy Baker), a 24 year old graffiti artist and the local delinquent of the Akomish reservation. Delsin has the unique Conduit ability of Power Absorption, allowing him to use other Conduits' powers. His brother, Reggie (Travis Willingham), is the local sheriff, and often arrests Delsin for his acts of vandalism. Both are Akomish Native Americans, whose territory lies at the shore of Salmon Bay, Washington. The antagonist is Brooke Augustine (Christine Dunford), the director of the D.U.P. and a Conduit <b>with</b> <b>power</b> <b>over</b> Concrete. Her actions in the Akomish reservation drive Delsin to travel to Seattle, now under lockdown by D.U.P. forces. Delsin and Reggie encounter three other Conduits: Henry [...] "Hank" [...] Daughtry (David Stanbra), a convict with control over Smoke; Abigail [...] "Fetch" [...] Walker (Laura Bailey), an ex- who uses her Neon powers to hunt down the illegal drug dealers in Seattle; and Eugene Sims (Alex Walsh), a reclusive video gamer who uses his Video (digital materialization) powers to save suspected Conduits from the D.U.P.|$|E
500|$|According to the Egyptologists Jean Sainte Fare Garnot and Herman te Velde, {{the name}} of [...] "Peribsen" [...] accords {{religious}} meaning, even before association with a deity. The name [...] "Peribsen" [...] literally means [...] "He who comes forth by their will" [...] or [...] "His heart and will comes forth for them." [...] The Egyptian syllable sn means [...] "them, their, those", revealing a clear plural writing. Te Velde and Garnot are convinced that Peribsen used the heraldic Seth animal as a serekh patron, but also linked his name to Horus. If true, it would prove that Peribsen worshipped Horus and Seth {{on an equal footing}} during his lifetime. An ostentatious plural meaning with religious ambiguity was not uncommon for pharaohs' names in the early Egyptian dynasties. Peribsen may have been perceived as a living incarnation of both Horus and Seth in equal measure, just like his predecessors on the throne. Therefore, Peribsen's name may actually show no break in the sacred tradition; he added the power of Seth to Horus. As further examples, the titles of early dynastic queens used plural patron deities, such as [...] "she who is allowed to see Horus and Seth" [...] and [...] "she who carries Horus and Seth". Similarly, the unusual serekh of king Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the Second dynasty, shows the deities Horus and Seth together atop the serekh. Horus wears the White Crown of Upper Egypt and Seth wears the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. Both gods are depicted facing each other in a kissing gesture. This special name was meant to illustrate the dual incarnation of the king as the representative of Horus and Seth, <b>with</b> <b>power</b> <b>over</b> all Egypt. Khasekhemwy's name can be interpreted as an advanced form of Peribsen's serekh name.|$|E
2500|$|The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke {{state that}} Jesus sent out [...] "the twelve" [...] (including Judas) <b>with</b> <b>power</b> <b>over</b> unclean spirits {{and with a}} {{ministry}} of preaching and healing: Judas clearly played {{an active part in}} this apostolic ministry alongside the other eleven. Origen of Alexandria, in his Commentary on John's Gospel, reflected on Judas's interactions with the other apostles and Jesus' confidence in him prior to his betrayal. However, in John's Gospel, Judas's outlook was differentiated - many of Jesus' disciples abandoned him because of the difficulty of accepting his teachings, and Jesus asked the twelve if they would also leave him. Simon Peter spoke for the twelve: [...] "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life," [...] but Jesus observed then that although Judas was one of the twelve whom he had chosen, he was [...] "a devil." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{drafting}} {{of a new}} constitution became a virtual battleground {{between the military and}} its opponents. The military favored a position of continued strength, a larger and more powerful NPKC-appointed senate <b>with</b> <b>power</b> <b>over</b> an elected house, a larger privy council, and the ability for non-elected officials to become cabinet members. This last clause allowed an acting military leader to become premier. The public mobilized to protest the draft, with 50,000 people demonstrating at Sanam Luang on 19 November 1991, the largest protest in Thailand since 1976. [...] The king intervened in his 4 December birthday speech, urging the public to accept the draft and noting that [...] "procedures or principles that we have imported for use are sometimes not suitable to the conditions of Thailand or the character of Thai people." [...] The constitution allowed Suchinda Kraprayoon to be appointed as prime minister, which led to a violent public uprising in May 1992 that brought down the government.|$|E
2500|$|The AirPort Base Station was {{discontinued}} {{after the}} updated AirPort Extreme was [...] on January 7, 2003. In {{addition to providing}} wireless connection speeds of up {{to a maximum of}} 54Mbit/s, it adds an external antenna port and a USB port. The antenna port allows the addition of a signal-boosting antenna, and the USB port allows the sharing of a USB printer.

60|$|Now, to my {{indifferent}} mind, {{education in}} the large sense--not politics at all--is the only agent really capable of improving the trend of civilisation, the only lever we can use. Believing this, I think it a thousand pities that neither Britain nor America, nor, so far as I know, any other country, has as yet evolved machinery through which there might be elected a supreme Director, or, say, a little Board of three Directors, of the nation's spirit, an Educational President, as it were, <b>with</b> <b>power</b> <b>over</b> the nation's spirit analogous to that which America's elected political President has over America's body. Our Minister of Education is as a rule an ordinary Member of the Government, an ordinary man of affairs--though at the moment an angel happens to have strayed in. Why cannot education be regarded, like religion in the past, as something sacred, not merely a department of political administration? Ought we not for this most vital business of education to be ever on the watch for the highest mind and the finest spirit {{of the day to}} guide us? To secure the appointment of such a man, or triumvirate, by democratic means, would need a special sifting process of election, which could never be too close and careful. One might use for the purpose the actual body of teachers in the country to elect delegates to select a jury to choose finally the flower of the national flock. It would be worth any amount of trouble to ensure that we always had the best man or men. And when we had them we should give them a mandate as real and substantial as America now gives to her political President. We should intend them not for mere lay administrators and continuers of custom, but for true fountain-heads and initiators of higher ideals of conduct, learning, manners, and taste; nor stint them of the means necessary to carry those ideals into effect. Hitherto, the supposed direction of ideals--in practice almost none--has been left to religion. But religion as a motive force is at once too personal, too lacking in unanimity, and too specialised to control the educational needs of a modern State; religion, as I understand it, is essentially emotional and individual; when it becomes practical and worldly it strays outside its true province and loses beneficence. Education as I want to see it would take over the control of social ethics, and learning, but make no attempt to usurp the emotional functions of religion. Let me give you an example: Those elixirs vitæ--open-air life and a proud pleasure in one's work--imagine those two principles drummed into the heads and hearts of all the little scholars of the age, by men and women who had been taught to believe them the truth. Would this not gradually have an incalculable effect on the trend of our civilisation? Would it not tend to create a demand for a simple and sane life; help to get us back to the land; produce reluctance to work at jobs in which no one can feel pride and pleasure, and so diminish the power of machines and of commercial exploitation? But teachers could only be inspired with such ideals by master spirits. And my plea is that we should give ourselves the chance of electing and making use of such master spirits. We all know from everyday life and business that the real, the only problem is to get the best men to run the show; when we get them the show runs well, when we don't there is nothing left but to pay the devil. The chief defect of modern civilisation based on democracy is the difficulty of getting best men quickly enough. Unless Democracy--government by the people--makes of itself Aristocracy--government by the best people--it is running steadily to seed. Democracy to be sound must utilise not only the ablest men of affairs, but the aristocracy of spirit. The really vital concern of such an elected Head of Education, himself the best man of all, would be the discovery and employment of other best men, best Heads of Schools and Colleges, whose chief concern in turn would be the discovery and employment of best subordinates. The better the teacher the better the ideals; quite obviously, the only hope of raising ideals is to raise the standard of those who teach, from top to toe of the educational machine. What we want, in short, is a sort of endless band--throwing up the finest spirit of the day till he forms a head or apex whence virtue runs swiftly down again into the people who elected him. This is the principle, as it seems to me, of the universe itself, whose symbol is neither circle nor spire, but circle and spire mysteriously combined.|$|E
