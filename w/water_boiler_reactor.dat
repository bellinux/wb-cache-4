40|$|Because of the {{affinity}} of fluoride ion for boneâ€”especially diseased boneâ€”a suitable radioisotope of fluorine {{may prove}} {{a useful tool}} for the study of meta bolic bone disease, localized osseous lesions, and dental conditions, in addition to the study of fluoride metabolism per se. All radioactive isotopes of fluorine have short half-lives. While short lived isotopes are preferable in human studies from the standpoint of radiation dosage, methods of production involving extensive manipulation to render them sterile, pyrogen free and carrier free are rather impractical because of the time factor. The only radioactive isotope of fluorine useful for the investigative purposes outlined is 18 F, with a half-life of 112 minutes (1). Since it is a positron emitter, the resultant annthilation radiation is suitable for detection by the usual gamma detecting instruments, while the short half-life permits the employment of rela tively high quantities with safety. We describe herein a rapid simple method for the production of sterile, pyrogen free, carrier free 18 F fluoride, almost immediately available for intra venous administration without extensive manipulation, and discuss its possible applications to the study of osseous disease in man.

40|$|Nowadays, systems {{based on}} {{convective}} boiling flows {{are found in}} a wide variety of industrial applications, such as boiling <b>water</b> <b>reactors,</b> <b>boilers,</b> thermosiphons, heat exchangers, condenser, chemical reactors and some other chemical process units. Such systems take advantage of the high heat transfer rates that a boiling fluid can reach at moderate temperature differences. However, those systems are unfortunately susceptible to thermally induced two-phase flow instabilities, such as Density Wave Oscillations. Thereby, the aim of present research is to perform an experimental investigation on Density Wave Oscillations, focusing on the analysis of the operational parameter effect in the system stability and characteristics of the oscillations. As a result of this investigation, the Ishii-Zuber plane is found to be appropriate to represent the system stability and that the Guido?s criteria cannot be used to estimate the instability threshold. Moreover, the oscillation amplitude monotonically increases by increasing the heat flux until it reaches an asymptote and the period is found to decrease when the amplitude is increased. Finally, a new dimensionless correlation based on amplitude ratio, is proposed as a result of the observed trends. It is found to be very useful, not only correlates well the collected data at the onset of Density Wave Oscillation, but also predicts the maximum amplitude for the given sets of operating conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{engineering}} practice exergy {{can be used}} for technical and economic optimization of energy conversion processes. The problem of increasing energy consumption suggests that heating plants, i. e. hot <b>water</b> <b>boilers,</b> as energy suppliers for household heating should be subjected to exergy and energy analysis. Heating plants are typically designed to meet energy demands, without the distinguished difference between quality and quantity of the produced heat. In this paper, the energy and exergy analysis of a gas fired hot <b>water</b> <b>boiler</b> is conducted. Energy analysis gives only quantitative results, while exergy analysis provides an insight into the actually available useful energy with respect to the system environment. In this paper, a hot <b>water</b> <b>boiler</b> was decomposed into control volumes with respect to its functional components. Energy and exergy of the created physical model of the hot <b>water</b> <b>boiler</b> is performed and destruction of exergy and energy loss in each of the components is calculated.
