40|$|This paper {{provides}} a broad overview of recent trends in solid <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling,</b> related public policy issues, and the economics literature devoted to these topics. Public attention to solid <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling</b> {{has increased dramatically}} {{over the past decade}} both in the United States and in Europe. In response, economists have developed models to help policy makers choose the efficient mix of policy levers to regulate solid <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling</b> activities. Economists have also employed different kinds of data to estimate the factors that contribute to the generation of residential solid <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling</b> and to estimate the effectiveness of many of the policy options employed. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to describe the relationship between specific local government solid <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling</b> program attributes and recyclable material recovery. The characteristics of solid <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling</b> programs vary greatly across North Carolina, achieving variable levels of recyclable material recovery rates. Given that solid waste disposal is increasing at a significant rate in North Carolina and approximately 20 years of landfill space remain in the state’s landfills, solid <b>waste</b> directors and <b>recycling</b> coordinators face an enormous amount of pressure to divert as much materials as possible to recycling programs. Through a survey of North Carolina solid <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling</b> program managers, this study collected vital data regarding characteristics of <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling</b> collection programs including pickup frequencies, weekly <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling</b> collection capacities, recycling separation requirements, and other variables presumed to be related to recyclable material recovery rates. Using correlation analyses and significance tests, the study revealed which solid <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling</b> program characteristics are most closely related to recyclable materials recovery. The study showed the three variables most closely related to recyclable materials recovery are recycling pickup frequency, separation methods and provision of <b>recycling</b> equipment. Solid <b>waste</b> and <b>recycling</b> program managers interested in maximizing recyclable material recovery rates should evaluate these three program attributes first to determine if improvements could be made. Recycling pickup frequency should be maximized, separation methods should be minimized and local governments should increase convenience for residents to obtain recycling bins or carts...|$|R

25|$|Phytogeographically, Belgium {{is shared}} between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the {{territory}} of Belgium belongs to the ecoregion of Atlantic mixed forests. Because of its high population density, industrialization and its location in the centre of Western Europe, Belgium still faces some environmental problems. However, due to consistent efforts by the various levels of government in Belgium, {{the state of the}} environment in Belgium is gradually improving. This led to Belgium being ranked {{as one of the top}} 10 countries (9 out of 132) in terms of environmental protection trends, and to Belgium being ranked in 2012 as the 24th country out of 132 for environmental protection. Belgium moreover has one of Europe's highest <b>waste</b> <b>recycling</b> rates. In particular, the Flemish region of Belgium has the highest waste diversion rate in Europe. Almost 75 percent of the residential waste produced there is reused, recycled, or composted.|$|E

25|$|Instead, in 2012 English Heritage and Heritage at Risk {{agreed to}} fund {{restoration}} {{work on the}} church. The work, which was scheduled to start in 2013, has now been completed to include the stabilising of the ruin and putting in a gravel pathway inside the church; and restoring a spiral staircase and providing a viewing platform to allow visitors to {{climb to the top}} of the tower and observe the view. Currently the tower tours run daily at 10am and 2pm. Visitors may need to telephone ahead (there is a number to call at the site of the church) as the tours are run by volunteers. Further planned work will then include building a heritage centre next to the church building. The total cost of completing the project is stated to be £225,000, of which £75,000 is to be contributed by English Heritage and £100,000 by Heritage at Risk.

25|$|Although {{consumer}} electronics {{such as the}} television have been popular since the 1920s, recycling of them was almost unheard of until early 1991. The first electronic <b>waste</b> <b>recycling</b> scheme was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices. After these schemes were set up, many countries {{did not have the}} capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of e-waste they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. This is cheaper, as recycling computer monitors in the United States costs 10 times more than in China. Demand in Asia for electronic waste began to grow when scrap yards found that they could extract valuable substances such as copper, silver, iron, silicon, nickel, and gold, during the recycling process. The 2000s saw a large increase in both the sale of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream: in 2002, e-waste grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU. This caused investment in modern, automated facilities to cope with the influx of redundant appliances, especially after strict laws were implemented in 2003.|$|E

500|$|Bulgaria {{adopted the}} Kyoto Protocol and {{achieved}} the protocol's objectives by reducing {{carbon dioxide emissions}} from 1990 to 2009 by 30 percent. However, pollution from factories and metallurgy works and severe deforestation continue to cause major problems {{to the health and}} welfare of the population. In 2013, air pollution in Bulgaria was more severe than any other European country. Urban areas are particularly affected by energy production from coal-based powerplants and automobile traffic, while pesticide usage in the agriculture and antiquated industrial sewage systems produce extensive soil and water pollution with chemicals and detergents. Bulgaria is home to Maritsa Iztok-2, a lignite-fired power station causing the highest damage costs to health and the environment in the entire European Union according to the European Environment Agency. It is the only EU member which does not recycle municipal waste, although an electronic <b>waste</b> <b>recycling</b> plant opened in June 2010. The situation has improved in recent years, and several government-funded programs have been put into place in an attempt to reduce pollution levels. According to Yale University's 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Bulgaria is a [...] "modest performer" [...] in protecting the environment. Over 75% of surface rivers meet the standards for good quality. An improvement of water quality began in 1998 and has maintained a sustainable trend of moderate improvement.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, the Navigation Trust {{was able}} to buy the bed of the river between Carre Street in Sleaford and Bone Mill, which {{included}} the lock and its island at Cogglesford Mill. Lower Kyme lock was refurbished in the winter of 2008. The upper gate is a vertical guillotine gate, and the mechanism required 350 turns of a handle to raise the gate, and another 350 to lower it again. New lock gates were fitted, and a new geared mechanism requiring fewer turns made the lock easier to operate. Around [...] of the waterway from Sleaford to Cogglesford Mill lock were reopened, following the construction of a lifting bridge in the town centre. This was installed in late December 2008, although the hydraulic operating gear was not fitted until January 2010. Work was also carried out to construct a new slipway on Eastgate Green, to allow trailed boats to be launched onto the town section. This involved careful planning to avoid damage to 27 mature trees, and the widening of [...] of the bank to create a mooring point. Funding was provided by Lincolnshire County Council, the Inland Waterways Association, and <b>Waste</b> <b>Recycling</b> Environmental Ltd (WREN), which administers the Landfill Communities Fund.
