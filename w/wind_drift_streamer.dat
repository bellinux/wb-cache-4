It has The impact of Stokes drift, a wave-driven {{mechanism}} of mass transport, is investigated for surface oil movement in the Gulf of Mexico. Stokes drift was neglected in trajectory forecasts in the Gulf during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The key considerations used in Gulf of Mexico trajectory forecasts were surface currents and <b>wind</b> <b>drift.</b> This study presents a physical argument for the importance of Stokes drift and questions the significance of <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> over an oil slick. Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of the <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> (2 – 5 % of the wind speed and 20 ° to the right in the Northern Hemisphere) is very {{similar to that of the}} Stokes drift. For this reason, the differences between Stokes <b>drift</b> and the <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> are examined using a vector comparison. The directional components of Stokes <b>drift</b> and the <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> are found to be very similar although the magnitudes of the <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> are found to be larger. When swell not associated with the local wind is present, however, the two drifts have significantly different directional components.

40|$|Despite the {{potentially}} strong effect of wind on bird orientation, {{our understanding of}} how <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> affects migrating birds is still very limited. Using data from satellite-based radio telemetry, we analysed the effect of changing winds on the variation of the track direction of individual birds. We studied adults and juveniles of two raptor species, osprey Pandion haliaetus and honey buzzard Pernis apivorus, on autumn migration between North Europe and Africa, and demonstrate an important difference between the age categories of both species in the extent of <b>wind</b> <b>drift.</b> For juveniles, side- and following-wind components affected the rates of movement perpendicular to and along the mean direction, respectively, to a similar degree, suggesting full <b>wind</b> <b>drift.</b> By contrast, for adults the rate of crosswind displacement was significantly smaller than the effect of wind on forward movement, showing much reduced <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> (29 %). This indicates that adults have acquired a more sophisticated orientation system, permitting detection of and compensation for <b>wind</b> <b>drift,</b> than juveniles. These drift effects are likely to reduce the ability of juveniles to locate species-specific wintering areas in case of rapid climatic wind change...|$|R

40|$|This study evaluates how the {{advection}} of precipitation, or <b>wind</b> <b>drift,</b> {{between the}} radar volume and ground affects radar measurements of precipitation. Normally precipitation {{is assumed to}} fall vertically to the ground from the contributing volume, and thus the radar measurement represents the geographical location immediately below. In this study radar measurements are corrected using hydrometeor trajectories calculated from measured and forecasted winds, {{and the effect of}} trajectory-correction on the radar measurements is evaluated. <b>Wind</b> <b>drift</b> statistics for Finland are compiled using sounding data from two weather stations spanning two years. For each sounding, the hydrometeor phase at ground level is estimated and drift distance calculated using different originating level heights. This way the drift statistics are constructed as a function of range from radar and elevation angle. On average, <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> of 1 km was exceeded at approximately 60 km distance, while drift of 10 km was exceeded at 100 km distance. Trajectories were calculated using model winds in order to produce a trajectory-corrected ground field from radar PPI images. It was found that at the upwind side from the radar the effective measuring area was reduced as some trajectories exited the radar volume scan. In the downwind side areas {{near the edge of the}} radar measuring area experience improved precipitation detection. The effect of trajectory-correction is most prominent in instant measurements and diminishes when accumulating over longer time periods. Furthermore, measurements of intensive and small scale precipitation patterns benefit most from <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> correction. The contribution of <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> on the uncertainty of estimated Ze (S) - relationship was studied by simulating the effect of different error sources to the uncertainty in the relationship coefficients a and b. The overall uncertainty was assumed to consist of systematic errors of both the radar and the gauge, as well as errors by turbulence at the gauge orifice and by <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> of precipitation. The focus of the analysis is error associated with <b>wind</b> <b>drift,</b> which was determined by describing the spatial structure of the reflectivity field using spatial autocovariance (or variogram). This spatial structure was then used with calculated drift distances to estimate the variance in radar measurement produced by precipitation drift, relative to the other error sources. It was found that error by <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> was of similar magnitude with error by turbulence at gauge orifice at all ranges from radar, with systematic errors of the instruments being a minor issue. The correction method presented in the study could be used in radar nowcasting products to improve the estimation of visibility and local precipitation intensities. The method however only considers pure snow, and for operational purposes some improvements are desirable, such as melting layer detection, VPR correction and taking solid state hydrometeor type into account, which would improve the estimation of vertical velocities of the hydrometeors...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glyphosate is used {{to control}} weeds in citrus orchards, and {{accidental}} spraying or <b>wind</b> <b>drift</b> onto the seedlings may cause growth arrest owing to metabolism disturbance. Two experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of non-lethal rates (0, 180, 360 and 720 g Al ha(- 1)) of glyphosate on four-month-old `Cravo` lime, Citrus limonia (L.) Osbeck, seedlings. Photosynthesis and the concentrations of shikimic acid, total free amino acids and phenolic acids were evaluated. RESULTS: Only transitory effects were observed in the! contents of shikimate and total free amino acids. No visual effects were observed.
