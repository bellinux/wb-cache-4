40|$|Abstract: Idiopathic lobular panniculitis, {{sometimes}} called relapsing febrile nodular panniculitis or Weber Christian disease first described in 1892 by Pfeifer, {{is the term}} used to describe {{a group of diseases}} that present as subcutaneous inflammatory nodules and histologically display an inflammatory focus primarily within the fat lobules. <b>Weber-Christian</b> <b>disease</b> is the term applied to idiopathic cases of lobular panniculitis associated with systemic symptoms. The disease occurs predominantly in middle aged females although it can be seen in both sexes and at all ages.

40|$|Two {{patients}} with profound decrease of alpha^antitrypsin (PiZZ) presented with severe panniculitis (Weber-Christian disease); one had systemic panniculitis including pancreatitis. Another possible case is quoted from the literature. Although milder forms of panniculitis can have normal Pi phenotypes and alphai-antitrypsin levels, the marked reduction of antiproteolytic activity found in PiZZ homozygotes may predispose to or aggravate the lesions of <b>Weber-Christian</b> <b>disease.</b> THE CAUSE of idiopathic panniculitis (<b>Weber-Christian</b> <b>disease)</b> is unknown (1, 2). Its severity is variable, rang-ing from restricted, transient inflammation of subcutaneous adipose tissue to a generalized and sometimes fatal process (3 - 5). We present here two cases of severe panniculitis asso-ciated with marked deficiency of alpha^antitrypsin. We {{believe that this}} association {{is unlikely to be}} accidental and that marked alphaj-antitrypsin deficiency may predis-pose to or worsen the course of panniculitis. Methods The trypsin inhibitory capacity of serum was measured by the enzymatic method of Dietz and colleagues (6, 7). In our laboratory healthy male adults (PiMM) * have values between 2. 1 and 3. 5 /xmol/min • ml (mean, 2. 73 ± 0. 29 (SD)) and healthy female adults between 2. 4 and 3. 8 (mean, 2. 97 ± 0. 32).

40|$|SUMMARY Fat {{necrosis}} {{was present}} in 22 of 400 cases of consecutive postperinatal mortalities investigated to assess the presence and pattern of deep fat necrosis. In just over 50 % of the cases of fat necrosis {{the cause of death}} was categorised as sudden infant death syndrome, which also showed more severe degrees of necrosis. The mechanism of necrosis may be vascular hypoperfusion, possi-bly related to shock, and brown adipose tissue, on account of its high metabolic activity and rich capillary plexus, may be particularly vulnerable to infarction. The occurrence of fat necrosis in association with other causes of death did not provide any definite clue as to the nature of the alleged shock. Fat necrosis, or panniculitis, usually occurs in a wide range of surgical or accidental conditions. <b>Weber-Christian</b> <b>disease</b> is the most well documented of the panniculitides.

40|$|Background: {{the purpose}} of the present paper was to {{describe}} the clinical manifestations and treatment of patients with panniculitis. Methods: From January 1983 to December 2002, 4294 patients were treated for pediatric rheumatological diseases at Pediatric Rheumatology Unit, University of São Paulo, Brazil. of these, 35 children and adolescents (0. 8 %) presented with panniculitis: erythema nodosum (EN) or <b>Weber-Christian</b> <b>disease</b> (WCD). Clinical characteristics, laboratory exams, biopsy of the lesion, treatment and clinical course were studied. Results: of the 35 patients, 29 presented with EN and six with WCD, one of these with cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis. Mean age at symptom onset was 85 months (6 - 204 months) and the mean duration of follow up was 55 months (1 - 144 months). All the patients presented with inflammatory subcutaneous nodules. the patients with WCD presented with systemic manifestations and cutaneous atrophy. the principal etiologies of EN were streptococcal infection (42 %), undetermined (13. 5 %), pulmonary tuberculosis (10 %), and acute rheumatic fever (10 %). Biopsy of the nodules indicated septal panniculitis in 14 patients with EN and lobular panniculitis without vasculitis in the patients with WCD, one of which had cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis. There was recurrence in 11 patients (38 %) with EN and in all those with WCD. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used in 15 patients with EN and corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs in the six patients with WCD. Three patients died. Conclusion: EN is the most frequent panniculitis, with a benign course and is mainly associated with infections. WCD is a severe disease, with systemic involvement, that proceeds with cutaneous atrophy and requires the use of corticosteroids and or immunosuppressive drugs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lipoatrophic panniculitis is {{generally}} considered to be a rare disease affecting children. We report a case involving this condition in an adult patient presenting with striking clinical features and responding to hydroxychloroquine therapy. We discuss the nosological relationship between lipoatrophic panniculitis and connective tissue panniculitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 62 -year-old woman was referred to our institution with a six-month history of painful erythematous nodules and plaques on the calves, thighs, buttocks, breasts, abdomen and arms. With each outbreak of new lesions, she felt unwell and experienced fever, chills and sweating. After a few weeks, the lesions progressed circumferentially and led to large areas of subcutaneous atrophy showing a central depression covered with a yellowish, supple skin and surrounded by an annular, infiltrated, erythematous and tender inflammatory margin. Deep subcutaneous biopsy specimens showed typical features of lobular and septal lipophagic panniculitis, with a dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of large histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells and few neutrophils, without vasculitis. The patient was started on hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily. Three weeks later, her pain and tenderness had completely resolved and the inflammatory margin of the lesions had clearly regressed. DISCUSSION: This unique condition, with distinctive clinical and histological features, is similar to cases described under the term "lipophagic panniculitis", seen mostly in children, but also "connective tissue panniculitis". Their clinical resemblance and response to hydroxychloroquine therapy leads us to think that these two entities, previously subsumed under the eponym of <b>Weber-Christian</b> <b>disease</b> or Rothman-Makai syndrome, are closely related. CONCLUSION: Dermatologists and dermatopathologists should be made aware of this unusual entity, and {{of the fact that it}} can arise in adult patients, so that they may make an early diagnosis and thus prevent the unsightly consequences of lipoatrophy...|$|E
40|$|From the Department ofPathology, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee SYNOPSIS A case is {{described}} of Weber-Christian panniculitis {{accompanied by a}} gammaglobulin disturbance which preceded by five years the diagnosis of an autoimmune hepatitis and pancyto-penia. Also associated was the onset of diabetes mellitus, found at necropsy {{to be related to}} pancreatic islet amyloid deposition. This case reinforces the view that Weber-Christian panniculitis may be an adipose response to a variety of immunological stimuli. The Weber-Christian type of panniculitis is a recurrent febrile illness characterized by multiple symmetrical subcutaneous nodules or plaques which resolve, leaving characteristically depressed atrophic areas (Cairns, 1968). Histologically (Lever, 1967) there are three phases: (1) degeneration of fat cells accompanied by an inflammatory infiltrate com-posed of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macro-phages: abscess formation does not occur; (2) infiltration with macrophages, many laden with fat and some multinucleate: in some areas macrophages with foamy cytoplasm completely replace fat cells; (3) fibroblasts intermingled with lymphocytes and plasma cells replace foam cells: collagen is laid down, resulting in fibrosis. Steinberg (1953) reviewed 43 cases with systemic symptoms and signs, and he concluded these to be malaise, fatigability, generalized aching, chills, night sweats, fever, nausea or vomiting, hepato-rnegaly, splenomegaly, normochromic normocytic anaemia, leucopenia or leucocytosis, and elevated or depressed platelet count. Milner and Mitchinson (1965) reviewed 11 published necropsy reports on patients with systemic involvement and reported a further case. In these cases there was involvement of subcutaneous and retroperitoneal, mesenteric or epicardial adipose tissue. They recommended the name systemic <b>Weber-Christian</b> <b>disease</b> where the typical lesions are present in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, and Weber-Christian panni-culitis where the lesions are confined to the sub-cutaneous adipose tissue. This terminology is adhered to herein...|$|E
40|$|<b>Weber-Christian</b> <b>disease</b> (WCD), or {{idiopathic}} panniculitis, {{refers to}} rare diseases {{from a group}} of systemic connective tissue diseases. To verify the diagnosis of WCD is a difficult task, for there are no precise diagnostic tests for this disease. Objective: to study the clinical features and additional investigation data of WCD as one of the variants of lobular panniculitis (LP). Subjects and methods. Nineteen patients (2 men and 17 women) aged 32 to 71 years with WCD were examined. The average disease duration was 65. 1 ± 11. 3 months. Results. The medical history data of 12 patients could identify three suspected factors of disease development: surgical intervention (n = 6); supercooling (n= 4), and acute respiratory viral infection (n= 2). In 10 (53 %) patients aged 47 – 71 years, the Quetelet index was as high as 31. 8 ± 7. 2 cm/kg, which allowed grade 2 obesity to be diagnosed. According to its clinical manifestations, there were 3 WCD forms: nodular (n= 10), plaque (n= 6), and infiltrative (n= 3). The saucer symptom was present in 74 %, including in all cases of the chronic course (p= 0. 02). The number of affected areas significantly differed in the nodular and plaque forms (p= 0. 01). ROC analysis showed that the optimal values of sensitivity (80 %) and specificity (83 %) on visual analog scale (VAS) in patients with these forms corresponded to a separation point of 60 mm, with the prognostic value of a positive result being 0. 89 (CI 0. 71 – 1. 1; p= 0. 011). The infiltrative form showed a typical clinical picture (VAS, 83. 1 ± 12. 5 mm) in 3 patients, one of them was found to have mesenteric panniculitis. The level of C-reactive protein was shown to be correlated with the form of the disease; the former being maximal in infiltrative WCD. The pathomorphological examination of skin and subcutaneous fat biopsy specimens from the nodule of all the patients detected diffuse leukolymphocytic infiltration, single multinucleated cells, necrotic foci, and lipocyte proliferation. Conclusion. WCD is a clinical variant of LP, which requires an extended diagnostic search. </p...|$|E
