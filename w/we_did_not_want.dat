500|$|Resident Evil 3 {{uses the}} same game engine as its predecessors. The environments consist of 2D pre-rendered {{backgrounds}} while moving objects such as enemies and some interactive elements consist of 3D polygon graphics. The developers chose this technique because having full 3D graphics would {{not allow them to}} create graphically rich and detailed environments. According to project supervisor Yoshiki Okamoto, [...] "the number of polygons allocated for the enemies would not be sufficient. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to have blocky, pixelated zombies." [...] Interaction with the environment was improved so that the player could shoot objects like explosive barrels to damage enemies. Developers also added more variety of zombies, who can take the form of policemen, doctors, and ordinary citizens, among others.|$|E
500|$|The Coens have {{acknowledged}} several cinematic inspirations for Barton Fink. Chief {{among these are}} three movies by Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski: Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-Sac (1966), and The Tenant (1976). These movies employ a mood of psychological uncertainty coupled with eerie environments that compound the mental instability of the characters. Barton's isolation in his room at the Hotel Earle is frequently {{compared to that of}} Trelkovsky in his apartment in The Tenant. Ethan said regarding the genre of Barton Fink: [...] "t is kind of a Polanski movie. It is closer to that than anything else." [...] By coincidence, Polanski {{was the head of the}} jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1991, where Barton Fink premiered. This created an awkward situation. [...] "Obviously", Joel Coen said later, [...] "we have been influenced by his films, but at this time we were very hesitant to speak to him about it because <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to give the impression we were sucking up".|$|E

500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

Lanier of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPD) revoked the permits that morning. An MPD spokesperson explained [...] "The Metropolitan Police Department is not the lead agency on presidential motorcades and <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to portray ourselves as such". As a result, the production crews did a last minute filming of the desired scenes back in Baltimore. The next day, Mayor of the District of Columbia Vincent Gray stated that there was confusion on what role the MPD would play in the filming. A spokesperson from his office stated that [...] ""MPD {{is not going to}} rent itself out as extras for film ... That's what MPD's decision was focused on. We're not going to be actors." [...] On October 2, all issues were resolved and the motorcade was filmed as originally planned without any MPD personnel [...] "actively participate in the filming".|$|E

500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, we both knew that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|E

And that's exactly {{what we wanted to}} do." [...] 2 years later in a 2000 interview with the Finnish The Christian Underground Zine issue 4, the fanzine's interviewer asked Antestor: [...] "However, you had a record deal with Cacophonous Records (ex-Cradle of Filth, Bal-Sagoth). What kind of experiences did you get from that?" [...] The band replied: [...] "Pretty bad, actually. I can not say they did anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing." [...] The interviewer also asked: [...] "Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?" [...] Antestor replied: [...] "Nothing like that. They just said that it is not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words 'Lord' and 'Jesus' from our lyrics. We ourselves removed a few texts because <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to provoke unnecessarily." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson gained {{high office}} {{due to his}} proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and {{self-employed}} tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the [...] "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, [...] "Johnson {{was always the same}} to everyone... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen." [...] Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts.

After a fast start, Cambridge took a half-length lead by Fulham. [...] Rounding the Middlesex bend, Oxford drew back into contention and the crews were level at the Mile Post {{in a time of}} 4 minutes 4 seconds. [...] On the approach to Harrods Furniture Depository, Painter, the Dark Blue cox, steered his boat so close to the Surrey shore that Douglas Calder, writing in The Times, suggested [...] "if the crews had gone any farther over they would have been practically on the towpath". After being warned twice by the umpire for steering too close to their opponents, and taking a small lead, Oxford were made to concede to the Light Blues, and Cambridge rallied. Despite rough water through Crabtree Reach, Cambridge pushed on at Hammersmith Bridge and opened an eight-second lead by the time the crews reached Chiswick Steps. [...] By Barnes Bridge they had extended their lead to twelve seconds, and passed the finishing post three-and-a-half lengths ahead in a time of 18 minutes 22 seconds. [...] It was the Light Blues' first victory in four years. [...] Their cox remarked [...] "I think we could have won on a foul if I had forced a collision at Harrods.

So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues."

We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics.

500|$|On February 12, 2010, major UK cinema chains, Odeon, Vue and Cineworld, {{had planned}} to boycott the film because of a {{reduction}} of the interval between cinema and DVD release from the usual 17 weeks to 12 (possibly to avoid {{the release of the}} DVD clashing with the 2010 FIFA World Cup, which was Disney's pretext for cutting short Alice's theatrical run but UK exhibitors protested that Alice would be less threatened by the World Cup than other titles). A week after the announcement, Cineworld, who has a 24% share of UK box office, chose to play the film on more than 150 screens. Cineworld's chief executive Steve Wiener stated, [...] "As leaders in 3D, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> the public to miss out on such a visual spectacle. As the success of Avatar has shown, there is currently a huge appetite for the 3D experience". Shortly after, the Vue cinema chain also reached an agreement with Disney, but Odeon had still chosen to boycott in Britain, Ireland and Italy. On February 25, 2010 Odeon had reached an agreement and decided to show the film on March 5, 2010. The Royal premiere took place at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on February 25, 2010 for the fundraiser The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts where the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall attended. It also did not affect their plans to show the film in Spain, Germany, Portugal and Austria. The film was released in the U.S. and UK, in both Disney Digital 3D and IMAX 3D, as well as regular theaters on March 5, 2010.|$|E

An Anglo-American force of 63,000 men landed in French Morocco and Algeria. The long-term goal was to clear German and Italian troops from North Africa, enhance naval control of the Mediterranean, and prepare {{an invasion of}} Italy in 1943. The Allies had hoped that Vichy forces would offer only token resistance to the Allies, but instead they fought hard, incurring heavy casualties.

2500|$|Looking {{for better}} {{distribution}} of their records, Big Black negotiated {{a deal with}} Homestead Records.

Further, the band took no advance payments, paid for their own recordings, and signed no contracts. Durango later remarked that [...] "We came from a punk perspective — <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to get sucked into a corporate culture where basically you're signing a contract because you don't trust the other person to live up to their word.

2500|$|Doubts {{have been}} cast by some experts from US or Israeli-affiliated think tanks {{on either the}} {{existence}} of fatwa, its authenticity, impact, or whether only political statements that lack the authority of a religiously binding fatwa have been made. James Risen of The New York Times noted that Khamenei said “that {{it was a mistake}} for Col.

In 2015, an open letter to then president Barack Obama posted on Iranian.com, reportedly from a nephew of Ali Khamenei, stated that Khamenei is practicing the Shia doctrine of taqiya with regard to the fatwa. On November 1, 2015, The Jerusalem Post also noted that the fatwa came after the period when President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani admitted the nuclear option was explored, referring to the interview.
