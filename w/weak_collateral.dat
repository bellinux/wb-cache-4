40|$|We {{extend the}} {{standard}} model of central bank operations to study {{the impact of a}} wider range of eligible collaterals. We show that central banks are able to control both the level of interbank market rates and the distribution of banks ’ funding costs by setting different prices on loans depending {{on the quality of the}} collateral. We compare this with the use of haircut requirements to penalize <b>weak</b> <b>collateral</b> and underline the merits of a combined approach with specific interest rates and haircut levels depending on the collateral type. This is preliminary work. Please do not distribute. Comments are welcome...|$|E

We compare this with the use of haircut requirements and underline the merits of a combined approach with specific interest rates and haircut levels depending on the collateral type. Central banks took unprecedented measures to fight the 2007 - 2009 crisis. One of them was to enlarge the range of collaterals accepted in their refinancing operations to make it easier for banks to borrow. For example, the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered its minimum quality threshold from A- to BBB- in the aftermath of the Lehman bankruptcy and the Bank of England now accepts ABSs backed by student or consumer loans as collateral in its Long-Term Repo Operations. Collaterals are used by central banks as a protection from credit risk. If the counterparty fails to repay when due, the central bank can sell or retain the collateral to make good any loss it may face. But when counterparties can pledge both high-quality (strong) or low-quality (<b>weak)</b> <b>collateral</b> for a same loan, an adverse selection problem arises as they will only pledge the worst type of collateral...|$|E

However, these theories have not really been tested in in-depth case studies – particularly beyond the national level of the parties. This article examines the mass party par excellence, the Swedish Social Democratic Party and focuses on the party’s traditionally {{close relationship with the}} blue-collar trade unions. There is evidence to support the {{theories of}} party change, but these organiz-ational developments are patchy at the local level. Moreover, various data deployed in support of the theories may be understating the enduring influence of collateral organizations within parties.

40|$|The striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) {{network is}} sparsely {{connected}} with fairly <b>weak</b> GABAergic <b>collaterals</b> receiving an excitatory glutamatergic cortical projection. Peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTH) of MSN population response investigated in various experimental studies display strong firing rate modulations distributed throughout behavioral task epochs. In previous work {{we have shown}} by numerical simulation that sparse random networks of inhibitory spiking neurons with characteristics appropriate for UP state MSNs form cell assemblies which fire together coherently in sequences on long behaviorally relevant timescales when the network receives a fixed pattern of constant input excitation. Here we first extend that model to the case where cortical excitation is composed of many independent noisy Poisson processes and demonstrate that cell assembly dynamics is still observed when the input is sufficiently weak. However if cortical excitation strength is increased more regularly firing and completely quiescent cells are found, which depend on the cortical stimulation. Subsequently we further extend previous work to consider {{what happens when the}} excitatory input varies as it would when the animal is engaged in behavior. We investigate how sudden switches in excitation interact with network generated patterned activity. We show that sequences of cell assembly activations can be locked to the excitatory input sequence and outline the range of parameters where this behavior is shown. Model cell population PSTH display both stimulus and temporal specificity, with large population firing rate modulations locked to elapsed time from task events. Thus the random network can generate a large diversity of temporally evolving stimulus dependent responses even though the input is fixed between switches. We suggest the MSN network is well suited to the generation of such slow coherent task dependent response which could be utilized by the animal in behavior...|$|R
40|$|Mathematical finance {{extensively}} {{relies on}} martingales. In some cases, {{they need to}} meet constraints. For instance, they can be required to evolve in a compact set; discounted zero-coupon bond prices are risk-neutral martingales in [0, 1] if interest rates are positive. So are survival probabilities E_t[1 _{τ>T}]. These martingales are usually tackled via latent processes, but some constraints are typically relaxed in order to fit the initial term-structure (eg positivity in Hull-White or CIR++ models for default intensities). In that context, tools for direct modelling of such bounded processes could be valuable. Surprisingly, however, such approaches haven't received much attention so far. Filling this gap is the goal of this paper. We first review the conditions for a pure diffusion SDE to admit a (strong) solution, and for the latter to be a martingale. We then proceed with bounded (or conic) martingales. Martingales in [0, 1] can be obtained by solving pure diffusion SDEs whose diffusion coefficient has a specific form, eg x(1 -x) or the logistic curve. Unfortunately, explicit solutions to those are unavailable. On the other hand, martingales in [a,b] can be obtained by mapping latent processes through smooth bijections F with image [a,b], provided that the associated drift is chosen according to the mapping's score. We study several mappings, and a unique solution is found in one case. Its variance, variance of increments and distribution are derived, a useful feature for tractability purposes. The solution's asymptotic distribution is proven to be typically singular (Bernoulli type). This is natural for floored/capped martingales. In particular, any quantile of the exponential martingale distribution tend to zero at some point. Interestingly, this proves that the maximum variance is attainable asymptotically. The existence of a unique solution is not always easy to establish for bounded martingale SDEs. We show how to choose the mapping for turning the SDE of a bounded martingale with separable diffusion coefficient of the form h(t) g(x) to that of a drifted process with autonomous diffusion coefficient. We conclude with an example where the method is applied to survival probability modelling. In this setup, calibration to initial survival probability curve is trivial. Potential applications cover pricing of CDS options or CVA on CDS under <b>weak</b> <b>collateral</b> regimes, among others...|$|E
