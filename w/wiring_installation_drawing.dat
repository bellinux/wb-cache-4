Individual cables can exit the tray at any point, simplifying the <b>wiring</b> <b>installation</b> and reducing the labour cost for installing new cables. Power cables may have fittings in the tray to maintain clearance between the conductors, but small control wiring is often installed without any intentional spacing between cables.|$|R

50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{an early}} form of {{insulated}} cable, introduced in 1896, {{consisted of two}} impregnated-paper-insulated conductors in an overall lead sheath. Joints were soldered, and special fittings were used for lamp holders and switches. These cables were similar to underground telegraph and telephone cables of the time. Paper-insulated cables proved unsuitable for interior <b>wiring</b> <b>installations</b> because very careful workmanship was required on the lead sheaths to ensure moisture {{did not affect the}} insulation.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to reducing weight, implementing a wireless solution {{has the potential}} to reduce costs throughout an aircraft's life cycle. For example, many key failure points associated with wire and connectors will be eliminated thus hours spent troubleshooting wires and connectors will be reduced. Furthermore, engineering costs could potentially decrease because less time would be spent on designing <b>wiring</b> <b>installations,</b> late changes in an aircraft's design would be easier to manage, etc.|$|R
