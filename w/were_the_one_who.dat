5000|$|A Shaggy {{defense is}} the legal {{strategy}} in which the defendant flatly denies guilt despite overwhelming evidence against them, particularly a recording of them committing the act, just by denying {{that they were the}} one witnessed or recorded committing the act. A key element of the defense is the refusal to engage with or try to refute the evidence against the defendant, instead choosing to just deny that they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> committed the act. The strategy's name is derived from reggae musician Shaggy's 2000 single [...] "It Wasn't Me", which is based around the concept; it was coined by Slate writer Josh Levin in 2008 to describe the defense used by singer R. Kelly while he was on trial for child pornography charges.|$|E
