5|$|Another large {{building}} lies crosswise at {{the south}} end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> thirteenth century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic infirmary—if so, it was a most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.|$|E

5|$|During the Georgian era Bath became fashionable, and {{the architects}} John Wood, the Elder, and his son, John Wood the Younger, laid out new areas of housing for {{residents}} and visitors. Assembly rooms {{had been built}} early in the 18th century, but a new venue for balls, concerts and gambling was envisaged in the area between Queen Square, The Circus and the Royal Crescent. Robert Adam submitted a proposal that was rejected as too expensive. John Wood, the Younger raised funding through a Tontine and construction started in 1769. The New or Upper Assembly Rooms opened <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> ball in 1771 and became the hub of fashionable society, being frequented by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, along with the nobility of the time.|$|E
5|$|Evanton has {{a number}} of public {{facilities}} including the Diamond Jubilee Hall, Chapel Road, building work started in December 1897, Major Randle Jackson of Swordale House gave 50% of the building costs and the people of Evanton (Parish of Kiltearn) raised the rest. The hall opened on 5 November 1898 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> concert over 500 people from the village attending. Diamond Jubilee Hall transferred from Highland Council to the Community on Thursday 29 September 2011. Evanton Sports Centre (opposite Kiltearn Primary School) is the other public facilies in the village which cateres for various sporting activities badminton, basketball, football and tennis.

5|$|In 1925, Michael Naify and William Nasser {{turned to}} Pflueger {{again for a}} new {{neighborhood}} theater design based on the Alhambra in Grenada, Spain. The Alhambra Theatre opened on November 5, 1926 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> facade flanked by twin minarets that glowed red at night. Pflueger's vision stayed firmly planted in the Moorish Revival style, complete to the iron scrollwork and amber shade redesign of two municipal streetlamps standing outside of the theater. Pflueger worked with muralist Arthur Frank Mathews to achieve a rich palette of color most prominently displayed in a geometric floral pattern on the main ceiling. The Alhambra was named San Francisco Landmark No. 217 in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In London Chopin took lodgings at Dover Street, {{where the}} firm of Broadwood {{provided}} him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at Stafford House, the audience included Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were Thackeray and the singer Jenny Lind. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one guinea per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements {{of some of his}} mazurkas to Spanish texts. On 28 August, he played at a concert in Manchester's Concert Hall, sharing the stage with Marietta Alboni and Lorenzo Salvi.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was the great hall of the castle, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> porch and steps leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E

5|$|When the Five Nations resumed {{with the}} re-admission of France in 1947 after the Second World War, England shared the {{championship}} with Wales. The early Five Nations competitions of the 1950s were unsuccessful for England, winning one match in the 1950 and 1951 championships. England won the 1953 Five Nations, and followed this up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Grand</b> Slam in 1957, and win in 1958. England broke France's four-championship streak {{by winning the}} 1963 Championship. After this victory, England played three Tests in the Southern Hemisphere and lost all three: 21–11 and 9–6 against the All Blacks, and 18–9 against Australia. England did not win a single match in 1966, and managed only a draw with Ireland. They did not win another Championship that decade; a fact that prompted amateur historian F. W. P. Syms to declare this period 'the sorriest in English Rugby Union History'.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} game's {{development}} was finished, Mikami told Takumi {{that they should}} make an Ace Attorney trilogy, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> finale in the third game's last case. Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes in the second game, but during the production the development team learned that the character had become popular. This led to Takumi feeling {{that he had to}} use the character more carefully and sparingly; he created the new prosecutor character Franziska von Karma, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he – a supposed prodigy – loses every case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided making a lot of changes between games: art from the first game for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for Justice for All.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{has had a}} long {{association}} with French monarchs seeking to associate themselves with a symbol of Roman imperial power. King Charles IX of France visited in 1564 during his Grand Tour of France and was greeted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> entertainment laid on by the Duc d'Uzès. Twelve young girls dressed as nymphs came out of a cave by the riverside near the aqueduct and presented the king with pastry and preserved fruits. A century later, Louis XIV and his court visited the Pont du Gard during a visit to Nîmes in January 1660 shortly after the signature of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. In 1786 his great-great-great-grandson Louis XVI commissioned the artist Hubert Robert to produce a set of paintings of Roman ruins of southern France to hang in the king's new dining room at the Palace of Fontainebleau, including a picture depicting the Pont du Gard in an idealised landscape. The commission was meant to reassert the ties between the French monarchy and the imperial past. Napoleon III, in the mid-19th century, consciously identified with Augustus and accorded great respect to Roman antiquities; his patronage of the bridge's restoration in the 1850s was essential to its survival.|$|E

5|$|In the divisional {{round of}} the playoffs, the Red Sox faced the Anaheim Angels in a best-of-five series.

In the 7th inning of Game 3, with the Red Sox leading by 4, Vladimir Guerrero tied the game for the Angels <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>grand</b> slam. However, David Ortiz won the series with a game winning home run in the 10th. In the American League Championship Series, the Red Sox lost the first three games against the New York Yankees and were {{trailing}} in Game 4 when they began the 9th inning. Kevin Millar was walked by Yankees closer Mariano Rivera. Dave Roberts then came into the game to pinch run for Millar and stole second base. Mueller then singled to enable him to tie the game. Another game winning home run by Ortiz won the game for the Red Sox in the 12th inning. Ortiz' single in the 14th inning of Game 5 scored the winning run for the Red Sox, in what was the longest post-season game in baseball history. Despite having a dislocated ankle tendon, Schilling started Game 6 for the Red Sox. He pitched for seven innings, and allowed just one run, during which time his sock became soaked in blood. In the eighth inning, Yankees third baseman Rodriguez slapped a ball out of pitcher Arroyo's hand, allowing the Yankees to score a run. However, after a discussion the umpires called Rodriguez out for interference and canceled the run. Fans then threw debris onto the field in protest and the game was stopped for ten minutes. The Red Sox won the game and became the first baseball team to ever force a Game 7 after having been down 3 games to none. A 10–3 win in Game 7 brought the Red Sox to the World Series {{for the first time in}} 18 years.|$|E
