50|$|Digimon Savers {{was first}} {{announced}} during the December 2005 Jump Festa convention in Japan with advertisements showing a remolded Agumon {{as the lead}} Digimon. The name of the series was later revealed in January 2005 with the character designs coming a month later. Savers was the first Digimon series to be produced in nearly four years, but the second Digimon production since 2005, coming off the heels of Digital Monster X-Evolution, where staff had mentioned early on that a new series might be possible depending on its performance. Unlike previous series which all featured human character designs by Akihiro Asanuma, Savers went with designs by Sayo Aoi that featured designs more typical of anime than the staple style of shows past. The series was aired as a family program rather than a children's program {{in an attempt to}} capture a wider audience, including those who might have <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>shows</b> but grown older. Because of this new market, this series also contains the oldest cast of main characters, ranging from late teens to early twenties.|$|R

After {{learning about the}} toxic leaks in the building, in which Frank, Toofer, and Lutz need to strip down, Frank says [...] "So much of my life was wasted creating hats!" [...] This is a reference to Judah Friedlander, who portrays Frank in the show and {{who is known for}} his trademark trucker hats which he wears {{in and out of the}} Frank character.

Liz reveals that she once participated in a reenactment on America's Most Wanted playing a woman who is strangled on a toilet. Jenna and Tracy, who are having strange dreams about Kenneth, decide they [...] "have to Elm Street this. We have to go to sleep and kill Kenneth in our dreams!" [...] This references the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, in which the movie's main character—Freddy Krueger—stalks and kills his victims in their dreams.|$|R
