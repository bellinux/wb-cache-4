5|$|Her musical {{influences}} {{were better}} expressed on Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, when she considered herself mature {{and was able}} to write and produce songs as she wished, without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> expectations of others. Knowles's lyrics tackle relationships, world issues, and deceased friends, with her second album focusing on events in her life, such as marriage, divorce, and parenthood. The album touched upon a variety of genres including pop-soul, psychedelic soul, electronica, and R.|$|E
5|$|Once in Vanilla Studios, {{the group}} began {{performing}} cover songs {{from a variety}} of genres, such as rockabilly, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, and reggae. In contrast to previous rehearsal sessions, the band kept these rehearsals private, and did not allow hangers-on to attend. This seclusion allowed the band to rebuild their confidence without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reaction from outsiders, who were familiar with the band's punk rock musical style.|$|E

5|$|Alan Brigman was the {{technical}} director and co-producer. He and Mike Woodroffe developed a game creation system, Adventure Graphic Operating System (AGOS) II, which facilitated {{the development of}} Simon the Sorcerer and enabled the team {{to focus on the}} gameplay and story without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> technical aspects. The system allowed the developers to input text commands on a separate monitor, and the engine could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text commands (a sentence parser carries them out), the loading of data as-needed, and functions could be implemented by the simple addition of commands. The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects. These tables contained animation code and information about what is supposed to happen. Alan Cox was also involved {{in the development of the}} AGOS engine, which is based on AberMUD.|$|E
5|$|At times, the coffers were full; in April 1764, {{near the}} end of the Paris sojourn and after two {{successful}} concerts, Leopold announced he would shortly be depositing 2,200 florins with his bankers. Two months later, after the initial London successes, Leopold banked a further 1,100 florins. However, in November of that year, after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects, he was <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> high costs of living in Londonhe informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1,870 florins in the four-month period since July. The following summer, after little concert activity, Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures to raise funds, including the children's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn at prices described by Jane Glover as humiliating. The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe, later, that Wolfgang was not worldly-wise enough to attempt such journeys alone, and needed to be anchored to an assured salary.|$|E
5|$|With the Autobots gone, the Decepticons {{launch a}} {{full-scale}} assault on New York City, randomly annihilating buildings and causing mayhem {{as part of}} a simultaneous galaxy-wide assault. The initial human aerial counterattack is annihilated. Even opposed by Colonel Daniel Witwicky, the Decepticons decimate all further military assaults and destroy all bridges and tunnels leading into the city. The Decepticon assault moves to other cities in the country, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., as the Constructicons begin to build in what was once Manhattan. On Cybertron, the dispirited and beaten Autobots begin to fall apart as Ironhide clashes with Prowl over the traitor in their midst. Another group of Autobots under Kup's command crashed on the planet after the Decepticons gained the access codes, where it is revealed that the situation is grave: Megatron has taken the Matrix. The humans attempt to send in a small commando team to assassinate Megatron, but the party is killed by Ratbat before even making across the river - all save their commander Spike. As the Decepticon assault spreads to other parts of Earth, the Decepticons begin to fall apart internally, with even Megatron <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> leadership challenges he will face now they have no enemy. The slaughter in Israel and Beijing worries other nations enough for them to contemplate using nuclear weapons on New York. On Cybertron the Swarm emerge, forcing the Autobots to flee once more.|$|E

25|$|Stamp {{collecting}} is {{a popular}} hobby. Collecting {{is not the same}} as philately, which is defined as the study of stamps. It is not necessary to closely study stamps in order to enjoy collecting them. Many casual collectors enjoy accumulating stamps without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> details. The creation of a valuable or comprehensive collection, however, may require some philatelic knowledge.|$|E

25|$|Males of {{some species}} {{are able to}} {{immobilize}} females and force copulation. In pigs and boars, males grab females and maneuver the pelvis to lift the vaginal opening and facilitate copulation. The stimulation following intromission causes the female to be immobilized. The male can then freely continue copulation without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> female escaping. Immobilization of the female also occurs in muscovy ducks.|$|E
25|$|Stamp {{collecting}} {{is generally}} accepted {{as one of}} the areas that make up the wider subject of philately, which is the study of stamps. A philatelist may, but does not have to, collect stamps. It is not uncommon for the term philatelist to be used to mean a stamp collector. Many casual stamp collectors accumulate stamps for sheer enjoyment and relaxation without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> tiny details. The creation of a large or comprehensive collection, however, generally requires some philatelic knowledge and will usually contain areas of philatelic studies.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{was born}} October 24, 1941 to Charlotte Keyes (n√©e Shachmann) and Scott Keyes. His {{father was a}} Quaker by choice {{and his mother was}} Jewish. Both were pacifists.

25|$|Meyer {{continued}} {{writing to}} the end chronologically, not <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> backstory. She lettered the chapters instead of numbering them, Chapter 13 being E. The last chapter of the first draft kept getting longer and longer, so she wrote epilogue after epilogue. However, {{she realized that she}} wanted to explore many of the events in the backstory and the reasons behind the events in the chapters, so she planned to write a 5-6 chapter backstory. Instead, these turned into twelve chapters {{by the time she was}} finished. In a matter of three months she had completed a novel. She has said she was writing for her own enjoyment, never thinking of publishing the work. She finished the manuscript on August 29, 2003.|$|E
25|$|The couple faced another hurdle when Brenda {{wanted to}} publish {{an article about}} the alarm of her {{pregnancy}} but Dylan objected, arguing that it was very personal. Typical of their relationship, Brenda and Dylan were once again reconciled after another dispute. In addition, Brenda was the victim of an armed robbery at the Peach Pit. This scene shocked her a lot and led her to see a psychologist, Dylan helped her a lot when she began to have nightmares about this event. Things get more serious when Brenda {{spends a lot of time}} with Dylan without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> limitations imposed by her parents. The latter invited her to a trip to Mexico and Brenda agrees, despite the formal prohibition of her father. The trip will be punctuated by a dispute and a passage at the customs where Brenda will realize that she does not have her passport and is therefore forced to phone her parents. When Brenda's parents are aware of her trip to Mexico with Dylan, the girl's father formally banned her from seeing him again. But she refuses to break and hides her relationship with Dylan.|$|E

A fervent Cantabrigian, Coke {{had a habit of}} naming Cambridge first, including in Parliament. When reminded that precedence belonged to Oxford [...] "by vote of the House," [...] Coke persisted in giving Cambridge primacy. [...] A Privy Councilor, Sir Thomas Edmondes, interrupted with a rebuke. It was reported that Coke suggested Edmondes not bother <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> primacy of Oxford or Cambridge, given that he had not attended either university.|$|E

[...] Prior to the eruption, her mother had traveled to Bogot√° on business.

After it hit, Omayra became trapped under her home's concrete and other debris and could not free herself. When rescue teams tried to help her, they realized that her legs were trapped under her house's roof. Sources differ as to the degree to which S√°nchez was trapped. Zeiderman (2009) said she was [...] "trapped up to her neck", while Barrag√°n (1987) said that she was trapped up to her waist.|$|E

[...] While <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> loss of originality of the franchise and noting that [...] "Harmony of Dissonance almost obsessively copies Symphony of the Night", GamePro called it [...] "a fun action game and a fine Castlevania game in its own right." [...] The improved graphics of Harmony of Dissonance, especially the backgrounds, 3D effects, and multi-jointed bosses, received praise from reviewers, who called them [...] "plentiful and visually stunning", and [...] "top-notch".|$|E
