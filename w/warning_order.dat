5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company {{arrived in}} Port Moresby from Australia on 2 August 1943. The unit {{had fought in}} Papua in 1942 in the Battle of Buna–Gona and had since {{conducted}} intensive training in Queensland. The company was {{under the command of}} Captain Gordon King, who had been its second in command at Buna. King received a <b>warning</b> <b>order</b> on 12 September alerting him to prepare for the capture of Kaiapit, and had access to detailed aerial photographs of the area.|$|E
5|$|From his {{headquarters}} in Tampa, Schwarzkopf began planning the operations to defend Saudi Arabia. Lieutenant General Charles Horner, USAF, ran the headquarters in Riyadh. Schwarzkopf planned supply lines for the 50,000 troops initially sent to Saudi Arabia, tapping Major General William G. Pagonis {{as director of}} the logistical operations, with U.S. Air Force cargo aircraft landing supplies at Dhahran and U.S. Navy ships offloading troops and supplies at Dammam. By August 20, 20,000 U.S. troops were in Saudi Arabia, with another 80,000 preparing to deploy, and a further 40,000 reserves tapped to augment them. Schwarzkopf arrived at the CENTCOM command in Riyadh on August 25, and on August 29 he conducted his first front-line tour of the potential combat zone, accompanied by reporters. Over the next several weeks, Schwarzkopf spoke frequently with both reporters and troops under his command, conducting many high-profile press conferences and updates to the situation in Saudi Arabia. Schwarzkopf worked to help coordinate the contributions of the different nations contributing military forces to the effort. By mid-October, Schwarzkopf indicated he was confident the forces were of a sufficient level that they could defend Saudi Arabia if it was attacked. Through October, Schwarzkopf and his command were occupied with setting up facilities and supply lines for the troops streaming into Saudi Arabia. He also worked to minimize the culture clash among foreigners in sharia-dominated Saudi Arabia, such as the high visibility of women in military roles. Schwarzkopf remained at his command in Riyadh through December, making frequent frontline visits to the troops. On December 29, 1990, he received a <b>warning</b> <b>order</b> from The Pentagon to be ready to attack into Iraq and Kuwait by January 17.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the right}} of 1st Australian Division was the 23rd Division, which {{followed}} {{the same pattern of}} planning and organisation. The <b>warning</b> <b>order</b> was issued on 3 September and the divisional plan issued on 6 September. Appendices followed from [...] with some amendments on 17 September. On 8 September X Corps instructed that divisional commanders were to take over their fronts on 13 September, before the divisions there were relieved by the attacking divisions and that brigade headquarters were to be taken over on 16 September. Intelligence gathering continued until the attack to amend plans. When aerial photographs showed that ground around Dumbarton Lakes, south of Inverness Copse was far muddier than expected, the plan was changed so that the infantry battalions sidestepped the marsh.|$|E

2500|$|Before the Fourth Army had {{captured}} Trônes Wood, Mametz Wood and Contalmaison, Rawlinson issued a <b>warning</b> <b>order</b> {{for an attack}} on the German second position and engineers and pioneers began to clear roads and fill in derelict trenches. Guns and ammunition were moved forward and the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) photographed the German second and third positions. With the corps commanders and artillery commanders, Rawlinson decided that the attack should begin at dawn, when there would be insufficient light for German machine-gunners to see far ahead. XIII Corps was to attack with two divisions from Longueval to Bazentin-le-Grand, after forming up in no man's land, [...] short of the German trenches. XV Corps was to attack from the north edge of Mametz Wood, on a front from Bazentin le Grand wood to Bazentin le Petit village and cemetery, where no man's land was much narrower. The 1st Division of III Corps was to attack further west as a flank guard.|$|E
2500|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the U.S. in time to participate in Fleet Week in New York and Independence Day celebrations in Boston, Massachusetts before receiving an [...] "All-hands" [...] recall on 28 July 1990, for Operation Desert Shield. The ship was empty of fuel, and ordnance and equipment as it was ready to join the yards for some SRA maintenance. Once the <b>Warning</b> <b>order</b> was issued, the ship went into 24-hour supplies replenishment procedures. She took on all the supplies and equipment she had just been offloading. She took on additional fuel and ordnance while crossing the Atlantic Ocean. [...] She departed the United States combat ready faster than any ship had accomplished since the Vietnam War. She departed on 10 August 1990, and became the flagship for {{the commander of the}} Red Sea Battle Force. At midnight on 17 January 1991 Kennedys Carrier Air Wing3 commenced the very first strike operations against Iraqi forces as part of Operation Desert Storm. Between the commencement of the operation and the cease-fire, Kennedy launched 114 airstrikes and nearly 2,900 sorties against Iraq, which delivered over 3.5million pounds of [...] On 27 February 1991 President George H. W. Bush declared a cease-fire in Iraq, and ordered all U.S. forces to stand down. Kennedy was relieved, and began the long journey home by transiting the Suez Canal.

2500|$|Green was {{conceived}} in early- to mid-1940 {{and the plan}} was drawn up in August 1940, under three weeks after Hitler issued his initial <b>warning</b> <b>order</b> for Operation Sea Lion on 16 July 1940. [...] The plan was widely circulated and even publicised during the period 1940–1941. [...] By 1942 Green had even made {{its way into the}} hands of the Irish military via the British military and was subsequently translated into English by Irish Military Intelligence G2 Branch. This has raised suspicion that intercepted 'chatter' about Green may have been aimed at creating a 'bogeyman' in the minds of British military planners on their western flank. [...] There was some truth to this; one example is Generalmajor Walter Warlimont's recollection from 28 June 1940 of an operational instruction issued by the High Command. [...] The directive was to mislead the enemy on a possible invasion of neutral Ireland using [...] "all available information media". [...] The intention was to spread rumours that German forces were preparing a landing in Ireland to place a further stranglehold on Britain, reinforcing the current [...] "siege". It is possible that these efforts heightened the state of alert and were a cause of alarm in Britain, leading to the British expending significant effort in trying to convince the Irish government to abandon neutrality and side with the Allies.|$|E
