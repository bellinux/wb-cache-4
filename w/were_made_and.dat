5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million <b>were</b> <b>made),</b> <b>and</b> the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E

5|$|Lion, Princess Royal and {{the rest}} of the battlecruisers reached Rosyth on the morning of 2 June where Lion began repairs that lasted until 19 July.

Princess Royal began repairs that lasted until 10 June.

5|$|Mills made {{large-scale}} {{changes to}} the squad over the summer of 2006, although a few months into 2006–07 more budget cuts <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>and</b> this limited his ability to add to a squad lacking in depth. When he left Alfreton they were 13th in the Conference North, and he was playing less frequently, making five appearances in 2006–07.|$|E

5|$|North American shipped {{spacecraft}} CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to {{be completed}} at KSC. But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>and</b> completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E
5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean was {{the first}} film {{released}} under the Walt Disney Pictures banner to be rated PG-13 by the MPAA; one executive noted that she found the film too intense for her five-year-old child. Nonetheless, the studio was confident enough to add The Curse of the Black Pearl subtitle to the film in case sequels <b>were</b> <b>made,</b> <b>and</b> to attract older children. Verbinski disliked the new title {{because it is the}} Aztec gold rather than the ship that is cursed, so he requested the title to be unreadable on the poster.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance humanism {{recognised}} no {{mutually exclusive}} polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies {{in science and}} engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work. These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). They <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>and</b> maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>and</b> the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence began calling witnesses.|$|E
5|$|By 20 December, {{arrangements}} for the delivery of emergency food and water supplies <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>and</b> expected to reach Carnarvon later that day. Supplies were also sent to outlying Aboriginal communities affected by the floods. After evacuating on 20 December, residents were {{allowed to return to}} their homes two days later in Carnarvon. However, most were left without power and clean water and required assistance from local agencies. Following the disaster, there were concerns that the Australian government could have prevented at least some of the floods by following through with a flood mitigation program. Dudley Maslen, the President of The Shire of Carnarvon stated that he did not want to place blame on any agency, though hoped for improvement during the future. More than 100 local government areas and regions were declared natural disaster areas on 21 December, encompassing areas from central Western Australia to the Pilbara coastline.|$|E
