[...] Capello was content with Milan's win, and believed his team were [...] "still about two months <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be." [...] It was his eighth trophy as manager of the club, one better than his predecessor Arrigo Sacchi. He said of the achievement: [...] "The mentality of this great club is passed on from the older players to the younger players, so they learn self-sacrifice and how to fight for every trophy they go for." ...|$|E

[...] Following the accident, Geffen Records and the band's manager pressured the group to hire another drummer and immediately go back to work. The band performed a few shows in Japan with drummer Chris Kontos, but when they declined to hire a long-term replacement, Geffen Records dropped them.|$|E
