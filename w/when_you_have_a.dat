25|$|Armstrong's view of {{knowledge}} is that the conditions {{of knowledge}} are satisfied <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> justified true belief that you arrived at through a reliable process: that is, the belief was caused by some factor in the external world (hence the label of externalism). Armstrong uses the analogy of a thermometer: as a thermometer changes to reflect {{the temperature of the}} environment it is in, so must one's beliefs if they are reliably formed. The connection between knowledge and the external world, for Armstrong, is a nomological relationship (that is, a law of nature relationship). Here, Armstrong's view is broadly similar to that of Alvin Goldman and Robert Nozick. The intuitions that lead to this kind of externalism led Alvin Plantinga towards an account of knowledge that added the requirement for 'properly-functioning' cognitive systems operating according to a design plan.|$|E

25|$|A {{general state}} of {{polarization}} launched into the medium {{can always be}} decomposed into two waves, one {{in each of those}} two polarizations, which will then propagate with different wavenumbers |k|. Applying the different phase of propagation to those two waves over a specified propagation distance will result in a generally different net polarization state at that point; this is the principle of the waveplate for instance. However, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wave launched into a birefringent material at non-normal incidence, the problem is yet more complicated since the two polarization components will now not only have distinct wavenumbers but the k vectors will not even be in exactly the same direction (see figure {{at the top of the}} page). In this case the two k vectors are rather solutions of eqn. 6 constrained by the boundary condition which requires that the components of the two transmitted waves' k vectors, and the k vector of the incident wave, as projected onto the surface of the interface must all be identical.|$|E

Warner Bros. sought to premiere the song on a popular rock radio station in Texas, but were turned down when the format refused to air the track—they told employees at the label to [...] "come back to us <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> melody in your song". The band then embarked on a short press tour through Europe {{in order to promote}} the record; it was during this time that KROQ-FM, a Los Angeles-based modern rock station, began to place [...] "Give It Away" [...] on heavy rotation.

500|$|Mass Effect 2 {{contains}} {{voices from}} 90 voice actors who play 546 characters and speak over 25,000 lines of dialogue. Voice recording {{for the game}} took {{twice as long as}} the original Mass Effect. The Unreal Engine 3's Matinee tool, which allows developers to animate characters during cinematics, was integrated into BioWare's own technology for digital acting and conversation. As Hudson explained, [...] "Our writers write into a dialogue editor and that becomes fused with the way that you end up seeing many different pieces of Matinee play out in combination <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> conversation with characters." [...] Another Unreal Engine 3 technology, Kismet, was used for scripting how levels or enemies would respond to a certain action. As the game's programmers were already familiar with the Unreal Engine 3 after using it on the first Mass Effect game, they did not feel the need to constantly communicate with Epic Games for support.|$|E

During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process.

Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race."

James Lawton's match report in The Independent was not as empathetic; although in praise of Henry's performance his indecision compared to Owen, demonstrated how [...] "effect, not style, is everything" [...] in football. Clive White of The Herald criticised Henry's lack of end product, using the final and Arsenal's European failure against Valencia to demonstrate how he would never be considered a [...] "natural goalscorer". Ron Atkinson, writing in his tactics column for The Guardian noted Liverpool's winning goal only came about because of Arsenal's eagerness to attack, which left gaps in defence.|$|E
