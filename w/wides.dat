5|$|As the 1934 season began, Allen was {{recovering}} from an operation to repair a rupture and played only once before that summer's Ashes series, in which Bob Wyatt captained England. Injury ruled {{him out of the}} second Test, but he was fit for the third. In a drawn game, he scored 61 runs but took no wickets; troubled by uneven footholds, he bowled three <b>wides</b> and four no balls during his first over, which lasted for 13 deliveries. He was selected for the fourth Test but, unhappy with his fitness, withdrew to play for Middlesex. He was successful in several games preceding the final, deciding Test, and was included in the team. Australia won comfortably after scoring 701 in their first innings; Allen took four for 170 and was wicketless in the second innings. In two Tests, he took five wickets at an average in excess of 70 and scored 106 runs at 35.33. In all first-class games that season he scored 438 runs at 25.76 and took 51 wickets at 27.49. Amid growing speculation that Allen would be chosen as the next England captain, Warner arranged for him to captain a low-key tour to Gibraltar in early 1935. During the return journey, Allen pulled a muscle when his ship pitched unexpectedly; the injury limited his cricket during 1935. He played twice before withdrawing {{from the rest of the}} season on medical advice. Off the field, Allen was elected to the MCC Committee at the unusually young age of 32.|$|E

Bermuda reached a total of 219 for 9, having been 88 for 7, and a fiery opening burst from 42-year-old Dennis Archer had the Scots worried. However, Cedric English and Gavin Hamilton steadied the ship, and the Scots {{eventually}} won by six wickets, making 222 for 4 in 46.5 overs.|$|E
