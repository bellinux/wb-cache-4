5|$|Decay {{was not a}} {{critical}} success, but was received with some positivity by video game journalists. Many reviewers felt the game <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> to play through with a friend, but that its more puzzle-oriented gameplay somewhat detracted from the overall experience. A number of reviews stated that the game simply felt {{little more than an}} extra add-on for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle.

Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E

5|$|Crytek then {{pitched the}} game to {{different}} publishers, and eventually, in 2009, the company pitched the two projects to Microsoft. According to Nick Button-Brown, the general manager at Crytek, the game was not functional at that time, and only served {{to prove to the}} publisher that a first-person melee game <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> for players. The representative from Microsoft, Phil Spencer, admired Crytek's intention to expand, and thought that Microsoft's games line up for the Xbox 360 was lacking a first-person melee-combat game. As a result, they accepted to publish Kingdoms, and rejected Kings. The two companies agreed that the project would be a natural fit for Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced Kinect.|$|E
5|$|Adam Cleveland at IGN called Revelations: The Demon Slayer a fun but not {{innovative}} game. The American game magazine Nintendo Power did however find it innovative; for instance, they {{cited the}} automatic battle option. Cleveland disliked the monster conversation system, which he found irritating; {{he said that}} players never know what answer they should give a monster, and that the questions the monsters ask feel monotone due to how often they are repeated. Writers for the Japanese game magazine Famitsu thought the monster fusion system <b>was</b> <b>fun.</b> In their review of Last Bible III, they commented on how different the game is from the Megami Tensei series, and instead compared it to Final Fantasy. Kurt Kalata and Christopher J. Snelgrove wrote for Hardcore Gaming 101 that while The Demon Slayer was {{not by any means}} an outstanding game, it was one of few competent role-playing games on Game Boy. They found Last Bible III to be the best game in the series.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake then {{attempt to}} find new homes. Initially {{they are unable to}} find a {{suitable}} home until they stumble upon a cave. They clean up the cave and hold a house-warming party, which Marceline crashes. She explains that the cave also belongs to her. Finn, having had enough starts a fight with Marceline, who grows into a huge demonic bat. After she seemingly kills Jake, Finn goes into a rage and violently punches Marceline, who promptly shape-shifts into her regular form and then kisses Finn on the cheek, making him blush. Jake—who was able to use his shape-shifting powers to save himself—runs over to Finn, and Marceline states that the fight they had <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> and {{that the two of them}} can have their old house back, as a gift. Once Finn and Jake return to their old abode, they are promptly hypnotized by King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada).|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} co-op mode highly but many disliked the single-player mode. Danielle Riendeau (Polygon) liked Monacos {{gameplay}} stating that it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> with other people, {{but it seemed}} that the single-player mode needed work. James Murff (GameFront) said the co-op was ridiculously fun and has good replayability. Marty Sliva (IGN) said that Monaco provided one of the best co-op experiences he'd had in a while. He stated that due to the gameplay and mechanics, {{it was one of the}} most unique and addictive games released in 2013. Scott Nichols (Digital Spy) said that the game contains lots to discover, but is best done cooperatively. Jeff Grubb (VentureBeat) praised the fact that the game works as both an arcade and a strategic game but said to skip it if the user wasn't planning on playing it cooperatively. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) liked the multiplayer mode more, but also praised the single-player mode calling it surprisingly compelling.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt it <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> to fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E

25|$|The game spawned many remakes, which {{received}} average to poor receptions. The Wii version obtained a 3 out of 10 from GameSpot, citing bland graphics, awkward controls and a confusing interface. Despite this, the reviewers {{stated that it}} could be a good educational tool. The game's iOS remake received a better reception, with a Metacritic score of 66/100. Multiplayer claimed the game <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> at first, but soon went downhill. They gave the game a 65/100.|$|E
25|$|Upon its release, Kiss Me Once {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. The {{majority of them}} complimented Minogue's charm and vocal delivery, alongside her return to contemporary pop music. However, critics were polarised towards the content and production; some felt the material <b>was</b> <b>fun,</b> but majority dismissed its memorability and felt it lacked innovation on Minogue's behalf. Commercially, the album performed moderately worldwide, and reached the top 10 in regions like Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, France, New Zealand, and Canada. The lack of commercial success for Kiss Me Once prompt Minogue to leave the company, citing artistic differences.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{reception}} of Robot was generally positive.

David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker, writing in The Television Companion, admired the performances of Nicholas Courtney and Elisabeth Sladen and felt Marter's debut as Harry Sullivan was promising. They also commended the K1 Robot costume, which was built by Allister Bowtell and designed by James Acheson. Howe and Walker, however, criticised the use of CSO (colour-separation overlay) effects for a number of shots involving the K1 Robot, as did Robert Cope.|$|E
