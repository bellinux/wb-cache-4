30|$|Energy {{consumption}} in wireless transmission {{system has been}} continuously increasing to cater for the explosive growth in demand for high-data-rate wireless applications and {{a wide variety of}} diverse quality of service (QoS) requirements during the last decade. Nowadays, the <b>wireless</b> <b>terminals</b> are usually powered by batteries. It is known that high-level energy consumption has a profound influence on the <b>wireless</b> <b>terminals</b> due to the limit of battery capacity. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} reduce energy consumption of the <b>wireless</b> <b>terminals</b> and increase energy efficiency (EE) [1 – 3]. Recently, a lot of advanced wireless communication techniques, such as relay technique [4, 5] and small cells [6], have been adopted to provide a significant capacity improvement and reduce the energy consumption. In order to further reduce the energy consumption, there is also a lot of research work focusing on the optimal power allocation [7, 8].|$|R

40|$|Cooperative {{communication}} {{is a recent}} paradigm for wireless relay networks wherein multiple <b>wireless</b> <b>terminals</b> share their resources to jointly transmit information {{of which they are}} not the source in order to achieve an improvement in overall performance. This is realized via the application of cooperative diversity techniques that take advantage of the spatial diversity offered by cooperation between <b>wireless</b> <b>terminals.</b> This dissertation addresses wireless relay networks with an arbitrary number of cooperating <b>wireless</b> <b>terminals,</b> arbitrary sets of communication links between pairs of cooperating terminals, and arbitrary numbers of antennas at each cooperating terminal.

50|$|CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) from TM {{is fixed}} {{wireless}} telephone service. It started in 2002 for PSTN service waiters and locations where TM has not laid the infrastructure for PSTN service yet. Starting 1 January 2003, {{the service was}} offered nationwide, not limited to niche customers only. It uses radio technology to enable caller to make and receive voice and data services. Wireless connections are based on radio frequency 450 MHz through Base Transceiver Station (BTS). CDMA service uses two types of access numbering; normal PSTN numbering (example 03-2240xxxx, 04-5422xxx, 07-8725xxx) and mobile numbering (011 - 18xxxxxx). Customer subscribing to PSTN numbering will be supplied with phone set called Fixed <b>Wireless</b> <b>Terminal</b> (FWT) as tool of communication, while 011 - 18xxxxxx customer will be using Mobile Fixed Wireless set to make calls. Customer with FWT will be provided with external antennae if needed, to enable the phone set to transfer voice or data {{in the form of}} radio frequency. Both FWT and Mobile Fixed Wireless phone sets require electric supply to function or charge the battery. CDMA can also provide SMS service.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ⎯ We {{consider}} a TDMA cellular multihop network where relaying – via <b>wireless</b> <b>terminals</b> {{that have a}} good communication link to the base station – {{is used as a}} coverage enhancement technique. Provided that the subscriber density is not very low, relaying via <b>wireless</b> <b>terminals</b> can {{have a significant impact on}} coverage, capacity, and throughput. This is mainly due to the fact that the signals only have to travel through shorter distances and/or improved line-ofsight paths. In this work, we investigated the effects of various relaying node selection (essentially a routing issue) and relaying channel selection schemes, as well as the effects of transmit power control, on system performance (these three selection/control schemes constitute the three major radio resource management decisions in peer-to-peer relaying in cellular networks). Our results show that with some modest intelligence incorporated in the relaying node selection scheme, the system coverage can be improved significantly through two-hop relaying. Furthermore, this improvement is observed to be fairly insensitive to the relaying channel selection scheme used, which is a plus in implementation. It is also observed that, as long as the number of <b>wireless</b> <b>terminals</b> in a cell is not very low, a minimal relaying node power level is sufficient to obtain most of the coverage enhancements...|$|R

40|$|In {{wireless}} network, it {{is often}} assumed that each individual <b>wireless</b> <b>terminal</b> or link will faithfully follow the prescribed protocols without any deviation – except, perhaps, for the faulty or malicious ones. Wireless terminals or links, often owned by individuals, will likely do what is most beneficial to their owners – act “selfishly”. Thus, it is more reasonable to expect that each selfish terminal will try to manipulate the algorithms or protocols for its owners ’ benefit, instead faithfully follow the designed protocols. Therefore, an algorithm or protocol intended for selfish wireless terminals or links must be designed. In this paper, we specifically study how to conduct efficient multicast in selfish wireless networks. We assume that each <b>wireless</b> <b>terminal</b> or communication link (called agent) will incur a cost when it transits some data, and the cost is known to the <b>wireless</b> <b>terminal</b> or communication link itself. For each of the widely used structures for multicast, we design a strategyproof multicast mechanism without using the well known VCG mechanism such that each agent has to truthfully report its cost to maximize its profit. Extensive simulations are conducted to study the practical performances of the proposed protocols regarding the actually network cost and total payment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{advocate}} {{the use of}} multiple base stations for providing wireless link to an OFDM–based terminal and thus obtain macro diversity, in particular site diversity. The wireless link to a terminal is defined through a subset of subcarriers that is optimized in a greedy manner over the union of base stations. The <b>wireless</b> <b>terminal</b> is unaware of how many and which base stations are providing its allocated set of sub–carrier, which simplifies the terminal design. We give an analytical comparison of our approach to the conventional solutions. The results show that the proposed schemes with multiple base stations can outperform the single base station case, while keeping the complexity of the <b>wireless</b> <b>terminal</b> unchanged. We further evaluate our schemes by considering minimize signalling over the air interface. I...|$|E
