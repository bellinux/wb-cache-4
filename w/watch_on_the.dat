5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1810 the French Navy made their first serious effort to contest British {{operations}} in the Adriatic, with the despatch of Bernard Dubourdieu from Toulon in Favorite. Dubourdieu {{was considered one of}} the more successful frigate commanders in the French Navy, and he collected the French and Italian forces scattered across the Adriatic into a squadron that significantly outnumbered Hoste's forces. Hoste was aware of Dubourdieu's movements and maintained a careful <b>watch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> French-led squadron in its base at Ancona.|$|E

5|$|An {{application}} to Parliament for a jetty {{in the following}} year was unsuccessful, but in 1860 the Upsall, Normanby & Ormesby Railway received permission for a line with access to the river, the S claim of exclusive rights to the foreshore having been rejected. The jetty was also opposed by the Tees Conservancy Commissioners and they moored barges along the foreshore to obstruct construction. In {{what became known as the}} Battle of the Tees, a fight broke out when a steam tug sent by the Commissioners interrupted men moving the barges. The barges were successfully moved, but a more serious fight developed the following night when three of the Commissioners' steam tugs arrived. The police then kept <b>watch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> works until they were finished.|$|E
5|$|Despite these reverses, {{in early}} 1261, Emperor Michael VIII {{set his sights}} on {{capturing}} the great prize: Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, which had been the seat of the Latin Empire since its capture by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. To this end, Michael concluded an alliance with Genoa in March, and in July 1261, as the one-year truce concluded after the previous failed Nicaean attack was nearing its end, Strategopoulos, recently released from Epirote custody, was sent with a small advance force of 800 soldiers (most of them Cumans) to keep a <b>watch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarians and spy out the defences of the Latins.|$|E

The force increased to 70 aircraft in eight flights as the year progressed. Operations were carried out in the Atlantic, over Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea. In November, PR units operated from Gibraltar in support of Operation Torch, the Allied landing in French North Africa.

5|$|The crop produce {{from these}} {{plantations}} were generally exported {{to other countries}} from Singapore {{with the assistance of}} Chinese merchants based in that city. From the 1860s onwards, many of these Kangchu chalked up debts and began to sell their property rights to these merchants or to larger business magnates (Kongsi in Teochew) based in Singapore, who were known to the locals as Tuan Sungai (literally Masters of the River). The Kangchu then were often hired as supervisors or managers by the merchants to keep <b>watch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day-to-day operations of the gambier and pepper plantations. Temenggong Abu Bakar began to issue contract-style letters of recognition to these Kangchu; the letters were known by their Malay name Surat Tauliah.|$|E

Additionally, the tropical storm warning was discontinued {{from the mouth of}} the Suwannee River to Tarpon Springs. Early on August27, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of Florida was discontinued for areas lying north of the Jupiter Inlet. Six hours later, the tropical storm warning on the east coast of Florida was lifted from the Jupiter Inlet southward to Ocean Reef, including Lake Okeechobee. At 1500UTC, all of the remaining watches and warnings for South Florida were cancelled. On August28, the tropical storm warning in the Florida Panhandle was discontinued for areas east of Destin.

5|$|Around 1960, ANAK held {{a series}} of secret dinner {{meetings}} with the families of Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr. and Lawrence Michael Williams, Georgia Tech's first three African American students. The goal of these meetings, facilitated through the Georgia Tech YMCA, was to discuss the range of potential situations that could arise when the three students enrolled at Georgia Tech the following year, as well as appropriate reactions to each of these situations. When Greene, Long, and Williams enrolled in the fall semester of 1961, ANAK members discreetly kept a close <b>watch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> three students for the first two weeks to ensure their safety. As a result of ANAK's efforts and those of other Institute and city organizations, none of the students was involved in any serious incident, paving the way for continued peaceful racial integration.|$|E
5|$|As Tropical Depression Five-E {{approached}} Mexico, the country's government released {{tropical storm}} watches and warnings for {{certain parts of}} the coastline. When the tropical depression formed on July 5, the government issued a tropical storm warning from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Other interests in the Pacific Ocean were asked {{to keep an eye on}} the developing depression. The morning of July 6, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. The earlier tropical storm warning remained in effect, for another six hours, when the warning was demoted into a tropical storm <b>watch.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> afternoon of July 6, the government discontinued the tropical storm watch up to Acapulco. The remaining tropical storm watch was discontinued on July 7, after the tropical depression had made landfall and began to weaken. The government's weather center also released thirteen tropical cyclone bulletins and four warnings for personal caution.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of 1945, monsoonal weather in Darwin reduced the number of {{missions}} flown by No.76 Wing. On the night of 5/6April, three Catalinas kept <b>watch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Japanese cruiser Isuzu, which was subsequently struck by Allied bombers and sunk by submarines. During the month, the Catalinas mined Hong Kong harbour, as well as targets on the coast of mainland China, flying up to sixteen hours per mission. On 26May, they undertook the RAAF's most northerly operation during the Pacific War, against Wenchow. The same month, Group Captain Stuart Campbell, former leader of No.42 Squadron, took over command of the wing. In May–June, reinforced by a detachment from No.11 Squadron, No.76 Wing flew mining and bombing missions in support of the forthcoming Operation Oboe Six, the Battle of North Borneo, and Oboe Two, the Battle of Balikpapan. Before Oboe Six, while some of the Catalinas concentrated on mining the approaches to Surabaya harbour, others bombed airfields in Java and Celebes in concert with RAAF B-24 Liberators. The Catalinas and Liberators combined again in the lead-up to Oboe Two to raid any Japanese airfields that could threaten Balikpapan, in some cases bombing the same target around the clock, the Catalinas by night and Liberators by day.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} {{might well}} have continued until the spring thaw had the German High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht) not launched Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein (Operation <b>Watch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Rhine) on 16 December 1944. The land offensive was to improve the German military position by capturing Antwerp and separating the British Army from United States Army forces. Part of the planning for the German land operation required the attack to be conducted {{under the cover of}} bad winter weather, which kept the main Allied asset, the Tactical Air Forces, on the ground. It initially succeeded, but the weather also grounded the Luftwaffe for the most part. Nevertheless, the Luftwaffe did manage to put 500 aircraft into the air on 16 December, more than had been achieved for a long time. This first day had been the originally planned date for the strike against Allied airfields, named Operation Bodenplatte. However, the weather proved particularly bad and operations were shut down.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Moors {{had invaded}} Byzacena and {{defeated}} the local Byzantine garrison, killing its commanders, Gainas and Rufinus. After diplomatic entreaties {{over the winter}} failed, and with his forces bolstered to some 18,000 men (as estimated by Charles Diehl) following the arrival of reinforcements, in spring 535 Solomon led his troops into Byzacena. The Moors, under their chiefs Cutzinas, Esdilasas, Iourphouthes and Mesidinissas had encamped at a location called Mammes. Solomon attacked them there and defeated them. The Byzantine army returned to Carthage, but there news came that the Moors, reinforced, had again attacked and overrun Byzacena. Solomon immediately marched out and met them at Mount Bourgaon, where the Moors had erected a fortified camp and awaited his attack. Solomon divided his forces and sent 1,000 men to attack the Moors from behind, scoring a decisive victory: the Moors broke and scattered, suffering great casualties. Those who survived fled to Numidia, where they joined the forces of Iaudas, {{the leader of the}} tribes of Mount Aurasium. With Byzacena secured, and urged by his own Moorish allies Massonas and Ortaias, Solomon now turned to Numidia. He cautiously advanced to Aurasium and challenged Iaudas to battle, but after three days, distrusting the loyalty of his allies, Solomon returned his army to the plains. He left part of the army to keep <b>watch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moors and established a series of fortified posts along the roads linking Byzacena with Numidia. Solomon then spent the winter preparing a new expedition against Aurasium and also against the Moors of Sardinia, but his designs were interrupted by a major army mutiny in spring 536.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Bhimsen {{was able}} to {{continue}} making all the administrative decisions of the country, while the Regent Queen Tripurasundari would unquestioningly approve these decisions by stamping the royal seal issued {{in the name of}} King Rajendra on these government orders. The Regent never dared to express any doubts regarding Bhimsen's decisions. Nevertheless, {{to make sure that the}} King, his wives – Samrajya Laxmi Devi (senior) and Rajya Lakshmi Devi (junior) – and the Regent were insulated from influences of people other than Bhimsen and his closest relatives, Bhimsen had instated his youngest brother, General Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the royal palace to keep a <b>watch</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> royal family and to keep guard against any outside person. Any priest or courtier who wished to be granted an interview with the King, the Queens, or the Regent, had to get an approval from Ranbir Singh and the interview had to be conducted under his watchful presence. Similarly, the royal family were not allowed to leave the palace without Bhimsen's permission either. Bhimsen had also neglected the formal education of Rajendra, due to which he had grown to be uncritical and weak minded to the extent that he was even unaware that he was virtually a prisoner. However, his wives were more alert and wary of Bhimsen since, according to Baburam Acharya, they received unfiltered news of the world outside the royal palace from their handmaidens, who would leave the palace compounds and go to their homes during their menstruation and gather news and rumors of the day, which they would then relate to the Queens.|$|E
