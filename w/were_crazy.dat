They spent their pre-season playing in Scotland and England where they won all seven matches. Carl Hoeft said of the pre-season; [...] "Looking back now, it's safe to say it wasn't probably the best way we could have prepared. Even now, people think <b>were</b> <b>crazy</b> when I tell them what we did". They were now coached by Glenn Ross and captained by Taine Randell. Their eight defeats that season included a 7543 defeat by Natal in Durban. The points scored by Natal included 50 points by Gavin Lawlessa competition record. Their three victories that season included defeating the Canterbury Crusaders at Carisbrook, and the Waikato Chiefs at Taupowhere Doug Howlett scored three tries for the Highlanders.|$|E

She was a fan of the show, and she was willing to do all the lines. It was all the people around her that <b>were</b> <b>crazy,</b> the management and all that. We originally had her introduce herself [...] as 'I'm teenage songbird Britney Spears.' And she recorded a few takes and they were fine. And suddenly, all these guys come rushing in [...] 'She can't say songbird.' [...] what's wrong with songbird? And they were somehow convinced that it was some sort of slam or an insult." [...] The staff members were therefore forced to change her opening line to [...] "I'm teen sensation Britney Spears." ...|$|E

He is close to his family, and noted that he started playing baseball around age five or six, with his first experience being playing in the back yard with his father and brother. When he was first called up to the major leagues, he noted, [...] "Emotions <b>were</b> <b>crazy.</b> Trying to hold back tears seeing your parents in the stands for the first time was tough, then playing on top of that made it a little crazy to start. But that is all part of it. I think the phone call I got to make to my parents the day I was called up was the most memorable part ..." ...|$|E

500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>crazy.</b> We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E

2500|$|The novel's title {{refers to}} a plot device that is {{repeatedly}} invoked in the story. Catch-22 starts {{as a set of}} paradoxical requirements whereby airmen mentally unfit to fly did not have to do so, but could not actually be excused. According to the novel, people who <b>were</b> <b>crazy</b> were not obliged to fly missions, but anyone who applied to stop flying was showing a rational concern for his safety and was, therefore, sane and had to fly. By the end of the novel, it is invoked as the explanation for many unreasonable restrictions. The phrase [...] "Catch-22" [...] has since entered the English language, referring to a type of unsolvable logic puzzle sometimes called a double bind.|$|E
2500|$|Foley and McDonald {{played two}} clearly insane people (although they always {{introduced}} themselves as [...] "not two clearly insane people"), who wore large wigs and {{identified themselves as}} Jerry Sizzler and Jerry Sizzler, the Sizzler Sisters. They were usually seen doing insane things, such as posing as a capella lounge singers, robbing a bank {{in order to make}} a deposit and then forcing people to mix up their shoes. In one sketch, Foley's character (whose real name is revealed to be Lister) has become sane through medication and is happily married. McDonald's character (whose real name is revealed to be Jean-Pierre) comes to Lister's apartment and urges him into become insane again, causing him stress and then withholding his medication. McDonald mentioned in an interview that he and Foley thought up the characters while running through the Kathie and Cathy beauty pageant sketch ("T.G.I.N.P.!"). Because they were bored, they started improvising that they <b>were</b> <b>crazy</b> people who escaped from an asylum; using the wigs (that they were wearing as background pageant contestants in the sketch) as their [...] "disguises". They wrote the Sizzler & Sizzler sketch shortly thereafter.|$|E

To satisfy America's appetite for their music, the band re-released their eponymous first album in the US {{in the middle of}} the year with the addition of the new single [...] "Is There Something I Should Know?". Upon its release, this song entered the chart at number 1 in the UK (a rarity then and their first chart-topper in their home country) and reached number 4 on the American charts. During the promotion of this album, Rhodes and Le Bon were MTV guest VJs for a show, during which artist and admirer Andy Warhol dropped by to greet them. [...] "Our first gigs in the United States <b>were</b> <b>crazy</b> and culty", Rhodes said later, [...] "But when we came back after 'Hungry' was a hit, it was mayhem. It was Beatlemania. We were doing a signing of the 'Girls on Film' video at a store in Times Square. We couldn't get out of the store. The cops sealed off the streets." [...] Also in 1983, keyboardist Nick Rhodes produced the UK number 1 and US number 5 hit [...] "Too Shy" [...] for the English band Kajagoogoo and Andy Taylor became the first member of Duran Duran to get married.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was only}} one catch and that was Catch-22, which {{specified}} that a concern for one's safety {{in the face of}} dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> and could <b>be</b> grounded. All {{he had to do was}} ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer <b>be</b> <b>crazy</b> and would have to fly more missions. Orr would <b>be</b> <b>crazy</b> to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he <b>was</b> <b>crazy</b> and didn't have to, but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5) ...|$|R
