500|$|In Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri punctuation, various {{combinations}} of dots {{were used as}} word dividers and to separate phrases, clauses, and paragraphs. In monumental inscriptions and manuscripts of 5th to 10th centuries, these were written as dashes, like , = and =. In the 10th century, clusters of one (·), two (:), three (...) and six (჻჻) dots (later sometimes small circles) were introduced by Ephrem Mtsire to indicate increasing breaks in the text. One dot indicated a [...] "minor stop" [...] (presumably a simple <b>word</b> <b>break),</b> two dots marked or separated [...] "special words", three dots for a [...] "bigger stop" [...] (such as the appositive name and title [...] "the sovereign Alexander", below, or {{the title of the}} Gospel of Matthew, above), and six dots were to indicate the end of the sentence. Starting in the 11th century, marks resembling the apostrophe and comma came into use. An apostrophe was used to mark an interrogative word, and a comma appeared {{at the end of an}} interrogative sentence. From the 12th century on, these were replaced with the semicolon (the Greek question mark). In the 18th century, Patriarch Anton I of Georgia reformed the system again, with commas, single dots, and double dots used to mark [...] "complete", [...] "incomplete", and [...] "final" [...] sentences, respectively. For the most part, Georgian today uses the punctuation as in international usage of the Latin script.|$|E

5000|$|The {{causes of}} {{dyslexia}} are not agreed upon, although {{the consensus of}} neuroscientists believe dyslexia is a phonological processing disorder and that dyslexics have reading difficulties because {{they are unable to}} see or hear a <b>word,</b> <b>break</b> it down to discrete sounds, and then associate each sound with letter/s that make up the word.

50|$|In Greek Homeric poetry (not in Latin), also, hexameters {{have two}} bridges, {{places where there}} very rarely is a break in a word-unit. The first, known as Meyer's Bridge (or Law), is in the second foot: if the second foot is a dactyl, the two short syllables {{generally}} {{will be part of}} the same word-unit. Stated another way, an iambic word (like θεά at Il. 1.1) should not precede the midline caesura. The second, known as Hermann's Bridge, is the same rule in the fourth foot: if the fourth foot is a dactyl, the two short syllables generally {{will be part of the}} same word-unit. Even in Homer, these bridges are not prescriptive: the first line of the Iliad violates Meyer's Bridge (Μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος) since there is a <b>word</b> <b>break</b> between ἄειδε and θεὰ.|$|E
