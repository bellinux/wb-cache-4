5|$|In October 1931 Prime Minister Niceto Alcalá Zamora {{resigned}} and was succeeded by Manuel Azaña. Radical Party leader Alejandro Lerroux had <b>wanted</b> <b>that</b> job himself and became alienated, switching his party's {{support to the}} opposition. This left Azaña dependent on the Socialists, but both the Socialists, who favoured reform, and the conservative right, who were against reform, were critical of the government. Socialists continued to support Azaña, but the left became fractured, driving the Socialists to the left, while the right united into CEDA, which tacitly embraced fascism.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Scamper {{sustained}} a cut to his coronet band {{at the beginning}} of the NFR. James recalled how the wound caused her to change Scamper's normal conditioning routine, which cost the pair a few go-round wins; but they still managed to win the world championship title with $96,651 in season earnings. In 1993, James and Scamper qualified for the NFR yet again. James also set her sights on a tenth WPRA World Championship title and recalled how anxious she felt under such pressure. She <b>wanted</b> <b>that</b> win so she could retire Scamper undefeated while he was still in his prime. That year, the pair won both the NFR and WPRA world championships, securing Scamper's place in barrel racing history.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter standing alone {{in the middle of}} the street. MacLaren <b>wanted</b> <b>that</b> shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's helplessness, insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for that shot. Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the crane shot was the first one they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and gaffer Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing up, then Walter standing up, then Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising. The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Samuel Maverick ever owned any other cattle and no other stock at all, beyond a few horses. One can reasonably doubt that a man who was not in the cattle business and who did not work with or live near his herd would have been engaged in branding strays.

25|$|But in {{this right}} moment, Görgei {{learned that the}} enemy just took Királyrév. This {{happened}} when he sent the orders to his cavalries to attack, and during the strong advancement of his right wing. Because of this he went personally with two infantry battalions and two cannons of the Hungarian II. corps {{to take back the}} village. Görgei wanted also to see if it is any enemy troops coming from the direction of Csallóköz. After he saw that his troops will not be attacked from there - because Klapka managed to hold the position there, he returned to the main battlefield, letting the two infantry battalions which he had led to Királyrév to continue the assault on the village. When he was returning, he saw that the attack of the cavalry of the III. corps on the right wing failed, and they were retreating, he understood that his plan of turning back the front line in the original position did not succeeded. Now he wanted to obtain this goal ordering the retreat of the infantry of the III. corps. He <b>wanted</b> <b>that</b> his troops to resist in Pered until the hoped arrival of Nagysándor's I. corps, which could decide the outcome of the battle in the favor of the Hungarians. He hoped to hold the village {{with the help of the}} III. corps of Leiningen, who retreated towards there. But when görgei arrived to Pered, saw that Colonel Kászonyi already ordered the retreat of the II. corps, and in the village he found only the cavalry of the III. corps. Görgei had no choice, than to position the III. and II. corps infantries behind Pered in order to hold themselves there. To hold their new front line successfully, Görgei ordered that Leiningen's III. corps cavalry division and four battalions to stop the advancement of the imperial cavalry from the right side of the enemy center, and the cavalry of the II. division which previously were held back by the Russian infantry division, to attack the enemy troops advancing from the extreme right wing of Wohlgemuth's army, in order to ease the tasks of the II. corps infantry and the III. corps cavalry. He also ordered, that if the III. corps would be pushed back, it can retreat only to Zsigárd, where they should take the artillery of the II. corps, which retreated there because their shortage of ammunition, and to hold there until Királyrév is recaptured. Colonel Kászonyi with the II. corps had to defend the III. corps left from an encirclement and to keep the contact with the troops from Királyrév. If this village would be reoccupied, than the two Hungarian corps had to start another offensive, helped by the troops from Királyrév. This was Görgei's new plan.|$|E
