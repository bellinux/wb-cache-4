6000|$|Not {{without a}} mournful {{interest}} have <b>we</b> <b>surveyed</b> that authentic {{image of a}} Time now wholly swallowed. Mournful reflections crowd on us;--and yet consolatory. How many brave men have lived before Agamemnon! Here is a brave governor Samson, a man fearing God, and fearing nothing else; of whom as First Lord of the Treasury, as King, Chief Editor, High Priest, we could be so glad and proud; of whom nevertheless Fame has altogether forgotten to make mention! The faint image of him, revived in this hour, {{is found in the}} gossip of one poor Monk, and in Nature nowhere else. Oblivion had so nigh swallowed him altogether, even to the echo of his ever having existed. What regiments and hosts and generations of such has Oblivion already swallowed! Their crumbled dust makes up the soil our life-fruit grows on. Said I not, as my old Norse Fathers taught me, The Life-tree Igdrasil, which waves round thee in this hour, whereof thou in this hour art portion, has its roots down deep in the oldest Death-Kingdoms; and grows; the Three Nornas, or Times, Past, Present, Future, watering it from the Sacred Well! ...|$|E
6000|$|Up to {{a certain}} age my {{experiences}} at school were precisely those which I have described. Our grammar was not so philological, abstruse and arid as the instruments of torture employed at present. But I hated Greek with a deadly and sickening hatred; I hated it like a bully and a thief of time. The verbs in [Greek text] completed my intellectual discomfiture, and Xenophon routed me with horrible carnage. I could have run away to sea, but for a strong impression that a life on the ocean wave [...] "did not set my genius," [...] as Alan Breck says. Then we began to read Homer; and {{from the very first}} words, in which the Muse is asked to sing the wrath of Achilles, Peleus' son, my mind was altered, and I was the devoted friend of Greek. Here was something worth reading about; here one knew where one was; here was the music of words, here were poetry, pleasure, and life. We fortunately had a teacher (Dr. Hodson) who was not wildly enthusiastic about grammar. He would set us long pieces of the Iliad or Odyssey to learn, and, when the day's task was done, would make us read on, adventuring ourselves in [...] "the unseen," [...] and construing as gallantly as we might, without grammar or dictionary. On the following day <b>we</b> <b>surveyed</b> more carefully the ground we had pioneered or skirmished over, and then advanced again. Thus, to change the metaphor, we took Homer in large draughts, not in sips: in sips no epic can be enjoyed. We now revelled in Homer like Keats in Spenser, like young horses let loose in a pasture. The result was not the making of many accurate scholars, though a few were made; others got nothing better than enjoyment in their work, and the firm belief, opposed to that of most schoolboys, that the ancients did not write nonsense. To love Homer, as Steele said about loving a fair lady of quality, [...] "is a liberal education." ...|$|E
60|$|We did not {{penetrate}} its perspective, for {{it seems}} {{one of the}} few things at Hampton Court barred to the public. Everywhere else the place is free to the visitor, who may walk as he pleases on its garden-paths, or over its close-woven turf, or sit out of the sun under its dense black yews, or stroll beneath the oaks by the banks of the Long Canal. If the canal is Dutch, the burly trees which lounge about at their pleasure in the park, impart the true English sentiment to the scene; but, for my part, I did not care to go far from the borders of the beds of hyacinths and tulips and daffodils. The grass sighed with secret tears under the foot, and it was better to let the fancy, which would not feel the need of goloshes, rove disembodied to the bosky depths into which the oaks thickened afar, dim amid the vapor-laden air. From the garden-plots one could look, dry-shod, down upon the Thames, along which the pretty town of Hampton stretches, and in whose lively current great numbers of house-boats tug at their moorings. The Thames beside the palace is not only swift but wide, and from the little flowery height on which <b>we</b> <b>surveyed</b> these very modernest of pleasure-craft they had a remove at which they were lost in an agreeable mystery. Even one which we were told belonged to a rich American could not alienate itself from the past when there were no United States, and very few united colonies. The poorest American, if he could not have a lodgement in the palace (and I do not see how the royal bounty could extend to one of our disinherited condition), or one of the pleasant Hampton houses overlooking the river, might be glad to pass the long, mild English summer, made fast to the willowy bank of the Thames, without mosquitoes or malaria to molest him or make him afraid in his dreamful sojourn.|$|E

60|$|One fifteenth of June two {{children}} sat with bated breath in the pinnace,--Dorothy Manners and myself. Mistress Dolly was then as mischievous a little baggage as ever she proved afterwards. She {{was coming to}} pass {{a week at the}} Hall, her parents, whose place was next to ours, having gone to Philadelphia on a visit. We rounded Kent Island, which lay green and beautiful in the flashing waters, and at length caught sight of the old windmill, with its great arms majestically turning, and the cupola of Carvel House shining white among the trees; and of the upper spars of the shipping, with sails neatly furled, lying at the long wharves, where the English wares Mr. Carvel had commanded for the return trips were unloading. Scarce was the pinnace brought into the wind before I had leaped ashore and greeted with a shout the Hall servants drawn up in a line on the green, grinning a welcome. Dorothy and I scampered over the grass and into the cool, wide house, resting awhile on the easy sloping steps within, hand in hand. And then away for that grand tour of inspection we had been so long planning together. How well I recall that sunny afternoon, when the shadows of the great oaks were just beginning to lengthen. Through the greenhouses we marched, monarchs of all <b>we</b> <b>surveyed,</b> old Porphery, the gardener, presenting Mistress Dolly with a crown of orange blossoms, for which she thanked him with a pretty courtesy her governess had taught her. Were we not king and queen returned to our summer palace? And Spot and Silver and Song and Knipe, the wolf-hound, were our train, though not as decorous as rigid etiquette demanded, since they were forever running after the butterflies. On we went through the stiff, box-bordered walks of the garden, past the weather-beaten sundial and the spinning-house and the smoke-house to the stables. Here old Harvey, who had taught me to ride Captain Daniel's pony, is equerry, and young Harvey our personal attendant; old Harvey smiles as we go {{in and out of the}} stalls rubbing the noses of our trusted friends, and gives a gruff but kindly warning as to Cassandra's heels. He recalls my father at the same age.|$|E

About the year 1820, the [...] eloquence of Dr. Edward Irving drew crowds to his church in London, [...] which was presbyterian. It required careful previous arrangements [...] to secure comfortable accommodation. The preacher was solemn, [...] majestic (notwithstanding the squint), and impressive; carrying all [...] the appearance of devoted earnestness. My father had on a certain [...] occasion, when I was still a small Eton boy, taken time by the [...] forelock, and secured the use of a convenient pew in the first rank [...] of the gallery. From this elevated situation <b>we</b> <b>surveyed</b> at ease [...] and leisure the struggling crowds below. The crush was everywhere [...] great, but greatest of all in the centre aisle. Here the mass of [...] human beings, mercilessly compressed, swayed continually backwards [...] and forwards. There was I, looking down with infinite complacency [...] and satisfaction from this honourable vantage ground upon the floor [...] of the church, filled and packed as one of our public meetings is, [...] with people standing and pushing. What was my emotion, my joy, my [...] exultation, when I espied among this humiliated mass, struggling [...] and buffeted--whom but Keate! Keate the master of our existence, [...] the tyrant of our days! Pure, unalloyed, unadulterated rapture! [...] Such a [Greek: peripeteia], such a reversal of human conditions of being, [...] as that now exhibited between the Eton lower boy uplifted to the [...] luxurious gallery pew, and the head-master of Eton, whom I was [...] accustomed to see in the roomy deck of the upper school with vacant [...] space and terror all around him, it must be hard for any one to [...] conceive, except the two who were the subjects of it. Never, never, [...] have I forgotten that moment.[32] ...|$|E
