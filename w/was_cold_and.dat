5|$|After leaving False Bay on 1 July, Bounty set {{out across}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Tasmania. They passed the remote Île Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, {{but he did not}} attempt a landing. The weather <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Tasmania and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Gascoignes' third child, {{daughter}} Hester, was born. Like many Observatory personnel, the Gascoignes {{lived in}} a staff residence on Mount Stromlo, which was a long difficult trip away from Canberra. It <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> lonely, particularly for Rosalie, but they enjoyed the outdoors, and the landscape inspired Rosalie's creativity and later her artistic career. In 1960 they relocated to Deakin in suburban Canberra, and in the late 1960s they moved to another suburb, Pearce.|$|E

Unfortunately the Indra Club (64 Grosse Freiheit) was closed, so a manager from a {{neighbouring}} club found someone to open it up, and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves. The group played at the club on the same night, but were told they could sleep in a small cinema's storeroom, which <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> in very poor condition, the Bambi Kino (33 Paul-Roosen Strasse).|$|E

5|$|The pitch was slow, and {{the weather}} <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> showery for the {{traditional}} tour opener against Worcestershire. Worcester attracted a record attendance of 32,000 with takings of more than ₤4000. The hosts elected to bat, and started strongly as a century second-wicket stand took them to 137/1 after 133 minutes. However, the dismissal of Charles Palmer, who top-scored with 85, precipitated a collapse and they lost their last nine wickets in two hours to be all out for 233. Five Australian bowlers shared the wickets, with Johnson taking 3/52. In their sole innings, Australia took the initiative from the outset through a 166-run second-wicket stand between Morris (138) and Bradman (107). This took them to 265/1, before they declared at 462/8 after Miller had hit an unbeaten 50 in faster than even time. Off spinner Peter Jackson took 6/135 for the locals. In their second innings Worcestershire were bowled out by Australia for 212 runs, with 70 minutes to spare. McCool took 4/29 as the spinners took eight of the wickets.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr {{was filmed}} between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer {{believed}} {{it would be}} beneficial by lending the dream-like ghost world of the film as well as allowing them to save money by not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was kept to a minimum. For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond to the voices {{that were going to}} be recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for the cast and crew during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as it <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm.|$|E

Almond is warned by Finch that Surridge {{will be the last}} of V's targets and goes to her house to prevent him but is killed by V. Almond is replaced by Peter Creedy. His death sets in motion one of the novel's major story arcs; that of his widow, Rose, who is left penniless and traumatised by the loss of her husband, who <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> abusive toward her but whom she nevertheless loved. In her grief and desperation, she blames her plight on Norsefire's leader, Adam Susan, and assassinates him at the novel's climax.|$|E
25|$|Maugham {{was sent}} to the UK to be cared for by his uncle, Henry MacDonald Maugham, the Vicar of Whitstable, in Kent. The move was damaging. Henry Maugham <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> emotionally cruel. The boy {{attended}} The King's School, Canterbury, which was also difficult for him. He was teased for his bad English (French had been his first language) and his short stature, which he inherited from his father. Maugham developed a stammer that stayed with him all his life, although it was sporadic, being subject to his moods and circumstances. Miserable both at his uncle's vicarage and at school, the young Maugham developed a talent for making wounding remarks to those who displeased him. This ability is sometimes reflected in Maugham's literary characters.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} February 1924, Charles and Geoffrey Bruce, Norton and Shebbeare {{arrived in}} Darjeeling where they {{selected}} the porters from Tibetans and Sherpas. They once again engaged the Tibetan born Karma Paul for translation purposes and Gyalzen for sardar (leader of the porters) and purchased food and material. At the end of March 1924, all expedition members were assembled and the journey to Mount Everest began. They followed the same route as the 1921 and 1922 expeditions. To avoid overloading the dak bungalows, they travelled in two groups and arrived in Yatung {{at the beginning of}} April. Phari Dzong was reached on 5 April. After negotiations with Tibetan authorities, {{the main part of the}} expedition followed the known route to Kampa Dzong while Charles Bruce and a smaller group chose an easier route. During this stage, Bruce was crippled with malaria and was forced to relinquish his leadership role to Norton. On 23 April the expedition reached Shekar Dzong. They arrived at the Rongbuk Monastery on 28 April, some kilometres from the planned base camp. The Lama of Rongbuk Monastery was ill and could not speak with the British members and the porters or perform the Buddhist puja ceremonies. The following day the expedition reached the location of the base camp at the glacier end of the Rongbuk valley. Weather conditions were good during the approach but now the weather <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> snowy.|$|E

500|$|Pickett lamented his men, lost {{in great}} number at Gettysburg. Late in his life, Colonel John S. Mosby, {{who had served}} under General J. E. B. Stuart, was present when Lee and Pickett met briefly after the war. [...] He claimed their {{interaction}} <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> reserved. Others present at the meeting disputed this, stating Lee only acted in his usual reserved and gentlemanly fashion. Pickett, Mosby said, complained bitterly after this meeting, saying to Mosby: [...] "That man destroyed my division." [...] Mosby allegedly replied [...] "Yes, but he made you immortal." [...] Most historians find the encounter as Mosby interpreted it unlikely. Asked by reporters why Pickett's Charge failed, Pickett frequently replied: [...] "I've always thought the Yankees {{had something to do}} with it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ambulance}} crew {{left the}} hotel at approximately 11:35a.m. to take Hendrix to St Mary Abbot's Hospital and {{they arrived at}} 11:45a.m. Medical registrar Dr. Martin Seifert stated: [...] "Jimi was rushed into the [...] room. He was put on a monitor, but it [...] was flat. I pounded his heart [...] a couple of times, {{but there was no}} point, he was dead". According to Seifert, the attempt to resuscitate Hendrix lasted [...] "just a few minutes". The surgical registrar, Dr. John Bannister, commented: [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> he was blue. He had all the parameters of someone who had been dead for some time. We worked on him for about half an hour without any response at all." [...] Bannister pronounced Hendrix dead at 12:45p.m., on Friday, September 18, 1970; he was 27 years old. He later stated: [...] "On admission he was obviously dead. He had no pulse, no heartbeat, and the attempt to resuscitate him was merely a formality." ...|$|E

500|$|Morrell also records how {{a hunting}} trip ashore in California {{led to a}} {{skirmish}} with the locals which turned into a full-scale battle ending, he says, with seventeen natives dead and seven of Tartars men wounded. Morrell claims that {{he was among the}} casualties, with an arrow in his thigh. Of a visit to San Francisco Morrell writes: [...] "The inhabitants are principally Mexicans and Spaniards who are very indolent and consequently very filthy." [...] After revisiting the Galapagos Islands and gathering a harvest of fur seal and terrapin, Tartar began a slow journey home on October 13, 1825. As they left the Pacific Morrell claimed to have personally inspected and identified every danger existing along the American Pacific coast. Tartar finally reached New York Harbour on May 8, 1826 with a main cargo of 6,000 fur seals. This haul did not please Morrell's employers, who had evidently expected rather more. [...] "The reception I met from my owners <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> repulsive", he wrote. [...] "The Tartar did not return home laden with silver and gold, and therefore my toils and dangers counted for nothing".|$|E
500|$|While {{researching the}} book, Taraborrelli {{realized}} {{that one of}} the greatest misconceptions about Madonna was the general perception that she <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> unemotional in her personal relationships. The opposite proved true; Madonna was indeed emotionally vulnerable, and Taraborelli cited as an example the icon's 1990 relationship with actor Warren Beatty. Their relationship was generally perceived as nothing more than a means to promote their film Dick Tracy, and Madonna was regarded under the circumstances as opportunistic. Taraborelli discovered however that Madonna actually had strong feelings for Beatty. The actor however was not as emotionally invested as Madonna, and the relationship ended with her heart being broken. Taraborelli observed, [...] "So, what I think will surprise people with this story are the many times that Madonna has ended up feeling alone and rejected. She has built her entire career on an image of indestructibility. But at least in her personal life, and again, I make that distinction, because this isn't necessarily true in her business life, {{she is one of the}} most fragile subjects I've ever written about...This book is really about placing her life into the proper historical context, and once again answering the why questions about her." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 18, {{the morning}} <b>was</b> <b>cold</b> <b>and</b> rainy {{with a light}} fog. The second day began as {{a copy of the}} first with {{multiple}} Union charges. The Union center was able to breach the center of the Confederate breatworks but were pushed out by a Rebel counterattack. Carpenter led a mounted rescue force of colored soldiers to save white soldiers trapped near a cover bridge on the left flank. Carpenter made several attempts but could not rescue the soldiers. Most of those trapped soldiers would be captured later that afternoon, but released before giving their parole. Later that day the Confederate reinforcements delivered a wild rebel yelling charge on the Union left flank. The white unit adjacent to the 5th USCC was completely routed and the 5th USCC flank was threatened. Ordered to fall back, Carpenter and Brisbin tried to maintain an orderly retreat. Many [...] "colored soldiers" [...] remembering the murder of their comrades during the first battle of Saltville broke ranks to rescue their wounded comrades. The retreat threatened to become a rout. About 4 PM, Union reinforcements arrived and bolstered the Union line. [...] During the night, Confederate forces were forced to retire {{due to the lack of}} ammunition. The next day Union forces buried the dead and helped the wounded. The costly victory marked the highpoint of Stoneman's raid.|$|E
