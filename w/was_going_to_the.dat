5|$|The Discovery Expedition {{was planned}} during {{a surge of}} {{international}} interest in the Antarctic regions {{at the turn of}} the 19th and 20th centuries. A German expedition under Erich von Drygalski was leaving at about the same time as Discovery, to explore the sector of the continent south of the Indian Ocean. The Swedish explorer Otto Nordenskiöld was leading an expedition to Graham Land, and a French expedition under Jean-Baptiste Charcot <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic Peninsula. Finally, the Scottish scientist William Speirs Bruce was leading a scientific expedition to the Weddell Sea.|$|E
5|$|Ferrara has {{proposed}} a number of redevelopments for the orphanage itself, and its surroundings. In 2004, he proposed a plan to redevelop the lot and building into 63 residential units. The proposed redevelopment was known as Glebe Gardens. Ferrara planned the construction of gardens and pools on the vacant grounds, but {{the front of the}} complex would face no development. Although the development application was approved by the city council, the plans were dropped because the costs to redevelop the lot were too great. In 2009, work began to revamp the orphanage and convert it into a retirement village, with trees being cleared to construct a retaining wall. Two metre high walls were going to be built to keep vandals out and to prevent further damage. He also stated that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fix up the orphanage once the proposed townhouses were under construction.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{was named}} to the Aussie Belles that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2012 Summer Paralympics. That the team {{qualified}} for the Games came as a surprise, as the Australian Paralympic Committee had been working on player development with an idea of the team qualifying for the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and an Australian team had not participated since the 2000 Summer Paralympics, when they earned an automatic selection as hosts, and the team finished last in the competition. Going into the Paralympics, her team was ranked eighth in the world. The Australian Paralympic Committee had chosen to work on her development as a goalball player with the idea that {{she might be able to}} qualify for and win a medal at the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Taylor debuted the national team's Paralympic uniform on 1 May 2012 at the Sydney Overseas Passenger Terminal on day two of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia Spring/Summer 2012/13. In the 2012 Summer Paralympics tournament, the Belles played games against Japan, Canada, the United States and Sweden. They lost every game, and did not advance to the finals.|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} {{were destroyed by}} fire {{early in the morning}} of 1 May 1757 during construction works, and never rebuilt. A servant who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stables saw that smoke was rising from the roof and gave the alarm. The 19th Earl of Crawfurd, his infant daughter Jean (later a Countess of Eglinton) and domestics had little time to escape the ferocity of the flames. The family moved to the Kilbirnie Barony manse at first and later settled at Bourtreehill House near Irvine. Lady Crawfurd was the eldest daughter and heiress of Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill.|$|E

Another friend from Marshall <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> University of Texas, so she {{chartered}} a plane to Austin to join her. As the plane landed, she was awed by the sight of a field covered with bluebonnets and instantly fell in love with the city. Lady Bird received a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with honors in 1933 and a second bachelor's degree in journalism cum laude in 1934. She was active on campus in different organizations, such as Orange Jackets, and believed in student leadership. Her goal was to become a reporter, but she also earned a teaching certificate.|$|E

25|$|Following World War I {{the brigade}} was {{deactivated}} {{until just before}} the commitment {{to the war in}} Vietnam in 1964, when it was activated as the 4th Marine Amphibious Brigade and deployed to the East Coast and Caribbean for counterinsurgency exercises. It participated in the intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965. In the 1970s, the 4th MAB's task changed from counter-terrorism to defending NATO's north flank against the Soviet Union. It was designated to reinforce Norwegian airfields and support a naval campaign to protect Norway. The next major operation for the 4th Marine Amphibious Brigade <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Middle East for operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm in the 1990s. The main mission performed by the 4th MAB was Operation Eastern Exit during which the brigade rescued the Soviet ambassador, the U.S. ambassador, and 300 other dignitaries from Mogadishu, Somalia.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of leaving King's College for Birkbeck College, Franklin was asked by John Randall {{to give up her}} work on DNA. When it became clear to Wilkins and the {{supervisors}} of Watson and Crick that Franklin <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new job, and that Linus Pauling was working on the structure of DNA, they were willing to share Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able. Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features was useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model. The key problem for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA double helix.|$|E

She stated she was unable to leave the house to inform Purvis or Martin about Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph, but as they were going to have fried chicken for the evening meal, she told Polly she had nothing in which to fry the chicken, and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> store to get some butter; that while at the store she called Mr. Purvis and {{informed}} him of Dillinger's plans to attend the Biograph that evening, at the same time obtaining the butter.

25|$|The League {{concerned}} {{itself with}} the issue of active believers who had infiltrated its own membership and who were trying to prove their loyalty to the regime or even undermine the antireligious work of the League. League members who suspected each other of harbouring religious beliefs secretly discussed their concerns in the early years. The League also had {{to address the issue of}} atheists in its membership who may have sympathized with the religious believers and who may have had doubts about what they were doing. In answer to these, the League adopted a policy that any League member who entered a church (to conduct antireligious work by checking on the strength of believers or numbering them) had to first receive local branch approval beforehand in order so that he did not give the impression that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church to pray. In contrast the League in Tashkent actually tried to translate the Quran into Uzbek so that more Muslims could read it, in hope that when Muslims were able to read what the Quran actually said, they would reject its content as fallacious.|$|E
25|$|The {{close of}} the twentieth century {{produced}} more favourable conditions for the extreme-right in Britain as a result of increased public concerns about immigration and established Muslim communities coupled with growing dissatisfaction with the established mainstream parties. In turn, the BNP gained rapidly growing levels of support over the coming years. In July 2000, it came second in the council elections for the North End of the London Borough of Bexley, its best result since 1993. At the 2001 general election it gained 16% of the vote in one constituency and over 10% in two others. In the 2002 local elections the BNP gained four councillors, three of whom were in Burnley, where it had capitalised on white anger surrounding the disproportionately high levels of funding being directed to the Asian-dominated Daneshouse ward. This breakthrough generated public anxieties about the party, with a poll finding that six in ten supported a ban on it. In the 2003 local elections the BNP gained 13 additional councillors, including seven more in Burnley, having attained over 100,000 votes. Concerned that much of their potential vote <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UK Independence Party (UKIP), in 2003 the BNP offered UKIP an electoral pact but was rebuffed. Griffin then accused UKIP of being a Labour Party scheme to steal the BNP's votes. They invested much in the campaign for the 2004 European Parliament election, at which they gained 800,000 votes but failed to secure a parliamentary seat. In the 2004 local elections, they secured four more seats, including three in Epping.|$|E

500|$|Hanjour {{trained at}} the CRM Airline Training Center in Scottsdale, Arizona, earning his FAA {{commercial}} pilot's certificate in April 1999. He {{had wanted to be}} a commercial pilot for the Saudi national airline but was rejected when he applied to the civil aviation school in Jeddah in 1999. Hanjour's brother later explained that, frustrated at not finding a job, Hanjour [...] "increasingly turned his attention toward religious texts and cassette tapes of militant Islamic preachers". Hanjour returned to Saudi Arabia after being certified as a pilot, but left again in late 1999, telling his family that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United Arab Emirates to work for an airline. Hanjour likely went to Afghanistan, where Al-Qaeda recruits were screened for special skills they might have. Already having selected the Hamburg cell members, Al Qaeda leaders selected Hanjour to lead the fourth team of hijackers.|$|E
500|$|Rhodes {{came up with}} an {{idea for}} the backing track in the car while he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio. He started playing with the Roland Jupiter 8 keyboard, while singer Simon Le Bon was working with the lyrics. The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Little Red Riding Hood, and the repeating of the word [...] "do" [...] {{at the end of each}} verse takes its melody from the instrumentals in Gordon Lightfoot's song [...] "If You Could Read My Mind". Andy Taylor worked out a Marc Bolan-ish guitar part, a very Marshall-sounding Les Paul guitar lick that was added to the track. Then the bass and drums were added, and the whole track was finished that day, including Le Bon's vocal melody and lyrics. The laugh at the beginning of the song and the screams during the song's fade-out were performed and recorded live by Rhodes' girlfriend at the time.|$|E
