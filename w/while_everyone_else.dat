Gallman of Oh, The Horror! claimed that Larter is again the bright spot; whereas Andrew Manning of Radio Free Entertainment positively acknowledged her, declaring that Larter rules the movie. Manning argued that <b>while</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> is merely a hastily assembled caricature without depth, Clear has a well-defined background and history with recognition to her appearance in the first film.

Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, said he [...] "thoroughly enjoyed" [...] the episode, especially the subplot of the parks department employees realizing how much work Leslie does due to her absence. However, he said way the sex scandal consumed the entire town and local media countered the central conceit of the series, [...] "that Leslie treats her mundane, small-town civil service job {{as if it were a}} high-stakes national politics job, <b>while</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> sees their world for what it is". Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode was [...] "a sweet and clever way to celebrate the holiday season", but that the media frenzy in [...] "Christmas Scandal" [...] was [...] "a little out of place in an episode filled with a ton of subtler, character-building moments".
