5|$|In {{the season}} opener against the Chicago Bears, Johnson caught a pass with 31seconds left in {{regulation}} {{in the end zone}} for <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a game-winning touchdown. However, referee Gene Steratore ruled the catch incomplete, saying that Johnson had not maintained possession of the ball through the entire process of the catch. The Lions lost the game by a score of 1914.|$|E
5|$|Though Haley is ostensibly a ghostwriter on the Autobiography, modern {{scholars}} tend {{to treat}} him as an essential and core collaborator who acted as an invisible figure {{in the composition of}} the work. He minimized his own voice, and signed a contract to limit his authorial discretion in favor of producing <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> verbatim copy. However, MalcolmX biographer Manning Marable considers this view of Haley as simply a ghostwriter as a deliberate narrative construction of black scholars of the day who wanted to see the book as a singular creation of a dynamic leader and martyr. Marable argues that a critical analysis of the Autobiography, or the full relationship between MalcolmX and Haley, does not support this view; he describes it instead as a collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Ripley's early {{television}} and film career was characterised by minor roles as prostitutes or mistresses; {{in what was}} to be her film debut, she filmed two scenes as a prostitute in the film Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh, 1994). In the first scene, her character was strangled by the creature (played by Robert De Niro's stand-in). The second scene featured De Niro himself, though Ripley's character was lying dead in a mortuary throughout. Pleased with <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> her breakout role, Ripley bought a dress for the premiere, though she was distraught when Branagh sent her a card apologising for cutting her scenes from the finished film. The same year, she filmed the role of Karen Hughes, the sister of a mute character who believes she sees a murder, in the low-budget film Mute Witness (Anthony Waller, 1995). After Mute Witnesss British television premiere in 1999, a Daily Record critic wrote that Ripley's dramatic scenes were not as good as her comic ones.|$|E

25|$|Security was {{frequently}} a problem, {{particularly in the}} club's latter years. There were several shootings {{inside and outside the}} club, and relations with the police and licensing authorities became troubled. When local magistrates and police visited the club in 1997, they witnessed a near-fatal assault on a man in the streets outside when 18-year-old Andrew Delahunty was hit over the head from behind with <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a metal bar before being pushed into the path of an on-coming car.|$|E
25|$|England {{had lost}} four wickets for six runs, and were 31 for 4 with Ian Bell and Kevin Pietersen at the crease.

His 41-run partnership with Bell took England's lead past 150, and with Bell having batted past the hour mark, he needed 29 more for his half-century when he gave a tiny edge to Gilchrist.|$|E

25|$|Twain {{created a}} unique {{marketing}} {{system designed to}} reach millions of veterans with a patriotic appeal just as the nation began mourning the war hero's death. Ten thousand agents canvassed the North, following a script Twain had devised; many were themselves veterans who dressed in their old uniforms. They sold 350,000 two-volume sets at prices from $3.50 to $12 (depending on the binding). Each copy contained <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a handwritten note from Grant himself. In the end, Grant's widow Julia received about $450,000, suggesting a royalty of about 30%.|$|E

25|$|In Manila in {{the early}} hours of January 30, 1911, people were awakened out of their sleep by what they at first took for loud thunder. The {{illusion}} was heightened when great streaks of lightning were seen to illumine the southern sky. Those who investigated further, however, soon learned the truth. A huge, fan-shaped cloud of <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> black smoke rose to a great height. It was crossed and crisscrossed with a brilliant electrical display, which the people of Manila at first took for lightning. This cloud finally shot up in the air, spread, then dissipated, and this marked the culmination of the eruption, at about 2:30 a. m.|$|E

25|$|Following the Nazi {{invasion}} of Poland in World War II, the New Cemetery {{was closed to}} outsiders and the Germans sold the most valuable stonework to local masons. Other headstones, as well as slabs, were turned into construction material and used for paving the supply road to the camp, including the courtyard of commandant Amon Göth, {{who is known for}} having insisted that the Jews pay for their own executions. Meanwhile, the old bones at the cemetery were often left uncovered and scattered around in <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> an open-pit mine. Caretaker Pina Ladner, who used to live on premises, was sent to Płaszów beforehand, and shot.|$|E
25|$|United Russia's {{predecessor}} was the Unity bloc, {{which was}} created {{three months before the}} December 1999 Duma elections to counter the advance of the Fatherland – All Russia (OVR) party led by Yuri Luzhkov. The creation of the party was heavily supported by Kremlin insiders, who were wary of <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a certain OVR victory. They did not expect Unity to have much chance of success, since President Boris Yeltsin was very unpopular and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's ratings were still minuscule. The new party attempted to mimic OVR's formula of success, placing an emphasis on competence and pragmatism. Charismatic Minister of Emergency Situations Sergei Shoigu was appointed as the party leader.|$|E
25|$|Western Australia Police {{supported}} {{the fight against}} take-away liquor and a strategic partnership was formed. The campaign was strengthened by this partnership, though it didn’t effect how it was managed. Western Australian Police Commissioner Karl O’Callaghan said, “When I first went up to Fitzroy Crossing, looking down from the air I saw <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> green emeralds on the ground”, “They {{turned out to be}} thousands and thousands of cans of VB beer, where people had sat around drunk”. Fitzroy Crossing Police were spending much of their time on alcohol-related crime.

25|$|One famous bakeneko {{story is}} about a man named Takasu Genbei, whose mother’s {{personality}} changed completely after his pet cat went missing for many years. His mother avoided the company {{of friends and family}} and would take her meals alone in her room. When the family peeked in on her, they saw a cat-like monster in the mother's clothes, chewing on animal carcasses. Takasu, still skeptical, slew <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> his mother, and after one day his mother's body turned back into his pet cat that had been missing. Takasu then tore up the floorboards of his mother's room to find her skeleton hidden there, her bones gnawed clean of all flesh.|$|E
25|$|On 20 August 2010 Graeme Smith {{announced}} that he was to surrender the captaincy in T20 Internationals but continue playing in the format. Cricket South Africa subsequently handed over the captaincy to his deputy Botha. Botha also took the One-Day International captaincy after the 2011 Cricket World Cup when Smith gave up his ODI captaincy. The deciding factor was that Botha had led South Africa to a series win against Australia earlier in 2010 when Smith was absent with injury. Botha's first match as permanent captain was on 7 October 2010 against Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe scored <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a competitive 168 however Zimbabwe's bowling attack severely let them down and it was easily chased by the South Africans with seven-wickets and five-overs to spare.|$|E
25|$|In 1884, Mr. T. Hodge Jones {{bought the}} {{property}} and, {{with several of}} his friends, formed the Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company to mine the marble from the cave. The company hired a geologist, and it was proved that <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> marble on {{the ceiling of the}} Shoe Room was really limestone. To keep the company alive they mined out the guano and sold it for $700 a ton. The guano was used for gunpowder and fertilizer. The miners filled ore carts with guano, then the carts were pulled by donkeys to the Cathedral Room, and the carts were lifted out of the cave by a pulley system. In 1889, after four and a half years,all the guano was mined out. Marble Cave Mining, Co. closed all operations.|$|E
