5|$|Since {{the day of}} the accident, {{there was}} {{uncertainty}} about who boarded the plane and about the exact cargo manifest—all leading to uncertainty as to the identity of the bodies recovered from the crash site; some bodies, including that of Sikorski's daughter, Zofia, <b>were</b> <b>never</b> recovered. Since several bodies <b>were</b> <b>never</b> found and the bodies of several members of Sikorski's entourage <b>were</b> <b>never</b> positively identified, some conspiracy theorists such as journalist and amateur historian Dariusz Baliszewski postulate that some might have been murdered on the ground while others might have been abducted to the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war <b>were</b> <b>never</b> found, and similarly bodies were recovered that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale of the issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead <b>were</b> <b>never</b> found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E
5|$|Germany and the Netherlands were {{eventually}} {{able to reach}} an agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings based upon their ideas for a battlecruiser, in return for a guarantee that all needed equipment would be ordered from German firms. With their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout, which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940. This is the last known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships <b>were</b> <b>never</b> completed, and the ships <b>were</b> <b>never</b> constructed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to what was}} built, the original plans also called for a multi-story parking garage, a 550-seat conventional movie theatre, and a direct underground link to the Museum subway stop. These features were deemed too costly and <b>were</b> <b>never</b> built.|$|E

5|$|Many planned {{elements}} <b>were</b> <b>never</b> filmed, due {{to production}} time constraints. Moore {{had hoped for}} an extended battle scene in which Data would be electrocuted, and Wesley Crusher blown up in an explosion. Production of the episode ended on December 19.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, almost all design work was halted, although work on turrets and gunnery arrangements by Germaniawerft's designers continued until the German invasion of the Netherlands in May. The first 1047-class ship was scheduled to be completed in 1944, so would in any case have been too late to stop the Japanese advance into the Dutch East Indies. Due to the war, final plans for the ships <b>were</b> <b>never</b> completed, and the ships <b>were</b> <b>never</b> constructed.|$|E

5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs <b>were</b> <b>never</b> easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E
