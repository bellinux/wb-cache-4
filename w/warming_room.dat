25|$|The cloister was {{a garden}} courtyard, {{surrounded}} by the domestic buildings of the abbey, mostly constructed in the late 12th century. The eastern buildings, adjoining the transept, are well-preserved, {{and it is possible}} to walk through the slype that gave access to the parlour, chapter house and possibly the infirmary. The south range is ruinous but the walls mainly survive. It contained the refectory, which was divided in the 14th century to provide a <b>warming</b> <b>room.</b> The range was much more complete in the early 19th century, when it still had most of its upper floor. This probably contained the abbot's lodging. There were many buildings further west and south, and the abbey's guest facilities must have been very large to accommodate visitors of very high status, with their enormous retinues.|$|E

5000|$|For example, {{consider}} {{an open window}} in a <b>warm</b> <b>room.</b> The <b>warm</b> air inside is less dense than the cold air outside, which flows {{into the room and}} down towards the floor. Now imagine the opposite: a cold <b>room</b> exposed to <b>warm</b> outside air. Here the air flowing in moves up toward the ceiling. If the flow is Boussinesq (and the room is otherwise symmetrical), then viewing the cold room upside down is exactly the same as viewing the <b>warm</b> <b>room</b> right-way-round. This is because the only way density enters the problem is via the reduced gravity [...] which undergoes only a sign change when changing from the <b>warm</b> <b>room</b> flow to the cold room flow.|$|R

50|$|Like its Roman {{predecessor}} {{a typical}} hamam {{consists of three}} basic, interconnected rooms: the sıcaklık (or hararet -caldarium), which is the hot room; the <b>warm</b> <b>room</b> (tepidarium), which is the intermediate room; and the soğukluk, which is the cool room (frigidarium). The main evolutionary change between Roman baths and Turkish baths concerned the cool room. The Roman frigidarium included a quite cold water pool in which patrons would immerse themselves {{before moving on to}} the <b>warmer</b> <b>rooms.</b> Medieval Muslim customs put a high priority on cleanliness but preferred running water to immersion baths, so the cold water pool was dispensed with. Also, the sequence of rooms was revised so that people generally used the cool <b>room</b> after the <b>warmer</b> <b>rooms</b> and massages, rather than before. Whereas the Romans used it as preparation, the Ottomans used it for refreshment (drinks and snacks are served) and recovery.|$|R

[...] To the north was a {{cruciform}} church oriented towards an east facing altar, with north and south transepts dividing the nave from the chancel. [...] The length of the church, from east to west, was about 140 feet and, from the north to the south transepts, about 98 feet. [...] To the south of the nave were cloisters, around which were grouped a Chapter House and <b>Warming</b> <b>Room</b> to the east, a refectory to the south, and a buttery, parlour and other buildings to the west.|$|E
50|$|The first {{club was}} {{located at the}} Farmer’s Market, now {{the site of the}} Cenex parking lot located between Second and Third Streets on America Avenue. Henry Krebs donated slabs for {{enclosing}} the one sheet of ice and a <b>warming</b> <b>room</b> {{at one end of the}} building. The first rocks were purchased from the Chisholm Curling Club at a reduced price. Other rocks were secured through the efforts of Frank Markus as he traveled throughout the area. Rocks could be purchased for about $10 a pair. During these early years, rocks were owned by many of the curlers who made their rocks available to those who did not have their own.|$|E
50|$|Of the {{original}} priory building only fragments survive. Fragments of {{the foundations of}} the prior's lodgings, dated c.1438, were incorporated into a later building at Repton School; the majority of this building dates from the 17th century, however, and was comprehensively altered in the 19th century. Parts of the foundations of other areas of the priory remain in several areas, having been uncovered during construction work at Repton School in 1922: the bases of a cluster of columns remain of the former chancel and chapels; fragments of an arch remain, belonging to the former pulpitum, which were moved to their current position in 1906; and fragments of the door surrounds of both the chapter house and <b>warming</b> <b>room</b> also survive.|$|E

5000|$|The priory {{church is}} {{described}} as [...] "a short, narrow, rectangular, aisleless building, without transepts". To the north stood a tower which {{was built in the}} 15th century. To the south of the church was the cloisters: a covered passageway around a courtyard, which was in turn surrounded by ranges of buildings on three sides. The eastern range of the cloisters was built after the fire of 1279. The ground floor consisted of a single vaulted room. This was subdivided to form a chapel, chapter house, and a day or <b>warming</b> <b>room.</b> Above was the [...] "dorter" [...] or [...] "sleeping quarters" [...] with the reredorter (communal toilet) {{at the end of the}} building. The southern range of the cloisters was slightly larger than the east, but had two stories again: the ground floor was an under-croft whilst the upper floor was occupied by the [...] "frater" [...] or refectory, where the canons ate. The west range was originally the lay-brothers accommodation (refectory on the ground-floor, sleeping quarters above). However, it is thought to have been converted into accommodation for the Prior. To the South-West was a square building housing the monastic kitchens.|$|E
50|$|Curling {{began in}} Wausau {{in the early}} 1920s, {{although}} there are accounts of unorganized play occurring even earlier. The Wausau Curling Club was officially organized in 1925. One of the club's founding members, Howard Morrison, arranged {{for one of the}} fair buildings at the county park to be used during the winter for curling sheets. By the 1940s it was apparent that the curling facilities were inadequate for the growing club. The county agreed to build a new multipurpose building adjacent to the existing club in the county fairgrounds, which would house four sheets, walkways and a <b>warming</b> <b>room.</b> During the summer of 1951, the club installed equipment for refrigerated (or artificially created) ice, which allowed for curling to continue regardless of the climate outdoors. The new ice was ready for the 1951-1952 season. During the 1950s and 60s there were several additions to the club. A dedicated clubroom, kitchen, hospitality room and improved locker facilities were added to the building, and a fifth sheet of ice. In 1976, the curling club hosted the United States Men's Curling Championship.The aging of the Marathon Park facility and a host of costly repairs encouraged the organization to pursue {{the construction of a new}} building outside of Marathon Park. In October 2011, the club announced plans to build a new dedicated curling club in 2012. The new club includes 8 curling sheets, and is one of the largest curling specific facilities in the United States. The club also hosts high school curling, including teams from Wausau East, Wausau West and more recently D.C. Everest.|$|E
