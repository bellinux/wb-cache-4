5|$|Tree {{of heaven}} {{is a popular}} {{ornamental}} tree in China and valued for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions. It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odor of its blossoms and the <b>weediness</b> of its habit. The problem of odor was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results. Michael Dirr, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes (his emphasis): In Europe, however, the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive {{as it is in}} America. In the United Kingdom it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and East Anglia. It becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland. It is also rare in Ireland. In Germany the tree is commonly planted in gardens. The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds.|$|E

We explore {{classification and regression tree}} models {{as an alternative to the}} current Australian Weed Risk Assessment system, and demonstrate how the performance of screening tests for unwanted alien species may be quantitatively compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The optimal classification tree model for predicting <b>weediness</b> included just four out of a possible 44 attributes of introduced plants examined, namely: (i) intentional human dispersal of propagules; (ii) evidence of naturalization beyond native range; (iii) evidence of being a weed elsewhere; and (iv) a high level of domestication. Intentional human dispersal of propagules in combination with evidence of naturalization beyond a plants native range led to the strongest prediction of <b>weediness.</b> A high level of domestication in combination with no evidence of naturalization mitigated the likelihood of an introduced plant becoming a weed resulting from intentional human dispersal of propagules. Unlikely intentional human dispersal of propagules combined with no evidence of being a weed elsewhere led to the lowest predicted probability of <b>weediness.</b> The failure to include intrinsic plant attributes in the model suggests that either these attributes are not useful general predictors of <b>weediness,</b> or data and analysis were inadequate to elucidate the underlying relationship(s). This concurs with the historical pessimism that we will ever be able to accurately predict invasive plants. Given the apparent importance of propagule pressure (the number of individuals of an species released), future attempts at evaluating screening model performance for identifying unwanted plants need to account for propagule pressure when collating and/or analysing datasets.

40|$|Our {{research}} examines plant {{gene flow}} and the impacts from environmental release of genetically-modified plants. Plant gene flow {{is a natural}} process that occurs when pollen from one plant lands on the flower of another plant and produces a hybrid offspring. Gene flow can produce hybrid offspring with new traits that could change {{the ability of the}} plant to survive and spread. If hybrid offspring have some advantage in the environment, they could become invasive and/or affect other components of our ecosystems. In the near future, the federal government may approve the use of a genetically engineered herbicide-resistant (HR) Agrostis stolonifera. A. stolonifera (creeping bentgrass) is a common non-native grass that inhabits a myriad of environments. It is also known to hybridize with four non-native bentgrass relatives in Connecticut. If the HR A. stolonifera is used, the gene is likely to escape into feral and cultivated bentgrass populations.

40|$|Abstract Background Safflower, Carthamus tinctorius, is a thistle that {{is grown}} commercially for the {{production}} of oil and birdseed and recently, as a host {{for the production}} of transgenic pharmaceutical proteins. C. tinctorius can cross with a number of its wild relatives, creating the possibility of gene flow from safflower to weedy species. In this study we looked at the introgression potential between different members of the genus Carthamus, measured the fitness of the parents versus the F 1 hybrids, followed the segregation of a specific transgene in the progeny and tried to identify traits important for adaptation to different environments. Results Safflower hybridized and produced viable offspring with members of the section Carthamus and species with chromosome numbers of n = 10 and n = 22, but not with n = 32. The T-DNA construct of a transgenic C. tinctorius line was passed on to the F 1 progeny in a Mendelian fashion, except in one specific cross, where it was deleted at a frequency of approximately 21 %. Analyzing fitness and key morphological traits like colored seeds, shattering seed heads and the presence of a pappus, we found no evidence of hybrid vigour or increased <b>weediness</b> in the F 1 hybrids of commercial safflower and its wild relatives. Conclusion Our results suggest that hybridization between commercial safflower and its wild relatives, while feasible in most cases we studied, does not generate progeny with higher propensity for <b>weediness.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Gene flow {{is defined}} as the {{movement}} of genes between populations and is a naturally occurring phenomenon among sexually compatible individuals. Crops have exchanged genes with their wild and weedy relatives for centuries, however this process has recently caused concern. The rapid advances in genetic engineering have hit an immense wall of opposition and gene flow is now seen as a possible escape route for transgenes. The safety of genetically modified (GM) crops has been fervently debated and the possible risks, to both the consumers of the crops and to the environment, have prevented their commercialisation in Britain and many other countries. Concern has arisen that if detrimental effects were to be detected post release of any GM crop, withdrawal may be difficult, or impossible, if gene flow has already occurred. Other potential, undesirable consequences of gene flow are the evolution of increased <b>weediness</b> and the extinction of wild relatives. It is thought that crop to wild gene flow has caused increased <b>weediness</b> in seven wild relatives of the world’s thirteen most important crops and extinction in two (Ellstrand et al. 1999). Gene flow can only prove a substantive risk if suitable recipients grow sympatric to the GM crop (i. e. in the same geographic location), if the transgene combines stably within the recipient to form a fertile hybrid and if the fitness of the hybrids is not reduced to a deleterious extent.
