5|$|Another Williams Institute study {{conducted}} in February 2012 estimated {{that in the}} first three years after the law takes effect, Maryland same-sex couples will generate between $40 and $64 million for the state economy, in addition to whatever revenue out-of-state couples bring. Several dozen small employers in the state have also said that same-sex marriage <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> their businesses, helping to attract and retain talent.|$|E
5|$|Themes from Plato and his {{influence}} on Western political philosophy are also {{prevalent in the}} novel. Mainly, {{the debate over the}} nature of 'Good Society' and how to achieve it are seen in the positions of the Supreme. He argues that it is the ruler's role, as well as his duty and obligation, to bring about the good society, and this can only be done by the imposition of absolute order from above. The dictator’s job is to bring about the Good Society, to impose the needed order, and the people's job is to obey the dictator, thereby enjoying the fruits of the good society. The result of such behavior by both the ruler and the ruled <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> everyone.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{their history}} in the competition, Liverpool manager Roy Evans, felt this would not count for {{anything}} in the final: [...] "Our players haven't really got that much Wembley experience, certainly {{not in terms of}} finals. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> us to have Ian Rush and John Barnes out there." [...] Striker Rush had picked up a hamstring injury while playing for the Welsh national team against Bulgaria, but was expected to be fit. Midfielder Mark Kennedy would not feature in the final as he was ineligible.|$|E

500|$|Arriving first {{during the}} summer was English defender Matthew Upson from Luton Town. French midfielders Emmanuel Petit and Gilles Grimandi joined from Monaco, where they were protégées to Wenger. Marc Overmars, a midfielder from Ajax, was {{recruited}} in a £7million deal and spoke of his delight at joining Arsenal in his press conference: [...] "I like English football because there is more space. With my speed and quality I think it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> me here." [...] Deals for midfielders Luís Boa Morte and Alberto Méndez striker Christopher Wreh and goalkeeper Alex Manninger were also finalised before August.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, all six {{remaining}} Adam Air 737s were immediately grounded awaiting safety checks. Vice-President of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla, said that all Boeing 737-300s should be checked. He eventually decided the entire Indonesian fleet of 737s should be checked, but did not ground any more aircraft. There were also suggestions that Adam Air should be suspended from all operations until the entire fleet could be checked, with MP Abdul Hakim saying [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the company and the government ... until the flight authorities can determine if Adam Air is still worthy as national aircraft company".|$|E
500|$|The {{result was}} a {{landslide}} for Dilworth. In an election with higher than expected turnout, the Democrat took 59% of the vote, a slight increase over the party's tally from the mayoral contest of four years earlier. The Democrats carried 44 of the city's 52 wards. Longstreth conceded defeat early in the evening, {{and said that he}} hoped for [...] "an administration that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> all people and the progress of our great city". The Philadelphia Inquirer described the result as [...] "a ringing indorsement [...] of the policies of Mayor Joseph S. Clark, Jr., whose Democratic administration was the key issue in the Fall ballot drive." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1984, Woolfolk was {{relegated to}} back-up status as Joe Morris {{took over the}} {{starting}} job at tailback midway through the season. [...] The 1984 Giants made the playoffs, but Woolfolk did not touch the ball. In March 1985, the Giants traded Woolfolk to the Oilers. In reporting on the trade, The New York Times said: [...] "The mystery of Butch Woolfolk, who in his three seasons with the Giants went from star running back to benchwarmer may be solved next fall, but not with Giants." [...] Woolfolk {{said at the time}} he was [...] "not bitter" [...] about the trade, and Coach Bill Parcells said: [...] "Maybe a new place <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Butch.

500|$|Not all reviews were positive, however. The American Mathematical Society's Deborah Loewenberg Ball and Hyman Bass {{reviewed}} {{the book from}} a mathematical perspective. Although they praised its [...] "attractive and imaginative fantasy," [...] the two mathematicians found several issues. Ball and Bass were concerned with The Number Devil negative characterization of math teachers, its apparent presentation of mathematics as magical rather than factual, {{and a number of}} other contentions. Ted Dewan, writing for the Times Educational Supplement, believed it to be [...] "far more compelling than a standard text," [...] but found it less adventurous than he hoped for. He also criticized its use in mathematics education, stating [...] "I suspect this is the sort of book that well-meaning adults will mistakenly thrust upon children because it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> them." ...|$|E
500|$|Overmars {{signed for}} Arsenal in June 1997. The fee was {{reported}} to be between £5million and £7million, with the player on a five-year contract, paid £18,000 per week. Overmars relished the challenge of playing in England: [...] "I like English football because there is more pace. With my speed and quality I think it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> me here." [...] Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger believed Overmars had his [...] "best years ahead of him" [...] and met his criteria of a player [...] "used to the pressures of playing for a big club and everything that goes with it". He opined that Arsenal lost the Premier League at home the previous season – [...] "we were maybe the best away team," [...] and commented on their inability to play expansive football. Wenger felt the signing of Overmars would rectify that problem.|$|E

500|$|The deal {{attracted}} mass {{attention from}} the media. Neil Harman, then of the Daily Mail, questioned the power broadcasters and Premier League chairman now had over fixture scheduling. He concluded his piece with a warning: [...] "The game has already reached saturation coverage, now {{it is likely to}} be choked. Football on six days out of seven per week <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> no-one." [...] The Independent noted that this was a [...] "remarkable coup" [...] for BSkyB, given the company's fluctuating fortunes. The Guardian correspondent David Lacey suggested that fans were the biggest losers: [...] "A lot of people who want to watch matches regularly in future are going to have to buy a bond or a dish." [...] Bryan Davies, Baron Davies of Oldham described the arrangement as [...] "absolutely appalling" [...] and Football Supporters' Association chairman Craig Brewin criticised the [...] "obscene" [...] amounts of money clubs earned as part of the deal.|$|E

Over 200 actresses auditioned for the role. The Production notes stated; [...] "The role required {{a young woman who}} could be believable as the ruler of that planet, {{but at the same time}} be vulnerable and open". Portman was chosen especially for her performances in [...] (1994) and Beautiful Girls (1996), which impressed Lucas. He stated, [...] "I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia [...] Natalie embodied all those traits and more". Portman was unfamiliar with Star Wars before being cast, but was enthusiastic about being cast as a character she expected to become a role model. Portman said, [...] "It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power.
