40|$|AbstractPotential {{production}} and emission of nitrosamines during post-combustion CO 2 capture has drawn some attention {{due to their}} toxicity and potential carcinogenicity. One of the possible {{ways to reduce the}} concentration of nitrosamines is irradiation of the liquid streams of the capture plant with UV light. This paper shows experimental results of the degradation of nitrosamines such as N-nitroso-diethanolamine (NDELA) and N-mononitroso-piperazine (MNPZ) in different solvent matrices. These solvent matrices include water and laboratory grade monoethanolamine (MEA) aqueous solutions, as well as aqueous MEA solution and wash water that had been used in a CO 2 capture pilot plant connected to a coal-fired power plant. Experiments were conducted in dedicated batch set-ups and in a continuous mini CO 2 capture plant. Results show that the UV absorbance of impurities (degradation products and/or dissolved metals) present in MEA solvent that had been used in a pilot plant significantly reduces the UV degradation rate of nitrosamines. Furthermore, UV light seems to accelerate the degradation of the capture solvent itself. For these reasons, if UV light treatment is to be used in full-scale post-combustion CO 2 capture plants, suitable locations would be the absorber's <b>washing</b> <b>section</b> or the stripper's condensate.

In April 2011, phase II of the project has started, which will run {{until the end of}} 2013. Corrosivity, long- term stability of the scrubbing agent and its impact on emissions and the need for reclaiming are being investigated in a long-term trial. At the beginning of phase II, the pilot plant was modified in order to test two optimisation measures. Firstly, a new high-performance structured packing was installed, aiming at a reduction in the absorber's cross- sectional area by more than 35 %. Pressure loss measurements and parameter studies were carried out to assess the performance of the new packing. Secondly, an additional <b>washing</b> <b>section</b> was installed {{at the top of the}} absorber. Owing to the fact that standards for measuring emissions of large-scale capture plants are not finally defined yet, different process configurations for emission reduction are being tested and optimised.

40|$|The {{catering}} {{industry in}} Hong Kong has been expanding {{rapidly in the}} past decade to become a significant segment of the hospitality sector in the city. Considering all restaurant-types available in the country, Chinese dim sum restaurants have the largest numerical count in Hong Kong. A major concern in the Chinese dim sum restaurant sector over the recent years has been the diverse and harmful forms of pollutants which accompany the food production process. Notably, Chinese restaurants are believed to consume more water and produce more sewage than restaurants serving other cuisines (Deng and Burnett, 2002). This study investigated the water consumption pattern of Chinese dim sum restaurants in a case study. Both qualitative and quantitative data from primary and secondary sources were collected. Results show that the dish <b>washing</b> <b>section</b> used the most amount of water (48 %). The factors which affect the extent and nature of water consumption in local dim sum restaurants were also identified It was found that the number of patrons was the chief determining factor with regard to the volume of water consumption in local Chinese restaurants. The gross floor area and operating hours of the restaurant also had an effect on total water consumption. Subsequent to analyzing water use patterns and identifying potential water abuse, some recommendations were made to industry practitioners. By reducing water consumption and sewage generation, the water charge, sewage charge and trade effluent surcharge of a restaurant can be cut down. Restaurant operators can therefore benefit from reduced operating expenses...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{correlation}} of Miocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks in southern Death Valley {{is used to}} constrain {{the total amount of}} slip on the southern Death Valley fault. The tertiary volcanic section near Ibex Pass is correlated to rocks ∼ 35 km to the northwest, in the Wingate Wash region (Luckow et al., 2005). Geochronology by Luckow et al. (2005) in Wingate Wash and the Owlshead Mountains has the region divided into two basic periods: an early interval (∼ 14 - 13. 4 Ma), and a later phase (∼ 13 - 12. 5 Ma). One date from the volcanic sequence in Ibex Pass has been reported (Calzia, 2000) suggesting that rocks of this section is a time equivalent to the Wingate <b>Wash</b> <b>section.</b> However, Topping (1993) suggested this section contains the ∼ 10 Ma Rhodes tuff, and is therefore is at least partially distinctly younger than the Wingate <b>Wash</b> <b>section.</b> Geochemical analyses and geologic mapping of lithologic units in Ibex Pass was performed to determine the structure and magmatic history of the area. Results from the correlation of physical stratigraphy and elemental chemistry on volcanics in southern Death Valley, suggests a geologic association between Wingate Wash and Ibex Pass. Data provided on the Pre-Shoshone volcanics containing the Rhodes Tuff was determined to have no stratigraphic or geochemical connection to the Ibex Pass volcanics. The data on the rock units in Ibex Pass clarifies the age discrepancy given for this region as well. The research conducted provides a better understanding on the displacement that has occurred in the southern Death Valley right-lateral strike slip system. The correlation of volcanic and sedimentary rocks along the southern Death Valley fault zone demonstrates there is at least ∼ 25 km of slip and as much as ∼ 35 km of slip that has occurred along the fault zone in the last 12 Ma. A reconstruction model created for this study displays the suggested amounts of offset. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (MHI), in {{collaboration}} with Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. (KEPCO), has developed and is continuing to improve upon an energy efficient chemical absorbent CO 2 recovery process called the KM CDR ProcessTM that utilizes the energy-saving CO 2 absorbent KS- 1 TM solvent. Long term, highly successful R&D activities since 1991, {{have led to the}} rapid commercial deployment of ten (10) CO 2 capture plants, with a maximum CO 2 capture capacity of 450 metric tons per day (tpd). One (1) further 500 tpd commercial plant in Qatar, currently under construction, will be commissioned in 2014. These plants have been delivered exclusively to the chemical industry; in the majority of the CO 2 recovery plants, CO 2 is stripped from natural gas fired steam reformer flue gas and used as a feedstock which reacts with ammonia to produce urea. To ensure that the KM CDR ProcessTM and KS- 1 TM solvent could also be used in an environmental capacity for CCS application, the impacts of coal fired flue gas on the KM CDRTM process needed to be investigated. MHI constructed a 10 tpd demonstration plant at the Matsushima power station and operated it for more than 6, 000 hours until concluding the successful test in 2008. The results and knowhow gained from the Matsushima test led to the construction and operation of the world's largest coal fired flue gas carbon capture plant in Alabama, USA. Southern Company 500 tpd plant began operation in June 2011 at Alabama Power's Plant Barry; the project became the world's first fully integrated black coal CCS project when SECARB began CO 2 injection in August, 2012. MHI is continuing with numerous R&D activities related to amine CO 2 recovery at both Japan based R&D facilities and abroad. During 2012, MHI's overseas R&D focus has been Italy, at the 60 tpd pilot test plant located at Enel's Brindisi Power Station. The pilot plant test, utilizing KS- 1 TM, was conducted over two (2) months capturing up to 60 tpd of CO 2 from European coal flue gas. This pilot plant {{is one of the biggest}} post combustion capture pilot plants in Europe; maximum flue gas flow of 12, 000 Nm 3 /h, CO 2 content range of 11 to 13 vol% with the flue gas pre-treated to remove SOx via wet electro filters. The pilot plant absorber column is 46 m high and 1. 5 m in diameter, including 3 structured packing beds and a <b>washing</b> <b>section.</b> The test program aim was to optimize operation using KS- 1 TM, while monitoring and minimising amine emissions. Several parameters such as solvent concentration, regenerator pressure, packing height within the absorber and stripper were adjusted with a constant CO 2 capture rate to determine the optimum points. The MHI test results, utilizing KS- 1 TM were directly compared to the pilot plant operation benchmark, 30 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA). The results showed that when compared to the benchmark, KS- 1 TM required considerably less specific energy, had better tolerance to oxygen and significantly lower amine emissions...|$|E
