When later activated, the K-line induces a partial mental state resembling the one that created it. A "partial mental state" is a subset of those mental agencies operating at one moment. This view leads to many ideas about the development, structure and physiology of Memory, and about how to implement frame-like representations in a distributed processor...|$|R
