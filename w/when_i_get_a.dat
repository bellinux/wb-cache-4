500|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{deployment}} to Europe, the Kilmers' daughter Rose had died, and twelve days later, their son Christopher was born. [...] Before his departure, Kilmer had contracted with publishers {{to write a}} book about the war, deciding upon the title Here and There with the Fighting Sixty-Ninth. The regiment arrived in France in November 1917, and Kilmer wrote to his wife that he had not written [...] "anything in prose or verse since I got here—except statistics—but I've stored up a lot of memories to turn into copy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance." [...] Kilmer did not write such a book; however, toward the end of the year, he did find time to write prose sketches and poetry. [...] The most notable of his poems during this period was [...] "Rouge Bouquet" [...] (1918) which commemorated the deaths of two dozen members of his regiment in a German artillery barrage on American trench positions in the Rouge Bouquet forest north-east of the French village of Baccarat. [...] At the time, this was a relatively quiet sector of the front, but the first battalion was struck by a German heavy artillery bombardment on the afternoon of March 7, 1918 that buried 21 men of the unit, killing 19 (of which 14 remained entombed).|$|E

6000|$|... "Really, I don't know. Somehow, I have an {{impression}} that I ought to say what I can in Wallace's favor, if only because he brought me here, and I feel like talking <b>when</b> <b>I</b> can <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sympathetic listener." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Kinney, soberly; [...] "but I {{like to see}} the {{philosophy}} of a thing <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance. Now, there's tea, for example," [...] he said, pointing to the great tin pot on the stove.|$|E

6000|$|Otterson {{looked over}} his {{shoulder}} to explain, despairingly: [...] "The trouble with me is that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> do <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to talk English, there's such a flow of language it carries me away, and I don't know just where I'm landing." ...|$|R

[...] Her two small {{children}} {{looked up at her}} with wide, dismayed eyes. They said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the unconscious tragedy they felt.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{fact that}} <b>I</b> hope to <b>get</b> back," [...] he remarked coldly, [...] "has nothing {{whatever}} {{to do with}} my liking my job <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> there. <b>As</b> a matter of fact, I hate it. At the same time, you can surely understand that there isn't any other place for a man of my age and profession." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{certainly}} sore," [...] said Phil. [...] "I must say, in a way, {{he and the}} supercargo are a team. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance, I am going to write to father {{and let him know}} exactly the sort of fellows they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I ain't. The day'll {{take care}} of itself an' show you. Now listen to what I'm tellin' you. I got a hunch myself out of your hunch.

6000|$|... "Oh, all right, all right," [...] said Mr. Dickerson. [...] "I don't blame you. I think you're {{perfectly}} excusable to {{feel the}} way you do.

6000|$|... "There isn't much to see," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{the kind}} of {{sculptor}} who works on order. I believe in the 'art for service' idea, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> order <b>I</b> fill {{it as well as}} I can, make it as beautiful as I can, and send it out on its mission. I'd like to model mantel-pieces and andirons, because they are seen and actually influence people's lives. What I started to say was this: my stuff all goes out--my real stuff; my fool failures stay by me--this thing, for instance." [...] He indicated the big clump of nude forms. [...] "I had an 'idea' <b>when</b> <b>I</b> started, but it was too ambitious and too literary. Moreover, it isn't democratic. It don't gibe with the present.
