5000|$|Alisma subcordatum, the American <b>water</b> <b>plantain,</b> is a {{perennial}} aquatic {{plant in the}} water-plantain family (Alismataceae).

Any leaves that form underwater are weak and quick to rot; they rarely remain on adult plants. A branched inflorescence with white to pink 3 petaled flowers blooms from June to September. The seeds are eaten by waterfowl and upland birds. [...] The species name subcordatum means [...] "almost heart-shaped".|$|R
