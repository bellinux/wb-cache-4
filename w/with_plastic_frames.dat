25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1980s, glasses <b>with</b> large, <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> were in fashion for both men and women. Small metal framed {{eyeglasses}} made a return to fashion in 1984 and 1985, and in the late 1980s, glasses with tortoise-shell coloring became popular. These were smaller and rounder than the type that was popular earlier in the decade. Throughout the 1980s, Ray-Ban Wayfarers were extremely popular, as worn by Tom Cruise in the 1983 movie Risky Business.|$|R
25|$|Other celebrities {{have used}} glasses to {{differentiate}} {{themselves from the}} characters they play, such as Anne Kirkbride, who wore oversized, 1980s-style round horn-rimmed glasses as Deirdre Barlow in the soap opera Coronation Street, and Masaharu Morimoto, who wears glasses to separate his professional persona as a chef from his stage persona as Iron Chef Japanese. In 2012 some NBA players wear lensless glasses <b>with</b> thick <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> like horn-rimmed glasses during post-game interviews, geek chic that draws comparisons to Steve Urkel.|$|R
5000|$|Gripping surfaces, {{particularly}} on handguns, are often {{designed to provide}} a large degree of friction to prevent the shooter's grip from shifting. This can be done by either using a material that provides a high friction, such as rubber, or by adding texture to the grips. Traditionally wood grips and stocks are provided with checkering, a process where [...] "V" [...] shaped grooves are cut into the wood at an angle to each other, leaving a pattern of pyramidal projections in the wood. Another process uses a punch to leave a random pattern of dents in the surface, called stippling; this process is better suited to complex curves than checkering, and is often found on anatomical grips. Handguns <b>with</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> will often have stippling or checkering molded into the frame.|$|E
5000|$|Many NBA players wear lensless glasses <b>with</b> thick <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> like horn-rimmed glasses during post-game interviews, geek chic {{that draws}} {{comparisons}} to Steve Urkel. Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder, {{known for his}} red frames claimed to have started the trend {{when he entered the}} league in 2008 but LeBron James of the Miami Heat disagreed. James' teammate Dwyane Wade calls them [...] "nerd glasses." [...] After the Heat won Game 4 of the 2012 NBA Finals Wade took it a step farther by wearing flip-up sunglasses. Wade said he was, [...] "paying a little homage to Dwayne Wayne tonight", referencing Kadeem Hardison's popular character from A Different World.|$|R
50|$|Wrap-arounds are a {{style of}} {{sunglasses}} characterized by being strongly curved, to wrap around the face. They may have a single curved semi-circular lens that covers both eyes {{and much of the}} same area of the face covered by protective goggles, usually <b>with</b> a minimal <b>plastic</b> <b>frame</b> and single piece of plastic serving as a nosepiece. Glasses described as wraparound may alternatively have two lenses, but again with a strongly curved frame.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{popularity}} with {{police officers in}} the United States has earned them the nickname [...] "cop shades". The two most popular styles for these are dual lenses set in metal frames (which are often confused with Aviators), and [...] "Wraparound" [...] (a single, smooth, semi-circular lens that covers both eyes {{and much of the}} same area of the face covered by protective goggles, combined <b>with</b> a minimal <b>plastic</b> <b>frame</b> and single piece of plastic serving as a nosepad). Wraparound sunglasses are also quite popular in the world of extreme sports.|$|R
5000|$|SPoRT {{stands for}} [...] "Symmetric, Patient-oriented, Rigid, Three-Dimensional active," [...] which {{it intends to}} be. The brace is symmetrical, built <b>with</b> a <b>plastic</b> <b>frame</b> {{reinforced}} <b>with</b> aluminum rods. The brace corrects hip misalignments through padding. Large, sweeping, thick pads push the spine to a corrected position. To prevent overcorrection, however, the brace also has [...] "stop" [...] pads holding the spine from moving too far in the other direction. The brace runs from just above the chair to T3 in many instances—it is successful at correcting high thoracic curves. In front, it goes around the patient's breast and up, even to pushing against the collar bone. Though it sounds restricting, it has been tested for comfort while participating in athletics. The theory holds that the support that the brace gives will help the patient's body learn to work {{as though it had}} no curve muscularly. Then the muscles would be able to support the spine, preventing further collapse. This brace is used for all curve patterns and types, even ones considered past brace treatment by other schools. The brace is typically worn 22 hours a day, and often coupled with a physical therapy program.|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the role of mechanical tension in myofibroblast differentiation using two in vivo rat models. In the first model, granulation tissue was subjected {{to an increase in}} mechanical tension by splinting a full-thickness wound <b>with</b> a <b>plastic</b> <b>frame.</b> Myofibroblast features, such as stress fiber formation, expression of ED-A fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) appeared earlier in splinted than in unsplinted wounds. Myofibroblast marker expression decreased in control wounds starting at 10 days after wounding as expected, but persisted in splinted wounds. In the second model, granuloma pouches were induced by subcutaneous croton oil injection; pouches were either left intact or released from tension by evacuation of the exudate at 14 days. The expression of myofibroblast markers was reduced after tension release in the following sequence: F-actin (2 days), alpha-SMA (3 days), and ED-A fibronectin (5 days); cell density was not affected. In both models, isometric contraction of tissue strips was measured after stimulation with smooth muscle agonists. Contractility correlated always with the level of alpha-SMA expression, being high when granulation tissue had been subjected to tension and low when it had been relaxed. Our results support the assumption that mechanical tension is crucial for myofibroblast modulation and for the maintenance of their contractile activity...|$|R

50|$|To further {{show their}} support of the environment, Deee-Lite pledged {{a portion of the}} album's profits to Greenpeace. Additionally, Infinity Within was the first Warner Music titles that was issued in an {{eco-friendly}} package called the Eco-pak. It was designed in 1991 by Ivy Hill Packaging, at the time a subsidiary of Time Warner, as a more environmentally friendly alternative to the longbox which was often discarded after purchase, and to facilitate proper display of CDs in music retail stores. The eco-pack was displayed in stores unfolded, to display titles {{in the same manner as}} longboxes. Upon purchasing a title and removing the plastic shrink wrap, the packaging was folded into the shape of a traditional CD jewel case, similar to a Digipak. By 1993, the use of the longbox was phased out as music retailers began replacing LP-sized sales racks with those to house jewelcase or digipak formats <b>with</b> the locking <b>plastic</b> <b>frames</b> (keepers); thus rendering the Eco-pak, in its original form, obsolete. As a result, Infinity Within is among the few titles ever released with the original Eco-pak design.|$|R
