50|$|The Sayre Glove, {{created by}} Electronic Visualization Laboratory in 1977, {{was the first}} <b>wired</b> <b>glove.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>wired</b> <b>glove</b> (also {{called a}} [...] "dataglove" [...] English Dictionary or [...] "cyberglove") is {{an input device}} for human-computer {{interaction}} worn like a glove.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wired</b> <b>gloves</b> {{are often}} used in virtual reality environments and to mimic human hand {{movement}} by robots.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wired</b> <b>gloves</b> and bodysuits allow gestural {{interaction}} to occur. These send hand or {{body position}} and movement {{information to the}} computer using sensors.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to <b>wired</b> <b>gloves</b> {{is to use}} a camera and computer vision to track the 3D pose and trajectory of the hand, at the cost of tactile feedback.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method of}} adding hand and finger motion {{is to have}} the {{animator}} or actor wear a data glove or <b>wired</b> <b>glove.</b> These devices very accurately measure and record the position and bend of each finger, thumb, and even the hand. Measurand's ShapeHand is made of flexible ribbons and includes 40 Fiber Optic bend/twist sensors.|$|E
50|$|Expensive {{high-end}} wired gloves {{can also}} provide haptic feedback, which is a simulation {{of the sense of}} touch. This allows a <b>wired</b> <b>glove</b> to also be used as an output device. Traditionally, wired gloves have only been available at a huge cost, with the finger bend sensors and the tracking device having to be bought separately.|$|E
50|$|It captures, with an {{integrated}} 3D camera and <b>wired</b> <b>glove,</b> the entire {{work of a}} human chef and upload it into a database. The chef's actions are translated into digital movements using gesture recognition algorithms created in collaboration with Stanford University and Carnegie Mellon University professors. Later, The Robotic Kitchen reproduces the whole sequence of actions to cook an identical meal from scratch.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} actions require a {{physical}} device. Input devices range from the common - keyboards, mice, graphics tablets, trackballs, and touchpads - to the esoteric - <b>wired</b> <b>gloves,</b> boom arms, and even omnidirectional treadmills.|$|R
50|$|On the Internet, various JavaScript virtual {{keyboards}} {{have been}} created, allowing users to type their own languages on foreign keyboards, particularly in Internet cafes. Multitouch screens allow {{the possibility to}} create virtual chorded keyboards for tablet computers, touchscreens, touchpads and <b>wired</b> <b>gloves.</b>|$|R
50|$|ASETNIOP is {{a virtual}} {{keyboard}} based on chords that appeared in 2012. The alphabet uses the 8 keys of the home row as ASET and NIOP (the eight most common letters in the English language), plus 18 chorded combinations. The layout also makes a less-cluttered 10-button keypad for tablet computers, touchscreens, touchpads, {{and can be used}} in <b>wired</b> <b>gloves.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>wired</b> <b>glove</b> has been {{traditionally}} popular in the research and engineering community. Engineers continue to develop prototypes that use innovative sensor technologies and architectures to achieve the goal of gesture recognition. For example, one such project is the Smart Glove, developed in 2009 by the then electronics engineering students Arvind Ramana, Subramanian KS, Suresh and Shiva. This project was an innovative design making interesting use of hall effect switches and custom home made bend sensors.|$|E
40|$|The term 'virtual reality' (VR) is {{currently}} {{used to describe}} a range of computer-based systems in which a user can explore a hardware and software generated 'microworld' that bears some resemblance to reality. An early application of such systems was the flight simulator used to train pilots. However, {{it is in the}} area of hi-tech games that many of the more recent developments in this field have occurred. Typically, a user will wear a helmet containing either a small video screen positioned in front of each eye, or a device that projects images directly onto the user's retinas. She might also wear an elaborately <b>wired</b> <b>glove</b> that provides tactile feedback as she attempts to physically interact with the computer generated visual environment. It was on devices and systems of this nature that our proposed investigation was to concentrate. Although this has remained the case, we have expanded our work to also include VR that mainly uses screen-based graphics - thus reflecting the expanded definition of VR (more of which later) ...|$|E

Overall aim Our overall aim was to determine the nature and capabilities of VR devices and systems that have already been developed, and of those that are under development; and to investigate the educational and instructional uses to which these devices and systems are already being put and to which they may be put in the near future. In this regard it was not our intention to argue the case for VR in education – indeed, in some cases we would do quite the contrary – but to provide relevant Macpherson and Keppell 61 information, and what we hoped would be enlightened discussion, so that educators in different situations could make up their own minds on the issues...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} <b>wired</b> <b>gloves</b> {{available}} to home users in 1987 was the Nintendo Power Glove. This {{was designed as a}} gaming glove for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It had a crude tracker and finger bend sensors, plus buttons on the back. The resistive sensors in the PowerGlove were also used by hobbyists to create their own datagloves.|$|R
50|$|The {{ability to}} {{manipulate}} a remote object or environment {{is an important}} aspect for some telepresence users, and can be implemented in large number of ways depending {{on the needs of}} the user. Typically, the movements of the user's hands (position in space, and posture of the fingers) are sensed by <b>wired</b> <b>gloves,</b> inertial sensors, or absolute spatial position sensors. A robot in the remote location then copies those movements as closely as possible. This ability is also known as teleoperation.|$|R
25|$|<b>Wired</b> <b>gloves.</b> These {{can provide}} input to the {{computer}} about the position and rotation of the hands using magnetic or inertial tracking devices. Furthermore, some gloves can detect finger bending {{with a high degree}} of accuracy (5-10 degrees), or even provide haptic feedback to the user, which is a simulation of the sense of touch. The first commercially available hand-tracking glove-type device was the DataGlove, a glove-type device which could detect hand position, movement and finger bending. This uses fiber optic cables running down the back of the hand. Light pulses are created and when the fingers are bent, light leaks through small cracks and the loss is registered, giving an approximation of the hand pose.|$|R
40|$|As {{virtual reality}} (VR) is {{becoming}} a more viable option for real world skills training, developers are attempting to uncover the methods and technologies {{that will lead to}} the most efficient transfer of knowledge and proficiency of the target tasks. Within these optimization issues lies the question that asks what type of VR interaction device will provide users with maximum control within the virtual environment (VE) while being a convenient and comfortable tool to use. An ideal interaction device should balance the factors of functionality, user satisfaction, and cost while yielding a well-designed product in the process. Although the needs for all VR systems are not the same, popular interaction devices in use today include <b>wired</b> <b>gloves</b> as well as VR wands, the current mode of interaction for study during this summer REU ISR project...|$|R
5000|$|... "Me, the Machine" [...] was {{recorded}} using gestural-music <b>wired</b> <b>gloves</b> and premiered {{as part of}} Earth Day 2012, together with a re-release of 'the first ever crowdsourced nature film', Love the Earth (November 2010 - Heap and Thomas Ermacora). [...] On 29 August 2012, [...] "The Listening Chair" [...] was performed at the Royal Albert Hall, South Kensington, London, conducted by USA composer Eric Whitacre.

50|$|The {{final version}} of the Baby was the type 554 Antarctic Baby, built as {{photographic}} aircraft for the 1921-1922 Shackleton-Rowett Expedition to Antarctica. This had an 80 hp (60 kW) le Rhone engine, raised tailplanes, rounded wingtips and tubular steel struts replacing rigging wires to avoid the problems of tensioning rigging <b>wires</b> with <b>gloved</b> hands. Like the Water Baby, it was a floatplane.|$|R
30|$|As the {{underpinning}} technology, VR {{has been}} defined as a 3 D computer-generated alternative environment to be immersed in, for navigating around and interacting with (Briggs 1996), or as a component of communication taking place in a ‘synthetic’ space, which embeds human as its integral part (Regenbrecht and Donath 1997). The definitions of VR systems usually includes a computer capable of real-time animation, controlled by a set of <b>wired</b> <b>gloves</b> and a position tracker, and using a head-mounted stereoscopic display as visual output. For instance, Regenbrecht and Donath (1997) defined the tangible components of VR as a congruent set of hardware and software, with actors within a three-dimensional or multi-dimensional input/output space, where actors can interact with other autonomous objects, in real time. VR has also been defined as a simulated world, which comprises of some computer-generated images conceived via head mounted eye goggles and wired clothing – thereby enabling the end users to interact in a realistic three-dimensional situation (Yoh 2001).|$|R
40|$|Virtual reality, VR, is an {{emerging}} computer interface that strives to make simulations so realistic that users believe, {{if only for}} a moment, that they are experiencing "the real thing. " Highly realistic and believable simulations are accomplished using high-speed graphics supercomputers, three-dimensional graphics accelerators, head-mounted display devices, <b>wired</b> <b>gloves,</b> spatial audio processing, psychological and cognitive skills and numerous other technologies and techniques [7]. Less realistic though still effective VR is available on modern personal computers. As the speed and capabilities of personal computers rapidly increase, and as the cost of high-performance graphics computers continues to drop, we can expect to see high-quality VR on the average desktop within the next 5 to 10 years. The question then, is “How can we take advantage of this new technology to enhance and improve engineering education, and how can the skills we gain as a result be applied to other areas of engineering? ” In order to answer these questions, work has been conducted at the University of Michigan to develop a series of VR-based educational modules [1 - 2]. This paper will briefly discuss these modules, {{as well as some of}} the things that have been learned during their development, and how educators can download and implement the modules...|$|R

A good stout {{pair of gloves}} for handling barbed <b>wire</b> or fur <b>gloves</b> (lined) would be acceptable. (Lt. Cecil Louis' letter to his wife, 1916) ...|$|R
5000|$|Flight {{operations}} {{begin on}} the 22d, {{and on the}} first morning patrol, fifteen Fokkers were seen diving on the squadron's [...] "C" [...] flight, outnumbering them five-to-one. The 17th's pilots, however, returned their fire and eventually about thirty aircraft were engaged in the aerial battle and downed six enemy aircraft. A Lt Tillinghast, was shot down in the battle. He turned up later in London with a remarkable story of how he was captured by the Germans and taken to {{a house in the}} rear of their lines. Being locked up in a room, he managed to escape though a hole in the roof and made his way from Valenciennes to Belgium, where he obtained a suit of civilian clothing. Friendly Belgians moved him from one home to another at night on an underground railway. Finally he reached Brussels, where he moved freely on the streets. He even went to the length, it seems, of taking a streetcar ride to a neighboring German Aerodrome that he inspected carefully and at length. Somewhere in Brussels he became friends with a Belgian engineer who ran the electric plant from which the current for charging the frontier wire barrier was generated. The engineer let him into all his official secrets and gave him a clippers and <b>wire</b> <b>gloves.</b> Having set the hour of his crossing over, the engineer gave him final instructions about making good his escape and managed to cross over onto our side of the line.|$|R
5000|$|Much of the {{interior}} technology introduced in the RL sedan {{is found in the}} optional [...] "Technology Package". This package includes the latest version of Acura's navigation system, complete with a rear view camera, XM Nav-Traffic real-time traffic monitoring, and Zagat restaurant reviews. The package also features a 10-speaker ELS Surround audio system with DTS and Dolby Pro Logic II surround sound. The audio system plays DVD-Audio discs as well. Both stereos come with a 1/8" [...] (a 3.5mm) auxiliary input jack, which may be used to plug in external sources such as iPods. For 2007, Acura also offered an iPod adapter for the RDX, which was <b>wired</b> into the <b>glove</b> box, and allowed the iPod to be controlled through the RDX's sound system interface. Due to hardware incompatibilities the Honda/Acura iPod musiclink has been discontinued as of model year 2008. 2010+ models come standard with a USB connection that interfaces with Apple iPod players and other USB mass storage devices, such as flash drives that contain MP3, WMA6 or AAC music files while being stored in the center console.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objectives}} for the glove project include taking various measurements from human subjects {{during and after}} they perform different tasks in the glove box, acquiring data from these tests and determining the accuracy of these results, interpreting and analyzing this data, and using the data to better understand how hand injuries are caused during EVAs. 1 Some of these measurements include force readings, temperature readings, and micro-circulatory blood flow. 1 The three glove conditions tested were ungloved (a comfort glove was worn to house the sensors), Series 4000, and Phase VI. The general approach/procedure for the glove sensor feasibility project is as follows: 1. Prepare test subject for testing. This includes attaching numerous sensors (approximately 50) to the test subject, wiring, and weaving the sensors and <b>wires</b> in the <b>glove</b> which helps to keep everything together. This also includes recording baseline moisture data using the Vapometer and MoistSense. 2. Pressurizing the glove box. Once the glove box is pressurized to the desired pressure (4. 3 psid), testing can begin. 3. Testing. The test subject will perform a series of tests, some of which include pinching a load cell, making a fist, pushing down on a force plate, and picking up metal pegs, rotating them 90 degrees, and placing {{them back in the}} peg board. 4. Post glove box testing data collection. After the data is collected from inside the glove box, the Vapometer and MoistSense device will be used to collect moisture data from the subject's hand. 5. Survey. At the conclusion of testing, he/she will complete a survey that asks questions pertaining to comfort/discomfort levels of the glove, glove sizing, as well as offering any additional feedback...|$|R
