5|$|Ann (Rashida Jones), who is {{preparing}} for her first date with Mark (Paul Schneider), worriedly asks Leslie (Amy Poehler) if she has any reservations, since Leslie previously had feelings for him. Leslie insists she is fine. Later, Leslie and Tom (Aziz Ansari) visit a community garden in the Pawnee pit, where they find <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be marijuana.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> {{to have been}} a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E

5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains {{as the cause}} of <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006 a major {{community}} archaeological dig was organised in the grounds by the Museum of London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre, {{as part of}} the centenary celebrations of the opening of Bruce Castle Museum, in which large numbers of local youths took part. As well as large quantities of discarded everyday objects, the chalk foundations of <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be an earlier house on the site were discovered.|$|E
5|$|In places, the {{seemingly}} at odds architectural styles {{can be viewed}} simultaneously; this is particularly so in the chimney stacks which resemble Islamic minarets. These coupled with the castellated parapets add <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be an almost Moorish element to the late English Renaissance air of the northern facade.|$|E

5|$|The {{ambiguity}} {{inherent in}} the IAU's definition was highlighted in December 2005, when the Spitzer Space Telescope observed Cha 110913-773444 (above), only eight times Jupiter's mass with <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be the beginnings of its own planetary system. Were this object found in orbit around another star, {{it would have been}} termed a planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E
5|$|When Rotting {{first came}} out it stirred {{a huge amount of}} {{controversy}} due to its cover art— a traditional grim reaper figure licking <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be Jesus Christ's face. It was based upon a medieval painting. The cover artist himself, Kelson Frost, refused to paint a crown of thorns over the man's head, which would readily identify him as the Christian messiah.|$|E

Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be a cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2000, Corzine denied {{having made}} {{payments}} to African-American ministers, although the foundation controlled by Jon and Joanne Corzine had paid one influential black church $25,000. Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, {{director of the}} Black Ministers Council, had campaigned against a form of racial profiling whereby police officers stop minority drivers and had gotten New Jersey state police superintendent, Carl A. Williams, fired. Corzine had donated to Jackson prior to getting <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be a reciprocal endorsement.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main road, there are five avenues, each planted in its own species and named accordingly: oak, poplar, birch, lime, and sycamore. The tree-lined avenues give Barrhill a charming appearance. Wason had trees planted in an unusual pattern around the market square. Residents only noticed in 1975 when viewing an aerial photo that those trees form <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be the three circles of Trinity, with the two inner avenues {{possibly}} symbolising a crucifix.|$|E

5|$|Burns talks Homer into {{cheating}} {{and they}} use a snowmobile to reach the cabin. Arriving early, they settle down in the comfortable surroundings and quickly become friends. While clinking their champagne glasses, they inadvertently cause an avalanche that buries the entire cabin. The two make several attempts at escaping but are unsuccessful. The other employees reach <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be their destination; however, it is actually a ranger station and they begin to realize that something bad has happened to their colleagues.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mating}} season, the male moults its brown {{feathers}} and displays a fiery red plumage. It may fluff its red back and shoulder feathers out so they cover {{part of the}} wings in a puffball-display. It will fly about and confront another male to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female. It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. 90% of the time, the male presents to a female in <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> to be a courtship ritual. The other 10% of the time, it presents to another male {{in an act of}} apparent aggression.|$|E
