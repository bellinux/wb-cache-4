5|$|While {{disagreeing with}} Nehru about socialist {{economic}} model, Gandhi also critiqued capitalism that {{was driven by}} endless wants and a materialistic view of man. This, he believed, created a vicious vested system of materialism {{at the cost of}} other human needs such as spirituality and social relationships. To Gandhi, states Parekh, both communism and capitalism <b>were</b> <b>wrong,</b> in part because both focussed exclusively on materialistic view of man, and because the former deified the state with unlimited power of violence, while the latter deified capital. A better economic system is one which does not impoverish one's culture and spiritual pursuits.|$|E
5|$|King Louis XV honored Franklin {{after seeing}} {{some of the}} {{electrical}} experiments done in the royal palace at St. Germain near Paris, France. However physicist Jean-Antoine Nollet (1700–1770), a skeptic who had published his own theory on electricity, declared Franklin's ideas <b>were</b> <b>wrong.</b> He claimed in 1753 that Franklin's lightning rod was not only dangerous but useless and would attract lightning bolts to wooden buildings, causing them to be hit more often. Franklin in time proved to the scientific community that his lightning rod invention not only was a protective device, but it {{also served as a}} preventive way to divert destructive lightning bolts away from hitting buildings.|$|E

5|$|Teams that toured other {{countries}} often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception {{have suggested that}} home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points {{out that it is}} impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions <b>were</b> <b>wrong,</b> particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.|$|E

25|$|In late 2006, Dr. Lee Wei Ling, head of National Neuroscience Institute, {{publicly}} {{questioned the}} policy of Philip Yeo and A*Star, asserting that they <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> by putting public money on competing with western countries on cutting-edge research.

25|$|As {{it turns}} out, {{most of those}} {{predictions}} <b>were</b> <b>wrong.</b> While Justice Burton harbored fears {{at one point that}} he might be the only Justice to vote against the government's position, he was encouraged by his private conversations with other Justices.

25|$|The government, therefore, while {{continuing}} {{to insist that the}} court's rulings <b>were</b> <b>wrong,</b> announced that it would accept them. The elections were held on 15 April 1953 with coloured voters in the Cape voting alongside white voters. Despite this, the National Party was returned in government with a larger majority: 94 seats out of 156, as opposed to 79 seats out of 153 in 1948.|$|E

25|$|The last {{emergence}} {{observed in}} the series was on 29April (at 10:30:06). By this time, Io had completed thirty orbits around Jupiter since 7March: the apparent orbital period is 42hours 29minutes 3seconds. The difference seems tiny – 32seconds – but it meant that the emergence on 29April was occurring a quarter-hour after {{it would have been}} predicted. The only alternative explanation was that the observations on 7 and 14March <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> by two minutes.|$|E
25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only {{at the level of}} their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments <b>were</b> <b>wrong,</b> but that it was the way they <b>were</b> <b>wrong</b> that was interesting.|$|E
50|$|However, his {{predictions}} {{have also}} proved to <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> on certain occasions. His prediction of a lunar eclipse on March 21, 1828 <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> by fifteen minutes. His prediction {{of the character}} of the eclipse also proved to <b>be</b> <b>wrong</b> as the eclipse was only a three-eighths eclipse and not five-eighths as he had predicted.|$|R

In the United States, on the other hand, mainstream economics goes on as if the controversy had never occurred. Macroeconomics textbooks discuss 'capital' {{as if it were}} a well-defined concept [...] which it is not, except in a very special one-capital-good world (or under other unrealistically restrictive conditions). The problems of heterogeneous capital goods have also been ignored in the 'rational expectations revolution' and in virtually all econometric work." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Frege-Geach problem [...] - [...] {{named for}} Peter Geach, who {{developed}} {{it from the}} writings of Gottlob Frege [...] - [...] claims that by subscribing to Expressivism one necessarily accepts that the meaning of [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to tell lies" [...] {{is different from the}} meaning of the [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to tell lies" [...] part of the conditional [...] "If it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to tell lies, then it <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> to get your little brother to lie", and that therefore Expressivism is an inadequate explanation for moral language.|$|R

25|$|What {{eventually}} led to Hamilton being defeated for re-election in 1984, was a 1980 reapportionment battle against the Black Caucus, who wanted the reapportionment figured to their advantage. Hamilton felt so strongly they <b>were</b> <b>wrong,</b> that she ended up testifying before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 1982. The Black Caucus were so angered by what they {{believed to be a}} betrayal by Hamilton, that they put Mable Thomas against her in the primary.
