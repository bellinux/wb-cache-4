40|$|To control second {{harmonic}} generation (SHG) in silica-based glasses is crucial for fabricating photonic devices, such as frequency doubling waveguides. Here, we investigated SHG of laser in-duced nonlinear optical crystals in silica-based glasses, according to <b>writing</b> <b>speed</b> and pulse energy. We observed two regions with different probing laser polarization angular dependence: a) a well-defined cosine-like curve with period of 180 ˚ at low pulse energy (0. 8 µJ) whatever the <b>writing</b> <b>speed</b> or at high pulse energy (1. 4 µJ) with high <b>writing</b> <b>speed</b> (25 µm/s). This is accounted for by a well-defined texture for the nano crystals with their polar axis oriented perpendicular to the writing laser polarization; and b) a double cosine-like curve revealing a second texture of the crystals at high pulse energy (1. 4 µJ) with low <b>writing</b> <b>speed</b> (5 µm/s) and with the polar axis oriented closer parallel to the writing laser polarization.

25|$|SD card {{speed is}} customarily rated by its {{sequential}} read or <b>write</b> <b>speed.</b> The sequential performance aspect {{is the most}} relevant for storing and retrieving large files (relative to block sizes internal to the flash memory), such as images and multimedia. Small data (such as file names, sizes and timestamps) falls under the much lower speed limit of random access, which can be the limiting factor in some use cases.|$|E

Burning HD DVD (including Dual Layer) with a 1× <b>write</b> <b>speed,</b> it could also burn DVDs and CDs. In a test of the SD-L902A by C't computer magazine with Verbatim discs, the written HD DVD-Rs suffered from high noise levels, as a result, the written discs could not be recognized by the external HD DVD drive of the Xbox 360, though they could be read back by the SD-L902A.|$|E
25|$|In addition, speed {{may vary}} {{markedly}} between writing {{a large amount}} of data to a single file (sequential access, as when a digital camera records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a random-access use common in smartphones). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a <b>write</b> <b>speed</b> of 1.38MB/s, while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not necessarily mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower.

25|$|In modern drives, {{there is}} one head for each {{magnetic}} platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or in some older designs a stepper motor. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having {{the same amount of}} data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use zone bit recording – increasing the <b>write</b> <b>speed</b> from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.|$|E
25|$|The microSD {{removable}} miniaturized Secure Digital {{flash memory}} cards were originally named T-Flash or TF, abbreviations of TransFlash. TransFlash and microSD cards are functionally identical allowing either {{to operate in}} devices made for the other. SanDisk had conceived microSD when its chief technology officer and the chief technology officer of Motorola concluded that current memory cards were too large for mobile phones. The card was originally called T-Flash, but just before product launch, T-Mobile sent a cease-and-desist order to SanDisk claiming that T-Mobile owned the trademark on T-(anything), and the name was changed to TransFlash. At CTIA Wireless 2005, the SDA announced the small microSD form factor along with SDHC secure digital high capacity formatting in excess of 2GB with a minimum sustained read and <b>write</b> <b>speed</b> of 17.6Mbit/s. SanDisk induced the SDA to administer the microSD standard. The SDA approved the final microSD specification on July 13, 2005. Initially, microSD cards were available in capacities of 32, 64, and 128MB.|$|E
25|$|IOPS {{performance}} of a ZFS storage pool can suffer if the ZFS raid is not appropriately configured. This applies to all types of RAID, {{in one way or}} another. If the zpool consists of only one group of disks configured as, say, eight disks in RAIDZ2, then the IOPS performance will be that of a single disk (<b>write</b> <b>speed</b> will be equivalent to 6 disks, but random read speed will be similar to a single disk). However, there are ways to mitigate this IOPS performance problem, for instance add SSDs as L2ARC cache— which can boost IOPS into 100.000s. In short, a zpool should consist of several groups of vdevs, each vdev consisting of 8–12 disks, if using RAIDZ. It is not recommended to create a zpool with a single large vdev, say 20 disks, because IOPS performance will be that of a single disk, which also means that resilver time will be very long (possibly weeks with future large drives).|$|E
