The national government will control the destination of the resources and guarantees transparency in the whole spending process. According to the minister, Colombia should already have reached full drinking water coverage, given the past investments in the sector.|$|E

5|$|At {{its final}} {{landfall}} in Guangdong, Imbudo produced strong winds, with a peak gust of 200km/h (124mph) measured at Shangchuan Island. At Yangjiang, gusts reached 159km/h (99mph), causing eleven boats to sink. There, over 10,000trees fell {{due to the}} strong winds, more than half in the city, and 7,649homes were damaged or destroyed. In Zhanjiang, the storm damaged power lines and water pumps, leaving residents <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> water. Imbudo spawned tornadoes in Luoding and Zhanjiang, damaging dozens of houses and killing 6,000chickens. Throughout Guangdong, Imbudo destroyed 595,000houses and caused ¥1.9billion (CNY, $230million USD). There were at least eight deaths in the province.|$|E
5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts {{the integrity}} and accessibility of essential information in the genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. <b>Without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{the huge}} numbers of {{newcomers}} were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E
5|$|Melvin {{therefore}} {{resorted to}} arresting suspects– including juveniles, {{some of them}} regarded as vulnerable– and holding them for days <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> lawyers. Of the 359 people arrested {{in connection with the}} inquiry in 1985 and 1986, just 94 were interviewed {{in the presence of a}} lawyer. Many of the confessions that resulted, whether directly about the murder, or about having taken part in the rioting, were made before the lawyer was given access to the interviewee.|$|E
5|$|Only 13days after Eline {{struck the}} country, Cyclone Gloria also hit northeastern Madagascar, {{bringing}} additional damage and flooding. The two storms collectively {{killed at least}} 140people, although there was initial uncertainty in the toll due to disrupted communications. Floods from the two storm inundated 70% of homes and wrecked 70% of the crops in the districts of Andapa, Sambava, Antalaha, and Vohemar. About 12,000people in 114villages were isolated. Rice fields were flooded for over a week, and coffee and banana crops had severe losses. Collectively, 12,230people were left <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> clean water.|$|E

5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, the striped {{burrowing}} frog (Cyclorana alboguttata) regularly aestivates during the hot, dry season in Australia, surviving in a dormant state <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> {{food and water}} for nine or ten months of the year. It burrows underground and curls up inside a protective cocoon formed by its shed skin. Researchers at the University of Queensland have found that during aestivation, the metabolism of the frog is altered and the operational efficiency of the mitochondria is increased. This means that the limited amount of energy available to the comatose frog is used in a more efficient manner. This survival mechanism is only useful to animals that remain completely unconscious {{for an extended period}} of time and whose energy requirements are low because they are cold-blooded and have no need to generate heat. Other research showed that, to provide these energy requirements, muscles atrophy, but hind limb muscles are preferentially unaffected. Frogs have been found to have upper critical temperatures of around 41 degrees Celsius.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among dead leaves, in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{believed}} in Twelver Shia Islam that ‘aql, divine wisdom, {{is the source}} of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called Hikmah and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam is not the recipient of a divine revelation, he has a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as al-Jafr and al-Jamia. Imamate, or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> divine guidance.|$|E

5|$|Kesselring's memoirs were {{published}} in 1953, as Soldat bis zum letzten Tag (A Soldier to the Last Day). They were reprinted in English as A Soldier's Record a year later. Although written {{while he was in}} prison, <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> his papers, the memoirs formed a valuable resource, informing military historians on topics such as the background to the invasion of the Soviet Union. When the English edition was published, Kesselring's contentions that the Luftwaffe was not defeated in the air in the Battle of Britain and that Operation Sea Lion—the invasion of Britain—was thought about but never seriously planned were controversial. In 1955, he published a second book, Gedanken zum Zweiten Weltkrieg (Thoughts on the Second World War).|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{statements}} originated from the juveniles who had been arrested shortly after the murder. They included Jason Hill, the 13-year-old who had been held for three days in his underpants and a blanket, <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> his parents or a lawyer. (Hill received £30,000 in damages from the police over his treatment.) Hill had not been told that his statement {{was going to be}} read out in court during the detectives' trial; he first learned that it had been used when he heard it on television. Another statement was from Mark Pennant, also a juvenile who had been arrested during the first inquiry. Overall it appeared that Silcott was being retried.|$|E
5|$|Steinhaus, {{because of}} his Jewish background, spent the Nazi {{occupation}} in hiding, first among friends in Lwów, then in the small towns of Osiczyna, near Zamość and Berdechów, near Kraków. The Polish anti-Nazi resistance provided him with false documents of a forest ranger who had died sometime earlier, {{by the name of}} Grzegorz Krochmalny. Under this name he taught clandestine classes (higher education was forbidden for Poles under the German occupation). Worried about the possibility of imminent death if captured by Germans, Steinhaus, <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> any scholarly material, reconstructed from memory and recorded all the mathematics he knew, in addition to writing other voluminous memoirs, of which only a little part has been published.|$|E

The claws are long and straight, and the third and fourth toes are slightly webbed at the base.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} {{and sent to}} the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses were carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|The tribes traded freely, {{and soon}} many had {{acquired}} French guns, while others had traded for Spanish horses. Tribes <b>without</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> either resource were left at a disadvantage. The Lipan Apache, {{who had been}} seasonal farmers, were soon pressed by the Comanche, who had horses, and the Wichita, who had guns. The Apaches were bitter enemies of the Tejas of East Texas and had transferred their enmity to the Spanish as friends of the Tejas. After discovering San Antonio in 1720, the Apache began repeatedly raiding the area to steal livestock, especially horses. An average of 3Spaniards died each year in Texas {{as a result of}} Apache attacks, with approximately 100animals taken each year. In retaliation, the Spanish launched multiple attacks on the Apaches, capturing horses and mules, hides and other plunder, and taking Apache captives, whom the Spanish used as household servants. By 1731, however, the San Antonio garrison was begging the government for help in negotiating a peace with the tribes.|$|E
