The original concepts, used since the first game, took elements from the Western role-playing games Wizardry and Ultima. A great deal of care was taken to make the gameplay intuitive so that players could easily start to play the game. The series features a number of religious overtones which were heavily censored in the Western NES versions.|$|E

Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies explains that Agyeman was cast in [...] before Children of Earth had been officially commissioned. Because Law & Order offered her 13 episodes a year, she went with that over Torchwood which {{had been reduced to}} 5.

Agyeman does not rule out returning to the show at a later date, however. Davies reveals in his non-fiction book [...] that Martha was also intended to appear in The Sarah Jane Adventures series two finale Enemy of the Bane in December 2008, but the character had to be replaced with classic series character Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) [...] "at the last minute" [...] due to Agyeman's role in Law & Order: UK; had Martha appeared, the character would have appeared in all three programmes in the franchise.|$|E

2500|$|The title {{refers to}} a passage {{about the end of}} the world from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, {{beginning}} with the words [...] "And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour" [...] (Revelation 8:1). Thus, in the confessional scene the knight states: [...] "Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?...What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to?" [...] Death, impersonating the confessional priest, refuses to reply. Similarly, later, as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors, Antonius Block says: [...] "Faith is a torment – did you know that? It is like loving someone <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." [...] Bragg notes that the concept of the [...] "Silence of God" [...] in the face of evil, or the pleas of believers or would-be-believers, may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by Bergman's father, a chaplain in the State Lutheran Church. Interestingly, in Bergman's original radio play sometimes translated as A Painting on Wood, the figure of Death in a Dance of Death is represented not by an actor, but by silence, [...] "mere nothingness, mere absence...terrifying...the void." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several reviews {{have also}} noted how well Gone Girl shows the tricky nature of media representation. Nick seems guilty due to media {{coverage}} before a trial occurs. Salon.com notes that [...] "Flynn, a former {{staff writer for}} Entertainment Weekly, is especially good on the infiltration of the media into {{every aspect of the}} missing-person investigation, from Nick's cop-show-based awareness that the husband is always the primary suspect to a raving tabloid-TV Fury, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> to avenge all wronged women and obviously patterned on Nancy Grace." [...] Entertainment writer Jeff Giles notes that the novel also plays on reader expectations that the husband will be the murderer, expectations that have also been shaped by the media, writing, [...] "The first half of Gone Girl is a nimble, caustic riff on our Nancy Grace culture {{and the way in which}} 'The butler did it' has morphed into 'The husband did it.'" [...] A New York Daily News review also notes the novel's interest in how quickly a husband can be convicted in the media: [...] "In a media society informed by Nancy Grace, when a wife goes missing, the husband murdered her. There’s no need for a body to arrive at a verdict." [...] A San Francisco Chronicle review also notes the book's recurring commentary on media influence: [...] "Flynn pokes smart fun at cable news, our collective obsession with social media and reality TV." ...|$|E
2500|$|A system {{recommended}} by some organisations, mostly {{those involved in}} technical diving (GUE, CMAS-ISA, other tech and cave diving groups) is to equip the regulator that is normally used throughout the dive (the [...] "primary") with a long hose, typically [...] long. This is the regulator that is donated to a diver <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>out</b> of air. The [...] "secondary" [...] or [...] "backup" [...] regulator is then reserved for the donor diver and is on a short hose, suspended just under the chin by a [...] "necklace" [...] {{which can be broken}} free in an emergency. The principal advantage is that the diver who is in trouble will receive a regulator that is known to be working, and providing breathing gas that is appropriate for the current depth, and quite possibly more quickly than if the clipped off octopus were to be donated. Donation of the long hose is particularly beneficial for cave and wreck penetration diving where the divers sharing air may be obliged to pass through small openings, as the length of the hose allows them to swim in single file where necessary. The length of the hose also allows the divers to swim side-by-side or one above the other in all possible arrangements. Another advantage is that the secondary regulator is stowed in a position where it is out of the way, protected from strong water flow, contamination and snags and where the diver will notice if it leaks, but accessible to the diver without requiring the use of hands, as it is possible to pick up the mouthpiece by dipping the chin. [...] This arrangement is slightly more cumbersome to use and requires greater skill to wear, deploy and recover.The benefits may not outweigh the disadvantages for open water divers in relatively low hazard conditions.|$|E
