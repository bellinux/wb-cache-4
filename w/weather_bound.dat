5|$|Jackson landed his Mooney at Furnace Creek Airport (the lowest {{elevation}} airstrip in North America) {{near the}} visitor center of Death Valley National Park early in the afternoon of 29 January 2011. He had no flight plan filed. Following a brief stop he took off in clear, sunny <b>weather</b> <b>bound</b> for Santa Monica, but {{a few minutes later}} he crashed and died about 6.5 miles (11km) south of the airfield in a dry lake bed. The wreckage was discovered by park rangers on the morning of 31 January, and was later examined by investigators who did not determine a cause for the accident. Jackson was survived by two brothers and two sisters, and by his fourth wife, Terri, their daughter Brianna, and Aja, Jackson's stepdaughter. He was survived by his third wife Betty Bennett and their son Lindsey and daughter Alex. Jackson was survived by his second wife Ruth Davis who sang background vocals for Springsteen. He was also survived by his first wife Margaret who married him when they were both 21 years old. Margaret was with him when he started JANDS, and accompanied him to the U.S. when he went to work for Clair Brothers.|$|E

2500|$|One of the {{highlights}} of the 1933 World's Fair was the arrival of the German airship Graf Zeppelin on October 26, 1933. After circling Lake Michigan near the exposition for two hours, Commander Hugo Eckener landed the 776-foot airship at the nearby Curtiss-Wright Airport in Glenview. It remained on the ground for twenty-five minutes (from 1 to 1:25pm) then took off ahead of an approaching <b>weather</b> front <b>bound</b> for Akron, Ohio. For some Chicagoans, however, the appearance of the Graf Zeppelin over their fair city was not a welcome sight, as the airship had become a prominent reminder of the ascendancy of Adolf Hitler to power earlier that same year. This triggered dissension in the days following its visit, particularly within the city's large German-American population.|$|R
40|$|The Terminal Area Productivity {{project has}} {{developed}} the technologies required (weather measurement, wake prediction, and wake measurement) {{to determine the}} aircraft spacing needed to prevent wake vortex encounters in various weather conditions. The system performs <b>weather</b> measurements, predicts <b>bounds</b> on wake vortex behavior in those conditions, derives safe wake spacing criteria, and validates the wake predictions with wake vortex measurements. System performance to date indicates that the potential runway arrival rate increase with Aircraft VOrtex Spacing System (AVOSS), considering common path effects and ATC delivery variance, is 5 % to 12 % depending on the ratio of large and heavy aircraft. The concept demonstration system, using early generation algorithms and minimal optimization, is performing the wake predictions with adequate robustness such that only 4 hard exceedances have been observed in 1235 wake validation cases. This performance demonstrates the feasibility of predicting wake behavior bounds with multiple uncertainties present, including the unknown aircraft weight and speed, weather persistence between the wake prediction and the observations, {{and the location of}} the weather sensors several kilometers from the approach location. A concept {{for the use of the}} AVOSS system for parallel runway operations has been suggested, and an initial study at the JFK International Airport suggests that a simplified AVOSS system can be successfully operated using only a single lidar as both the weather sensor and the wake validation instrument. Such a selfcontained AVOSS would be suitable for wake separation close to the airport, as is required for parallel approach concepts such as SOIA...|$|R
50|$|From the southward and eastward, {{bound for}} Bering Sea, {{there are three}} passes used by deep-draft vessels, known collectively as the Fox Islands Passes, and {{respectively}} as Unimak, Akutan, and Unalga passes. The largest and most desirable one to use in thick and foggy weather is the eastern one, Unimak Pass. This is clear of hidden dangers, the widest of the three, and is comparatively free from tide rips. It is especially recommended for sailing vessels, and for steamers bound direct to the northward. Akutan and Unalga passes are convenient for steam vessels bound to Unalaska Bay, but, being narrow and having strong currents and tide rips at times, are not recommended for sailing vessels bound north. A fair wind is almost necessary for the passage, and from the southward this would bring fog. The pass between Ashmiak and Ugamok islands on the east and Sea Lion Island on the west may be clear of dangers, {{but it is not}} recommended. All of the other minor passes between Unimak and Akutan passes are known to be full of rocks and reefs. The mountains in this vicinity would be excellent landmarks if they could be seen, but in summer they are almost always obscured by fogs or low-lying clouds. The lower hills and islands and objects near the sea level furnish the available landmarks. In coming from the southward or eastward in clear <b>weather,</b> and if <b>bound</b> through Akutan or Unalga passes, it is recommended to steer for Tigalda Island as the first land to be made. It is high and prominent, and when once made a course can be shaped for any of the three passes.|$|R

40|$|International audienceMadagascar is an Archean to Neoproterozoic {{continental}} crust {{surrounded by}} transform, oblique and divergentmargins: the oblique Morondava Basin to the west, pounded by the Davie Fracture Zone, {{and to the}} north, thedivergent Mahajanga (Majunga) Basin connected to the Somali Oceanic Basin. This 1600 km long island is ahigh axial plateau with elevations from 1200 to 1800 m. The top of the plateau corresponds to <b>weathered</b> planationsurfaces (etchplains), <b>bounded</b> by more or less high scarps. We here present geological arguments for the age and {{the timing of the}} Madagascar Plateau. This analysis is basedon a double, coupled analysis of the onshore geomorphology (stepped planation surfaces) and the offshore marginstratigraphy (seismic stratigraphy and wells). The geomorphological analysis is based on a characterization, a mapping and dating of stepped planation surfaces(mantled to stripped etchplains, pediments to pediplains). The dating is based on their geometrical relationshipswith dated magmatic rocks. The difference of elevation between two planation surfaces (corresponding to localbase level) provides a proxy of the uplift. The sequence stratigraphic analysis is based on a biostratigraphicreevaluation of 4 industrial wells (foraminifers and nannofossils on cuttings). Uplift periods are characterized by(1) seaward tiltings of the margins overlain by planar reflectors, (2) forced regression wedges and (3) upstreamerosions of older sediments recorded by fauna/flora reworking. (1) During Paleocene to Middle Miocene times (66 to 13 Ma), Madagascar is a quite flat low elevation domainwith remnants of an oldest pre-Madagascar Trap (90 Ma) surface. This low relief is highly weathered with growthof numerous lateritic profiles and surrounded by large carbonate platforms with no siliciclastic sands influx. (2) The Late Miocene is the paroxysm of uplift with (1) a tilting of the margin (Morondova), (2) an increase of thesiliciclastic sand flux since middle Miocene and (3) a major stepping of dated planation surfaces. (3) The end result of this uplift is a convex up shape pattern for the end Cretaceous surface weathered duringEocene times, creating the present-day dome morphology (with a central plateau) of Madagascar. (4) The amplitude of this uplift can be estimated based on the present-day elevation of Late Eocene lagoonalsediments located 100 km north-east of Toliara and now at an elevation of 900 m. If the absolute sea level wasaround 50 m (Miller et al., 2005) above present-day sea level during Late Eocene times, this means a surface upliftof around 850 m. (5) The mechanism of this uplift has to explain a very long wavelength deformation (x 1000 km) necessary due tomantle dynamics. The relationships with the other East African domes (Ethiopia, East Africa, South Africa) arediscussed.
