[...] Gordon Lish's O.

The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> I'm capable of and this album will give me the opportunity to show people what I can really do." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{replace the}} [...] "Italian" [...] style of Trapattoni, Koeman wanted Benfica {{to have a}} [...] "Dutch" [...] approach; he said, [...] "A team like Benfica always has to play to win. In <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> of this team, we can {{perfectly}} play in a 4–3–3," [...] and that finding the right balance between offence and defence in the playing style mattered. Vital to his new formation, Koeman asked for more wingers, such as Andy van der Meyde, and Boudewijn Zenden, but Benfica did not sign them. Instead, he received attacking midfielders Diego Souza, Andrei Karyaka and Giorgos Karagounis. To improve Koeman's options up-front, composed of Nuno Gomes and Mantorras, Benfica tried but failed to sign Jon Dahl Tomasson. Koeman instead received Italian international Fabrizio Miccoli on loan from Juventus. In defence, Benfica added Brazilians Anderson, Léo, with Nélson [...] replacing Miguel, who moved to Valencia.|$|E

She paid tribute to him by hosting the CBS special Sonny & Me: Cher Remembers, which aired on May 20, 1998. That month, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. Later that year, Cher published The First Time, a collection of autobiographical essays of [...] "first-time" [...] events in her life, which critics praised for revealing the singer to be down to earth and genuine. Although the manuscript was almost finished when Sonny died, she could not decide whether to include his death in the book; she feared being criticized for capitalizing on the event. She later told Rolling Stone, [...] "I couldn't ignore it, could I? I might have if I cared more about what people think than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> is right for me." ...|$|E

Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do your club much good, but I believe if I taught him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years.

500|$|The plot of Man of Steel {{employs a}} {{nonlinear}} narrative, and tells {{parts of the}} story in flashback. During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises in 2008, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight. Nolan admired Bryan Singer's work on Superman Returns for its connection to Richard Donner's version, stating that [...] "A {{lot of people have}} approached Superman {{in a lot of different}} ways. I only know the way that has worked for us that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> how to do," [...] emphasizing the idea that Batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the Man of Steel would assure the integrity needed for the film. [...] "Each serves to the internal logic of the story. They have nothing to do with each other." [...] Nolan, however, clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series.|$|E

Touré of The New York Times remarks that [...] "While Snoop delivers rhymes delicately, the content is anything but. Growing up poor, often surrounded by violence, and having served six months in the Wayside County jail outside of Los Angeles (for cocaine possession) gave Snoop Dogg experiences upon which he draws." [...] Snoop Dogg later commented on the [...] "reality" [...] of his lyrics, stating [...] "My raps are incidents where either I saw it happen to one of my close homies or I know about it from just being in the ghetto. I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> and that's that street life. It's all everyday life, reality." ...|$|E
500|$|Astonishing Stories is not {{remembered as}} {{being among the}} best science fiction magazines: both critic Peter Nicholls and sf writer Jack Williamson have {{described}} it as a [...] "training ground" [...] for writers who would go on to do their best work elsewhere. [...] However, Nicholls adds that [...] "its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them", and Wolf and Thompson agree, claiming that [...] "there was much that was memorable in Astonishing, both by way of immediate appeal and of more lasting quality". [...] Pohl himself, who later became a very successful magazine editor, felt he made many mistakes. [...] He quotes as an example his serialization of Malcolm Jameson's story [...] "Quicksands of Youthwardness" [...] in three parts; the story was only 27,000 words long, and readers complained (justifiably, in Pohl's view) that serializing it in a bimonthly magazine meant they had to wait for five months to read the whole story, in relatively small 9,000-word pieces. [...] Overall, Pohl assessed his performance by saying [...] "I wasn't really a very good editor"; adding [...] "With <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> now I could have made those magazines sing, but as it was they just lay there".|$|E
