40|$|Converging {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{suggest that a}} significant portion of the Martian surface fines may consist of salts and smectite clays. Salts can form stoichiometric hydrates as well as eutectic solutions with depressed freezing points; clays contain bound <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>constitution</b> and adsorb significant quantities of water from the vapor phase. The formation of ice may be suppressed by these minerals in some regions on Mars, and their presence in abundance would imply important consequences for atmospheric and geologic processes and the prospects for exobiology...|$|E
40|$|Data on isotopic {{composition}} of interstitial and bottom waters collected {{in an area}} of gas hydrate occurrence in the Sea of Okhotsk are presented. Investigations indicate that heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen are used in generation of gas hydrate, so that {{isotopic composition}} of its <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>constitution</b> is: d 18 O = + 1. 9 per mil, d 2 H = + 23 per mil (relative to SMOW). Production of authigenic carbonates results in isotopic exchange with interstitial water, which in turn alters its isotopic composition by an increase in d 18 O. Bottom waters are isotopically light relative to the SMOW standard and to the average isotopic composition of interstitial waters in the area of gas hydrate occurrence in study...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effects of Naomaitong Recipe, a {{compound}} Chinese herbal medicine, on the expressions of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and nitric-oxide synthases (NOSs) in brain tissue after focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion in aged rats and the dosage-effect relationship. Methods: We adopted the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in aged rats as the focal cerebral ischemia model, with 3 -hour ischemia and 12 -day reperfusion, and observed the changes of the nerve dysfunction score, the <b>water</b> content <b>of</b> cerebral <b>constitution</b> and the expressions of NF-κB, heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70) and NOSs in cerebral cortex. Results: The nerve dysfunction score, the <b>water</b> content <b>of</b> cerebral <b>constitution,</b> the expressions <b>of</b> NF-κB, HSP 70, neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS), endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in the untreated group were higher than those of the sham-operated group. The nerve dysfunction score, the <b>water</b> content <b>of</b> cerebral <b>constitution,</b> the expressions <b>of</b> NF-κB, iNOS and nNOS were lower, while the expressions of HSP 70 and eNOS were higher in the high-, medium- and low-dose Naomaitong-treated groups and nimodipine-treated group than those of the untreated-group. The nerve dysfunction score and the expression of nNOS were lower, while the expression of eNOS was higher in the medium-dose Naomaitong-treated group than those of the nimodipine-treated group. The expressions of HSP 70 and eNOS were higher, while the other indices were lower in the medium-dose Naomaitong-treated group than those of the low-dose Naomaitong-treated group. Conclusion: Naomaitong Recipe can protect the brain cells from damage after focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury by adjusting the expressions of NF-κB, HSP 70 and NOSs, and the medium-dose Naomaitong Recipe is more effective...|$|R

40|$|The mineral {{processing}} {{sector of industry}} is very fuel-intensive. For instance, aluminium making {{is one of the}} nine processes which together account for about 50 % of the industrial energy used in the United States (Warshawsky, 1976). In aluminium production, the first stage is alumina manufacture. In alumina processing, i e. bauxite refining, the final step is calcination. Calcination was defined and the evolution in the development of today's alumina calcination plants was reviewed. The whole processes (unit configuration and operation, equipment capabilities, energy consumption and efficiency, product quality, etc [...] ,) were described. Operational difficulties and successive improvements were also analysed. In these units, the major component of the equipment is the furnace (rotary kiln or stationary furnace) wherein the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>constitution</b> of precalcined alumina crystals is expelled at high temperature (900 to 1200 °C). Overall aluminium trihydrate dehydroxylation is expressed by the following theoretical chemical reaction: Al 2 O 3, 3 H 2 O → AI 2 O 3 + 3 H 2 O(v) Special attention was given to five commercial stationary calciner furnaces which were detained and compared. However, the scope of this work was focused on the study of the Mark III Alcoa flash furnace : a cylindrical vertical vessel composed of three sections -the bottom and top section of smaller dimensions than the central main body- in which fuel oil or gas are introduced and burnt directly into the suspension of alumina particles. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations [...] -the best technique available to obtain a description of the flow of solid in the furnace since adequately reliable physical modelling experiment does not exist for two phases situations [...] -were carried out to ascertain the media behaviour in the chamber. A description of the numerical tool, together with the various models used in the computations were given. Numerical models of the above existing furnace were built: Isothermal single (gaseous flow) and two phase flows, combustion reaction. Swirling flow field was tested in a partial model of equivalent dimension. Heat and mass transfer between the two phases have not been implemented. Predictive results were validated against physical tests and plant operating data. The models allowed the cause of the current operational inefficiencies to be addressed. Design changes were suggested and actually introduced in the new generations of calciner furnaces which combine an increased combustion efficiency and a better processing of particles...|$|E
