30|$|We {{isolated}} the mutated gene using a map-based cloning strategy. <b>We</b> <b>first</b> developed an <b>F</b> 1 population by crossing the heterozygous mutant (nrtp 1 -D/NRTP) with wild-type ‘Nipponbare’ (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica). Segregation of the mild “short-root” phenotype in the F 1 population displayed a ratio close to 1 : 1 (23 plants of the wild-type phenotype and 25 plants of the mild mutant phenotype, P[*]=[*] 0.885). The F 1 seedlings with the mild mutant phenotype were self-pollinated {{to generate the}} F 2 mapping population. Segregation in the F 2 generation expressed a ratio close to 1 : 2 : 1. These results further support {{the fact that a}} single semi-dominant gene was responsible for the mutant phenotype.|$|R

40|$|Recently, several human cancers {{including}} leukemia {{and breast}} and brain tumors {{were found to}} contain stem-like cancer cells called cancer stem cells (CSC). Most of these CSCs were identified using markers that identify putative normal stem cells.

Purified side population cells from two cell lines (U 373 glioma and MCF 7 breast cancer) and a xenograft prostate tumor (LAPC- 9) are more tumorigenic than the corresponding non–side popula-tion cells.

30|$|Our {{previous}} {{study showed that}} the HWC 2 locus was located within the 3.9 -cM region between two RFLP markers: XNpb 264 and XNpb 197. The present study localized this gene on 19 -kb region of the chromosome 4 physical map, where five candidate genes were annotated. <b>We</b> <b>first</b> selected the <b>F</b> 2 population from the cross between Nipponbare and Kasalath because of high DNA polymorphism and accumulation of DNA marker information. However, the candidate region was not narrowed down to less than 150  kb even though approximately 6, 500 gametes were analyzed. We further examined 14, 190 gametes from 18 kinds of other cross combinations and finally narrowed down the area of interest to 19  kb. In the cross between Nipponbare and Kasalath, chromosomal rearrangement such as inversion and insertion near the HWC 2 locus probably suppressed crossover events thereby.|$|R
40|$|In the Convex Body Chasing problem, we {{are given}} an initial point v_ 0 in R^d and an online {{sequence}} of n convex bodies F_ 1, [...] ., F_n. When we receive F_i, we are required to move inside F_i. Our goal is to minimize the total distance travelled. This fundamental online problem was first studied by Friedman and Linial (DCG 1993). They proved an Ω(√(d)) lower bound on the competitive ratio, and conjectured that a competitive ratio depending only on d is possible. However, despite much interest in the problem, the conjecture remains wide open. We consider the setting in which the convex bodies are nested: F_ 1 ⊃ [...] . ⊃ F_n. The nested setting {{is closely related to}} extending the online LP framework of Buchbinder and Naor (ESA 2005) to arbitrary linear constraints. Moreover, this setting retains much of the difficulty of the general setting and captures an essential obstacle in resolving Friedman and Linial's conjecture.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this article is}} to obtain a {{condition}} under which an infinite collection F of satellite knots (with companion a positive torus knot and pattern similar to the Whitehead link) freely generates a subgroup of infinite rank in the smooth concordance group. This goal is attained by examining both the instanton moduli space over a 4 -manifold with tubular ends and the corresponding Chern-Simons invariant of the adequate 3 -dimensional portion of the 4 -manifold. More specifically, the result is derived from Furuta's criterion for the independence of Seifert fibred homology spheres in the homology cobordism group of oriented homology 3 -spheres. Indeed, <b>we</b> <b>first</b> associate to <b>F</b> the corresponding collection of 2 -fold covers of the 3 -sphere branched over the elements of F and then introduce definite cobordisms from the aforementioned covers of the satellites to a number of Seifert fibered homology spheres.
