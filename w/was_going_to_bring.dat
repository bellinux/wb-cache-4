5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was especially difficult for Jodie Foster, who was hounded relentlessly {{by the media}} during 1981 because she was Hinckley's target of obsession. Since then, Foster has only commented on Hinckley on three occasions: a press conference {{a few days after}} the attack, an Esquire magazine article she wrote in 1982, and during an interview with Charlie Rose on 60 Minutes II in 1999; she has otherwise ended or canceled several interviews after the event was mentioned or if the interviewer <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> up Hinckley.|$|E

25|$|Still, in {{his three}} outings {{he had done}} a respectable enough job, and he was {{thought to have been}} in the frame for a few Formula One seats come 1995. As it turned out, Larrousse folded, and the only deal that came his way was to drive the Simtek {{in the second half of}} 1995 as Jos Verstappen's teammate, with Schiattarella racing in the first half of the year.

The 243 principalities or Rajwaras were to be divided among caste Hindus and “others” and then herded together in a ghetto called Hanoodia. As for the Sikhs, they were to be pushed into an enclave called Sikhia. Other races and religions were to inhabit an encampment by the name of Hanadika.
