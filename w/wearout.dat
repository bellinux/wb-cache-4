40|$|Abstract—Although {{constant}} technology scaling {{has resulted}} in considerable benefits, smaller device dimensions, higher operating temperatures and electric fields have also contributed to faster device aging due to <b>wearout.</b> Not only does this result in the shortening of processor lifetimes, it leads to faster <b>wearout</b> resultant performance degradation with operating time.

In this pa-per, we explore an alternative, more preferred method of exploiting microarchitectural redundancy to enhance chip lifetime reliability. In our proposed approach, redundancy is used proactively to allow non-faulty microarchitecture components to be temporarily deactivated, on a rotating basis, to suspend and/or recover from certain <b>wearout</b> ef-fects. This approach improves chip lifetime reliability by warding off the onset of <b>wearout</b> failures as opposed to re-acting to them posteriorly. Applied to on-chip cache SRAM for combating NBTI-induced <b>wearout</b> failure, our proac-tive <b>wearout</b> recovery approach increases lifetime reliability (measured in mean-time-to-failure) of the cache by about a factor of seven relative to no use of microarchitectural re-dundancy and a factor of five relative to conventional reac-tive use of redundancy having similar area overhead. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to introduce and define {{the concepts of}} threshold and <b>wearout</b> and to review the existing state of knowledge surrounding these topics. The problem is first introduced in Section II, not explicitly in terms of threshold and <b>wearout,</b> {{but in terms of}} how these phenomena affect the decision of how many times a campaign or advertising theme should be run In Section III formal definitions of these terms, such as they exist, are provided and discussed {{within the context of the}} stimulus-response approach. It is suggested that the conception of how advertising works significantly determines the way in which thresholds and <b>wearout</b> are defined and assumed to operate. As such, problems of definition are discussed in Section IV together with the need to specify advertising in a time dimension and the need to specify the measure of response. The value of the stimulus-response ideology is brought into question in Section V and an alternative conception, illustrated for the case of direct response advertising, is proposed. This alternative is based on the need to consider the role of interest or involvement in the advertising when seeking to interpret different forms of response within the context of thresholds and <b>wearout.</b> This viewpoint is further developed in Section VI with reference to the available work on the effects of advertising repetition. Characteristics of the advertising appeal and format, the product or brand, the media and the schedule are discussed in terms of how they influence the level of response.

40|$|Abstract — Scaling of device sizes {{has reduced}} gate oxide {{thickness}} {{to a few}} atomic layers, increasing {{the vulnerability of the}} gate oxide to breakdown. During breakdown, devices go through a gradual <b>wearout</b> process after an initial gate leakage increase leading to device failure. It is proposed that if <b>wearout</b> can be monitored, cache arrays with failing cells can be reliably operated after reconfiguration given available memory redundancy. Using experimentally verified gate oxide breakdown models, a detailed analysis of the effect of progressive gate oxide breakdown on the performance of a conventional 6 T SRAM cell is presented for 45 nm predictive technology. The DC margin trends (Read, Write and Retention) and access times (Read and Write) during <b>wearout</b> are analyzed, and a cell breakdown point due to degradation in each of these parameters is defined. A combination of these results is used to formulate a practical definition for the hardbreakdown point of a cell.

As CMOS scaling continues {{into the deep}} sub-micron regime, soft errors and device <b>wearout</b> will increas-ingly jeopardize the reliability of unprotected processor pipelines. To preserve reliable operation, processor cores will require mechanisms to detect errors affecting the control and datapaths. Con-ventional techniques such as parity, error correcting codes, and self-checking circuits have high implementation overheads and therefore these techniques cannot be easily applied to complex and timing-critical high-performance pipelines. This thesis proposes and evaluates architectural and microarchitectural fingerprints. A finger-print is a compact (e. g., 16 -bit) signature of recent architectural or microarchitectural state updates. By periodically comparing a fingerprint and a reference over an interval of execution, the system can detect errors in a timely and bandwidth-efficient manner. Architectural fingerprints capture in-order architectural state with lightweight monitoring hardware at the retirement stages of a pipeline, while microarchitectural fingerprints leverage existing design-for-test hardware to accumulate a signature of internal state. This thesis explores two applications of fingerprints. In the Reunion execution model, this thesis shows that architectural fingerprints can detect both soft errors and input incoherence with complexity-effective redundant execution in a chip multiprocessor. Cycle-accurate simulation shows that the performance overhead is only 5 - 6 % over more complicated designs that strictly replicate inputs. In another application, FIRST, fingerprints detect emerging <b>wearout</b> faults by periodically testing the processor under marginal operating conditions. <b>Wearout</b> fault simulation in a commercial processor show that architectural fingerprints have high coverage of widespread <b>wearout,</b> while mi-croarchitectural fingerprints provide superior coverage of both individual and widespread <b>wearout.</b> i...|$|E
40|$|Ever {{since the}} VLSI process {{technology}} crossed the sub-micron threshold, {{there is an}} increased interest in design of fault-tolerant systems to mitigate the <b>wearout</b> of transistors. Hot Carrier Injection (HCI) and Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) are two prominent usage based transistor degradation mechanisms in the deep sub-micron process technologies. This <b>wearout</b> of transistors can lead to timing violations along the critical paths which will eventually lead to permanent failures of the chip. While {{there have been many}} studies which concentrate on decreasing the <b>wearout</b> in a single core, the failure of an individual core need not be catastrophic in the context of Chip Multi-Processors (CMPs). However, a failure in the interconnect in these CMPs can lead to the failure of entire chip as it could lead to protocol-level deadlocks, or even partition away vital components such as the memory controller or other critical I/O. Analysis of HCI and NBTI stresses caused by real workloads on interconnect microachitecture shows that <b>wearout</b> in the CMP on-chip interconnect is correlated with lack of load observed in the network-on-chip routers.

State-of-the-art techniques, which typically detect and measure low level circuit properties like gate delay can-not deliver on all four requirements. Moving away from the paradigm of measuring circuit delays is key to satisfying the four design requirements. Our insight is to virtually age the processor and thus manifest a <b>wearout</b> fault early – we convert the delay degradation into a logic fault; expose the fault and then detect the fault. To virtually age the pro-cessor, reducing supply voltage effectively mirrors <b>wearout.</b> For fault exposure, we observe that faults in critical paths are naturally exposed and we develop a technique to expose faults along the non-critical paths using clock phase shifting logic.

Nonetheless, the challenge of modeling and improving the effects of low-level failures at the architecture-level continues to be a rather daunting one.; This research tackles the issue of modeling chip lifetime reliability at the architecture level. We propose a new and robust structure-aware lifetime reliability model at the architecture-level, where only devices vulnerable to <b>wearout</b> failure mechanisms and the effective stress condition of these devices are taken into account for the failure rate of microarchitecture structures. In formulating the proposed model, we separate architecture-level factors from technology-dependent parameters which are encapsulated into a newly proposed technology-independent unit of reliability, called the FIT of reference circuit (FORC). This allows architects to abstract processor reliability analysis from technology-level effects. In addition, the proposed model is extended for processor systems employing microarchitectural redundancy which {{has been used as a}} means of improving chip lifetime reliability.; Microarchitectural redundancy is typically used in a reactive way, allowing chips to maintain operability in the presence of failures, by detecting and isolating, correcting and/or replacing components on a first-come, first-served basis only after they become faulty. In this research, we explore an alternative, more preferred method of exploiting microarchitectural redundancy to enhance chip lifetime reliability. In our approach, redundancy is used proactively to allow non-faulty microarchitecture components to be temporarily deactivated (i. e., in recovery mode) on a rotating basis, to suspend and/or recover from certain <b>wearout</b> effects. This approach improves chip lifetime reliability by warding off the onset of <b>wearout</b> failures as opposed to reacting to them posteriorly. To make our proactive approach more effective, we also propose circuit-level techniques to exploit the recovery effect of <b>wearout</b> failure mechanisms such as NBTI while components operate in recovery mode. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to cache SRAM susceptible to failure caused by NBTI for exploiting microarchitectural redundancy targeted to enhancing cache SRAM lifetime reliability...|$|E
