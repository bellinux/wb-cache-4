5|$|On October16, 2009, the Champlain Bridge <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> traffic due to {{structural}} concerns. The {{bridge was}} demolished on December28, 2009, {{as a result}} of those concerns, temporarily reducing NY185 in purpose to a spur route linking NY9N and NY22 to Crown Point. Its replacement, the Lake Champlain Bridge, opened to traffic on November7, 2011.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, the {{graveyard}} was full {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} damaging the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and bones were often removed to a nearby charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E
5|$|Downing Street leads off the {{south-west}} end of Whitehall, {{just above}} Parliament Street. It {{was named after}} Sir George Downing, who built a row of houses along the street around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number of terrorist attacks, the road <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> the public in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the Provisional IRA fired mortars from a van parked in Whitehall towards No.10, one of which exploded in the gardens.|$|E
5|$|Fay {{damaged the}} roof of the airport's {{terminal}} building, causing the sprinkler system to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing passenger information. The airport's radar was also impacted by the storm. In response to the damage, the airport <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> all flights, though it quickly reopened to emergency diversions and non-commercial flights. Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.|$|E

As {{part of the}} project, {{the section of the}} bridge between Brown and West Main Streets would be removed—allowing for the canal bed to be filled in and the road to be rebuilt—while the segment between West Main Street and Exchange Boulevard would be rehabilitated. The portion of Broad Street between Allen and Main Streets <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> all traffic in February and was originally scheduled to open on October30. It finally reopened to traffic on December3.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S. National Championships, Richard Sears (1881–1887), William Larned (1901–1902, 1907–1911) and Bill Tilden (1920–1925, 1929) {{hold the}} record for most titles in the men's singles, with seven {{victories}} each. Four of Sears' wins and all of Larned's, came within the challenge round format, and they won respectively only thrice and twice after going through a complete draw. Sears also holds the all-time record for most consecutive titles, with seven from (1881 to 1887); the first win came when the event <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> foreign participants. Without the challenge round, the record stands at six, and is held by Tilden (1920–1925).|$|E

5|$|Michel Roux {{was born}} in Charolles, Saône-et-Loire, in a room above his grandfather's charcuterie (a {{delicatessen}} specializing in meat products). He moved to Paris with his family after the war, where his father Michel set up his own charcuterie, after not taking over the family business in Charolles. His father gambled away all of the family's money, and the shop <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> prevent it from going bankrupt. By the time Michel turned ten, his father had left the family and was not heard from again.|$|E
5|$|Muirhead-Gould {{gave the}} general alarm, along with orders for ships to take anti-submarine measures, at 22:27; the alarm was {{repeated}} at 22:36 with advice for ships to take precautions against attack, {{as an enemy}} submarine {{might be in the}} harbour. At {{the time of the first}} alarm, Sydney Harbour <b>was</b> <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> external traffic, but Muirhead-Gould ordered ferries and other internal traffic to continue, as he believed that having multiple ships travelling around at speed would help force any submarines to remain submerged.|$|E

30|$|The {{analysis}} of neural classifier outputs shows that, {{in case of}} MLP, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 1 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will be far to be the identified fault class. In case of RBF, the outputs are distances from RBF centers. In this case with a new scale of outputs it is easily to make output class values varying between [0, c], where c is a constant to be determined (e.g., see Sect.  5.1, Fig.  7 a–c). Then, more the output which is a distance <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> c and more this output will be far {{to be identified as}} fault class. Contrarily, more the output <b>is</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 0 and more this output will <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the identified fault class. From this purpose, one interesting way to built efficient decision-making from two neural classifiers is fuzzy logic [18, 19].|$|R
