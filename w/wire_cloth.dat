2500|$|The York Factory Whistle {{holds the}} world record for the loudest music without {{amplification}} from a non-musical instrument. Every Christmas Eve the whistle uses a compressor to create air pressure, then releases it {{through a series of}} tubes using a device much like a slide whistle. (Prior to 2010, the pressure was created using steam produced by a boiler.) [...] The music had a loudness of 140 dB and can be heard 10 to 12 miles away with proper weather conditions. Various Christmas music is played for a short time around midnight. It is thought that this annual tradition was started around 1925. After the hosting New York <b>Wire</b> <b>Cloth</b> Company plant closed in 2013, Metso moved the whistle to their factory in York and the annual concert tradition has continued. Metso announced in August 2015 that it would close its York plant by the end of March 2016. Organizers {{hope to be able to}} hold the 2016 whistle concert at the same location.|$|E

50|$|The {{company began}} as a cottage {{industry}} weaving animal hair from cows and horses, started by Benjamin Gilbert. Water power was needed, and the enterprise used a former sawmill facility downriver from the later factory site. The company found success making sieves from animal hair. After much development and a fire, the company focused on wire products including woven <b>wire</b> <b>cloth</b> for meat safes, the first insect wire screening, and poultry netting.|$|E

40|$|Using the {{complementary}} wave- and particle-like natures of photons, {{it is possible}} to make "interaction-free" measurements where the presence of an object can be determined with no photons being absorbed. We investigated several "interaction-free" imaging systems, i. e. systems that allow optical imaging of photosensitive objects with less than the classically expected amount of light being absorbed or scattered by the object. With the most promising system, we obtained high-resolution (10 μ m), one-dimensional profiles of a variety of objects (human hair, glass and metal <b>wires,</b> <b>cloth</b> fibers), by raster scanning each object through the system. We discuss possible applications and the present and future limits for interaction-free imaging.

5000|$|Plaster expands while {{hardening}} then contracts slightly {{just before}} hardening completely. This makes plaster excellent {{for use in}} molds, and it is often used as an artistic material for casting. Plaster is also commonly spread over an armature (form), made of <b>wire</b> mesh, <b>cloth,</b> or other materials; a process for adding raised details. For these processes, limestone or acrylic based plaster may be employed, known as stucco.|$|R
50|$|The wooden {{west wing}} that {{had served as}} the {{original}} school in the 1860s was demolished in 1962. A new roof and gutter were installed in 1985, and Lexan and <b>wire</b> <b>cloth</b> {{were added to the}} basement windows to protect against damage from stray balls on the nearby softball field, also used for Little League. Further renovations were made in 1996 in anticipation of an exhibit on the centenary of Jell-O. This included the installation of electricity, a security system and refinishings of the exhibit rooms on the first floor, including the installation of modern track lighting.|$|E
50|$|Woven <b>wire</b> <b>cloth,</b> {{typically}} {{produced from}} stainless steel, is commonly {{employed as a}} filtration medium for sieving {{in a wide range}} of industries. Most often woven with a plain weave, or a twill weave for the lightest of meshes, apertures can be produced from a few microns upwards (e.g. 25 microns), employing wires with diameters from as little as 25 microns. A twill weave allows a mesh to be woven when the wire diameter is too thick in proportion to the aperture. Other, less commonplace, weaves, such as Dutch/Hollander, allow the production of meshes that are stronger and/or having smaller apertures.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{screening}} {{has been linked}} to the early Egyptians who used the process to separate basic minerals by using a mesh that had equal openings. This idea fell down through the ages and developed into a series of European patents around 1924, when the thought of electrically heating the <b>wire</b> <b>cloth</b> for screens was considered. This was the first attempt at eliminating screen blinding (when the material being processed (clay, dirt, etc.) clogs the holes in the screen) by using heat, and it proved that the surface tension from blinding was reduced when heat was introduced.|$|E
25|$|When Herman Wissman met Zappo Zap in 1887 he {{was dressed}} with a turban, shirt and pants in the Arab fashion. The missionary Lapsley, who met Zappo Zap's son later, {{said he had a}} cloth tied about his head and was clothed from {{shoulder}} to knee. Lapsley gave Zappo Zap a gift of brass <b>wire</b> and <b>cloth,</b> and received some young slaves in return. Lapsley appreciated the gift, later releasing the slaves and educating them at the Luebo mission.|$|R
50|$|In 1834, Gilbert & Bennett Co. {{purchased}} {{the site of}} a former comb mill alongside the Norwalk River in the Georgetown section of Redding, and began producing <b>wire</b> mesh <b>cloth</b> for varying uses, in time to include sieves and window screens. In 1863, Gilbert & Bennett built a facility at the site for drawing metal wire. During World War I, the U.S. military adapted the company's products for camouflage netting, gas masks and trench liners; and during World War II, for signal corps uses.|$|R
5000|$|The term long {{products}} may include hot rolled bar, cold rolled or drawn bar, rebar, railway rails, wire, rope (stranded <b>wire),</b> woven <b>cloth</b> of steel <b>wire,</b> shapes (sections) such as U, I, or H sections, {{and may also}} include ingots from continuous casting, including blooms and billets. Fabricated structural units, such bridge sections are also classed as {{long products}}. The definition excludes [...] "Flat Products" [...] - slab, plate, strip and coil, tinplate, and electrical steel; and also excludes certain tubular products including seamless and welded tube.|$|R
5000|$|Modular {{screen media}} is {{typically}} 1 foot large by 1 or 2 feet long [...] (4 feet long for ISEPREN WS 85 [...] ) steel reinforced polyurethane or rubber panels. They are installed {{on a flat}} deck (no crown) that normally has a larger surface than a tensioned deck. This larger surface design compensates {{for the fact that}} rubber and polyurethane modular screen media offers less open area than <b>wire</b> <b>cloth.</b> Over the years, numerous ways have been developed to attach modular panels to the screen deck stringers (girders). Some of these attachment systems have been or are currently patented. Self-cleaning screen media is also available on this modular system.|$|E
5000|$|The FIRST (Fabrication of Inflatable Re-entry Structures for Test) {{system was}} an Aerojet {{proposal}} for an inflated-spar Rogallo wing made up from Inconel <b>wire</b> <b>cloth</b> impregnated with silicone rubber and silicon carbide dust. FIRST was proposed in both one-man and six man versions, used for emergency escape and reentry of stranded space station crews, and {{was based on}} an earlier unmanned test program that resulted in a partially successful reentry flight from space (the launcher nose cone fairing hung up on the material, dragging it too low and fast for the thermal protection system (TPS), but otherwise it appears the concept would have worked; even with the fairing dragging it, the test article flew stably on reentry until burn-through).|$|E
5000|$|Today <b>wire</b> <b>cloth</b> is woven {{to strict}} {{international}} standards, e.g. ISO1944:1999, which dictates acceptable tolerance regarding nominal mesh count and blemishes. The nominal mesh count, to which mesh is generally defined {{is a measure}} of the number of openings per lineal inch, determined by counting the number of openings from the centre of one wire to the centre of another wire one lineal inch away. For example, a 2 mesh woven with a wire of 1.6mm wire diameter has an aperture of 11.1mm (see picture below of a 2 mesh with an intermediate crimp). The formula for calculating the aperture of a mesh, with a known mesh count and wire diameter, is as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|Before the {{catalysts}} {{are packed}} onto the shape, they are first packed onto something porous like a <b>cloth</b> or <b>wire</b> mesh.

50|$|The leading {{industry}} in Cortland {{in the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth century was the Wickwire Brothers wire drawing mill, noted for its production of <b>wire</b> hardware <b>cloth</b> for use as window screens. The extent of their wealth is commemorated in a pair of magnificent mansions. The Victorian Chateauesque style home of Chester Wickwire is now the 1890 House Museum & Center for Victorian Arts, while the 1912 home of Charles Wickwire is now owned and operated by the SUNY Cortland Alumni Association. It is open to the public as well as being used by the Alumni Association to host college-related events and house visiting dignitaries.|$|R
