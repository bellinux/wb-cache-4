5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|By 1991, {{development}} was behind schedule. Development slowed even more when Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory cancelled its {{order for the}} first machine, {{in favor of the}} C90. Several executives, including the CEO, left the company. The company then announced they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for a customer that needed a smaller version of the machine, with four to eight processors.|$|E
5|$|However, after Detroit's {{first round}} {{loss to the}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the {{following}} season, he expressed his desire to play again. This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on Curtis Joseph's three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Colorado Avalanche <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for a goalie to replace Patrick Roy after his retirement. With Manny Legace also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.|$|E

5|$|In May 2014, Night Trap {{designer}} James Riley {{announced that}} he was in talks to re-release the game with improved resolution and gameplay. That August, a Kickstarter campaign appeared for the game's original creators, who formed a company titled Night Trap LLC. The developers said that if the campaign were successful, they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> into re-releasing other Digital Pictures titles. Furthermore, the company was also considering making a sequel to the original game. The Kickstarter failed, only gaining $39,843 of its $330,000 goal.|$|E
5|$|While {{portraying the}} bonds between {{the members of}} Class Zero, and between them and their summoned monsters, along with the game's themes of death and war, Naora drew {{inspiration}} from {{when he saw a}} cat killed by a car surrounded by other cats. Nomura was in charge of choosing the voice cast, which featured several well-known voice actors. When listening to the samples and picking the actors, Nomura focused on whether they could successfully project the characters' personalities. The actors and actresses helped define the characters, adding individual touches during voice recording sessions. Sayoko Hoshino acted as the game's character texture artist. Originally, she was going to put in black voids where a female character's panties would have been due to hardware limitations. However the staff realized that the players <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at the backs of characters a lot, so Hoshino designed panties for each female character and worked with the staff to incorporate them into the character models.|$|E

25|$|Van Dyke {{was charged}} with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of {{official}} misconduct. He remained on desk duty after the shooting. Van Dyke {{had a history of}} complaints in his career but was cleared in a majority of the cases. He pleaded not guilty on December 29, 2015 to the charges against him.

He stated that he used EPO, growth hormone, testosterone, DHEA, insulin, IGF-1, cortisone and did blood transfusions. He also stated that his cycling career was over and that he wanted to cooperate fully with the Danish anti-doping institutions. The Danish Authorities stated that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> to enforce a two-year ban, reduced from the normal eight-year ban in exchange for revealing what he knew about other illegal doping activities.|$|E

25|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{ruled out}} producing a re-engined {{version of its}} 737 {{to compete with the}} Airbus A320neo family launch planned for 2015, believing airlines <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> towards the Boeing Y1 and a 30% fuel saving, instead of paying 10% more for fuel efficiency gains of only a few percent. Industry sources believe that the 737's design makes re-engining considerably more expensive for Boeing than it was for the Airbus A320. However, there did prove to be considerable demand. Southwest Airlines, who use the 737 for their entire fleet (680 in service or on order), said they were not prepared to wait 20 years or more for a new 737 model and threatened to convert to Airbus. Boeing eventually bowed to airline pressure and in 2011 approved the 737 MAX project, scheduled for first delivery in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Inheritance was by descent, {{but could}} be further {{restricted}} by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In {{the case of the}} Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and her future children. The irony of the novel's opening line, therefore, is that generally within this society it would be a woman who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for a wealthy husband in order to have prosperous life.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, £700,000 was {{invested}} {{in improving the}} pitch.

500|$|Opponents of the light-rail project {{have argued}} that it was {{undertaken}} without sufficient consultation with the public. In February 2008, it was reported that the House of Commons committee on government operations <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> into his involvement over the case. MP and committee member Mark Holland voiced a concern that Baird leaked information on the contract. Baird replied that he made the right decision and dismissed the investigation saying [...] "there is no evidence of anything". Speaking to reporters he added following the announcement of the investigation: [...] "If you want to avert a billion-dollar boondoggle, you have to make some difficult decisions".|$|E
500|$|Four {{months after}} the release of [...] "We Are the World", USA for Africa had taken in almost $10.8million (equivalent to $ million today). The {{majority}} of the money came from record sales within the US. Members of the public also donated money—almost $1.3million within the same time period. In May 1985, USA for Africa officials estimated that they had sold between $45million and $47million worth of official merchandise around the world. Organizer Ken Kragen announced {{that they would not be}} distributing all of the money at once. Instead, he revealed that the foundation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> into finding a long-term solution for Africa's problems. [...] "We could go out and spend it all in one shot. Maybe we'd save some lives in the short term but it would be like putting a Band-Aid over a serious wound." [...] Kragen noted that experts had predicted that it would take at least 10 to 20years to make a slight difference to Africa's long-term problems.|$|E
500|$|William Brace, {{the local}} MP {{speaking}} {{on behalf of}} the South Wales Miners' Federation, announced on 16 October that the priority would be given to putting out the fire and that no more search parties <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for survivors. Brace observed that the fire was blocking the western workings and consuming the oxygen in the air, making it unlikely that anyone was left alive. Progress in tackling the fire over the previous days had been slow, and it had only been extinguished in the first 30 yards of the roadway—still [...] from the coal face. Two coroner's inquests were opened: one in Senghenydd for the men who died in the colliery, and one in Cardiff for those who had died in hospital; both were adjourned the same day. The first funerals took place the following day, Friday 17 October. An estimated 150,000 mourners gathered for the 11 men buried on the Saturday and 8 on the Sunday.|$|E

500|$|In January 2007, Brunner {{proposed}} {{a plan that}} would allow counties to recruit poll workers by mail, who would then undertake two paid training days, and work a paid eight-hour shift at the polls on Election Day. Brunner explained the plan in an interview: [...] "In terms of Ohio and what happened in the 2004 presidential election, there has been a crisis in confidence in our election system in Ohio, both nationally and in our state. One of the quickest ways to repair that {{is to make sure that}} we have adequate numbers of poll workers. ... We suggested this as one tool that the boards of elections would have available to them for recruiting poll workers. We <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> to do this similar to how we recruit jurors, only jurors are recruited for two weeks of service whereas we'd only be asking for three days. It would also allow us to offer split shifts to poll workers. In Ohio the polling places are open for thirteen hours, so essentially a poll worker works at least fourteen hours; with the average age of our poll workers at 72, that's a tough day for anyone, no matter what their age is. ... It's an option, and we can even include a trigger, so that a county has to be deficient by a certain percentage of poll workers to even be able to use this." [...] In the initial proposal it was not yet decided what wages would be paid, and whether refusing recruitment would result in penalties. The proposal will be decided by the Ohio General Assembly.|$|E
