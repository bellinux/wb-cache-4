500|$|Minton {{tried again}} to expose what he {{believed}} to be Republican control of the media. He led the committee to target a newspaper with national circulation, Rural Progress. Minton accused the publishers of improperly accepting {{large sums of money}} from corporations and the editors of undue influence from this money. The owner of the paper, Maurive V. Renolds, was summoned before the committee for a hearing, where Minton demanded to know why he was accepting money from corporations. When Renolds asked his manager, Dr. Glen Frank, to help him answer the questions, Minton and fellow Democratic senators began to shout Dr. Frank down. As he <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine, Minton beat his gavel and yelled, [...] "This committee doesn't intend to permit you to use this as a forum to air your Republican views." ...|$|E
500|$|With the Cabinet still {{divided between}} adherents of Green and Harkness, Diefenbaker {{made a speech}} in the Commons on January 25 that Fleming (by then Minister of Justice) termed [...] "a model of obfuscation". Harkness was {{initially}} convinced that Diefenbaker <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he would support nuclear warheads in Canada. After talking to the press, he realized that {{his view of the}} speech was not universally shared, and he asked Diefenbaker for clarification. Diefenbaker, however, continued to try to avoid taking a firm position. On January 30, the US State Department issued a press release suggesting that Diefenbaker had made misstatements in his Commons speech. For the first time ever, Canada recalled its ambassador to Washington as a diplomatic protest. Though all parties condemned the State Department action, the three parties outside the government demanded that Diefenbaker take a stand on the nuclear weapon issue.|$|E
500|$|The team {{continued}} their resurgence into the 2006 season, finishing {{with a record}} of 13–3. During the season, Urlacher had one of the best performances of his professional career against the Arizona Cardinals. He helped the Bears overcome a 20-point deficit by recording 19 tackles and a forced fumble that was returned for a touchdown. Teammate Devin Hester commented on Urlacher's performance, stating, [...] "We watched the film and everybody <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he just turned into the Incredible Hulk the last four minutes of the game, just killing people and running over and tackling whoever had the ball." [...] The Bears won the NFC Championship against the New Orleans Saints, 39–14, but lost Super Bowl XLI to the Indianapolis Colts, 29–17. Urlacher finished the season with 93 tackles and three forced fumbles. He was elected to the 2006 All-Pro Team and 2007 Pro Bowl, while also earning consideration for the League's Defensive Player of the Year award.|$|E

500|$|John Donovan of Sports Illustrated praised {{both teams}} for how {{unexpected}} their reaching the World Series <b>was,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> they were [...] "not {{supposed to be}} here." [...] He also called the series a [...] "blast from the past" [...] because both teams were very old franchises and had twice previously met in the World Series. In a breakdown of how the two teams matched up, he concluded that the edge was with the Red Sox in pitching and the Cardinals in defense and batting. Ultimately he concluded that Schilling and Martinez would be the [...] "key to [...] Series" [...] and that the Red Sox would win in six games. Jim Molony of MLB.com, said he expected the series to play out very differently from {{the last time the}} two teams met in the World Series in [...] This was because both team offenses had been some {{of the best in the}} league during the season, while pitching had been very dominant in 1967.|$|E
500|$|... "Like a Virgin" [...] {{was written}} by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The idea for the song {{originated}} when Steinberg was living at his father's vineyards in the Coachella Valley, and driving a red pickup truck one day. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Steinberg explained that the song was not written for Madonna or any female singer but was inspired by his personal experiences. At that time Steinberg had just come out of an emotionally challenging relationship, and he had met someone new. That inspired the lyrics for [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] about how he coped with the difficult situation. When he took the song to Kelly, they decided {{that it would be a}} sensitive ballad, however they could not decide how the word [...] "virgin" [...] would fit in it. Steinberg elaborated: [...] "I wasn't just trying to get that racy word virgin in a lyric. I <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> ... <b>that</b> I may not really be a virgin— I've been battered romantically and emotionally like many people— but I'm starting a new relationship and it just feels so good, it's healing all the wounds and making me feel like I've never done this before, because it's so much deeper and more profound than anything I've ever felt." ...|$|E
500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles. She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion, in Nashville, of Josh and Zac Farro's departure from Paramore. Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. {{as if it was}} going to be some kind of paradise or saving grace. I got there and realized that my problems were following me. Okay, so I was having a bad six months? Get over it. [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> to me, so I had to say it to myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content. However, he noted that its [...] "sunny" [...] sonority made it [...] "pleasant" [...] to hear.|$|E

500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E
500|$|The Byrds' {{recording}} of the song opens with a distinctive, Bach-inspired guitar introduction played by McGuinn and then, like Dylan's version, goes into the song's chorus. Although Dylan's version contains four verses, The Byrds only perform the song's second verse and two repeats of the chorus, followed by {{a variation on the}} song's introduction, which then fades out. The Byrds' arrangement of the song had been shortened during the band's rehearsals at World Pacific Studios in 1964, at the suggestion of Jim Dickson, in order to accommodate commercial radio stations, which were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long. Thus, while Dylan's version is five-and-a-half minutes long, The Byrds' runs just short of two-and-a-half minutes. The lead vocal on The Byrds' version of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was sung by McGuinn, who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in the popular music scene of the day, somewhere between the vocal sound of John Lennon and Bob Dylan. The song also took on a spiritual aspect for McGuinn during the recording sessions, as he told The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan in 1997: [...] "I was singing to God and I <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> God was the Tambourine Man and I was saying to him, 'Hey, God, take me for a trip and I'll follow you.' It was a prayer of submission." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Rangel became {{chair of}} the Select Committee on Narcotics, which {{solidified}} his position as a leading strategist on this perennially important issue to him. [...] Rangel kept the committee going, {{in the face of}} the usual pressure to disband special committees. [...] He battled against proposed cutbacks in the federal anti-drug budget, and advocated increased grants to states and cities for better shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel's amendments providing increased funding for state and local law enforcement were included in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. [...] He traveled to countries in Central and South America and elsewhere to inspect the sources of drugs and the law enforcement efforts against them; Ebony magazine termed Rangel [...] "a front-line general in the war against drugs." [...] Rangel said [...] "We need outrage!", making reference to the slow reaction by both government and religious leaders to the epidemics of crack cocaine, heroin, PCP, and other drugs that hit American streets during the 1980s. [...] He believed that legalizing drugs would represent [...] "moral and political suicide". [...] Nor did he refrain from criticizing those most affected by drugs, saying that Hispanic and black teenagers had no sense of self-preservation, and that drug dealers were so stupid that they had to eat in fast-food places because they could not read a menu. [...] By 1988, Rangel <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> President Ronald Reagan had not done enough in the war on drugs, but that First Lady Nancy Reagan's [...] "Just Say No" [...] campaign had been quite valuable. [...] The narcotics committee itself was termed possibly the most important select committee of its time. [...] The Washington Post said Rangel was [...] "in a powerful position to shape policy on an issue at the top of the nation's agenda." [...] He would remain as {{chair of the}} committee through 1993, when it was abolished along with other House select committees.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the voting}} in the Knesset on the war, only Hadash {{opposed the war}} (and even {{submitted}} a no-confidence motion against the Israeli government). Hadash Knesset member Meir Vilner said in the Knesset plenary session that: [...] "The government is leading Israel to an abyss. It is doing something that {{in the course of}} time might lead to crying for generations". In response, they were condemned, and calls were heard, among others from the editor of Yediot Ahronoth, to prosecute them for treason. Left-wing Knesset members, including Shulamit Aloni and Yossi Sarid, were absent from the plenary for the vote. Even the Labour faction voted in support.

2500|$|According to a musnad (supported) hadith, Muhammad made {{a speech}} at Ghadir Khumm in which he said, [...] "Of whomsoever I am the mawla, Ali is his mawla". Mawla {{has a number of}} {{meanings}} in Arabic. Although Shi'ites translate it as [...] "master" [...] or [...] "ruler" [...] and believe that Muhammad did not make 120,000 people wait in the desert for three days only to tell them to support Ali, some Sunni scholars say that Muhammad <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> his friends should befriend Ali; it was a response to Yemeni soldiers who had complained about Ali. A similar incident is described in Ibn Ishaq's Sirah, in which Muhammad reportedly said: [...] "Do not blame Ali, for he is too scrupulous in the things of God, or the way of God, to be blamed."(Guillaume p.650) Sunnis believe that interpreting an expression of friendship and support as the appointment of a successor is incorrect, and the leadership dispute after Muhammad's death proved that his statement was not an appointment.|$|E
2500|$|The {{revelation of}} Williams' pregame speech was also greeted with revulsion. ESPN NFL analyst and former Dallas Cowboys safety Darren Woodson said {{that much of}} Williams' speech was {{standard}} pregame rhetoric. According to Woodson, when Williams called for his men to [...] "attack the head" [...] of running back Frank Gore, he <b>was</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the 49ers' offense would be rendered ineffective if they managed to shut Gore down. However, Woodson felt that several parts of Williams' speech—particularly his calls to go after Crabtree's ACL and target Williams specifically because he had concussions in the past—went too far. His former teammate, NFL Network analyst Michael Irvin, said that he [...] "almost threw up" [...] when he heard Williams tell his men to go after Crabtree's ACL, saying that players are taught from youth football onward to [...] "never take out a man's knees." [...] Fox Sports' Mark Kriegel argued that the tape proved Williams was [...] "woefully underpunished," [...] especially since he made the speech after being alerted that the NFL had reopened its investigation. He called for Goodell to ban him from the league for life.|$|E
