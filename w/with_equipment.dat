He used a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones as a studio monitor {{in order not to}} wake up his roommate. It was subsequently mastered by Brian Gardner.|$|E
5|$|After the war the Manchester Fire Brigade {{was again}} municipalised, and reorganised.

5|$|Four months later, in May 2005, {{a second}} spike {{had to be}} cut off by firefighters after it was {{discovered}} hanging loose. At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public, and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed.

This consisted of retrofitting tip weights to 70% of the spikes' weights.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the {{expedition}} Nansen continued to experiment <b>with</b> <b>equipment</b> and techniques, altering {{the designs of}} skis and sledges and investigating types of clothing, tents and cooking apparatus, thereby revolutionising methods of Arctic travel. In the era of polar exploration which followed his return, explorers routinely sought Nansen's advice as to methods and equipment—although sometimes they chose not to follow it, usually to their cost. According to Huntford, the South Pole heroes Amundsen, Scott, and Ernest Shackleton were all Nansen's acolytes.|$|E
5|$|Bedford Castle {{was a large}} medieval {{castle in}} Bedford, England. Built after 1100 by Henry I, the castle played a {{prominent}} part in both the civil war of the Anarchy and the First Barons' War. The castle was significantly extended in stone, although the final plan of the castle remains uncertain. Henry III of England besieged the castle in 1224 following a disagreement with Falkes de Breauté; the siege lasted eight weeks and involved an army {{of as many as}} 2,700 soldiers <b>with</b> <b>equipment</b> drawn from across England. After the surrender of the castle, the king ordered its destruction. Although partially refortified in the 17th century during the English Civil War, the castle remained a ruin until the urban expansion in Bedford during the 19th century, when houses were built across much of the property. Today only part of the motte still stands, forming part of an archaeological park built on the site between 2007 and 2009.|$|E

5|$|Borchgrevink was not {{a trained}} scientist, and his {{incompetence}} <b>with</b> <b>equipment</b> and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern {{to some of the}} party. However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the hut when the weather permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts alongside the hut. A concert was arranged, including lantern slides, songs and readings. During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk set fire to the hut and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fire fumes as they slept.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, {{amateur astronomers}} observe {{a variety of}} {{celestial}} objects and phenomena sometimes <b>with</b> <b>equipment</b> that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, {{and a variety of}} deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Quinet {{continued}} her {{service in the}} eastern Mediterranean {{after the end of}} the war in 1918. During the culmination of the Greco-Turkish War that immediately followed World War I, Edgar Quinet rescued 1,200 people from the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922. In 1925, Edgar Quinet was converted into a training ship. The work lasted until 1927, and included the reduction of her armament to ten of her 194mm guns, the removal of two of her funnels, and a reconstruction of her bridge. Then-Captain François Darlan commanded the ship in 1928. In 1929, Edgar Quinet underwent an overhaul; during this modernization she was fitted <b>with</b> <b>equipment</b> to handle floatplanes for reconnaissance purposes. After returning to service, the ship was assigned as a training ship for cadets from the École Navale (Naval Academy). On 4 January 1930, Edgar Quinet ran aground off the coast of Algeria west of Oran and proved to be a total loss. She sank five days later.|$|E
