5|$|The Chew Valley {{is an area}} in North Somerset, England, {{named after}} the River Chew, which rises at Chewton Mendip, and joins the River Avon at Keynsham. Technically, {{the area of the}} valley is bounded by the <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> area of the Chew and its tributaries; however, the name Chew Valley is often used less {{formally}} to cover other nearby areas, for example, Blagdon Lake and its environs, which by a stricter definition are part of the Yeo Valley. The valley is an area of rich arable and dairy farmland, interspersed with a number of villages.|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Wirrimbirra White' {{is a white}} {{form from}} Kangaloon near Robertson. Aboriginal legends of white waratahs existed, and several had been encountered, but none had been {{previously}} preserved in horticulture. Joseph Maiden had previously found a white waratah near Kurrajong, and others had been sighted near Narara on the Central Coast in 1919, and Colo Vale in the 1950s. Horticulturalist Frank Stone reported one in his garden, possibly propagated from the latter plant. 'Wirrimbirra White' was brought into cultivation in 1972 by cuttings from the original plant, which grew on <b>water</b> <b>catchment</b> property. It has pale greenish buds which open to a cream-white inflorescence. It is less vigorous than the parent species and vulnerable to borers. It is also highly vulnerable to the Macadamia twig girdler.|$|E

Bordering the Philippine Turtle Islands is the Turtle Islands National Park, it consists of three islands of Selingaan, Bakkungan Kechil and Gulisaan which is notable as the nesting place for green turtle and hawksbill sea turtle. Other important wildlife regions in Sabah include the Maliau Basin, Danum Valley, Tabin, Imbak Canyon and Sepilok. These places are either designated as national parks, wildlife reserves, virgin jungle reserves, or protection forest reserve. Beyond the coasts of Sabah lie a number of islands rich with coral reefs such as Ligitan, Sipadan, Selingaan, Tiga and Layang-Layang (Swallow Reef). Other main islands including the Jambongan, Timbun Mata, Bum Bum and the divided Sebatik. The Sabah state government has enacted several laws to protect its forests and endangered wildlife species under the Animals Ordinance 1962, Forest Enactment 1968 and the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 among others. Under the Wildlife Conservation Enactment, any persons hunting inside conservation lands are liable for imprisonment {{for five years and}} fined with RM50,000. The state government also plans to implement seasonal huntings as part of its conservation efforts to prevent the continuous lose of its endangered wildlife species while maintaining the state indigenous hunting traditions.|$|E

Meanwhile the purpose of this research was to know the governmental efforts to protect <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> area from sand mining in Sleman Regency, in particularly in Cangkringan Subdistrict. In addition the method used for collecting data was direct interview to the source person and respondent. From the research result, up till now the effort of legal protection conducted by the government towards <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> area has not been fully optimal. It is caused by some matters, e. g. the inexistence of particular regulation that rules, the lack of coordination between the related institution, and the lack of employees in governmental institution and also the lack of budget provided by regional government up till now. Thus the government of Sleman Regency should improve the working system in related institution and unify the similar vision and mission, as well as the government should establish a strict regulation for managing and supervising <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> area in Sleman Regency. For the surrounding society and the sand miners, they should have consideration and maintain the function of <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> area in order to decrease environmental destruction of which is resulted by the mining activity in <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> area...|$|R
40|$|Wildlife {{managers}} have assumed {{for years that}} the availability of free-standing water was a primary factor limiting the distribution, productivity, and recruitment of desert ungulates in the southwestern United States. As a result, wildlife management agencies and sportsman's organizations have invested significant time and resources in the construction and maintenance of <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> for game species, including desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana). Recently the efficacy of these catchments has been questioned and their use has become controversial. Although <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> {{have been used as}} a wildlife management tool for decades, very few studies have experimentally examined the influence of these catchments on populations. The objective {{of this study was to}} experimentally examine the influence of <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> on diet, movement, home range size, mortality, productivity, and recruitment of desert bighorn sheep.

40|$|Cryptosporidiosis, {{caused by}} the {{protozoan}} parasite Cryptosporidium, represents the major public health concern of water utilities in developed nations due to its small size, resistance to disinfection and ability to be shed in large numbers in faeces. In Australia, recreational access is not allowed on direct supply sources, however, in Western Australia, limited recreational access to drinking <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> has been allowed, although only in the outer catchment. Recreational activities within 2. km of the drinking water body is prohibited. The present study compared the amount, prevalence and species of Cryptosporidium in recreational versus non-recreational <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> in the south west of Western Australia (WA). Recreational <b>water</b> <b>catchments,</b> which allowed swimming and camping had a higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium {{and the majority of}} samples were the human-associated C. hominis. Non-recreational catchments had a lower prevalence and all the samples genotyped were C. parvum. Risk analysis identified increasing population as strongly correlated with an increase in the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in recreational catchments. This suggests that recreational access to drinking <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> is a serious public health risk and government policy limiting activities to the outer catchment should be supported...|$|R

40|$|Application of the Sustainable Nitrogen Management Program in {{two small}} {{agricultural}} watersheds (Arquennes – Belgium) and impact evaluation by monitoring of nitrate fluxes at outlets and by numerical modeling. Four <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> {{used by the}} Walloon Society of Water (SWDE) in the rural village of Arquennes (Province of Hainaut, Belgium) have been contaminated by nitrate (concentrations between 60 and 70 mg NO 3 -·l- 1) for several years. The catchment basins (31 ha and 47 ha) are located exclusively in a cultivated area on loamy soils. Since October 2004, these basins {{have been used as}} a pilot area for the environmental evaluation of good agricultural practices as regards nitrogen management (adaptation of amounts of mineral nitrogen fertilizers, farm manure management, soil cover after harvest, etc.) thanks to monitoring by farmers. This approach fits into the general pattern of the Sustainable Nitrogen Management Program (PGDA in French), which implements the European Nitrates Directive as part of Walloon legislation. The second objective of the working scheme is to study and to set up a decision-making tool aimed at preventing the contamination of water by agricultural nitrate around <b>water</b> <b>catchments.</b> Two numerical models (SWAT and FEFLOW®) were used together in order to simulate the passage of water and nitrogen from the soil surface to the <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> outlets. Calibration and validation of models were based, among other things, on soil and subsoil characterization and on tracer testing in both saturated and unsaturated zones. Moreover crop yield, farming practices, water and nitrate fluxes in <b>water</b> <b>catchments,</b> groundwater levels and nitrate concentration in groundwater were monitored for eight years. The results of simulations show that the application of PGDA in Arquennes watersheds would lead to a decrease in nitrate concentration (to almost 50 mg NO 3 -·l- 1) in <b>water</b> <b>catchments</b> in 2012. This expected improvement in water quality has been visible since 2009 in <b>water</b> <b>catchments,</b> with mean nitrate concentrations of lower than 50 mg NO 3 -·l- 1 at the end of 2012...|$|R
