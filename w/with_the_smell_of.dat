500|$|There {{was little}} advance {{excitement}} about the pending Warriors-Knicks game that Friday. Only five games {{remained in the}} regular season, with the Warriors (46–29) in second place—eleven games behind the Boston Celtics—and the Knicks in last place. Chamberlain {{had spent the night}} before the game in New York City, partying all night with a female companion before dropping her off at her home at 6am With no sleep and suffering from a hangover, he boarded the train to Philadelphia at 8am, met several friends at the Philadelphia train station, and had a long lunch with them, thus almost missing the team bus to Hershey. The other players were similarly bored. Warriors player York Larese said: [...] "The biggest thrill in my life was to see that. There was nothing exciting about the Knicks playing the Warriors in Hershey. Chocolate was more exciting." [...] The game was played at Hershey Sports Arena, an old drafty gym originally built for ice hockey. The league occasionally played games in remote towns to attract new fans. This was the Warriors' third [...] "home" [...] game of the season in Hershey, which was [...] from Philadelphia. [...] The Warriors' Tom Meschery called the arena [...] "god-forsaken place ... The town of Hershey was built around a huge chocolate factory; everything there became permeated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> chocolate. It was practically impossible to stay indoors; people felt sick. I was just dreaming to leave the place as fast as I could." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Pourville (Green Beach), LCAs {{carrying}} the South Saskatchewan Regiment touched {{down on the}} shingle beach at approximately 04:52 without having been detected. All the troops got ashore before the Germans opened fire. This was less {{than half an hour}} after zero hour. The LCA flotillas had left their landing ships punctually, but lost time on the run in. As the landing craft moved shoreward they received [...] "a warm wind laden <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> hayfields blowing upon them from the south." [...] Unfortunately, some of the landing craft had drifted off course on the way in, and most of the battalion was disembarked west of the Scie River, not east of it as planned. The opposition was much lighter on Green Beach for the landing craft and did not begin to stiffen for the South Saskatchewans until they were getting established on shore. German resistance to the Saskatchewans had been stiffening inland, but Green Beach was still not receiving heavy fire at approximately 05:35 when a LCA landed the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada. By 08:45 the expected link-up with Churchill tanks of the Calgary Regiment landing at White Beach had not taken place. When, at 09:40, the signal to withdraw was sent, German resistance was growing and the Saskatchewans and Camerons were being fought to a standstill.|$|E
