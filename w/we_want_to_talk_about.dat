40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{application}} of Concurrent Fuzzy Prolog (ConFuP) [10, 9] {{in the field of}} modeling flexible manufacturing systems. ConFuP offers the feasibility of concurrent process modeling through a set of descriptive rules based on uncertain or qualitative knowledge and enables the user to model hierarchical descriptions from a physical point of view (e. g. machines, tools, etc.) as well as from a logical one, where processes and machine states are described. Time considerations, modeling of alternative decisions and concurrency /synchronization are also supported by ConFuP. With fuzzy data types and operators (fuzzy sets, fuzzification, defuzzification) the formulation of different kinds of uncertainty is possible. System calls for different fuzzy operators, methods and strategies allow maximum flexibility. 1 Introduction Process modeling is (besides data modeling) {{one of the most important}} aspects in the CIMframework.

40|$|Wikimedia Foundation's wikis - {{first of}} all the Wikipedia project to create a free {{encyclopaedia}} - {{play an important role}} in wiki's success. Wikipedia is currently the 17 th most visited website worldwide so it's of general public interest to find out more about its structure and processes. Research on Wikipedia is supported by making its data publically available. Wikipedians reflect a lot on their project and there is a small but growing number of scientific papers in Wikipedia research. Most of the large wikis use the same MediaWiki-engine like Wikipedia so general wiki research can also profit from Wikipedia research. However it is difficult to analyze Wikipedia without basic knowledge of its particularities and some involvement in the community. This workshop wants to bring together people interested in further wikipedia research. A short overview of current Wikipedia research will be given as well as some practical guidelines on methods how to analyze data and where to get in contact with the community. Together <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> differences and commonalities of Wikipedia and other wikis and hot topics in Wikipedia research...|$|E

40|$|Language is {{a social}} tool {{that allows us to}} speak to others about the world. In doing so we need words that pick out those {{entities}} that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> Linguistic expressions that identify such entities are known as referential or referring expressions, including proper names (Laura), natural kind terms (water, gold, tiger), indexicals (you, I, she), and definite descriptions (the dog, the smallest positive number). The mechanisms of reference {{have been the subject of}} intense speculation, and the debate over descriptive (Frege 1892 / 1948; Searle, 1958) vs. causal (Kripke, 1972 / 1980) or hybrid theories of reference (Evans, 1973) is still rife in the semantics literature (Genone & Lombrozo, 2012; Lam, 2010; Martí, 2014). Whatever the theoretical approach to reference, from a developmental perspective the three key questions are the following: What is the trajectory of language learners’ comprehension and production of referential expressions? To what extent, and in which contexts, do children abide by the same linguistic constraints as adults in their referential choices? How do cross-linguistic differences shape the process of referential choice acquisition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to the verification of functional-logic programs. For our verification purposes, equational reasoning is not valid due {{to the presence of}} non-deterministic and partial functions. Our approach transforms functionallogic programs into Maude theories and then uses the Rewriting Logic logical framework to verify properties of the transformed programs. We propose an inductive proving method based on the length of the computation on the Rewriting Logic framework to cope with the non-deterministic and non-terminating aspects of the programs. We illustrate the application of the method on various examples, where we analyze the sequence of steps to be performed by the proof in order to get expertise for the automatization of the process. Then, since the proposed transformation process is also amenable of automatization, we will obtain a tool for proving properties of CRWL programs. Another advantage of our methodology, that distinguish it from other approaches, {{is that it does not}} confuse the original functional-logic program with the subjects <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> in the properties, but it allows the equational definition of observations on top of the transformed programs which simplifies the obtained proofs...|$|E
