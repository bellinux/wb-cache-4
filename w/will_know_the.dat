5|$|Lucius Belyakov is {{a mysterious}} man who appears in Ben's and Brother Justin's dreams as a Russian soldier. He is also {{revealed}} to be the previous generation's Creature of Light. Unknown at first, {{he is also the}} carnival's Management, hiding in his trailer and communicating with his carny workers solely through Samson. He is also the father of Iris and Justin Crowe. As Management remains unseen during the first season, it is unclear at first whether Management exists at all. Late in the season however, Management is shown to have a conversation with Lodz. In the second season, Management reveals himself to Ben as Lucius Belyakov, the soldier of his dreams who was once badly injured by a bear. Management wants Ben to break an unfolding chain of catastrophic events, which will lead to the death of millions. Management urges Ben to find and bring Scudder to him, as he <b>will</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> identity of the current generation's Avatar of Darkness. After Ben accomplishes his mission, Management attacks Scudder and is stabbed by Ben to protect the latter. Ben reveals to Samson that Management had planned for Ben to kill him so all of his powers would pass to Ben. With his last breath, Management tells Ben how to defeat the Usher, Ben's ultimate nemesis.|$|E

500|$|The Edict of Tolerance in 1787 gave Protestants {{legal status}} and a {{congregation}} was formed under the pastorship of Paul-Henri Marron, {{who had been}} serving as the chaplain at the Dutch embassy. [...] The congregation gained permission to worship openly in 1789 during the revolution and met {{in a variety of}} places including a wine shop before gaining permission to rent Saint-Louis-du-Louve, the first building dedicated to Protestant worship in the history of Paris. [...] For the dedication of the new church, or temple as French Protestants referred to their buildings, Pastor Marron preached from the text, [...] "Soyez joyeux dans l’espérance, patients dans l’affliction, persévérants dans la prière," [...] (be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer (Romans 12:12)). [...] When the mayor, Jean Bailly, attended in person on 13 October 1791 Marron chose the passage, [...] "Vous connaissez la vérité et la vérité vous rendra libres," [...] (you <b>will</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> truth, and the truth will set you free (John 8:32)).|$|E

2500|$|Generally {{early action}} {{is similar to}} early {{decision}} except the decision is not binding, so a student could apply to multiple colleges. The time frame is similar: apply by early November, get a decision by mid-December, although specific deadlines vary by school. It allows a student to compare competing offers. The exception {{is that there are}} four colleges – Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale—which have a single-choice early action program, meaning that an applicant can only apply early action to one school. Early action can be the best choice for students who know they prefer one particular school and have done everything possible to secure admission since a student <b>will</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> result of the application sooner, and to varying extents allows a student to compare aid offers from different schools. One report suggested that non-binding early action programs continued to be highly popular, and noticed that three schools––Harvard, Princeton, and the University of Virginia—which had abandoned early admissions programs in 2006, reestablished them in 2011 after other colleges failed to follow their lead. Generally fewer schools offer the early action program but ones that do include Georgetown University, MIT, and Boston College. One account suggested that early action did not give as much of an [...] "admissions edge" [...] as early decision because it was non-binding.|$|E
2500|$|Those who {{upheld a}} radical {{interpretation}} of {{the secrets of the}} Guide, from Joseph Caspi and Moses Narboni in the 14th century to Leo Strauss and Shlomo Pines in the 20th, proposed and developed tools and methods for the decoding of the concealed intentions of the Guide. Can we already find the roots of this approach in the writings of Samuel ben Judah ibn Tibbon, a few years after the writing of the Guide?...Ibn Tibbon's comments reveal his general approach toward the nature of the contradictions in the Guide: The interpreter need not be troubled by contradiction when one assertion is consistent with the [...] "philosophic view" [...] whereas the other is completely satisfactory to [...] "men of religion". Such contradictions are to be expected, and the worthy reader <b>will</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> reason for them and the direction they tend to...The correct reading of the Guide's chapters should be carried out in two complementary directions: on the one hand, one should distinguish each chapter from the rest, and on the other one should combine different chapters and construct out of them a single topic. Again, on the one hand, one should {{get to the bottom of}} the specific subject matter of each chapter, its specific [...] "innovation", an innovation not necessarily limited to the explicit subject matter of the chapter. On the other hand, one should combine scattered chapters which allude to one single topic so as to reconstruct the full scope of the topic.|$|E
