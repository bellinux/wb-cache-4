5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared <b>with</b> <b>skin</b> and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} bird-like {{anatomy and}} close relationship to other dromaeosaurids, paleontologists hypothesize that Deinonychus was probably covered in feathers. Clear fossil evidence of modern avian-style feathers exists for several related dromaeosaurids, including Velociraptor and Microraptor, though no direct evidence is yet known for Deinonychus itself. When conducting studies of {{such areas as}} the range of motion in the forelimbs, paleontologists like Phil Senter have taken the likely presence of wing feathers (as present in all known dromaeosaurs <b>with</b> <b>skin</b> impressions) into consideration.|$|E

5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, {{and direct}} contact <b>with</b> <b>skin</b> can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E
5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis <b>with</b> <b>skin</b> necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E
5|$|Contact <b>with</b> <b>skin</b> is dangerous, and {{adequate}} ventilation {{should be provided}} when melting this metal. Thallium(I) compounds have a high aqueous solubility and are readily absorbed through the skin. Exposure by inhalation should not exceed 0.1mg per cubic metre in an 8-hour time-weighted average (40-hour work week). Thallium will readily absorb through the skin and care {{should be taken to}} avoid this route of exposure as cutaneous absorption can exceed the absorbed dose received by inhalation at the PEL. Thallium is a suspected human carcinogen. For a long time thallium compounds were readily available as rat poison. This fact and that it is water-soluble and nearly tasteless led to frequent intoxication caused by accident or criminal intent.|$|E

25|$|Red wine {{may offer}} health {{benefits}} {{more so than}} white because potentially beneficial compounds are present in grape skin, and only red wine is fermented <b>with</b> <b>skins.</b> The amount of fermentation time a wine spends in contact <b>with</b> grape <b>skins</b> is an important determinant of its resveratrol content. Ordinary non-muscadine red wine contains between 0.2 and 5.8mg/L, depending on the grape variety, because it is fermented <b>with</b> the <b>skins,</b> allowing the wine to absorb the resveratrol. By contrast, a white wine contains lower phenolic contents because it is fermented after removal of skins.|$|R

25|$|Agouti {{signalling}} peptide (ASIP) acts as {{an inverse}} agonist, binding in place of alpha-MSH and thus inhibiting eumelanin production.

One, rs2424984 has been identified as an indicator of skin reflectance in a forensics analysis of human phenotypes across Caucasian, African-American, South Asian, East Asian, Hispanic and Native American populations and is about 3 times more common in non-African populations than in Africa. The other allele, 8188G (rs6058017) is significantly associated <b>with</b> <b>skin</b> color variation in African-Americans and the ancestral version occurs in only 12% of European and 28% of East Asian samples compared with 80% of West African samples.|$|E
