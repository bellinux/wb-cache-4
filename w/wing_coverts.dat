5|$|The {{juvenile}} T.l. ludovicianus {{is similar}} in appearance, but the plumage is generally paler with a softer texture with buff-tipped <b>wing</b> <b>coverts,</b> a superciliary streak is less white, a fluffy vent and crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) without bars. In August and September, the partial plumage molt for the post-juvenile wrens is darker in color and affects the contour plumage, <b>wing</b> <b>coverts,</b> tail and develops a whiter superciliary stripe. The post-nuptial molt for adults {{in the same time}} period is more pronounced in color than the spring molt, with both sexes similar in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The sexes are similar, but {{the female}} {{tends to be}} duller than the male, with a brown tint to the head, brown upperparts and less bright underparts. However, some birds cannot be safely sexed on plumage alone. The {{juvenile}} is paler in color than the adult male and has dark spots on its breast, and whitish <b>wing</b> <b>coverts.</b> First-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, {{but they tend to}} be duller, and a small percentage retains a few juvenile <b>wing</b> <b>coverts</b> or other feathers.|$|E
5|$|Adults have a {{complete}} moult after breeding which takes about 80 days, starting from late May onwards and finishing by late September. The moult period for Siberian birds is more compressed, running from June to mid-September. Fledged juveniles moult some of their <b>wing</b> <b>coverts</b> when they are about eight weeks old.|$|E
5|$|Adult Eurasian rock pipits have a {{complete}} moult in August–September, at which time juveniles replace their body and some <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers, giving them an appearance very like the adults. From late January to early March there is a partial moult and individually variable moult of some body and <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers, and sometimes the central tail feathers.|$|R
500|$|Adults {{undergo a}} {{complete}} [...] moult between July and September after breeding has finished. Juvenile birds have a partial moult {{in the same}} time period, replacing head, body and some <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers.|$|R
50|$|An {{immature}} is duller and {{lacks the}} semi-collar of an adult. It also has buff edges {{to all the}} upper part and <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers, while the plumage below is broadly edged greyish-white.|$|R
5|$|A {{juvenile}} {{often has}} a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look {{darker than the}} pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill shape of the young {{may not be as}} fully developed as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with <b>wing</b> <b>coverts</b> lacking white spots.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies, S. c. carolinensis, has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown of the head), {{and a black}} band on the upper back. The <b>wing</b> <b>coverts</b> and flight feathers are very dark gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a thin white wing bar. The face and the underparts are white. The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.|$|E
5|$|Adult great spotted {{woodpeckers}} have {{a complete}} moult after the breeding season which takes about 120days. Northern D. m. major starts its moult from mid-June to late July and finishes in October or November, temperate races like D. m. pinetorum are earlier, commencing in early June to mid-July and completing in mid-September to late October, and southern D. m. hispanicus starts late May or June and finishes as early as August. Juveniles have a partial moult, retaining some of the <b>wing</b> <b>coverts</b> but replacing body, tail and primary feathers. This moult to near-adult plumage starts from late May to early August and finishes from mid-September to late November, timing varying with latitude as with the adults.|$|E
50|$|The {{juvenile}} {{has less}} contrast in the wings, but the remiges bear prominent white spots. It differs from {{greater spotted eagle}} juveniles {{by a lack of}} <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> spotting and the presence of a cream-colored neck patch.|$|R
50|$|Adults of {{both sexes}} are {{similarly}} plumaged, but males are slightly larger than females. Young birds have the white areas of plumage tinged with grey, a less distinct breast band, and pale fringes to the upperpart and <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers.

5|$|The {{song thrush}} (as {{represented}} by the nominate subspecies T. p. philomelos) is 20 to 23.5centimetres (8 to 9.25in) in length and weighs 50–107grammes (1.8 to 3.8oz). The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and neatly black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks {{on the back and}} <b>wing</b> <b>coverts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some <b>wing</b> <b>coverts</b> spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
5|$|Males {{entering}} {{their second}} or third year may develop spotty blue and white plumage during the breeding season. By their fourth year, males have assumed their nuptial plumage, where the scapulars, secondary <b>wing</b> <b>coverts,</b> and secondary flight feathers are white {{while the rest of}} their bodies are a vibrant cobalt blue. All sexually mature males moult twice a year, once before the breeding season in winter or spring, and again afterwards in autumn; rarely, a male may moult directly from nuptial to nuptial plumage. The breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent due to the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E
50|$|A slender, long tailed wagtail {{with light}} buish grey upperparts and white underparts {{with a narrow}} black breast band. The wings are black with white feather edges and two white <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> bars. The outer tail is white and the tail centre is black. The face is blackish broken up with a white {{supercilium}} and the eyelid. Juveniles are browner than adults.|$|R
40|$|Wild turkeys, Meleagris gallopavo, {{are among}} the most ornamented birds in North America, {{displaying}} vividly coloured fleshy ornaments on their heads and bright, iridescent structural coloration in their plumage. We investigated the effect of experimental inoculation with coccidian parasites on the expression of iridescent structural coloration in yearling male turkeys. Prior to moult of ornamental feathers, we assigned turkeys to three experimental groups: we maintained six turkeys free of coccidial infection, inoculated four turkeys with a single species of coccidial oocysts, and inoculated six turkeys with multiple species of coccidial oocysts. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify the plumage coloration of <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> and breast feathers in the breeding plumage of males in each treatment protocol. We found significant treatment-based variation in the iridescent plumage coloration of yearling male turkeys such that infected males showed proportionately less UV reflectance in their <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> and breast feathers and had duller breast feathers. This is the first experimental evidence that parasites can suppress the expression of structural plumage coloration, and our findings suggest that, in wild turkeys, iridescent coloration could serve as a condition-dependent signal of male health...|$|R
50|$|Adults {{undergo a}} {{complete}} moult between July and September after breeding has finished. Juvenile birds have a partial moult {{in the same}} time period, replacing head, body and some <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers. The only species that can potentially be confused with the Siberian accentor is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat. The Siberian accentor is still distinguishable by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a white line below the black face mask.|$|R
5|$|The {{nestling}} is born nearly featherless {{except for}} tiny primary quills {{and a fine}} down along its spine, humerus, forearm, and femur. Its skin is dark pink but displays variable black patches on its upperside. The gape is yellow. As the nestling develops, its plumage begins to resemble that of the adult, though it has white flecks on its <b>wing</b> <b>coverts</b> and the featherless skin on the head is black or dark brown, not powder blue, on the forecrown and dark reddish brown, not carmine, on the hindcrown. After fledging, the immature closely resembles the adult except for the bare patch {{on the back of}} the head being golden yellow instead of carmine and the tail being only a third as long as that of an adult.|$|E
5|$|The vulture is {{minimally}} sexually dimorphic, with {{no difference}} in plumage and little in size between males and females. The juvenile vulture has a dark bill and eyes, and a downy, gray neck that soon begins to turn the orange of an adult. Younger vultures are a slate gray overall, and, while they look similar to the adult by the third year, they do not completely molt into adult plumage until they are around {{five or six years}} of age. Jack Eitniear of the Center for the Study of Tropical Birds in San Antonio, Texas reviewed the plumage of birds in captivity of various ages and found that ventral feathers were the first to begin turning white from two years of age onwards, followed by wing feathers, until the full adult plumage was achieved. The final immature stages being a scattered black feathers in the otherwise white lesser <b>wing</b> <b>coverts.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Peruvian booby {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} but has grey feet, whiter head and neck, and white spots on its <b>wing</b> <b>coverts.</b> The ranges of the two species overlap {{in the waters of}} northern Peru and southern Ecuador.|$|E
50|$|This {{is one of}} {{the smaller}} Old World warblers, at 9.5-11 cm long and {{weighing}} 4-9 g distinctly smaller than a chiffchaff but slightly larger than Pallas's leaf warbler. Like many other leaf warblers, it has overall greenish upperparts and white underparts. It also has prominent double wing bars formed by yellowish-white tips to the <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers (a long bar on the greater coverts and a short bar on the median coverts), yellow-margined tertial feathers, and long yellow supercilium. Some individuals also have a faint paler green central crown stripe though many do not show this.|$|R

50|$|The river lapwing is 29-32 cm long. It has a black crest, crown, {{face and}} central throat and grey-white neck sides and nape. It has a grey-brown breast band and white underparts {{with a black}} belly patch. The back is brown, the rump is white and the tail is black. This is a {{striking}} species in flight, with black primaries, white under wings and upper wing secondaries, and brown upper wing coverts.Adults of both sexes are similarly plumaged, but males are slightly larger than females. Young birds have the brown tips to the black head feathers, a sandier brown back, and pale fringes to the upperpart and <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers. The call of the river lapwing is a sharp tip-tip or did-did-did.|$|R
25|$|Measuring 19–21cm (8in) in length, {{this small}} vibrant and brightly {{coloured}} parrot is sexually dimorphic. The male has a scarlet chest, a cobalt blue face, and bright green upperparts. The lower breast and underparts are yellow, and the <b>wing</b> <b>coverts</b> are pale blue. The tail is green, {{the eyes are}} brown and the bill is blackish, and legs are brown-grey. The female likewise has a blue face, although the coloration is less extensive, green upperparts and green breast, with yellow underparts. Immature birds are duller versions of their respective adult forms. Males begin to get red plumage on their chest from around {{two or three months}} of age, though do not complete their red chest until fifteen to eighteen months old.|$|E
25|$|Males {{and females}} {{are about the}} same size, and do not differ conspicuously in {{appearance}} except by direct comparison. In the female the underparts are greyer and are usually visibly barred greyish-brown, and the white wing and tail markings are characteristically less in extent (though this is rarely clearly visible except in flight). Fledged young birds are heavily tinged greyish-brown all over, with barring on the upperside and indistinct buffy-white markings. The tips of the tertiary remiges and the <b>wing</b> <b>coverts</b> are also buffy, with a black band in the latter. In the North American subspecies borealis, the fledglings are tinged quite brown indeed on upperside and wings, and have sharp and dark underside bars. In Eurasia, fledglings moult into a female-like plumage with the tertiary bars usually remaining in autumn. Across its range, the young acquire the adult plumage in their first spring.|$|E
25|$|The {{rufous-naped lark}} {{is a fairly}} large and robust lark species, with rather heavy flight. The sexes are similar, but males average larger and heavier. Adults are {{individually}} and geographically variable. It measures 15–18cm from bill tip to tail tip and weighs 40-44g. The streaked upper parts, short erectile crest, creamy-buff eyebrow that merges with the lore, and the rufous flight feathers are easily discernible features. The hindcrown and nape are streaked along the feather centers while the margins vary from chestnut, rufous or pinkish buff to greyish brown. The wings appear conspicuously rufous in flight, while the outer edges of the primaries show up as a rufous panel on the closed wing. The underwing coverts are rufous, and upper coverts are broadly edged tawny or buff (or grey in race grisescens). The tail is dark brown, but the outer webs of the outer tail feathers vary from buff (cf. africana and sharpii) to tawny or bright rufous. The mantle is lighter brown than the back, and the rump still darker brown. The flanks are a shade darker than the rufous-buff belly, but regionally the plumage may also be stained red by soil. The throat is unmarked but the pale rufous upper breast is streaked and spotted darker brown. The eyes are hazel brown, the longish bill is blackish and pinkish, and the feet pink to pinkish brown. Juveniles have bold black spotting on the crown, mantle and <b>wing</b> <b>coverts,</b> all edged with buff, while the breast spotting is more blotchy or diffuse.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to inhibiting {{the production of}} melanin pigment in random areas the Recessive Pied mutation also modifies {{the distribution of the}} yellow pigment in green-series birds: the intensity of yellow pigmentation in the leading or outermost edge of the wing primaries is enhanced. As this is {{the only part of the}} primaries visible in the folded wing the wings appear much yellower than those of the Lutino, which most clearly shows the normal distribution of the yellow pigment. A similar effect in the <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers imparts a more uniform yellow colouration to the clear parts of the wing, which in consequence entirely lack the ghost markings visible in the Lutino. The long tail feathers are similarly affected, being a deeper yellow than those of the Lutino.|$|R
50|$|Pallas's leaf warbler {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} warblers, with a large head and short tail. At 9 - 10 cm long and 4 - 7 g in weight, it is slightly smaller than a yellow-browed warbler and barely any larger than a goldcrest. It has greenish upperparts and white underparts, but is very striking, with prominent pale yellow double wingbars on the <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers, bold yellow supercilia and central crown stripe, and a lemon-yellow rump. The bill is blackish-brown with a yellowish tinge to the cutting edges and the base of the lower mandible, the iris is brown, and the legs are brown with a green or greyish tinge. Although the yellow rump is obvious when a bird is low in vegetation or hovering, it can otherwise be hard to see.|$|R
500|$|Other {{nightjar}} species {{occur in}} parts of the breeding and wintering ranges. The red-necked nightjar breeds in Iberia and northwest Africa; it is larger, greyer and longer winged than the European nightjar, and has a broad buff collar and more conspicuous white markings on the wings and tail. Wintering European nightjars in Africa may overlap with the related rufous-cheeked and sombre nightjars. Both have a more prominent buff hind-neck collar and more spotting on the <b>wing</b> <b>coverts.</b> The sombre nightjar is also much darker than its European cousin. Given their nocturnal habits, cryptic plumage and difficulty of observation, nightjar observation [...] "is as much a matter of fortune as effort or knowledge".|$|E

In stark contrast, the <b>wing</b> <b>coverts,</b> flight feathers and tail are dark grey to black, as is the prominent thick neck ruff. The head and neck are devoid of feathers, the skin shades of red and purple on the head, vivid orange on the neck and yellow on the throat. On the head, the skin is wrinkled and folded, and there is a highly noticeable irregular golden crest attached on the cere above its orange and black bill; this caruncle does not fully form until the bird’s fourth year.|$|E
500|$|The brolga {{is a tall}} {{bird with}} a large beak, long slender neck and stilt-like legs. The sexes are indistinguishable in {{appearance}} though the females are usually a little smaller.

5000|$|Early explorers of Cuba, such as Christopher Columbus and Diego Álvarez Chanca, {{mentioned}} macaws on Cuba in 14th- and 15th-century writings. Cuban macaws {{were described}} and illustrated in several early accounts about the island. In 1811, Johann Matthäus Bechstein scientifically named the species Psittacus tricolor. Bechstein's description {{was based on}} the bird's entry in François Le Vaillant's 1801 book Histoire Naturelle des Perroquets. Le Vaillant's account was itself partially based on the late 1700s work Planches Enuminées and a specimen in Paris; as it is unknown which specimen this was, the species has no holotype. Jacques Barraband's original watercolour painting which was the basis of the plate in Le Vaillant's book differs from the final illustration in showing bright red lesser <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers ("shoulder" [...] area), but the significance of this is unclear.|$|R
500|$|Clark {{noted that}} the {{iridescent}} feathers described are not unique to the Guadeloupe amazon, as other freshly killed amazons also show this {{to a greater or}} lesser degree, especially the Saint Vincent amazon (Amazona guildingii). He suggested that the black of the head and underparts of the Guadeloupe bird could have been the borders of the feathers, as seen in the imperial amazon, whereas the green may have been a sign of immaturity, like in the Saint Vincent amazon. He also likened the brownish green upperparts to those of a young Saint Vincent amazon, and suggested that the red [...] "rosettes" [...] mentioned by Du Tertre may have been scattered feathers in the <b>wing</b> <b>covert</b> feathers. Clark listed features of the imperial amazon which contrasted with those of the Guadeloupe amazon, such as its deep purple head and underparts, green upperparts, wings with dark brown, purple, green, blue and red feathers.|$|R
