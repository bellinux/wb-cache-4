[...] According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore stuck his head into the compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, [...] "There's a little kid out there with a hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'."

Quoting Henry James, President Reagan said in honoring his old friend that [...] "art was the shadow of humanity" [...] and that Sinatra had [...] "spent his life casting a magnificent and powerful shadow". On September 21, 1983, Sinatra filed a $2 million court case against Kitty Kelley, suing her in punitive damages, before her unofficial biography, His Way, was even published. The book became a best-seller for [...] "all the wrong reasons" [...] and [...] "the most eye-opening celebrity biography of our time", according to <b>William</b> <b>Safire</b> of The New York Times. Sinatra was always adamant that such a book would be written on his terms, and he himself would [...] "set the record straight" [...] in details of his life. According to Kelley, the family detested her and the book, which took its toll on Sinatra's health. Kelley claims that Tina Sinatra blamed her for her father's colon surgery in 1986.
