5|$|In the sonnet, {{the poet}} writes of <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> stopped {{showering}} his muse with flowery praise and adoration. In {{his analysis of}} Shakespeare's Sonnets, David West suggests that the sequence of sonnets 100-103 and the silence described are {{a response to the}} infidelity of the Fair Youth in the Rival Poet sequence of sonnets (78-86), which has caused a rift between the poet and his Muse. He writes of how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, the Poet begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100-103, where the Poet expresses his regret over what has transpired.|$|E

500|$|For DmC: Devil May Cry, a reboot of the series, Dante was {{completely}} redesigned {{as a result}} of comments by the Capcom staff.

While the original Dante was designed from a Japanese perspective, the new one was made from a Western perspective.
