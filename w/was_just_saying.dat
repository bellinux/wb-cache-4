500|$|According to Steven Curtis Chapman, {{the idea}} for [...] "Miracle of the Moment" [...] {{came out of a}} song he had written called [...] "Find Me", which did not end up being {{included}} on This Moment. He reflected that he thought [...] "God <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> 'I really just want you to be present in this moment - the good ones, the bad ones - all that'". [...] "Miracle of the Moment" [...] was written and produced by Chapman and Matt Bronlewee. It was mixed by F. Reid Shippen and mastered by Ted Jensen.|$|E
500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying</b> let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E
500|$|By coincidence, Olympic team {{training}} {{took place}} in Tarwater's hometown of Knoxville. At the Olympics, Tarwater swam the third leg of the preliminary round of the men's 4×200-meter relay. His time of 1:46.33 was a personal best, and the second-fastest leg for Team USA, which turned in the fastest preliminary swim, and third-fastest among all 64 swimmers. He attributed his performance to concentrating exclusively on the freestyle during the two months between Trials and the Games. Of his Olympic experience, Tarwater said, [...] "Even at 28, {{with a lot of}} international experience, nothing matches the Olympics. [...] My heart was pumping so intensely that I was just trying to calm myself down. [...] Standing on the blocks, waiting to take the exchange, I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Breathe. [...] Breathe. [...] Breathe.'... It's such a rush." [...] Typically, the relay team for the finals is composed of the top two qualifiers plus the two fastest swimmers in the preliminaries. In 2012, however, the U.S. team had its top three swimmers in reserve, as Phelps would swim the relay final despite dropping the individual 200-meter freestyle from his program. [...] After Tarwater's fast preliminary swim, the U.S. coaches strongly considered replacing number three Olympic Trials qualifier Ricky Berens with Tarwater in the finals, before electing to go with Berens due to Berens' greater experience. In the finals, the U.S. relay team beat the second-place French team by three seconds, winning Tarwater a gold medal.|$|E
