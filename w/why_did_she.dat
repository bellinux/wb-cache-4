25|$|On the Champ de Mars parade {{ground the}} decorations for the Bastille Day celebration are {{destroyed}} by a storm. An aggressive, raving drunk wanders around. Charlotte meets Camille again and finds him more dispirited than ever. He admits to her his total, profound political disillusionment; she, on the contrary, believes that a heroic deed is more necessary than ever. They are pestered by the drunk who accuses Camille of being a traitor, whereupon a patrol appears and arrests him. Charlotte delivers an attack against the Revolution's abuses of power. Gaston arrives and justifies the arrest but Marat frees Camille, after Charlotte vouches for him. Gaston is amazed as much as Marat himself by this unexpected clemency, while Charlotte asks herself <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> miss this new opportunity to murder Marat. He feels ill again and wants to be taken home.|$|E
2500|$|One {{can give}} an {{explanation}} of why one followed a particular rule in a particular case. But any explanation for rule following behaviour cannot be given in terms of following a rule, without involving circularity. One can say something like [...] "She did X because of the rule R" [...] but if you say [...] "She followed R because of the rule R1" [...] one can then ask [...] "but <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> follow rule R1?" [...] and so potentially become involved in a regression. Explanation must have an end.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Germany {{does not}} wish for war," [...] Captain Fielder persisted, [...] "why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> keep such an {{extraordinary}} army? <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> continually add to her navy? <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> infest our country with spies and keep all her preparations as secret as possible?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> come so promptly, {{when she}} must [...] know That she's only the nearer to the {{inevitable}} farewell; The hill is steep, on the snow my steps are slow-- <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> come, when she knows what I have to [...] tell? ...|$|R
5000|$|Ms. Dunbar, Robner's secretary: <b>why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> seem so nervous? ...|$|R
2500|$|Martha Cutter {{notes that}} Brown portrayed his women {{characters}} generally as passive victims {{of slavery and}} as representations of True Women and the cult of domesticity, which were emphasized at the time for women. They are not portrayed as wanting or seeking freedom, but as existing through love and suffering. Cutter asks, if Mary could free George, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> not free herself? Although Brown published three later versions of Clotel, he did not seriously change this characterization of the African-American women. [...] Slave women such as Ellen Craft were known to have escaped slavery, but Brown did not portray such women fully achieving freedom.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall see!" [...] {{she cried}} fiercely. [...] "You can't frighten me! If {{the paper is}} of no value, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> steal it, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> carry it sewn in her clothes? If you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But before I go," [...] I said, [...] "tell me this: <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> {{not send}} me some word from Lisbon? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> not give Captain Stearns {{a line on}} a piece of paper or some message?" ...|$|E
50|$|Dr. Reef co-authored {{a dating}} book titled <b>Why</b> <b>Does</b> he <b>do</b> that? <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> that?. He is a {{contributor}} for the Huffington Post, {{and his work}} has been profiled in Forbes and the Christian Science Monitor.|$|R
60|$|<b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> let him hang about her? She {{must know}} she's turning his silly head.|$|R
6000|$|What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> mean by {{this look}} and this imploring gesture? <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> come so close? What is {{the letter that}} she holds? ...|$|R
60|$|She sat {{leaning on}} her elbow, looking at nothing. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> stay {{listening}} to my absurd chatter? And not only that; but <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> powder her face in preparation for my arrival? It seemed to be her idea of making a toilette, and in her untidy negligence a sign of great effort towards personal adornment.|$|E
60|$|The captain knit his brows. This was {{extraordinary}} {{action on the}} part of the vessel. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> steer so straight for land? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> so quickly drop anchor and put out two boats? Could it be that this vessel had been on their track? Could it be that the Peruvian government--But he could not waste time in surmise as to what might be. They must act, not conjecture.|$|E
6000|$|Why, {{the fact}} is, that Mr Westlock was passing at that moment. The Temple {{is a public}} thoroughfare; they may write up on the gates that it is not, but {{so long as the}} gates are left open it is, and will be; and Mr Westlock had as good a right to be there as anybody else. But <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> run away, then? Not being ill dressed, for she was much too neat for that, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> run away? The brown hair that had fallen down beneath her bonnet, and had one impertinent imp of a false flower {{clinging}} to it, boastful of its licence before all men, THAT could not have been the cause, for it looked charming. Oh! foolish, panting, frightened little heart, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> run away! ...|$|E

5000|$|Where is Vesory’s chief {{taking her}} in the sports car—and <b>why?</b> <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> really love Versory or is she only using him? ...|$|R
5000|$|Long ago, Zoe Heriot {{shared an}} {{adventure}} {{with a man}} called the Doctor — but she remembers him leaving afterwards. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>does</b> <b>she</b> have detailed dreams of travelling {{with him in the}} TARDIS? <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> fear the Daleks, if she never met them? Can someone with an eidetic memory truly forget the past? ...|$|R
6000|$|And why, Clennam asked, as {{he turned}} his eyes upon the fire, bent his brows, and {{considered}} again; <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> suppose that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{secretary}} {{assured me}} that Miss Cliffe would be safe with the alcalde's wife; I shall hold him responsible. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> leave Valverde?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bury her, then!' {{returned}} he. 'But <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> do it? I am sure I {{said nothing}} to make her throw herself into the oven.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> come? She {{reminds me}} of the lost; She {{reminds me of}} the dead: In her form like the other, In her walk like the other: <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> come? ...|$|R
5000|$|Why has Lady Beatrice {{suddenly}} forgone {{her usual}} habit of stopping {{to greet her}} favourite horse? <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> just ride on by in her carriage? ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bosengate was puzzled. <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> laugh? He looked round, {{saw that}} the {{children}} were gone, took his pipe from his mouth, and approached her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What ails our mother, father?' {{said the}} boy. 'And <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> shut me {{in here with}} these {{children}} when {{it seems that there}} is fighting without?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you, darling!" [...] cried Sylvie. [...] "I {{like your}} present best of all!" [...] (But if so, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> {{give it back}} so quickly?) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And when" [...] said Honora, [...] "when Mrs. Dwyer has dinner-parties for celebrated {{people who}} come here, <b>why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> invite you {{in to see the}} table?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you lounge {{about on}} that terrace for every evening? And <b>why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> get fluttered when your shadow begins {{to come and}} go?" [...] demanded Edward.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's {{a regular}} play actor. I don't like made-up people. <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> go {{around with her}} sleeves rolled up that way, and--and her dress open at the throat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, foolish, panting, timid little heart, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> feign to be {{unconscious}} of his coming! Why wish herself so far away, yet be so flutteringly happy there! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> look at {{him like}} that? Ugly girl! How hateful ugly people were! When she was gone, he reopened {{the door of the}} waiting-room, and listened.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true enough; {{but then}} <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> {{make all the}} world believe he was engaged to her, if he wasn't?--And if he wasn't, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> let him go on as though he was, being at all hours, I'm told, with her at Ballycloran?--and {{if they are not}} to be married, why does her brother let him be coming there at all? I know you're fond of them, Father John, and I'd be sorry to think ill of your friends; but I must say it begins to look odd." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a {{comfortable}} theory for her. I {{hope you will}} never impart it to the old folks. <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> let them bully her? Is she not her own mistress?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look," [...] cried Aissa. [...] "Look at {{the mother}} of your son! <b>She</b> is afraid. <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>she</b> not go from before my face? Look at her. She is ugly." ...|$|R
