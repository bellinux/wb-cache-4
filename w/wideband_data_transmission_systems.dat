40|$|Abstract: An optical {{synchronization}} {{technique is}} described for the demultiplexer of a <b>wideband</b> optical <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>system.</b> In this system, the closely spaced optical pulses of interleaved PCM channels are “space sorted ” by a coincidence detection technique using an optical reference waveform {{generated in the}} receiver. For synchronization of the reference waveform with a spatial waveform produced by the received laser beam in the demultiplexer, a number of pulses on these two optical waveforms are coded with a pseudo-random sequence. Acquisition of the coded waveforms for synchronization is indicated in an optical matched filter. For automatic track-ing, a synchronization error-control circuit is added. This communication suggests an optical correlation method for synchronization in an optical <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> in which many pulse-code modulated (PCM) channels are time-multiplexed [1 - 31. In the particular type of system discussed here, the sequence of data pulses transmitted during each time frame is derived from one pulse of a mode-locked laser[4]. Each time frame contains pulses used for the acquisition and error control of synchronization {{as well as the}} pulses that are singl...|$|R

30|$|Based on the {{different}} implementation methods, the adaptive filtering modes of <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> {{can be divided into}} analog adaptive filtering and digital adaptive filtering. Analog adaptive filtering technology is to add an analog filter at the front end of demodulator to adapt channel amplitude and group delay characteristic. This technology cannot adjust with channel changes, has poor adaptability, and cannot solve orthogonal unbalance impact of microwave modulator. Digital adaptive filtering technology has strong adaptability, highly matches with channel, and can rectify orthogonal unbalance, thus its overall effect is superior to analog adaptive filtering technology. Therefore, digital adaptive filtering technology is adopted in high-speed <b>data</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
