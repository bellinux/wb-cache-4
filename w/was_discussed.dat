5|$|Before her marriage, Louise {{served as}} an {{unofficial}} secretary to her mother, the Queen (1866–1871). The question of Louise's marriage <b>was</b> <b>discussed</b> in the late 1860s.

Despite opposition from members of the royal family, Louise fell in love with John, Marquess of Lorne, the heir to the Duke of Argyll. Victoria consented to the marriage, which took place on 21 March 1871. Despite a happy beginning, the two drifted apart, possibly because of their childlessness and the Queen's constraints on their activities.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to rapid}} {{advances}} and availabilities of powerful image processing softwares, {{it is easy}} to manipulate and modify digital images. So it is very difficult for a viewer to judge the authenticity of a given image.

In the paper, first, classification of Image forgery detection techniques <b>is</b> <b>discussed</b> and the two important techniques for pixel based forgery detection <b>are</b> <b>discussed.</b> A technique for copy-move forgery detection <b>is</b> <b>discussed.</b> But this approach takes into account only shifting of copied regions.
