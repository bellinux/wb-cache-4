5|$|In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect, {{written in}} Cyrillic (and {{at times in}} Latin for social networking), is predominant, while in Inner Mongolia, the {{language}} is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script. In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian (i.e., the standard written language as formalized in the <b>writing</b> <b>conventions</b> and in the school grammar), but {{much of what is}} to be said is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects, especially Chakhar.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} use of Arabic script for Tunisian was {{recorded}} in the 17th century, when Sheykh Karray wrote several poems in Tunisian Arabic for mystic purposes. However, transcription of Tunisian Arabic was not common until 1903, when the Gospel of John was transcribed in Tunisian Arabic using Arabic script. After the World War I, the use of Arabic script to Tunisian Arabic became very common with the works of Taht Essour. Nowadays, {{it has become the}} main script used for Tunisian Arabic, even in published books, but <b>writing</b> <b>conventions</b> for Tunisian Arabic are not standardized and can change from one book to another.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, Native Americans groups {{had not yet}} formed the large {{political}} “tribes” known from the historical era during {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries, and many tribal names used in historical literature do not apply in the seventeenth century. Many tribal names were actually amalgamations of earlier groups that had been decimated by wars and disease and banded together for mutual safety. Groups were also known by many different names, which also made identifying specific groups difficult. Group names were often recorded before the group met Europeans, and was frequently the name that enemies knew them by and in a different language family from what the group themselves spoke. These names were then transliterated into several European written languages, particularly French, English, Dutch, and Spanish. These European languages often had different phonetic stylings for the foreign languages of the Native Americans, and this translation and transliteration was conducted in an era before many modern <b>writing</b> <b>conventions,</b> resulting in inconsistent spelling, grammar and alphabetic characters.|$|E

In the case of the earlier version of the tale, this may have been a case of a man imitating the <b>writing</b> <b>conventions</b> of female authors. Rosette F. Willig, who translated it into English, considers the version she used, Ima Torikaebaya, to have been written between 1100–70, and suggested that some elements of the tale may be autobiographical.

50|$|There is {{some debate}} amongst EAP {{teachers}} {{as to the}} best way to help students with academic English.
