5|$|An {{aboriginal}} Australian fable retold by the Welsh school headmaster William Jenkyn Thomas (1870–1959) {{tells how}} some animals needed a canoe {{to cross the}} ocean. Whale had one but refused to lend it, so Starfish kept him busy, telling him stories and grooming him to remove parasites, while the others stole the canoe. When Whale realized the trick he beat Starfish ragged, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> Starfish still is today.|$|E

5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself because he had a fear of not being able to keep up. There were a few years that Lee was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E
25|$|Domestically, the colectivo is {{also called}} bondi; the word {{comes from the}} name of Rio de Janeiro's tramways (bondes), in turn from English bonds, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the {{government}} paid for the Rio tramway system to the British company that built it.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after 2000, {{business}} intelligence software producers became interested in producing universally applicable BI systems which don’t require expensive installation, and could hence be considered by smaller and midmarket businesses which could not afford on premise maintenance. These aspirations emerged in parallel with the cloud hosting trend, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> most vendors came to develop independent systems with unrestricted access to information.|$|E
25|$|There exist {{animals that}} are {{sensitive}} to various types of infrared, but not by means of quantum-absorption. Infrared sensing in snakes depends {{on a kind of}} natural thermal imaging, in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation. EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> these animals detect it.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} ideas speak to the crux of Plato's Problem, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> {{to account for the}} gap between {{knowledge}} and limited experience. For some scientific and philosophical disciplines, the answer to this conundrum is innateness, or biological pre-wiring. Innate knowledge is what bridges the gap between the limited information one gleans from the environment (poverty of the stimulus) and one's actual knowledge.|$|E

25|$|In {{discussing}} God's {{relationship to}} His creation, Orthodox theology distinguishes between God's eternal essence, which is totally transcendent, and His uncreated energies, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> He reaches us.

That is, these energies are not something that proceed from God or that God produces, but rather they are God himself: distinct, yet inseparable from, God's inner being.|$|E

Dunkerrin Catholic Church records show that her parents, Michael and Margaret Shelley, married on February 24, 1863, and she was baptized on December 12, 1863. Her grave marker says she was born on September 25, 1865 and died January 21, 1912.

25|$|Ordinary {{differential}} equations (ODEs) arise in many contexts {{of mathematics and}} science (social as well as natural). Mathematical descriptions of change use differentials and derivatives. Various differentials, derivatives, and functions become {{related to each other}} via equations, and thus a differential equation is a result that describes dynamically changing phenomena, evolution, and variation. Often, quantities are defined as the rate of change of other quantities (for example, derivatives of displacement with respect to time), or gradients of quantities, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> they enter {{differential equations}}.|$|E
25|$|The avian {{vocal organ}} {{is called the}} syrinx; it is a bony {{structure}} {{at the bottom of}} the trachea (unlike the larynx at the top of the mammalian trachea). The syrinx and sometimes a surrounding air sac resonate to sound waves that are made by membranes past which the bird forces air. The bird controls the pitch by changing the tension on the membranes and controls both pitch and volume by changing the force of exhalation. It can control the two sides of the trachea independently, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> some species can produce two notes at once.|$|E

25|$|A route roughly {{along the}} line of the M2 had been planned since the 1930s, but the first {{concrete}} plans for the North Approach were announced in 1946. In 1956 proposals for several motorways, including the M2, were announced with the M2 running directly to Ballymena. Part of this alignment became the A8(M). In 1964 the plans were further extended to route the M2 via Antrim to Coleraine, away from its original direct alignment over difficult terrain, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the plans for construction were then progressed. The A8(M) was already under construction, so it was left as a spur.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, the Bíró {{brothers}} and a friend, Juan Jorge Meyne, fled Germany {{and moved to}} Argentina, where they formed Bíró Pens of Argentina and filed a new patent in 1943. Their pen was sold in Argentina as the Birome (portmanteau of the names Bíró and Meyne), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> ballpoint pens are still known in that country. This new design was licensed by the British, who produced ballpoint pens for RAF aircrew as the Biro. Ballpoint pens {{were found to be}} more versatile than fountain pens, especially at high altitudes, where fountain pens were prone to ink-leakage.|$|E

Cloud-hosted data analytics made it possible for companies to categorize and process large volumes of data, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> we can currently speak of unlimited visualization, and intelligent decision making.|$|E
