5|$|In 1832, {{the state}} began {{construction}} on the Wabash and Erie Canal. The canal was started at Lake Erie, passed through Fort <b>Wayne,</b> <b>and</b> connected to the Wabash River.

Other canal projects were started, but all were abandoned before completion due to the state's foundering credit after the devaluation of the bonds.|$|E

5|$|Records {{indicate}} that the alignment of PA371 was first constructed as a cut from the Delaware River to the community of Great Bend, Pennsylvania, in1791 through <b>Wayne</b> <b>and</b> Susquehanna Counties. In1801, the state legislature of New York and Pennsylvania brought up the proposal for the Newburgh and Cochecton Turnpike (later the Great Bend and Newburgh Turnpike) to connect the Hudson River to the Delaware River. Although the route was finished in New York, the portion in Pennsylvania was not legislated until March29,1804. Construction through <b>Wayne</b> <b>and</b> Susquehanna Counties commenced in1806, with completion of the roadway coming in1811. At that point, the turnpike was extended onto the cut in Pennsylvania to the Susquehanna River. The turnpike was used for transportation of farmers' goods and stock along with a route for pioneers to use for heading westward. After construction of the original CochectonDamascus Bridge in 1817 (and later in 1821), {{the area around the}} bridge became a bustling community. The alignment of what is now PA371 eventually became littered with a large rate of development, with nineteenth-century style buildings constructed in Damascus. The turnpike itself fared poorly later on, and was abandoned in1853. Although the roadway itself was abandoned, the turnpike corporation that was supposed to maintain the roadway remained intact until 1868, when it was dissolved. Even afterwards, the roadway remained the only physical route in the area until at least the1890s.|$|E
5|$|Ryan White {{was born}} at St. Joseph Memorial Hospital in Kokomo, Indiana, to Hubert <b>Wayne</b> <b>and</b> Jeanne Elaine (Hale) White. When he was circumcised, the {{bleeding}} would not stop. When he was three days old, doctors diagnosed him with severe hemophilia A, a hereditary blood coagulation disorder associated with the X chromosome, which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding. For treatment, he received weekly infusions of Factor VIII, a blood product created from pooled plasma of non-hemophiliacs, an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time.|$|E
5|$|Temperance {{became a}} part of the evangelical Protestant {{initiative}} during Indiana's pioneer era and early statehood. Many Hoosiers freely indulged in drinking locally distilled whiskey on a daily basis, with binges on election days and holidays, and during community celebrations Reformers announced that the devil was at work and must be repudiated. A state temperance society formed in 1829 and local temperance societies soon organized in Indianapolis, Fort <b>Wayne,</b> <b>and</b> Logansport. By the 1830s pietistic (evangelical) Protestants and community leaders had joined forces to curb consumption of alcohol. In 1847 the Indiana General Assembly passed a local option bill that allowed a vote on whether to prohibit alcohol sales in a township.|$|E
