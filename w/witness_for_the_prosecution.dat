5|$|At {{the appeal}} hearing at the {{regional}} court in Dresden, in the morning 1 July 2009, nine people {{were present in the}} courtroom: three judges, the prosecutor, Wiens as the defendant, his court-appointed defence counsel, El-Sherbini as <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> and her husband and son as observers. No security personnel were present and no security searches of individuals and their possessions were carried out; this was a common procedure for cases without anticipated security concerns or detained persons present.|$|E
5|$|Kerr {{experienced}} a career resurgence {{on television in}} the early 1980s when she {{played the role of}} the nurse—played by Elsa Lanchester in the 1957 movie—in <b>Witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prosecution.</b> Later, Kerr rejoined screen partner Robert Mitchum in Reunion at Fairborough. She also took {{on the role of the}} older Emma Harte, a tycoon, in the adaptation of Barbara Taylor Bradford's A Woman of Substance. For this performance, Kerr was nominated for an Emmy Award.|$|E
5|$|During the Trial of Gotovina et al {{before the}} International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia, Reynaud Theunens {{compared}} Operations Mistral 2 and Storm {{in his capacity as}} an expert <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Theunens pointed out that civilian property and infrastructure at less risk in the aftermath of Operation Mistral 2, as Gotovina had issued much more strict orders in that respect, establishing companies specifically tasked with security and imposing a curfew in Jajce. The HV and the HVO sustained losses of 74 killed and 226 wounded in the operation.|$|E

5|$|Alfano {{was accused}} of being {{the man behind the}} murder of rival Camorra boss Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife. The trial against Alfano and his {{associates}} in Viterbo in 1911–12, expanded from a murder case into a tribunal against the Camorra and attracted a lot of attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, and despite the fact that the legitimacy of the trial was seriously questioned when the main <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, {{so they were}} sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> something {{that would not have}} been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E
5|$|Behan {{testified that}} when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom {{might have had a}} pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's {{testimony}} was significant, since he was a prime <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E

50|$|In 1833, Naundorff {{travelled}} to Paris {{where another}} claimant to the French throne, the Duke of Richemont, was on trial. One of <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> read out his letter as a counterclaim.|$|R
5|$|After {{a failed}} {{attempt by the}} defence to {{question}} the court's jurisdiction, several witnesses were questioned {{over a period of}} several weeks, including Udin's neighbours and wife, as well as Sudarmo's nephew. The hearings, which were held on Mondays and Thursdays, were filled with spectators. At the trial, the defence suggested that a government conspiracy may have been responsible, but were told by the tribunal to focus on the case at hand. Further witnesses, including a key <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> came across as unconvincing; they also changed their stories, reneging statements which they had made before the trial. Other witnesses for the prosecution, including several of Sumaji's neighbours, testified that the driver could not have committed the murder because he was at home on the night of 13 August. Another said that the steel pipe said to be the murder weapon in court was different from that found with Udin's blood on it.|$|E
5|$|In April 1969 or February 1970, the High Prosecutor's {{office in}} Medan filed charges against Jassin, {{charging}} him with blasphemy {{after he was}} unwilling to divulge Kipandjikusmin's true name. At trial, Jassin argued that, as the story {{was a product of}} the author's imagination, it should not be considered an insult to Islam; he also cited physical descriptions of Allah from the Quran and Sufi literature, as well as the writer's Christian influences. A <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> noted ulama and writer Haji Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah (Hamka), testified that a depiction of Allah wearing glasses implied that Allah was imperfect, as opposed to the personifications cited by Jassin, which were based on man's love for Allah. Hamka later stated that nobody had been able to incite hatred against Muhammad like Kipandjikusmin since the Crusades. Jassin was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} their {{contention}} that Kinne {{had been so}} interested in seeing her husband removed {{that she had been}} willing to pay for his murder, supported by the grand-jury testimony of John Boldizs. Boldizs, though nominally a <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> weakened his testimony on the stand during the trial by claiming that Kinne's offer to pay him $1,000 in return for James Kinne's murder could have been a joke, and Hill was forced to attack his own witness's credibility. Further prosecution testimony alleged that the Kinne's marriage had been on the verge of dissolution at the time of James Kinne's death, that Sharon Kinne's adultery had been a cause of this, and that Sharon Kinne had known that she would collect her husband's $29,000 in life insurance policies only if she were still his wife.|$|E
5000|$|On June 2, 1925, Northern went {{on trial}} in the Howard County Circuit Court <b>for</b> <b>the</b> robbery of the South Kokomo bank. [...] <b>Witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{included}} A.E. Gorton, cashier of the bank, {{and representatives of the}} New Harmony State bank.|$|R
50|$|Andrews {{travels to}} Lewes and gives his {{testimony}} in court despite being scorned by <b>the</b> other <b>witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> as a Judas figure. The trial {{ends with the}} smugglers being acquitted and their pledging to revenge themselves on Andrews by hurting Elizabeth.|$|R
50|$|The only {{defendant}} {{not present}} at the Polytechnic trial was Elias Tsiaouris or Tsiaparas, accused of murder, who had escaped custody {{because he was in}} hiding. There were a total of 237 <b>witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> and <b>the</b> defence and about 50 lawyers.|$|R
5|$|The trial, {{which was}} held from 22 July to 4 October 1948, was marked by {{numerous}} irregularities. The principal <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> was shot dead {{three days before the}} trial, and much of the evidence against the defendants was obtained through torture. All three were found guilty of conspiracy against the state and endangering national security. Although these points were raised at the trial, Ravoahangy was sentenced to death, along with Raseta and four other nationalists, while Rabemananjara was sentenced to life in prison. In July 1949, the convicts' death sentences were commuted to life in prison, and the trio remained imprisoned until they were granted amnesty in 1958. Few individuals, with the notable exception of Monja Jaona, the founder of Jiny in the south, have claimed responsibility for a leadership role in the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} Japan's formal {{surrender}} in Tokyo Bay, Hashimoto {{was promoted to}} his final rank of commander. On 20 November, he was given command of the destroyer Yukikaze, among the few Imperial Navy ships to survive the war, and assigned to repatriation duties, returning troops to Japan from overseas. Before Hashimoto could begin his new duties, however, he was summoned by the United States military to be a <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> in the court-martial against Indianapolis commander Captain Charles B. McVay III, who was on trial on charges of negligence leading to the ship's sinking. On 9 December 1945 he was transported from Tokyo to Oakland, California aboard an aircraft of the Naval Air Transport Service. Hashimoto was assured he would {{be treated as a}} naval officer instead of a prisoner of war or war criminal, but he remained under guard during his time in the United States and was not allowed to leave his hotel, as his appearance had been front page news that day in the New York Times and in other newspapers. The next day he arrived in Washington, D.C. where hearings were taking place. For the duration of his time in the United States, he spoke through translator Francis Earl Eastlake from the Office of Naval Intelligence.|$|E

50|$|Breivik took <b>the</b> stand <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{second time}} to give {{evidence}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defence. He conceded {{that it had been}} hard to hear live evidence from <b>witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> but he also said that the Labour government should apologize for their immigration policies.|$|R
5000|$|Distinguishing Leach, the Court of Criminal Appeal held in R v Lapworth (1930) that spouses were {{nevertheless}} compellable <b>witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{in cases}} of personal violence, {{on the basis that}} the common law position prior to the 1898 Act had not been unaffected by its entry into law. However, in Hoskyn v Metropolitan Police Commissioner (1978) the House of Lords overruled Lapworth, ending the personal violence exception in favour of spouses being competent but not compellable <b>witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> in all cases. In reaching this view, judges were swayed by the special status of marriage, and the [...] "natural repugnance" [...] that the public would feel at seeing a wife give evidence against her husband {{in a wide range of}} scenarios.|$|R
50|$|The trial saw 28 <b>witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> and 16 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defence. In addition, the {{tribunal}} received 16 witness statements {{given to the}} investigator after <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> argued that those witnesses were either dead, or that producing them before {{the tribunal}} would incur unreasonable delay or expenditure.|$|R
25|$|Occasionally a <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> {{appears in}} court in a mask to avoid being {{recognized}} by associates of the accused.|$|E
25|$|In 70 BC, Marcus Lucullus helped Cicero {{achieve his}} famous {{prosecution}} of Verres by appearing as a <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> (as did his consular colleague from 73, Gaius Cassius Longinus Varus, among others).|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Christie was {{the first}} {{recipient}} of the Mystery Writers of America's highest honour, the Grand Master Award. Later the same year, <b>Witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prosecution</b> received an Edgar Award by the MWA for Best Play.|$|E
2500|$|One of <b>the</b> last <b>witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> was {{broadcaster}} and politician, Pierre Salinger, who {{was questioned}} by prosecutor Alan Turnbull and by both defence counsel William Taylor and Richard Keen.

5000|$|... a {{criminal}} trial of Gubiana the puppet, conducted in Lombard, with <b>witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> and defence, <b>the</b> harangue of Giubiana's counsel and the reading of Giubiana's threatening last will, the judgement of the Regiuus (the heads of Canzo's families and Town senators) and the pronouncing of the verdict.|$|R
50|$|A {{second trial}} began on February 13, 1934. Once more, <b>witnesses</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> perjured {{themselves}} on a massive scale. Despite unreliable testimony from Factor himself, the jury convicted Touhy and his three associates on February 22. Touhy was sentenced to 99 years in prison. He was incarcerated at Stateville Correctional Center.|$|R
25|$|There is {{agreement}} that Manson {{was behind the}} killing of Hinman. Brunner was present throughout and was the key <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> She testified at Beausoleil's trial that Beausoleil killed Hinman (a musician), because Hinman had refused to join Manson's pop group.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{responsibility}} for numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity, Bach-Zelewski did not stand trial in Nuremberg, and instead {{was used as}} a <b>witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> He was later convicted for politically motivated murders after the war and died in prison in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Wilder himself {{considered}} Double Indemnity {{his best}} film {{in terms of}} having the fewest scripting and shooting mistakes and always maintained that the two things he was proudest of in his career were the compliments he received from Cain about Double Indemnity and from Agatha Christie for his handling of her <b>Witness</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Prosecution.</b>|$|E
