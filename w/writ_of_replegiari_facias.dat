50|$|<b>Writs</b> <b>of</b> {{prohibition}} {{are similar}} to <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> certiorari, as both types <b>of</b> <b>writs</b> allow superior courts to manage inferior courts.

25|$|The {{first known}} use <b>of</b> the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis {{in a court}} of law {{occurred}} in England during the 1500s. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis was identical in nature to a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> a similar name: the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram vobis. <b>Writs</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis were issued by the court of King's (or Queen’s) Bench while <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> coram vobis were issued by the court of Common Pleas.

50|$|The ancient <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis {{originated}} in the English judicial system during the sixteenth century. If a court discovered a factual mistake or error after {{the conclusion of a}} case, the writ could be issued by the court to correct the error. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis was identical to the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus; except, the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus was reserved exclusively for those who were held in prisons, and the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis was available to everyone else.|$|R
50|$|In England and Wales, the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> fieri facias, {{except for}} <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> fieri facias de bonis ecclesiasticis, was renamed to <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> control by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 on 6 April 2014.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis {{has many}} {{similarities}} in origin and purpose with the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus. Habeas corpus is a Latin phrase meaning “produce the body”, where the English courts ordered states to “produce the body” or “deliver the prisoner” to the court. [...] Generally, anyone attacking their conviction must either file a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus {{if they are}} currently in-custody from a federal sentence or file a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis if {{they are no longer}} in-custody. [...] Those who are in-custody cannot file a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis and those who are no longer in-custody cannot file a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus.|$|R

50|$|As <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> {{prohibition}} {{were rather}} easy to obtain, {{in the late}} thirteenth century, <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> Consultation came into use.

50|$|Obviously, a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> {{habeas corpus}} is a writ issued {{by a court}} and has binding effect. The right to request a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus origins from the {{principle}} of presumption <b>of</b> innocence. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus is to protect individual freedom from arbitrary detention or arrest. The High Court Ordinance, Section 22(A), gives clear guidance on the application for and issue <b>of</b> <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus:One particular point is worth a mention in which {{the law does not}} limit on that only the accused has the right to request a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus but some other people can do it for the accused.|$|R
5000|$|The writ is {{comparable}} to the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> amparo and the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus. [...] In contrast, this writ protects one's right for a healthy environment rather than constitutional rights. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> kalikasan is [...] "proudly Philippine-made", unlike the other two writs that have roots in European and Latin American law.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis (also {{known as}} <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> error coram nobis, <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram vobis, or <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> error coram vobis) {{is the name}} of a legal order {{allowing}} a court to correct its original judgment upon discovery of a fundamental error which did not appear in the records of the original judgement’s proceedings and would have prevented the judgment from being pronounced. [...] The term “coram nobis” is Latin for “before us” and the meaning of its full name, quae coram nobis resident, is “which [...] remain in our presence”. [...] The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis originated in the English court of common law in the English legal system during the sixteenth century.|$|R
50|$|A more usual {{remedy is}} not available. A federal {{prisoner}} in custody can only appeal his conviction or sentence through a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus. A {{person who was}} convicted in a federal court is not eligible for a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus; therefore, {{there is no other}} usual remedy except the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis.|$|R

A <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis is not available in federal courts to directly attack a state criminal judgment. The federal government operates its own coram nobis procedures independent from state courts. Those seeking to attack a state judgement must follow the post-conviction remedies offered by that state. A <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis is also not available for civil cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) specifically abolished the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis in civil cases.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> {{attachment}} is a {{court order}} to [...] "attach" [...] or seize an asset. [...] It is issued by a court to a law enforcement officer or sheriff. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> attachment is issued in order to satisfy a judgment issued by the court. A prejudgment <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> attachment may be used to freeze assets of a defendant while a legal action is pending. Common grounds for obtaining a prejudgment <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> attachment are that a defendant has committed fraud or that a defendant is prepared to hide assets from a court.|$|R
50|$|Philippines: On August 25, 2007, Chief Justice Reynato Puno (at the College of Law alumni of Silliman University in Dumaguete City) {{announced}} that the Supreme Court of the Philippines was drafting the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> Habeas Data. By invoking the truth, the new remedy will not only compel military and government agents to release information about the desaparecidos but require access to military and police files. Reynato Puno announced earlier on the draft <b>of</b> the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> amparo - the Spanish for protection—which will prevent military officials in judicial proceedings to simply issue denials on cases of disappearances or extrajudicial executions. With the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus, the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> Habeas Data and the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> amparo will further help those looking for missing loved ones.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis is not {{specifically}} authorized by any federal statute; however, the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis is authorized {{as part of}} the Judiciary Act of 1789 which provides “That all the before-mentioned courts of the United States, shall have power to issue <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by statute.” ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{a convicted}} {{defendant}} files a petition for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis {{in the trial}} court, {{he or she must}} simultaneously file a motion in the appellate court to stay the appeal as of right until conclusion of the coram nobis proceeding in the trial court. [...] A petition for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis is untimely unless filed within one year of the time a judgment becomes final in the trial court. [...] It is clear that a timely petition for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis will almost always be filed while an appeal is pending. Pendency of the appeal does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to consider the petition for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis since a suit for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis is a new action. [...] On the same day that a petition for <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis is filed in the trial court, the petitioner should also file in the appellate court a motion requesting that the appellate proceedings be stayed pending the trial court's decision on the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis. A copy of the petition should be attached to the motion. Under most circumstances, the motion to stay should be granted.|$|R
25|$|A <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis lies only in {{the unusual}} {{situation}} in which no adequate remedy is provided by law. Moreover, when habeas corpus affords a proper and complete remedy the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis will not lie. Prisoners who are in custody may only attack their conviction or sentence through habeas corpus {{and they are not}} eligible to file <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis.|$|R

5000|$|If a party {{wanted to}} contest the {{granting}} <b>of</b> a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> prohibition, they could do so in two ways. The first was a contempt proceeding called the [...] "Attachment on Prohibition", wherein the plaintiff and defendant would plead before the managing court on the validity <b>of</b> the <b>writ.</b> Alternatively, the parties could seek to reverse the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> prohibition by seeking a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> Consultation.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> scire facias {{was created}} in 1285 during the 13th year {{of the reign of}} Edward I by the English Parliament in the Second Statute <b>of</b> Westminster. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> quo warranto was created during this same period. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> scire facias [...] "is in nature a bill in Chancery" [...] which meant that it would be issued solely by a court of equity.|$|R
500|$|The Judiciary Act of 1789 {{authorized}} the Supreme Court to hear <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> error from the circuit courts and <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> error from [...] the highest state courts in cases {{that involved the}} validity or construction of federal law. Either a judge of the lower court or a justice of the Supreme Court would have to sign the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> error (which was drafted and signed by counsel) before the Supreme Court could hear the case. Signing the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> error was not a mere formality, but rather a preliminary assessment of {{the merits of the}} arguments in the writ.|$|R
2500|$|A {{petition}} for a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis {{in a federal}} court must seek to vacate a federal criminal conviction.

2500|$|In 1955 the General Assembly {{extended}} the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis to criminal proceedings. The relief available extended only to [...] "errors dehors {{the record and}} to matters that were not or {{could not have been}} litigated on the trial of the case, on a motion for a new trial, on appeal in the nature <b>of</b> a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> error, on <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> error, or in a habeas corpus proceeding." [...] The statute provided only that criminal coram nobis proceedings were to be governed by the same rules and procedure applicable to the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> coram nobis in civil cases.|$|R

5000|$|Puno {{stated that}} with the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> Habeas corpus, the <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> Habeas Data and <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> amparo will further assist [...] "those looking for missing loved ones".On August 30, 2007, Puno (speech at Silliman University in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental) promised to {{institute}} the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas data (“you should have the idea” or “you should have the data”). Puno explained that amparo bars alibi, while Habeas Data [...] "can find out what information is held by the officer, rectify or even the destroy erroneous data gathered". Brazil used the writ, followed by Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Argentina and Ecuador.|$|R
50|$|A <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> certiorari, {{otherwise}} {{known simply as}} cert, is an order by a higher court directing a lower court to send record of a case for review, and is {{the next logical step}} in post-trial procedure. While states may have similar processes, a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> cert is usually only issued, in the United States, by the Supreme Court, although some states retain this procedure. Unlike the aforementioned appeal, a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> cert is not a matter <b>of</b> right. A <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> cert will have to be petitioned for, the higher court issuing such writs on limited bases according to constraints such as time. In another sense, a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> cert is like an appeal in its constraints; it too may only seek relief on grounds raised in the original trial.|$|R
