Within two hours, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie.

We wouldn't have done the story we're doing, and the way we're doing it, if we didn't have this special. It's not part of the run of three episodes.

[...] Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them; the episodes [...] "Ups and Downs," [...] "Survey Ladies," [...] and [...] "I Got Yer Can" [...] were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively. Another episode, [...] "Bumbie's Mom," [...] both parodied the film Bambi and was a story based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film.|$|E

Hewitt also comments that, [...] "Actually we started off with two villains, and [...] was one of them until we merged them together...." [...] Craig Hubbard also remarks that [...] "... his jacket actually used to belong to another villain we had in the game named Conrad Krieg, whom we combined with Fettel pretty literally." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] {{was written}} by Kesha {{alongside}} Neon Hitch, Sean Foreman, and Benny Blanco, who also produced the song. Kesha said that the song originated from a discussion {{they had in the}} studio on the politics of female-male relationships which Kesha later explained, [...] "The song came about when the people that wrote it — me, Benny Blanco, Neon Hitch and [...] Sean Foreman — all got in a room, and they were talking about how chicks talk too much," [...] "And me and Neon were like, 'No, no, no, guys talk too much," [...] "So, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> war of who were more obnoxious, chicks or dudes. And the song kind of came around from that conversation. I think I make a pretty fair point both in this video and in the song, that dudes are way more annoying." ...|$|E

He used to teach [...] the L.A. Lockers, and he would do community service in after-school programs. He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances, he put on that song 'More Bounce', and they started pop-locking. And I think from that visual, from seeing that, it was my first introduction into hip-hop. Period. I didn't know nothing about nothing. I hadn't heard [...] "Rapper's Delight" [...] yet. It was the first thing that was really fly to me. They started dancing, and since 'More Bounce' goes on forever, they just got down.

500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|Director of {{photography}} Bill Roe later {{stated that he}} borrowed motifs from Steven Soderbergh's 2000 film Traffic {{for some of the}} shots. In addition, before filming, he decided to do various test shots to get the lighting right. The crew ended up shooting [...] "exteriors three, four stops over what you should shoot it at", resulting in very washed out outdoor scenes. Roe and his crew had a hard time developing the various lighting contrasts for the episode. When talking about the episode, Roe said: [...] "it was really dark so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> huge contrast of lighting. It was dark and warm and brown. When you go inside, you can barely see things, but when you're outside, it's just blaring." [...] To create the Mexican town featured in the episode, scenes were filmed at a small town located outside of Los Angeles. A matte of the town's background and blue sky were then cut and a faux Mexican background was added. In addition, Mat Beck was given a flyer, and he duplicated it, making several strings of posters that did not exist when the shots were filmed.|$|E

500|$|The team {{decided to}} {{incorporate}} anime elements for the game's animation. Inafune explained, [...] " [...] hand transforms into {{a gun and}} {{you can actually see}} it come out of his arm. We {{wanted to make sure that}} the animation and the motion was realistic and actually made sense. So with Mega Man, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> perfect blending of game character with animation ideas." [...] The gameplay for Mega Man was inspired by the game rock-paper-scissors. The project supervisor wanted a simple system that offered [...] "deep gameplay". Each weapon deals a large amount of damage to one specific Robot Master, others have little to no effect against them, and there is no single weapon that dominates all the others. Mega Man was originally able to crouch, but the team decided against it since it made players' ability to determine the height of onscreen projectiles more difficult. Naoya Tomita (credited as [...] "Tom Pon") began work on the Mega Mans scenic backgrounds immediately after his Capcom training. Tomita proved himself amongst his peers by overcoming the challenges of the console's limited power through maximizing the use of background elements.|$|E
500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut and you wonder how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set and you have the cameras, and you have to deal with special effects, because on top of everything else we had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to other}} Sleater-Kinney albums, {{the lyrics of}} All Hands on the Bad One feature personal, political, and social themes. The first song, [...] "The Ballad of the Ladyman", is a {{deliberate}} attempt to mock those who misunderstand the band. Tucker said that the song is [...] "almost making fun of how people see us, how people see what you're supposed to be when you're a woman in rock." [...] The song was inspired when the band was invited to the Bowlie Weekender music festival in England in 1999. Tucker explained, [...] "We were all staying in little chalets or whatever and we had our own cabin and we were cabin 216. Someone wrote this message to us that was like, 'Cabin 216 ladymen.' And we were like, 'What?' It {{was meant to be}} a funny thing, but in this other way, it was really this naming of us. It was a subtle way of saying, 'Oh, you're different because you're a woman band and because you're in some ways political.' It's still seen as threatening to people. It's not like <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> weekend where we just relaxed with everyone and just hung out." [...] Kat Iudicello, writing for PopMatters, stated that the song [...] "sports sweet harmonies, a slow anger and soft, low bitterness, and driving steady guitars and drums." ...|$|E

We did a lot of auditioning, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> meeting with Amy Adams and after that I just felt she was perfect for it." [...] Adams auditioned for the role three times: once for the unproduced Superman: Flyby, and the second time for Superman Returns before landing the current role. Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011. While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, [...] "We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today. Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful." [...] On portraying Lois Lane, Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an [...] "independent, feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world." [...] Adams said that [...] "She has become more of a free-ranging journalist, someone who likes to be hands-on. The nature of the newspaper business has changed so much.

500|$|Rakeysh {{said the}} {{following}} in a scriptwriter's conference {{conducted by the}} Film Writers Association in the year 2008, [...] "I was making a documentary called Mamooli Ram, on the missed revolution with Kamalesh Pandey. We were sitting in a small hotel room in Nanded, drinking. We started singing songs, and we both realised we liked similar songs. And so Rang De Basanti was born. He was angry with the system, I was helpless with the system. We wanted to do so much. But we really can't do anything and it {{was born out of}} anger. He wrote a story called Ahuti, meaning sacrifice. Ahuti was about the armed revolution about India, between the years 1919 and 1931. It started with Ashfaqullah Khan, Ramprasad Bismil, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, went on to Chandrashekhar Azad and so on. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> amazing screenplay called Ahuti, which we had also termed as The Young Guns of India, which started with a train robbery, Azad on a horse and so on. I said, [...] "let's do The Young Guns of India". We were going to go on the floor, and suddenly {{there were a couple of}} film on Bhagat Singh made. But they came and went. Not because they were good or bad films, not because they were written badly or not written so bad. I'm not being judgmental about them. And this is very important: because they did not reflect the sentiment of today's time. Nobody in the audience could identify with something which was past. It wasn't that there wasn't idea of patriotism in us, but it was sleeping somewhere. And you had to kind of relate to it in today's world. So a couple of bottles of vodka again, and three days later, with couple of vodkas down, Kamlesh ji comes up with 'You know what, I think I've cracked it'." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears's {{relationship}} {{of three years}} with pop singer Justin Timberlake ended in 2002 after months of speculation. In November 2002, Timberlake released the song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors {{that she had been}} unfaithful to him. [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] is often credited as being the song that propelled the album into the charts. In September 2001, Annet Artani accepted to become a backing vocalist for Spears's 2001–2002 Dream Within a Dream Tour. Her interactions with Spears during most of the tour were limited to small conversations at the gym and vocal warm ups. Artani had begun a relationship with the show's musical director during 2002; however, it was not working out well {{by the end of the}} tour. Before the last date in Mexico City, Spears called her and asked about the relationship. Artani told her they were going to break up, to which Spears responded, [...] "Don't worry about it, you're going to hang out with me". Following the end of the tour, Spears and Artani began to forge a friendship. Spears invited Artani to her house in Los Angeles, California. According to Artani, their relationship grew out of their shared romantic experiences at the time. She explained, [...] "Basically, we commiserated because she, at that time, had broken up with Justin [...] Maybe like nine months before, but of course it was really fresh in the media. I was just breaking up with this guy, so we kind of like—I think we kind of needed each other." [...] Artani stayed at Spears's house for a few weeks, in which they started writing songs at the piano. Shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Artani added, [...] "It was me and her, her stylist and Felicia, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>this</b> humongous house to ourselves, and they had a piano there as well".|$|E
