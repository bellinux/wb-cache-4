5|$|The Shangani Patrol {{continued}} its approach {{during the late}} evening, and scouted close to the bush enclosure housing Lobengula. Captain William Napier repeatedly called to the king in the Matabele language, Sindebele, but received no reply from the Matabele leaders, who remained silent and hid themselves. The patrol's actions confused the Matabele, who could not understand why {{there appeared to be}} so few Company soldiers, nor <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> reveal their position like this. They concluded that it must be a trap, and were only satisfied that it was not when Wilson's men had stopped during their approach to call to Lobengula five times. Following the fifth call from Napier, Mjaan ordered his riflemen to gather around the patrol, intending to pocket it. Noticing this, Wilson ordered a retreat, and took up a well-covered position in the bush where he could hide until daybreak. When Lieutenant Hofmeyer and Troopers Bradburn and Colquhoun were lost amid the increasingly stormy night, Wilson briefly backtracked to recover them.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of November 30, 1994, {{the day before the}} verdict in his sexual abuse trial was to be announced, Shakur was robbed and shot five times by three men in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios in Manhattan. Shakur stated that he {{believed}} the robbery to be a setup for the attack, wondering <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> take jewelry and leave his Rolex watch. Shakur checked out of the Bellevue Hospital Center against doctor's orders, three hours after surgery. In the day that followed, he entered the courthouse in a wheelchair and was found guilty of three counts of molestation and found not guilty of six others, including sodomy, stemming from his 1993 arrest for sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|The Queen {{turns into}} an old lady and tries to force Kilala to eat a poison apple, making the dogs hold down Rei. Snow White appears and tells The Queen that, to save Kilala, she will eat the apple instead. Just before she can, however, Kilala knocks the apple {{out of her hand}} telling The Queen no one will be eating that apple and the Seven Dwarfs appear. They are all able to attack the Queen, pushing her into a Cauldron which turns her into a vulture. Afterwards, Snow White gives Kilala a ruby, which {{attaches}} itself to the Tiara and changes her and Rei back to normal. The Gate reappears and the two leave Snow White's world, following the light back to their world, which leads them to Erika. Rei questions <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> leave her behind, but then realizes it must be because she is not the Seventh Princess.|$|E

25|$|The social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} {{is an important}} source of interpersonal interaction, social integration, and forming positive and durable relationships. In fact, many people engage in sharing behaviors in order to have such social interactions and strengthen their relationships (as described above). However, this might not result from the sharing of certain emotional events. When asked <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> keep an emotional event a secret, the most frequent reasons cited were: wanting to avoid hurting someone, preserving one’s image in the eyes of others, protecting one’s private life, and protecting one’s self. Such reasons, which together constituted the responses of over 75% of participants, all concern one thing: protection. According to Baumeister and Leary, this idea of protection pertains to protection from undesirable consequences {{in the realm of the}} social sphere, namely that the revelation of such secrets would be harmful to social relationships. Therefore, instead of social integration and the strengthening of relationships, the revelation of certain emotional events could be harmful to a relationship and could thus result in social disintegration and deterioration of relationships.|$|E

Ugo Mariotti, a producer on the film, spotted Donaggio on a Vaporetto on the Grand Canal in Venice, and believing {{it to be a}} [...] "sign" [...] contacted him to see if he would be interested in working on the film. Donaggio was reluctant at first because he did not understand <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be interested in someone who had no experience of scoring films.|$|E
500|$|During the Dive Bar Tour, Gaga {{recalled}} {{that she and}} musician Hillary Lindsey were seated in couches and having a back-and-forth conversation with guitar and piano. The singer asked questions about the men in her life, including her father and boyfriends, wondering <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> give her million reasons to leave them, but all she wanted was to have one reason to stay. Lindsey, who previously had experiences in writing country songs in Nashville, was identified by Interscope as a potential collaborator on Joanne. The label's A Aaron Bay-Schuck, who had heard the initial Joanne material, introduced Gaga to Lindsey. They bonded over drinks and Gaga also played initial demos {{of some of the}} tracks she had written. Lindsey remembered that Gaga's personal experiences and stories resulted in many ideas for songs. [...] "Million Reasons" [...] was similarly picked from their conversations, including the title phrase. It was a straightforward songwriting session according to Lindsey, with Gaga using an [...] typewriter.|$|E

500|$|Peter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who {{raped and}} murdered Teena. Sarsgaard {{was one of the}} first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his {{character}} to be [...] "likable, sympathetic even", because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter. In an interview with The Independent, Sarsgaard said, [...] "I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I felt like I was just like the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me." [...] Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom Roseanne, as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Sarsgaard earned {{critical}} {{recognition in}} Kimberly Peirce's Boys Don't Cry, {{where he was}} cast as notorious killer John Lotter. The film {{is based on the}} real-life story of Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered in 1993 by Lotter and Tom Nissen after they found out that he was a trans man. Boys Don’t Cry received overwhelmingly positive acclaim from critics, and his performance was critically well received. According to The Boston Globe, [...] "Peter [...] Sarsgaard... makes the killer's terrible trajectory not only believable, but grounded in the most mundane clodhopper behavior. He isn't a drooling monster, he's a guy you wouldn't look [...] twice at a bar or a convenience store." [...] A contributor from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote [...] "It's a marvelous performance supported ably by... Sarsgaard as the unpredictable, sociopathic Lotter." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2000 Venice Film Festival. In regards to his character, as how Sarsgaard made him [...] "likeable, sympathetic even" [...] was because he wanted the audience [...] "to understand <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him." [...] In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt [...] "empowered" [...] by playing Lotter.|$|E

2500|$|No group claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack. Iraq's President, Jalal Talabani, accused Iraqi Sunni insurgents of the bombings, pointing at the history of Sunni violence against Yazidis. They were reported to have distributed leaflets denouncing Yazidis as [...] "anti-Islamic". Although the attacks carry Al-Qaeda's signature of multiple simultaneous attacks, it is unclear <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> refrain from claiming responsibility for such a successful operation.

Francesca Martinez and Richard Vaughan refused to carry the torch, while Konnie Huq decided to carry it and also speak out against China. The pro-Tibetan Member of Parliament Norman Baker asked all bearers to reconsider. Amid pressure from both directions, Prime Minister Gordon Brown welcomed the torch outside 10 Downing Street without holding or touching it.|$|E

The architect claimed that they were [...] "just lifting floorboards and joists". There was no apparent reason <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> need to carry out such a job on the house.

5000|$|Most {{conservative}} scholars however, {{argue that}} {{both internal and}} external evidence strongly points to dates prior to 70 AD for the Synoptic Gospels, Acts, and the Pauline Epistles. They note that {{there is no mention of}} the deaths of Paul, Peter, and James, all of which happened between 60-65 AD, in any book of the New Testament. These were all extremely important figures in the early church, writers would have mentioned their deaths if the New Testament had been written later. [...] Furthermore, the Gospels contain numerous attacks on the Sadducees, a sect of Judaism that was wiped out with the destruction of the temple. <b>Why,</b> <b>they</b> ask, <b>would</b> later writers devote so much narrative space to attacking a group that no longer existed? ...|$|R
