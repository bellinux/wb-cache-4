40|$|Intraocular {{lymphoma}} (IOL) {{is a rare}} lymphocytic malignancy {{which contains}} two main distinct forms. Primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) is mainly a sub-type of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Alternatively, IOL can originate from outside {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) by metastasizing to the eye. These tumors are known as secondary intraocular lymphoma (SIOL). The IOL can arise in the retina, uvea, vitreous, Bruch’s membrane and optic nerve. There are predominantly of B-cell origin; however there are also rare T-cell variants. Diagnosis remains challenging for ophthalmologists and pathologists, due to its ability to masquerade as noninfectious <b>or</b> infectious uveitis, <b>white</b> <b>dot</b> syndromes, <b>or</b> occasionally as other metastatic cancers. Laboratory tests include flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, interleukin detection (IL- 10 : IL- 6, ratio > 1), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Methotrexate-based systemic chemotherapy with external beam radiotherapy and intravitreal chemotherapy with methotrexate are useful for controlling the disease, but the prognosis remains poor. Therefore, it is important to make an early diagnose and treatment. This review is focused on the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the IOL...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPrimary intraocular {{lymphoma}} (PIOL) is an ocular malignancy that is {{a subset}} of primary central system lymphoma (PCNSL). Approximately one-third of PIOL patients will have concurrent PCNSL at presentation, and 42 – 92 % will develop PCNSL within a mean of 8 – 29  months. Although rare, the incidence has been rising in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent populations. The majority of PIOL is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, though rare T-cell variants are described. Recently, PIOL has been classified by main site {{of involvement in the}} eye, with vitreoretinal lymphoma as {{the most common type of}} ocular lymphoma related to PCNSL. Diagnosis remains challenging for ophthalmologists and pathologists. PIOL can masquerade as noninfectious <b>or</b> infectious uveitis, <b>white</b> <b>dot</b> syndromes, <b>or</b> occasionally as other neoplasms such as metastatic cancers. Laboratory diagnosis by cytology has been much aided by the use of immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, biochemical finding of interleukin changes (IL 10 :IL 6 ratio > 1), and cellular microdissection with polymerase chain reaction amplification for clonality. Use of several tests improves the diagnostic yield. Approaches to treatment have centered on systemic methotrexate-based chemotherapy, often with cytarabine (Ara-C) and radiotherapy. Use of intravitreal chemotherapy with methotrexate (0. 4  mg/ 0. 1  mL) is promising in controlling ocular disease, and intravitreal rituximab (anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody) has also been tried. Despite these advances, prognosis remains poor...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{characterize}} <b>white</b> <b>dots</b> in {{diabetic retinopathy}} (DR) and {{their association with}} disease severity using ultra-wide-field scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Methods: We randomly selected 125 eyes of 77 patients (25 eyes from individual categories of the international classification of DR severity) for which ultrawide field photographs were obtained. We characterized <b>white</b> <b>dots,</b> which were delineated by higher signal levels on green but not red laser images, and evaluated {{the relationship between the}} number of <b>white</b> <b>dots</b> and the international severity scale of DR. Results: Most <b>white</b> <b>dots</b> were located in nonperfused areas, and the number of total <b>white</b> <b>dots</b> was significantly correlated to that of dots in nonperfused areas. <b>White</b> <b>dots</b> corresponded to microaneurysms around the boundary between nonperfused areas and perfused areas or unknown lesions in nonperfused areas. Eyes with DR had significantly more <b>white</b> <b>dots</b> than those with no apparent retinopathy. The numbers of <b>white</b> <b>dots</b> in moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or more severe grades were significantly higher than in mild NPDR. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AROC) analyses demonstrated that the number of <b>white</b> <b>dots</b> had the significance in the diagnosis of DR (0. 908 - 0. 986) and moderate NPDR or more severe grades (0. 888 - 0. 974).

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} the fundus autofluorescence (FAF) spectrum of punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC). Methods. This is a retrospective observational case series of 27 consecutive patients with PIC admitted from October 2013 to March 2015, who underwent short-wavelength- (SW-) and near-infrared- (NIR-) FAF imaging, spectral domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (SD-OCT), fluorescein angiography (FA), and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Results. There were three primary findings on the FAF imaging of patients with PIC. First, active PIC lesions revealed hypoautofluorescent spots with hyperautofluorescent margin. After the lesions regressed, the hyperautoflurescent margin faded. Second, subclinical {{and most of the}} atrophic PIC lesions appeared to be hypoautofluorescent spots. But subclinical PIC lesions were more distinctive on NIR-FAF imaging than on SW-FAF imaging. Third, hypoautofluorescent spots of PIC lesions coexisted with hyperautofluorescent patches on SW-FAF imaging. These hyperautofluorescent patches were demonstrated to be multiple evanescent <b>white</b> <b>dot</b> syndrome (MEWDS) <b>or</b> acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) lesions by subsequent multimodal imaging and faded during follow-up examinations. Conclusion. FAF imaging helps in noninvasively tracking the evolution of PIC lesions and identifying the combined MEWDS or AZOOR lesions, complementary to SD-OCT and angiographic studies...|$|R

5000|$|In 1995, {{questions}} arose {{about another}} purported Calder, Two <b>White</b> <b>Dots</b> (this piece is distinguished from a similarly-named piece, Two <b>White</b> <b>Dots</b> in the Air, created by Calder in 1958). Calder created a 1 ft high sheet metal maquette in 1973 for an unrealized stabile he called Two <b>White</b> <b>Dots.</b> He gave this maquette to Carmen Segretario, founder {{and owner of}} the Segré Foundry of Waterbury, Connecticut. For decades, Calder had utilized the services of Segré Foundry in manufacturing his mobiles and stabiles. Each piece (no matter how many copies were made) would be initialled personally by Calder in white chalk, after which a welder would follow the chalk marks to burn the initials into the work. Calder died in 1976, without a full-size version of Two <b>White</b> <b>Dots</b> ever having been made. In 1982, Segretario constructed a full-size version of Two <b>White</b> <b>Dots,</b> and sold it in 1983 to art dealer Shirley Teplitz for $70,000. Segetario's documentation claimed that the work had been fabricated around 1974 [...] "under the supervision and direction of Artist". Two <b>White</b> <b>Dots</b> was then sold at auction in May 1984 for $187,000. Over the next decade, the piece was sold repeatedly. In 1995, Jon Shirley (the former president of Microsoft and a Calder collector) purchased Two <b>White</b> <b>Dots</b> for $1 million. When Shirley submitted the work to the Calder Foundation for inclusion in their catalogue raisonné, the Foundation contested the work's authenticity. The André Emmerich Gallery refunded Shirley's money, and sued the Segré Foundry, which sought bankruptcy protection. The suit was settled out of court in the late 1990s. Two <b>White</b> <b>Dots</b> now resides outdoors on a farm near a river outside the small town of Washington, Connecticut.|$|R
