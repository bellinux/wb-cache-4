500|$|On {{the night}} of 23 February, Missouri and Wisconsin turned their big guns on Kuwait's Faylaka Island to support the US-led {{coalition}} ground offensive to free Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces. The two ships were to conduct a diversionary assault aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that Coalition forces were preparing to launch an amphibious invasion. As part of this attack, Missouri and Wisconsin were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after Missouri completed her shelling of Faylaka Island, Wisconsin, while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to spot for her [...] guns. As Wisconsins drone approached Faylaka Island, the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers would {{know that they were}} once again being targeted by a battleship. Iraqi troops on the ground heard the Pioneer’s distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of Missouris artillery strike on their trench line, the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to surrender by waving makeshift white flags, an action dutifully noted aboard Wisconsin. Amused at this sudden development, the men assigned to the drone’s aircrew called Wisconsins commanding officer, Captain David S. Bill III, and asked, [...] "Sir, they want to surrender, <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> do with them?" [...] This surrender to Wisconsins Pioneer has since {{become one of the most}} remembered moments of the Gulf War; the incident was also the first-ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft controlled by a ship. Wisconsin drone also carried out a number of reconnaissance missions on occupied Kuwait before the coalition's ground offensive.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} {{the poet}} is writing to, in sonnet 57, {{is a young}} male {{he seems to be}} attracted to. [...] "Shakespeare's sonnets display a narrative and a Dramatic Personae which combine to threaten conventional assumptions of appropriate love. Looking at Sonnet 57, the writer is claiming that the young man, due to the age gap, enslaves him and he must be patient and wait for the time when the fair youth desires the poet and the poet will ultimately wait for that time. [...] Furthering this statement into a detailed analysis of the poem, in line one, [...] "being your slave <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> do but tend"; Shakespeare is referring to himself as a slave who serves his master. [...] He continues throughout Sonnet 57 to emphasise that he is devoted to his master.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the poet}} implores [...] "Sweet love" [...] (1) {{to conquer the}} lust that is ruining his union with the young man. This {{analysis}} of the sonnet relies upon two assumptions: 1) the young man is the poet's lover and 2) that when the poet refers to [...] "sad interim" [...] (9), he {{does not mean that}} the young man is away from London, but that he is separated from him emotionally - i.e., they are in a [...] "period of estrangement" [...] from one another due to the young man's promiscuity. Thus the poet is [...] "whipping up the young man's flagging affection. Behind lines 9-12 flickers a reminiscence of the situation of Hero and Leander" [...] (Rowse 115). The situation becomes even more clear when we read Sonnet 57, in which the poet, now very worried about the young man's lustful nature, asks him outright, [...] "Being your slave, <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> do but tend/Upon the hours and times of your desire?... dare I question with my jealous thought/Where you may be" [...] (1-2/9-10).|$|E
2500|$|The priest Ernst Alt, {{whom they}} met, on seeing her {{declared}} that [...] "she didn't {{look like an}} epileptic" [...] {{and that he did}} not see her having seizures. Alt believed she was suffering from demonic possession and urged the local bishop to allow an exorcism. In a letter to Alt in 1975, Michel wrote, [...] "I am nothing, everything about me is vanity, <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> do, I have to improve, you pray for me" [...] and also once told him, [...] "I want to suffer for other people...but this is so cruel". In September of the same year, Bishop Josef Stangl granted the priest Arnold Renz permission to exorcise according to the Rituale Romanum of 1614, but ordered total secrecy. Renz performed the first session on 24 September. Michel began talking increasingly about [...] "dying to atone for the wayward youth of the day and the apostate priests of the modern church", and she refused to eat towards the end. At this point, her parents stopped consulting doctors on her request and relied solely on the exorcism rites. 67 exorcism sessions, one or two each week, lasting up to four hours, were performed over about ten months in 1975–1976.|$|E

2500|$|Literary critics such as David Schalkwyk {{see this}} sonnet as playing out a {{relationship}} with unequal power. He sees this relationship in Sonnets 26, 57, 58 and notes that it is strongest in 57 saying [...] "This sonnet's hyperbolic reference to slavery invokes more clearly the late-sixteenth-century, almost wholly pejorative sense of vassalage...". With the first lines of the sonnet being, [...] "Being your slave <b>what</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> do but tend Upon the hours, and times of your desire?" [...] it clearly correlates back to Schalkwyk's idea that Shakespeare seemingly emphasises a class difference {{or at the very}} least a power difference between Shakespeare and the Fair Youth that the sonnet addresses. Schalkwyk goes on to say [...] "This declaration of abject powerlessness (i.e. aforementioned slavery) pushes the notion of vassalage away from that of feudal reciprocity toward a commonplace early modern conception of the servant as utterly, submissive, silent and undemanding". Schalkwyk seems to make the point that during this period servitude was not viewed then as we view it today, but as something quietly accepted, linking to Shakespeare's [...] "servitude" [...] to the Fair Youth as something he is not resentful of, simply accepting the fact that as the speaker his rank in society was less than the addressee and that his position as a [...] "servant" [...] or [...] "slave" [...] to the Fair Youth was nothing more than a simple fact.|$|E
