Donini and Maxwell (2013 : 385) state that “[t]here also seems to be a correlation between the increase in remote management and the development and generalised availability of a number of distance technologies.” Various scholars and professionals have come up with different definitions of Remote Management (see Carle and Chkam 2006; Donini and Maxwell 2013; Egeland et al. 2011; Sandvik 2016; Steets et al. 2012; Stoddard et al. 2010). Combining their insights, I define Remote Management as a mode of operation in which (inter)national staff, either after relocation, after evacuation, or by design, manages a project from a distant location because of high or increasing security risks, while local staff members or local partners implement the project on the ground. This programming modality is not necessarily technology-based itself as it has been used for decades in low-technology countries (Stoddard et al. 2010). Nevertheless, humanitarian technologies reduce the challenges and make it an easier way of operating (see Sandvik et al. 2014, 2016).|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} four-stage {{hierarchical}} resource allocation scheme for the downlink of a large-scale small-cell {{network in the}} context of orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Since interference limits the capabilities of such networks, resource allocation and interference management are crucial. However, obtaining the globally optimum resource allocation is exponentially complex and mathematically intractable. Here, we develop a partially decentralized algorithm to obtain an effective solution. The three major advantages of our work are: 1) as opposed to a fixed resource allocation, we consider load demand at each access point (AP) when allocating spectrum; 2) to prevent overloaded APs, our scheme is dynamic in the sense that as the users move from one AP to the other, so do the allocated resources, if necessary, and such considerations generally result in huge computational complexity, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> third advantage: 3) we tackle complexity by introducing a hierarchical scheme comprising four phases: user association, load estimation, interference management via graph coloring, and scheduling.

Finally, we provide results of numerical simulations to illustrate the efficacy of our scheme.

The counting statistics from the Lindblad approach does not take into account interference in the reservoirs which gives a decreased noise in comparison with the Green function method which describes phase coherent leads.
