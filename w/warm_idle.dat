40|$|Emissions {{of carbon}} {{monoxide}} (CO) from motor vehicles cause several hundred accidental fatal poisonings annually in the United States. The circumstances {{that could lead to}} fatal poisonings in residential settings with motor vehicles as the source of CO were explored. The risk of death in a garage (volume = 90 m 3) and a single-family dwelling (400 m 3) was evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation with varying CO emission rates and ventilation rates. Information on emission rates was obtained from a survey of motor vehicle exhaust gas composition under <b>warm</b> <b>idle</b> conditions in California, and information on ventilation rates was obtained from a summary of published measurements in the U. S. housing stock. The risk of death ranged from 16 to 21 % for a 3 -hr exposure in a garage to 0 % for a 1 -hr exposure in a house. Older vehicles were associated with a disproportionately high risk of death. Removing all pre- 1975 vehicles from the fleet would reduce the risk of death by one-fourth to twothirds, depending on the exposure scenario. Significant efforts have been made to control CO emissions from motor vehicles with the goal of reducing CO concentrations in outdoor air. Substantial public health benefit could also be obtained if vehicle control measures were designed to take account of acute CO poisonings explicitly. IMPLICATIONS Significant efforts have been made to control CO emissions from motor vehicles with the goal of reducing outdoor CO concentrations. An important, but apparently incidental benefit of these controls is that the rate of accidental deaths from motor vehicle related CO poisoning has declined. Nevertheless, motor vehicle emissions still cause several hundred accidental deaths annually in the United States. Substantial public health benefit might be obtained if CO emission control measures for motor vehicles were designed to take explicit account of the risk of acute CO poisoning...|$|E
40|$|In China primary {{particulate}} matter emission from on-road vehicles is predominantly coming from diesels, yet secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formed from diesel emission may be also of greater significance due to more intermediate volatile organic compounds (IVOC) in the exhaust. Here we introduced exhaust from in-use diesel vehicles under <b>warm</b> <b>idling</b> condition directly into an indoor smog chamber with a 30 m 3 Teflon reactor, and investigated the SOA formation as well as chemical aging of organic aerosols during photo-oxidation. The emission factors of primary organic aerosol (POA) and black carbon (BC) for the three typical Chinese diesel vehicles ranged 0. 18 – 0. 91 and 0. 15 – 0. 51 g kg-fuel − 1, respectively; and the SOA production factors ranged 0. 50 – 1. 8 g kg-fuel − 1 with an average SOA/POA ratio of 1. 6. Aromatic hydrocarbons could only explain less than 3 % of SOA formed during aging, and IVOC and oxygenated VOC might contribute substantially to SOA formation. High resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) resolved that POA dominated by CH classes (alkanes, cycloalkanes and alkenes) with high abundances of the C n H 2 n + 1 and C n H 2 n - 1 fragments, and after photo-oxidation the fraction of CH classes and the H/C ratios decreased, while the fraction of CHO, {{as well as the}} ratios of O/C and of organic matter to organic carbon (OM/OC), all increased. The plot of f 44 (ratio of m/z 44 to the total signal in a mass spectrum) versus f 43 indicated that diesel SOA were semi-volatile oxygenated organic aerosols (SV-OOA). The slopes of O:C versus H:C element ratios in the Van Krevelen diagram ranged from − 0. 47 to − 0. 68, suggesting a combination of carboxylic acid and alcohols/peroxides formed during the aging of diesel exhaust...|$|R
5000|$|Whilst {{trying to}} come up with a way of ending the film Monty Python's Life of Brian, Eric Idle wrote an {{original}} version of the song which was sung in a more straight fashion, which the other Python members eventually agreed would be good enough for the end of the film. However, Michael Palin noted in his diary for 16 June 1978 that during a script meeting, [...] "Eric's two songs — 'Otto' and the 'Look on the Bright Side' crucifixion song — are rather coolly received before lunch." [...] Despite being initially underwhelmed, the group <b>warmed</b> to <b>Idle's</b> efforts and the song was retained. While practicing during a break in filming, Idle found that it worked better if sung in a more cheeky manner. This new version was used in the film and became one of Monty Python's most famous compositions.|$|R
40|$|Idling {{releases}} pollutants {{that can}} harm {{human health and}} the environment. Limit warm-up idling to 30 seconds, even in cold weather. Turn off your engine if you expect to be stopped for more than 30 seconds (except in traffic). Avoid drive-through windows (banks, pharmacies and fast-food restaurants). Park and go inside. Carpool, walk, bike or take the bus whenever possible. It's a myth that frequent restarting is harder on the engine and wastes more fuel than idling and that engines need to <b>warm</b> up by <b>idling,</b> especially in cold weather...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Aeroengine {{parameters}} {{model is}} pivotal {{for development of}} aeroengine virtual testing system. So the modeling method is discussed in this paper in detail. Firstly, dependency relationships between parameters are established according to the variational character of each parameter in different working state, including transient processes such as false start, cold run, start, acceleration, deceleration, stop and stable processes such as <b>idle,</b> <b>warming,</b> performance test. Then parameter equations are formulated based on least square fit, utilizing actual test data {{of some kind of}} turbo-fan aeroengine as prototype. With the method, modeling work for aeroengine virtual testing system is facilitated. And each parameter varying pattern is consistent to that of real aeroengine. Furthermore, different test process can be simulated via changing relevant setting parameters. It makes the development of aeroengine virtual testing system much easier...|$|R
