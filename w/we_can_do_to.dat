25|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is by far}} the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, overfishing, and invasions by alien species. Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of the current climate change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far the best thing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> slow climate change is a global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E

Downey defended Gibson during the {{controversy}} surrounding The Passion of the Christ, and said [...] "nobody's perfect" [...] in reference to Gibson's DUI.

Let's go see what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> work on ourselves.'" [...] In October 2011, Downey was being honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards; Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work, and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.|$|E

The mission of the organization is to promote solutions with elected officials and the general public. The couple states that it supports the Second Amendment while promoting responsible gun ownership and “keeping guns {{out of the hands}} of dangerous people like criminals, terrorists, and the mentally ill.” Current gun laws allow for private sellers to legally sell guns without a background check, creating a loophole that provides criminals and the mentally ill easy access to guns. Kelly said on Fox News on March 31, 2013, that “any bill that does not include a universal background check is a mistake, It's the most common sense thing <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> prevent criminals and the mentally ill from having access to weapons." ...|$|E

She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers [...] "somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection" [...] and that [...] "by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies." [...] She concluded that [...] "depicting teen parents may not glamorize them, so much as humanize them. You know, that thing that happens when one person recognizes that someone else is a person too? So, now that we can firmly state that realistically depicting the lives of the tiny percentage of girls who do become pregnant won't necessarily contaminate the rest of them, it's time to stop worrying and ask what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Wednesday 24 March 2012, 14 year-old Noah Crooks {{was accused}} of {{shooting}} his 32-year-old mother with a [...]22 caliber rifle after a failed attempt to rape her. Noah was charged with first-degree murder and assault. During the dispatch call to 911 shortly following the murder, Crooks revealed that Gretchen Crooks had taken away his Call of Duty video game because his grades had turned poor {{and that this was}} the reason why he snapped. According to dispatch, Noah Crooks did not seem emotional even though he had murdered his mother a couple of hours earlier. On the night of April 14, 2012, in Clydebank, Scotland, a 13-year-old boy slashed his friend's throat after a session of Gears of War 3.

Reference (a) advised that Com 16 {{intercepts}} were considered most reliable and requested Com 16 to evaluate reports on Japanese naval movements and send dispatch to OPNAV, info CINCPAC. Com 16's estimates were more reliable than Com 14's, not only because of better radio interception, but because Com 16 was currently reading messages in the Japanese Fleet Cryptographic System ("5-number code" [...] or [...] "JN25") and was exchanging technical information and Japanese-to-English translations with the British C.

2500|$|Klass's {{modus operandi}} {{when dealing with}} opponents such as Friedman was exceptional. [...] He seemed to have an acute {{understanding}} of his position in both his career and his hobby and the power that position afforded him. [...] When he learned of Friedman's plans to move to Canada in 1980, Klass {{wrote a letter to}} A.G. McNamara with the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics at the National Research Council in Ottawa. [...] For decades the NRC had been the unwilling recipient of UFO reports collected by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. [...] The NRC did not research the reports they received; they merely classified them as [...] "meteorite" [...] or [...] "non-meteorite" [...] and filed them. [...] The purpose of Klass's letter was to bring [...] "bad tidings" [...] - that Stanton Friedman was moving to Canada. [...] Klass warned that Friedman would begin accusing them of UFO coverups. [...] He then went on to smear Friedman's professionalism, while simultaneously claiming to be Friedman's friend when discussing topics other than UFOs. [...] Ten days later a memo was sent within the NRC management which said, [...] "I don't know what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> prepare for the arrival in Canada of this man Friedman, but if he acts as Klass predicts we can ill afford the publicity he will generate for us." [...] The decision was made quickly to turn over all UFO reports older than a year to the Public Archives of Canada. [...] Klass's single letter apparently prompted a major records relocation in Canada and subsequently made Friedman's research easier than it otherwise might have been.|$|E

So, we’re looking at what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make sure the game looks incredible on [...] From a features perspective, I’d say the thing we’re most excited about is that players {{are going to be}} able to create Toy Boxes now that are much, much larger than they were before," [...] and [...] "In terms of what we're doing with , we're planning on making use of the graphical prowess of those machines — they can pump out some amazing-looking graphics. In addition to that, what we're planning on doing is taking advantage of the overall memory footprint. In Disney Infinity there were certain platforms that were constrained by the amount of RAM, so people couldn't truly build the toy box of their dreams. We've optimized the engine to allow the last-gen, PS3 and 360, to still build compelling Toy Box levels, but with Xbox One and PS4, the sky's the limit." [...] The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 {{versions of}} the game are more advanced than the others, as executive producer John Vignocchi said [...] "one of the most unique features of Disney Infinity 2.0 on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, just because of the memory footprint of those systems, is that the size of the toy boxes you can create are just gigantic."
