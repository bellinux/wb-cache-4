50|$|Dick Johnson wrote {{more than}} 100 {{articles}} for Soaring magazine, consisting mostly of the Flight Test Evaluation series starting in 1976, which measured {{the performance of}} sailplanes utilizing the measurement methods taught by Dr Raspet and refined by Johnson. Funded by the Dallas Gliding Association, which {{did not have any}} financial ties to sailplane manufacturers, Johnson's evaluations were considered an unbiased evaluation and were reprinted in multiple languages and collected into book form. In addition to measuring the sailplane performance as received, these evaluations documented opportunities for measurable performance improvements such as wing smoothing, improved <b>wing</b> <b>seals,</b> turbulator inducing strips, and deturbulator strips.|$|R

5000|$|On December 16, 2016 {{a prison}} guard was {{reportedly}} [...] "rushed" [...] by inmates {{leading to a}} rapid escalation of what prison officials described as [...] "trouble". According to a G4S statement, staff retreated from two of the prison's four <b>wings,</b> <b>sealing</b> the abandoned sections before withdrawing. The disturbances, however, subsequently spread to the remaining two wings. [...] According to a different account of events told by a [...] "prison affairs blogger" [...] quoted by The Guardian, the breakdown in order began after inmates seized control of fire hoses and began breaking lights. Prison staff attempted to lock down inmates in their cells, however, during the operation a guard's keys were stolen, whereupon security staff were ordered to evacuate the wing.|$|R
40|$|A {{low-speed}} wind-tunnel {{investigation was}} made to determine the lateral control characteristics {{of a series of}} untapered low-aspect-ratio <b>wings.</b> <b>Sealed</b> flap ailerons of various spans and spanwise locations were investigated on unswept wings of aspect ratios 1. 13, 1. 13, 4. 13, and 6. 13; and various projections of 0. 60 -semispan retractable ailerons were investigated on the unsweptback wings of aspect ratios 1. 13, 2. 13, and 4. 13 and on a 45 degree sweptback wing. The retractable ailerons investigated on the unswept wings spanned the outboard stations of each wing; whereas the plain and stepped retractable ailerons investigated on the sweptback wing were located at various spanwise stations.

40|$|Modifications to the {{high-lift}} system of a full-scale F/A-I 8 A {{were tested in}} the 80 - by 120 -Foot Wind Tunnel of the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. The objective was to measure the effect of simple modifications on the aerodynamic performance of the {{high-lift system}}. The modifications included the placement of a straight fairing in the shroud cove above the trailing-edge flap {{and the addition of}} seals to prevent air leakage through the hinge lines of the leading-edge flap, the trailing-edge shroud, and the wing fold. The test was carried out on an actual F/A- 18 A with it's flaps deployed in the landing approach configuration. The angle of attack ranged from 0 to 16 degrees and the wind speed was 100 knots. At an angle of attack of 8 degrees, the trimmed lift coefficient was improved by 0. 09 with all <b>wing</b> <b>seals</b> in place. This corresponds to a reduction in the approach speed for the F/A-I 8 A of about 5 knots. The <b>seal</b> along the <b>wing</b> fold hinge, a feature present on many naval aircraft, provided one third of the total increment in trimmed lift. A comparison of the full-scale wind-tunnel results with those obtained from flight test is also presented...|$|R

50|$|A wet wing is an {{aerospace}} engineering technique where an aircraft's <b>wing</b> structure is <b>sealed</b> {{and used as}} a fuel tank. Wet wings are also called integral fuel tanks. By {{eliminating the need for}} fuel bladders, aircraft can weigh less and the wing root bending moment caused by the lift generated by the wings in flight is decreased. This offers further reduction in weight by allowing structural components to be designed lighter as the components do not need to support larger forces.|$|R

5000|$|It {{quickly became}} clear that having two airstair doors on an {{aircraft}} holding only 19 passengers was excessive. In creating the 1900C, Beechcraft kept the front airstair, but eliminated the aft airstair door, installing an enlarged cargo door in its place. Other than the redesigned door layout, the early 1900Cs were substantially similar to the original 1900s. These were assigned serial numbers starting with the letters UB. A total of 74 UB version were built, many of which remain in service.Aircraft in the UA and UB series employ a bladder-type fuel tank system in the wings. Later 1900Cs use a wet wing fuel system: entire sections of the <b>wing</b> are <b>sealed</b> off for use as fuel tanks. This design change allowed more fuel to be stored, substantially increasing the 1900C's range. The wet wing 1900Cs were assigned serial numbers beginning with [...] "UC." [...] These aircraft are {{also referred to as}} 1900C-1s. The wet wings proved popular, and the UC is the most common version of the low-ceiling 1900, with 174 UC airframes built.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the wet}} wing is that every rivet, bolt, nut plate, hose and tube that penetrates the <b>wing</b> must be <b>sealed</b> to prevent fuel from leaking or seeping around these hardware components. This sealant must allow for expansion and contraction due to rapid temperature changes (such as when cold fuel is pumped into a warm wing tank) and must retain its sealing properties when submerged in fuel and when left dry {{for long periods of}} time. Working with this sealant can be difficult and replacing old sealant inside a small wing tank can be harder if the old sealant needs to be removed as well before new sealant can be applied.|$|R
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy.
