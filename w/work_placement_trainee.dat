The empirical material consists of data from two different labour market projects with funding from the European Social Fund (ESF). Within ESF-projecs, <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> {{is one of the most}} common measures to increase the labour supply.   The results demonstrate that <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> can function as both opportunity and constraint for labour market integration. When the work emplacement is located in a communicative, Swedish-speaking environment, it is a potential arena for language development. An opportunity for meaningful <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> is also opened up when projects are organized as vocational training. The link between the purpose of the <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> and the <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> as such, becomes very clear – it´s about the opportunity to learn a trade. Here, however, a potential problem becomes prominent. If the projects participants are trained for occupations in industries which are already ethnically segregated – the project is at risk to enforce the already segregated labour market. The study also shows how employers may be “tired” of unemployed coming to their organization for <b>work</b> <b>placement.</b> This creates a competition for placements, which do not favor those considered less employable.

The thesis provides a review of the theoretical and empirical literature in the field of student <b>work</b> <b>placements</b> and transferable skills and provides a discussion of the measurement of impact in this field. It also describes the design of the study, methods of data collection and the data analyses used. The research project was carried out at Loughborough University from 2005 – 2008. The data was collected from 247 students and 5 DIS (Diploma in Industrial Studies) tutors from three engineering departments (Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering and the Institute of Polymer Technology and Materials Engineering (IPTME)) and 26 line managers from 19 different companies which take students on placements. The results shows that {{the overwhelming majority of the}} students valued <b>work</b> <b>placements</b> as a way of developing transferable skills and identified the transferable skills which <b>work</b> <b>placements</b> were most likely and least likely to develop. There was close agreement on these matters between students who had experienced placements and those that had not. All DIS tutors and 87 % of the line managers interviewed considered that a <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> had a very strong or strong impact upon the transferable skills of the students. Triangulation of the responses by students, tutors and line managers revealed close agreement on these matters. Students, tutors and line managers had mixed opinions whether <b>work</b> <b>placements</b> would improve degree results. In fact, <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> students performed significantly better in degree examinations than non <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> students. The tutors and line managers stressed particularly that <b>work</b> <b>placements</b> increased the confidence and maturity of the students. They suggested holiday work, summer work, team based projects as a part of the University degree courses as alternative ways of helping the students who are not doing <b>work</b> <b>placements</b> to acquire and improve their transferable skills, although they did not think that these suggested alternatives will be as effective as the one year placement. They considered that the duration of the work experience period is a key factor in improving transferable skills. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

It is the aim of this study to find out in what areas and to what extent competence is acquired and psychological stress exists in students during their <b>work</b> <b>placement.</b> Veterinary students (n= 142) from all German education institutes participated in a voluntary online-study based on Burnout Screening Scales (BOSS) as well as a questionnaire regarding the acquisition of competence and excessive stress during the <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> (FKÜP). The distribution of values for <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> related stress show that such <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> related stress is generally slightly increased (T= 60) and lies above that of occupational stresses within the normal population. <b>Work</b> <b>placement</b> related physical complaints also show a significant slight increase (T= 61).

Few of the students questioned considered themselves to be excessively stressed in favour of a high subjective acquisition of competences. The largest increase regarding the acquisition of competence was noted for the areas of animal handling/restraint and application and injection techniques. In the sense of a perceived excessive demand regarding practical capabilities the areas of emergency management, surgery and medication dispensation were mentioned.

40|$|The {{impetus for}} this {{dissertation}} originated {{from my own}} <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> experience. I was in a multi-disciplinary work environment that traditionally hired only engineering students who needed to complete their work experience requirement. After a summer of working with engineering undergraduates, I {{became aware of the}} strict requirements imposed on them and realised the School of Surveying approach was lacking coordination.

As such, my aim was to identify the perceptions the three main stakeholders; students, employers and staff, have on the <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> scheme. I was aware that any differences in expected outcomes would lead to stakeholder dissatisfaction, which may prevent parties from capitalising on <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> opportunities. The results of a questionnaire study were used to identify the stakeholder perceptions on the <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> scheme. It was found the School of Surveying needs to identify why they have the work experience requirement in their formal degree structure.

International student mobility has become an increasingly important and prominent part of the global higher education landscape {{over the past two}} decades (Verbik and Lasanowski, 2007). Despite a long history within Europe, student mobility has increased significantly over recent years partly due to the support and encouragement provided by the Erasmus programme. Since its introduction in 1987, the Erasmus programme has traditionally facilitated student mobility for studies within Europe; however, in 2007 the programme expanded and now also supports student mobility for <b>work</b> <b>placements.</b> There is a growing body of literature on student mobility for the purpose of studies, but student <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> mobility has largely been overlooked in existing research. This thesis makes an original contribution to knowledge and offers a new perspective on student mobility by exploring the drivers, experiences and effects of Erasmus <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> mobility. The UK has performed well in terms of Erasmus <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> mobility compared to its previous performance for Erasmus study abroad and therefore provides an interesting case study for this research. The findings presented in this thesis offer new insights into the motivations, experiences and perceptions of UK students who go abroad in Europe during their undergraduate studies to complete a <b>work</b> <b>placement.</b> Overall, this thesis stresses the importance of assessing subtypes of student mobility and highlights that <b>work</b> <b>placement</b> mobility is very different to study abroad in numerous ways...|$|R
