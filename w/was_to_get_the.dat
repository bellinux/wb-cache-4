5|$|Liverpool {{controlled}} the opening passages of the game. Their first goalscoring chance {{came in the}} 11th minute when Alan Kennedy's 30 yard shot was saved by Real goalkeeper Agustín Rodríguez. Further chances were created, but neither Terry McDermott or Dalglish were able to score. Real started to exert more of an influence after this, midfielder Juanito started to cause Liverpool problems with his passing. One pass found José Antonio Camacho who beat Liverpool defender Alan Hansen but put his shot wide of the Liverpool goal. Despite their scoring opportunity, one problem Real had <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> best out of their winger Cunningham. Not fully fit, he was tightly marked and made little impact in the match.|$|E

For many years to come Warm Springs would be where Franklin would retreat in comfort and do hydrotherapy for his legs.

One of Roosevelt's major goals <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> American Orthopedic Association to endorse the resort, but he was rejected because there was no real progress in physical health. It is now the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, a comprehensive rehabilitation facility operated by the State of Georgia.|$|E

25|$|A November 13, 1995 car {{bombing in}} Riyadh led the U.S. forces {{stationed}} at Khobar Towers {{to raise the}} threat condition to THREATCON DELTA. Days after the attack, military commanders briefed soldiers and airmen at Khobar that the U.S. had received anonymous communications from an organization claiming to have carried out the Riyadh attack. The attackers claimed their goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> United States Armed Forces to leave the country, and that Khobar Towers would be attacked next if troop withdrawal did not begin immediately.

25|$|When Strom {{started his}} career in the NBA, he felt the most {{important}} aspect <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> play right. Instead of selling a bad call, he felt that officials should admit their mistake, and get the call right. To get plays called correctly, he brought up the idea of limited use of instant replay for shots made {{at the end of a}} period ("buzzer beaters") and three-point attempts. The NBA eventually adopted the use of instant replay for end of the period field goal attempts and fouls at the start of the 2002–03 NBA season. Strom believed that referee's job was to ensure the game is played correctly, which will allow players to play their particular style. As the NBA began to evolve, Strom opposed the addition of the third official in NBA game for one season, the 1977–78 NBA season, and later in its present form since the 1988–89 NBA season. Strom felt that well-conditioned officials who are able to stay on top of the play would be able to make calls that a third official would be responsible for.|$|E

25|$|When new {{immigrants}} arrived in Israel, they were sprayed with DDT, underwent a medical examination, were inoculated against diseases, and were given food. The earliest immigrants received desirable homes in established urban areas, {{but most of}} the immigrants were then sent to transit camps, known initially as immigrant camps, and later as Ma'abarot. Many were also initially housed in reception centers in military barracks. By the end of 1950, some 93,000 immigrants were housed in 62 transit camps. The Israeli government's goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> immigrants out of refugee housing and into society as speedily as possible. Immigrants who left the camps received a ration card, an identity card, a mattress, a pair of blankets, and $21 to $36 in cash. They settled either in established cities and towns, or in kibbutzim and moshavim. Many others stayed in the Ma'abarot as they were gradually turned into permanent cities and towns, which became known as development towns, or were absorbed as neighborhoods of the towns they were attached to, and the tin dwellings were replaced with permanent housing.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July 1906 Rawlinson told Wilson that {{he wanted}} him to succeed him {{at the end of}} the year, and the news {{appeared}} in the press in August amidst praise for Rawlinson, suggesting that he rather than Wilson had leaked it. In September and October 1906 Lyttelton favoured Colonel Edward (“Edna”) May, Assistant Director of Military Operations and described by Lord Esher as “a worthy but stupid officer”. Ewart (Director of Military Operations) and Haig (Director of Military Training) opposed May's appointment, whilst Field Marshal Roberts wrote to Richard Haldane (Secretary of State for War from December 1905) and Esher recommending Wilson on the basis of his excellent staff work in South Africa, and as a strong character needed to maintain Rawlinson’s improvements to training at Camberley. Wilson, who learned indirectly from Aylmer Haldane (cousin of Richard Haldane) on 24 October that he <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> job, wrote to thank Roberts, and was in little doubt that his support had clinched it for him. Wilson remained very close to Roberts, often joining him for Christmas Dinner and attending his Golden Wedding in May 1909. French (then commanding 1st Army Corps at Aldershot Command) had initially been suspicious of Wilson as a Roberts protégé, but now supported his candidacy, and by 1912 Wilson had become his most trusted adviser.|$|E
500|$|After {{a series}} of {{unsuccessful}} projects to resurrect Batman on screen following the critical failure of Batman & Robin (1997), Nolan and David S. Goyer began {{to work on the}} film in early 2003 and aimed for a darker and more realistic tone, with humanity and realism being the basis of the film. The goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. The film, which was primarily shot in Iceland and Chicago, relied on traditional stunts and miniatures, while computer-generated imagery was used minimally. Comic book storylines such as The Man Who Falls, [...] and [...] served as inspiration.|$|E

Wood did not contact his fact witnesses, the Gerhardts, until shortly before the trial, and Palsgraf was examined by Dr. Hammond {{the day before the}} trial started. McNamara, one of the most junior members of the LIRR's legal team, called no witnesses, and Manz suggested the entire defense strategy <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> judge to dismiss the case.

500|$|In January 2003, Warner Bros. hired Memento {{director}} Christopher Nolan {{to direct}} an untitled Batman film, and David S. Goyer {{signed on to}} write the script two months later. Nolan stated his intention to reinvent the film franchise of Batman by [...] "doing the origins story of the character, which is a story that's never been told before". Nolan said that humanity and realism would {{be the basis of}} the origin film, and that [...] "the world of Batman is that of grounded reality. [...] will be a recognizable, contemporary reality against which an extraordinary heroic figure arises." [...] Goyer said that the goal of the film <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> audience to care for both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Nolan felt the previous films were exercises in style rather than drama, and described his inspiration as being Richard Donner's 1978 film Superman, in its focus on depicting the character's growth. Also similar to Superman, Nolan wanted an all-star supporting cast for Batman Begins to lend a more epic feel and credibility to the story.|$|E

Then Thomas was brought in by Virgin Records to produce. The band's first single, [...] "Anarchy in the U.K.", was released on 26 November 1976. Music journalist John Robb described the record's impact: [...] "From Steve Jones' opening salvo of descending chords, to Johnny Rotten's fantastic sneering vocals, this song is the perfect statement...a stunningly powerful piece of punk politics...a lifestyle choice, a manifesto that heralds a new era". Colin Newman, who had just cofounded the band Wire, heard it as [...] "the clarion call of a generation." ...|$|E

Scott's concept for the plot was [...] "to go back to where the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created", which became the basis of his prequel series. In late 2008, Weaver hinted in an interview with MTV that she and Scott were working on an Alien spinoff film, which would focus on the chronicles of Ellen Ripley rather than on the Aliens, but the continuation of Ripley's story has not materialized. Instead, Scott worked on a prequel that explained the [...] "Space Jockey" [...] found on the derelict spacecraft from Alien, titled Prometheus, which was released in June 8, 2012. Scott and Damon Lindelof developed a story that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise.

500|$|The {{budget was}} set at $5.5 million, and the film was shot in 35 days in Los Angeles, San Pedro and New York City. Spacey said that they shot the {{interrogation}} scenes with Palminteri over a span of five to six days. These scenes were also shot {{before the rest of}} the film. The police lineup scene ran into scheduling conflicts because the actors kept blowing their lines. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie would feed the actors questions off-camera and they improvised their lines. When Stephen Baldwin gave his answer, he made the other actors break character. Byrne remembers that they were often laughing between takes and [...] "when they said, 'Action!', we'd barely be able to keep it together." [...] Spacey also said that the hardest part was not laughing through takes, with Baldwin and Pollak being the worst culprits. Their goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> usually serious Byrne to crack up. They spent all morning trying unsuccessfully to film the scene. At lunch a frustrated Singer angrily scolded the five actors, but when they resumed the cast continued to laugh through each take. Byrne remembers, [...] "Finally, Bryan just used one of the takes where we couldn't stay serious." [...] Singer and editor John Ottman used a combination of takes and kept the humor in to show the characters bonding with one another.|$|E
500|$|It was in {{the next}} game of the series which [...] Leaf defenceman Bill Barilko scored {{one of the most}} famous goals in NHL history with a goal in {{overtime}} to win the Stanley Cup. However, without Kennedy's face-off skills Barilko's goal would not have occurred. Montreal had been leading late in the game 2–1 and it appeared that the teams were headed to a sixth game in Montreal. With just 39 seconds remaining, Toronto was able to get a faceoff in the Montreal end. Toronto coach Joe Primeau had pulled the goaltender so they could have six skaters. Primeau had the option of changing his players, but decided to leave Kennedy out to take the faceoff against Canadien Billy Reay. Kennedy's plan on the faceoff <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> puck to Max Bentley, who was stationed at the point. Then Montreal coach Dick Irvin decided to switch and have his best forwards, the Punch Line, out for this critical faceoff. Kennedy faced Lach instead. Kennedy later recalled he was relieved at the switch as he had trouble with Reay on faceoffs, but when Lach came out he felt [...] "I had a chance," [...] Kennedy won the faceoff from Lach, got the puck to Bentley and from the ensuing scramble around the net Tod Sloan tied the game. The goal dispirited the Montreal team and led to Barilko's famed overtime goal which won another Stanley Cup for the Leafs.|$|E
