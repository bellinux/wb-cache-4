6000|$|... "Senor," [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "that is a {{question}} which you must excuse my child from answering. Not, sir, from want of will, for she is docile and obedient, though I say it, {{but there is no}} answer beyond <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> And this is, sir, that all creatures, whether man or bird, have the voice that God has given them; and in some the voice is musical and in others not so." ...|$|E

6000|$|This frank {{expression}} of regard {{brought about a}} moment of emotional tension, and Ben hesitated before replying. At last he said: [...] "I hope I shall always deserve your confidence.

6000|$|The man {{was simply}} irresistible. Beaucourt sat down resignedly on the nearest {{of the hall}} chairs. Dick asked {{him to return to}} the dining-room. [...] "No," [...] he said; [...] "it's not worth while. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> may be told in two minutes." [...] Dick submitted, and took the next of the hall chairs. In that {{inappropriate}} place the young lord's unpremeditated confession was forced out of him, by no more formidable exercise of power than the kindness of his friend.|$|E

[...] "But <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is why I hold that, as I said just now, we can do most. We can do this: we can give to a {{harmless}} and sensitive creature hitherto practically disinherited--and give with an unexpectedness that will immensely add to its price--the pure joy of a deep draught of the very pride of life, of an acclaimed personal triumph in our superior sophisticated world." ...|$|E

There is Houpembiere,--that means the beer- barrel, I take it,--and La Rouge Bombarde, and Remeswalle and Quincequin, every one {{shooting}} stone balls thirty inches in girth. The houses on the bridge are a heap of stones, the mills are battered down, and we must grind our meal in the city, in a cellar, for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell.</b> Nom Dieu! when they take the boulevard we lose the river, and if once they bar our gates to the east, whence shall viands come?" ...|$|R

[...] "I can't do {{anything}} to help her--nobody can, if she has found out her mistake already. And {{it seems to me that}} she has a dreary lack of the ideas that might help her. Strange and piteous to human flesh like that might be, wrapped round with fine raiment, her ears pierced for gems, her head held loftily, her mouth all smiling pretence, the poor soul within her sitting in sick distaste of all things! But <b>what</b> do <b>I</b> know of her? There may be a demon in her to match the worst husband, for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell.</b> She was clearly an ill-educated, worldly girl: perhaps she is a coquette." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, now, Mr. Wilson," [...] said George, {{coming up}} and sitting himself determinately {{down in front of}} him; [...] "look at me, now. Don't I sit before you, every way, just as much a man as you are? Look at my face,--look at my hands,--look at my body," [...] and the young man drew himself up proudly; [...] "why am I not a man, as much as anybody? Well, Mr. Wilson, hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> I had a father--one of your Kentucky gentlemen--who didn't think enough of me to keep me from being sold with his dogs and horses, to satisfy the estate, when he died. I saw my mother put up at sheriff's sale, with her seven children. They were sold before her eyes, one by one, all to {{different}} masters; and I was the youngest. She came and kneeled down before old Mas'r, and begged him to buy her with me, that she might have at least one child with her; and he kicked her away with his heavy boot. I saw him do it; and the last that I heard was her moans and screams, when I was tied to his horse's neck, to be carried off to his place." ...|$|E
60|$|Let {{me think}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> of the President. I {{have never seen}} his face, though he has driven past me in the boulevards, and past these windows constantly, but {{it is said that}} he is very like his portraits--and, yes, rumour and the gazettes speak of his riding well. Wilson and Wiedeman had an {{excellent}} view of him the other day as he turned into a courtyard to pay some visit, and she tells me that his carriage was half full of petitions and nosegays thrown through the windows. What a fourth act of a play we are in just now! It is difficult to guess at the catastrophe. Certainly he must be very sure of his hold on the people to propose repealing the May edict,[6] and yet there are persons who persist in declaring that nobody cares for him and that even a revision of the constitution will not bring about his re-election. I am of an opposite mind; though there is not much overt enthusiasm of the population in behalf of his person. Still, this may arise from a quiet resolve to keep him where he is, and an assurance that he can't be ousted in spite of the people and army. It is significant, I think, that Emile de Girardin should stretch out a hand (a little dirty, be it observed in passing), and that Lamartine, after fasting nineteen days and nights (a miraculous fast, without fear of the 'prefect'), should murmur a 'credo' in favour of his honesty. As to honesty, 'I do believe he's honest;' that is to say, he has acted out no dishonesty as yet, and we have no right to interpret doubtful texts into dishonorable allegations. But for ambition--for ambition! Answer from the depth of your conscience, 'de profundis.' Is he or is he not an ambitious man? Does he or does he not mean in his soul to be Napoleon the Second? Yes, yes--I think, you think, we all think.|$|E

[...] Alito responded to Senator Biden's questioning with [...] "... <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is that I have not studied these authorities and it is not my practice to just express an opinion on a constitutional question including particularly one that is as momentous as this." ...|$|E

5000|$|On October 31, 2011, {{after the}} release of subpoenaed documents, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer stated he found out about gunwalking in Operation Wide Receiver in April 2010, and that he wished he had alerted the deputy or the {{attorney}} general at the time. [...] The following day, in testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee in a hearing on International Organized Crime, when asked if he had reviewed the letter before it was sent to Senator Charles Grassley on February 4, 2011, denying gunwalking, Breuer replied, [...] "I cannot say for sure whether I saw a draft of the letter that was sent to you. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Senator, is that at that time I was in Mexico dealing with the very real issues that we're all so committed to." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sam was {{introduced}} as the estranged wife of Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker). Tucker told Jackie Brygel of TV Week that {{during a meeting}} to discuss his character's return to the show, it was [...] "loosely" [...] mentioned {{that he could have}} a wife. The idea was later used. Dan initially kept his marital status a secret until he developed feelings for Libby Kennedy (Valentine). He decided to be honest with her before their relationship went any further. Their conversation prompted Dan to get in contact with Sam. Tucker said [...] "Dan realises he has got a few things to sort out with his ex. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is that his past involved a lot of pain and turmoil. He now knows that he has to dredge all that up again so that he can move on completely and perhaps start a new relationship with Libby." [...] Dan had mixed emotions when Sam then turned up Erinsborough, while Libby could see that there was still something between the two of them. Buchanan thought the Sam/Dan/Libby triangle was an interesting storyline. She explained that Sam was unaware of Libby and [...] "innocently comes back into the picture". Buchanan did not think either of the women were the villain in the situation.|$|E

So, by 2003, the usage had become standard.

60|$|The affliction {{which has}} befallen me has left certain duties to be {{performed}} that require my presence in London. My house is let; I am staying at a hotel. My friend, Sir James (also in London on business), has rooms near mine. We breakfast and dine together in my sitting-room. For the moment solitude is dreadful to me, and yet I cannot go into society; I shrink from persons who are mere acquaintances. At Sir James's suggestion, however, one visitor at the hotel {{has been asked to}} dine with us, who claims distinction as no ordinary guest. The physician who first warned me of the critical state of my mother's health is anxious to hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> him of her last moments. His time is too precious to be wasted in the earlier hours of the day, and he joins us at the dinner-table when his patients leave him free to visit his friends.|$|R
