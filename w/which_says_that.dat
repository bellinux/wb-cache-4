5|$|Orion served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture. The {{story of the}} adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on which {{we have the most}} {{evidence}} (and even on that not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage <b>which</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Strait of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|The {{integers}} {{have additional}} properties {{which do not}} generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, <b>which</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker–Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in determining what properties do hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{seems to}} have been on good terms with the West Saxons: he stood as sponsor to the baptism of their king, Cynegils, and married Cynegils' daughter. Her name is {{reported}} by only one source, Reginald of Durham's 12th century Vita S. Oswaldi, <b>which</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> it was Kyneburga. Although Oswald had one known son, Æthelwald, it is uncertain whether this was a son from his marriage to Cynegils' daughter or from an earlier relationshipsince Æthelwald began ruling in Deira in 651, {{it has been argued that}} a son from this marriage would have been too young at the time to be trusted with this position, and therefore may have been older, the product of a relationship Oswald had during his exile.|$|E

5|$|Neither the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle nor Æthelweard's Chronicon makes {{mention of}} Sitric {{in the years}} 921924, i.e. between his {{installation}} as King of Northubmria {{and the death of}} Edward the Elder. However, there are coins in existence which were minted at Lincoln during the period that bear Sitric's name. These are an important piece of evidence since they suggest Sitric ruled a large area south of the Humber, a claim contradicted by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle <b>which</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> all the 'Danes' in Mercia (i.e. south of the Humber) submitted to Edward in 918. These coins might indicate Viking reconquest of a large area in the years 921924, which if it did happen went unremarked upon by the Chronicle. Edward's control of Mercia likely stretched the kingdom's resources to breaking point, allowing Sitric to exploit the ill-will towards Edward that existed among the populace there, with Edward being unable to effectively oppose Sitric. Downham suggests that the silence of the Chronicle might be due to Edward's failing power in the latter years of his reign, and its tendency to only record successes and not failures. His death in 924 is not recorded by a number of important Frankish, Welsh and Irish annals, suggesting a fall in importance and standing from the zenith of his power in 920.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} 2011 with Cocoro {{traveling}} to SPHIA to interview Inubushi, when her plane experiences turbulence and crashes on Mount Akakura. Yuni and Yomogi get the unconscious Cocoro and Mayuzumi {{to an emergency}} cabin to take shelter from the blizzard. In 2012, Satoru falls from the SPHIA facility's clock tower and loses consciousness. Cocoro wakes up {{in a room and}} is relieved to find that Yuni is safe. Yuni does not recognize her; when looking at herself in a mirror, she sees a man's body. Similarly, Satoru wakes up in a woman's body. Both eventually switch back to their respective bodies, but the phenomenon continues, with their minds moving between their bodies; they conclude that their consciousnesses are transcending time and space. In the cabin, a news article dated July 4, 2011 is found, <b>which</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Yuni was the only survivor, with the other three having died in an avalanche on January 17. Satoru finds a key in his room, but does not know what it unlocks.|$|E

25|$|A claim can be {{made that}} the {{difference}} between the two cases is that in the second, you intend someone's death to save the five, and this is wrong, whereas, in the first, you have no such intention.

Macrobius describes a further refinement whereby, in one 8-year period within a 24-year cycle, {{there were only}} three intercalary years, each of 377 days. This refinement brings the calendar back in line with the seasons, and averages the length of the year to 365.25 days over 24 years.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects that may seem counterintuitive.
