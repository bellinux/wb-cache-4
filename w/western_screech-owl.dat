40|$|Although {{common in}} western North America, {{the ecology of}} <b>Western</b> <b>Screech-Owls</b> (Megascops kennicottii) is poorly studied. For many birds, the post-fledging period is also poorly {{understood}} {{because of the difficulty}} of tracking newly fledged young. In raptors such as owls, the post-fledging period is unique in that it is generally longer than other species of birds. Our goal was to examine the post-fledging behavior of <b>Western</b> <b>Screech-Owls.</b> We studied owls in the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area and used radio-telemetry to help overcome the difficulty of observing screech-owls. We radio-tagged nestlings shortly before they fledged so we could monitor them throughout the post-fledging period. By locating owls, we quantified movements of owls after fledging, their roosting behavior in relation to the nest, proximity of family members, habitat use, and the timing of brood break-up and dispersal. Our study helps further understanding of the post-fledging ecology of raptors and the behavior of <b>Western</b> <b>Screech-Owls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about habitat {{selection}} by elf owls (Micrathene whitneyi) and <b>western</b> <b>screech-owls</b> (Otus kennicottii). From 1994 to 1996 in the Sonoran Desert, I used point counts and nest searches to examine habitat selection by both species at multiple spatial scales. The abundance of both species had a positive association with percent cover of washes and mesquite (Prosopis spp.) at {{the scale of the}} study area. At both the scale of the study area and the nesting area, elf owls selected areas with high densities of mature saguaros (Carnegiea gigantea) and saguaro cavities. Elf owls nested only in woodpecker cavities in saguaros, whereas <b>western</b> <b>screech-owls</b> nested in both saguaro cavities and in natural cavities in mesquite. <b>Western</b> <b>screech-owls</b> nested nearly exclusively in gilded flicker (Colaptes chrysoides) cavities when they nested in saguaros. Patterns of nest cavity selection by elf owls suggest they may choose cavities that provide thermoregulatory advantages. I give management recommendations based on my findings...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} three chapters {{that describe}} my two-year {{study of the}} postfledging roosting behavior and dispersal of young <b>western</b> <b>screech-owls,</b> Otus kennicottii, in southwestern Idaho. In the first chapter I discuss {{the primary focus of}} this study which was to examine how social status alters the distance and direction that young screech-owls disperse. For the most part, hypotheses regarding social status and dispersal have been untested. Thus, the first chapter contains the most scientifically challenging and intriguing portion of this thesis. Chapters two and three describe the dispersal behavior and roosting behavior during the postfledging period, respectively, and are, in part, an extension of a descriptive study of dispersal and roosting behavior in a closely related but geographically distinct species, the eastern screech-owl, Otus asio (Belthoff 2 ̆ 6 Ritchison 1989; Belthoff 2 ̆ 6 Ritchison 1990), in eastern Kentucky. Here, my study provides a comparative analysis of the behavior of young of both species, and offers insight into the effects that physiography and distinctly different habitats have on the ecology of these two species...|$|R

40|$|Both sexes {{of adult}} Western Screech-Owls (Otus kennicottii) sing in {{response}} to playback of conspecific song within their territories. Two primary songs are the bounce and double trill. Using sonographic analysis of tape-recorded vocalizations, our study quantified characterstics of bounce and double trill songs uttered by individuals within a population of Western Screech-Owls inhabiting riparian woodlands in southwestern Idaho. We asked if songs {{of males and females}} differed and, if so, how accurately could songs be classified by sex. On average, male bounce songs were ∼ 30 % lower in frequency than bounce songs of females, but song duration, note duration, number of notes per bout, and internote duration did not differ. Similarly, double trill songs of males were significantly lower in frequency than those of females, and double trill songs uttered by females had significantly greater internote distances in the leading portion. A discriminant model based on frequency at maximum amplitude of bounce songs correctly classified all males and females in our sample. Presence of sex-specific patterns of vocalizations in that species would allow owls to assess the sex of potential intruders and respond appropriately. Moreover, sonographic analysis of <b>Western</b> <b>Screech-Owl</b> songs provides a means for noninvasive classification of sex...|$|E
40|$|CORRECTIONS TO NBR 51 : 18. On line 8 of page 18 of the March 1983 Bird Review {{the number}} of parties for North Platte should be 3, rather than 30.

Checklist has been released, and some of the loose ends in the {{previous}} report on it (NBR 50 : 74) can now be tied up. The Crested Tinamou (no Elegant) is listed in Appendix D - introduced species, either not established or not sufficient importance to be included on the hypothetical list (Appendix B). Mexican Duck is included with Mallard because of extensive hybridization. The Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) is listed because it is established in the Hawaiian Islands (which {{were not included in the}} 5 th but are included in the 6 th Edition). The CommonQuail (Cortunix coturnix), which was introduced in Nebraska, apparently has not been successfully introduced anywhere in North America. The Screech-Owl complex is discussed in Marshall (1967, W. Found. Vertebr. Zool. Monogr., no. 1, pp. 1 - 72).

40|$|We used a {{standard}} handling protocol {{to examine the}} stress response of captive young <b>western</b> <b>screech-owls</b> during their active (nighttime) and inactive (daytime) periods and to compare the stress responses of captive and free-living owls. Circulating corticosterone levels were significantly higher during the inactive period than in the active period in this nocturnal species. This suggests that the daily pattern of corticosterone secretion is reversed in nocturnal birds and is correlated with activity period rather than with the light/dark cycle. Young (ca. 4 - 5 mo old) screech-owls of both sexes showed increases in plasma corticosterone up to 30 min after capture, followed by significant decreases at 60 min. This pattern is {{similar to those of}} other species of birds examined previously, except that decreases in corticosterone at 60 min rarely have been observed. Such decreases {{may be the result of}} physiological differences between adult and young birds, habituation to handling in captive birds, or the effects of body condition. Corticosterone levels and the response to capture and handling were comparable in captive and free-living owls, which suggests that the captive owls were not subjected to chronically high levels of stress...|$|R
40|$|I {{compared}} the nesting chronology, body size, food habits, prey size, and nest site characteristics of northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) and <b>western</b> <b>screech-owls</b> (Otus kennicottii) nesting in nest-boxes in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (SRBOPNCA) in southwestern Idaho {{to evaluate the}} niche overlap and potential interspecific competition between the two owl species. Overlap occurred in the nesting chronology; saw-whet owl median egg laying date was 14 March, median date of egg hatching was 9 April, and the average fledging date was 14 May. The median laying date for screech-owls was 2 April, and median hatching date was 13 April. Body size of the two owl species did not overlap. Overlap {{was found in the}} diets of the two owls for prey species, frequency, biomass, and prey size. Dietary overlap was 99 % at coarse resolution (class level) and 82 % at fine resolution (species level); the lower overlap at species level indicated that the owls ate different mammal species. The prey sizes taken by the two owl species overlapped; saw-whet owls took prey that ranged from 11 - 55 g; screech-owl prey ranged 0. 5 - 400 g. Nest-site micro-habitat measurements obtained at nest boxes used by saw-whet owls and screech-owls were similar revealing substantial overlap in nesting habitat for this area. I also examined the relationship of nearest-neighbor distances to nesting success and productivity (clutch size and number of bandable-age young) of <b>western</b> <b>screech-owls</b> and northern saw-whet owls. The nesting success of screech-owls was positively significantly related to the nearest-neighbor distance of screech-owl nest-sites (p = 0. 013), but the relationship to saw-whet nest-sites was not significant. Nesting success of saw-whet owls was not related to the nearest-neighbor distances of either owl. Although not significant, there were trends in the relationship of clutch size and number of screech-owl young to the distance to screech-owl and saw-whet owl nest-sites. This indicated that nearest-neighbor distances of screech-owls affected their nesting success, but nesting productivity levels were not determined by the nearest-neighbor distances. Average nearest-neighbor distances for saw-whet owls nest-sites were 4507 m; average distance of screech-owl nest-sites to screech-owl and to saw-whet owl were 3054 m and 13139 m, respectively. Mean clutch size of saw-whet owls was 5. 9 eggs, while that of screech-owls was 4. 5 eggs. The average number of young per successful pair was 5. 3 for saw-whet owls and 4. 1 for screech-owls. The average number of young per nesting attempt was 3. 6 for saw-whet owls and 3. 0 for screech-owls. Because placement of nest-boxes is sometimes used as a management tool, {{it is important to understand}} the possible nest-box requirements of these owl species. I examined the nest-box selection of the two owl species and found that there was no significant difference between nest-boxes selected by saw-whet owls, screech-owls, and unoccupied nest-boxes. However, I found some trends in nest-box selection...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{offspring}} mortality {{can occur}} during the postfledging period of birds, but few postfledging survival {{studies have been}} conducted within the context of habitat suitability. We conducted a 2 -year radiotelemetry study of Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculatus) reproductive success and fledgling survival in a 24 -ha forested park in a residential area of Lake Oswego, Oregon. In corroboration of previous research on this species, we found (1) that Spotted Towhees nested closer to the edge between the park and residential neighborhoods than expected by chance, and (2) that pairs nesting near edges produced the largest and most offspring. However, fates were reversed during the postfledging period. Thirty-six of 52 fledglings survived the 27 -day tracking period, and although fledglings {{were more likely to be}} found near edges than in the interior, fledglings near edges had a far higher probability of dying. All deaths were from predation, and at least 11 of 16 predation events were attributable to Domestic Cats (Felis catus) and <b>Western</b> <b>Screech-Owls</b> (Megascops kennicottii). A stochastic model that incorporated probability of nest success, nestling production from successful nests, and fledgling survival showed that the number of independent offspring produced per nest was greatest in the park interior. Heavy use of, and apparent preference for, edge by nesting Spotted Towhees, coupled with high fledgling mortality near edges, created a severe ecological trap that was not apparent until the final stage of parental care. Hence, failure to document offspring survival in the late stages of reproduction may lead to incorrect assessment of habitat suitability and poor management decisions...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 I studied {{bird and}} rodent nesting in woodpecker-excavated {{cavities}} in pifion-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma) (P-J) woodland in southeastern Colorado {{during the spring}} and summer of 1987 and 1988. Two related investigations were conducted: one described characteristics of habitat used by birds and rodents nesting in woodpecker-excavated cavities and the other evaluated whether or not birds and rodents were competing for the nest-cavity resource. Seven species of birds and 4 species of rodents were included in the study: American kestrel (Falco sparverius), <b>western</b> <b>screech-owl</b> (Otus kennicottii), northern flicker (Colaptus auratus), ash-throated flycatcher (Mviarchus cinerascens), plain titmouse (Parus inornatus), Bewick's wren (Thrvothorus bewickii), mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides), white-footed mouse (Peromvscus leucopus), deer mouse (P. maniculatus), pition mouse (P. truei), and woodrat (Neotoma spp.). 1987 was a preliminary year. In 1988, 248 nests were located in 433 cavities monitored, and cavity density averaged 1. 5 /ha. Western screech-owls nested earlier than all other species (P < 0. 001), plain titmice nested earlier than ash-throated flycatchers (P = 0. 033), and other species of birds and rodents nested at the same time (P < 0. 05). Seven of 19 characteristics associated with nests differed (P < 0. 05) among species: 4 of 5 at the cavity-level, 2 of 5 at the cavity-tree level, and 1 of 9 at the cavity-site level. Generally, larger species (kestrels, screech-owls, and flickers) nested in larger cavities and smaller species (white-footed, deer, and pitlon mice, and Bewick's wren) nested in smaller cavities. Characteristics of cavities used for nesting by secondary cavity-nesting species also differed from characteristics of all cavities monitored most frequently on characteristics associated with cavity size. Differences were demonstrated using univariate analysis (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA) because with the considerable overlap among species, multivariate analysis (discriminant function analysis [DFA]) could not discriminate among species. Management implications include the need to evaluate impacts to the P-J woodland cavity-nesting community before converting the woodland to rangeland, evaluate impacts of logging in higher elevation forests where many of the cavity-excavating woodpeckers breed, and evaluate the influence of the nest-parasitic brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) and the highly competitive European starling (Sturnus vulqaris). In 1988, 95 cavities were manipulated to yield 47 rodent exclusions and 48 bird exclusions. Proportions of these manipulated cavities used for nesting by birds and rodents were compared to the proportions of 83 control cavities used for nesting by the appropriate group of species. Cavities were revisited at 10 -day intervals 4 May - 6 August 1988 and evidence of use recorded. The proportions of cavities used as nests by rodents was significantly greater in manipulated cavities than in control cavities (P = 0. 0083). Thus, interspecific competition was experimentally demonstrated between birds and rodents for nest-sites in woodpecker-excavated cavities...|$|E
40|$|Variation in {{timing and}} {{distance}} of dispersal movements of juvenile birds {{may result from}} differences in competitive ability. Dispersal by low-ranking juveniles may be initiated before dominants if the latter force subordinate siblings from natal areas. Conversely, when vacant territories are limited and are acquired on a first-come first-served basis, selection could operate on young to disperse as early as possible. In this case, dominant individuals with priority of access to resources in the natal area will mature more quickly {{and are expected to}} disperse first. If costs of dispersal increase with dispersal distance, dominant juveniles are expected to disperse shorter distances. Alternately, if there are advantages to long-distance dispersal, then dominants, which are in better condition, should disperse further than subordinates. We examined effects of social rank on the timing and distance (to wintering area) of dispersal movements by juvenile western screech-owls,Otus kennicottii, in southwestern Idaho. Based on observations of aggressive interactions made using video cameras attached to nestboxes, we assigned dominance ranks to nestlings within nine broods. We radiotracked young throughout the postfledging period to determine order of dispersal, and we located them after leaving their natal areas to determine distances to apparent overwintering areas. In six of seven broods, for which dispersal information could be recorded, the most dominant juvenile dispersed first. Moreover, in five of seven broods, the least dominant individual was the last individual to disperse, and the order of dispersal matched the dominance hierarchy in four of seven broods. In contrast, social status did not affect postfledging dispersal distance. We conclude that social dominance relationships influenced the timing of dispersal in juvenile <b>western</b> <b>screech-owls</b> but not distance travelled to overwinter sites...|$|R
