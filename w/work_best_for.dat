The technique is used to diagnose and monitor disease, detect risk, and decide which therapies will <b>work</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> individual patients.|$|E
5|$|AML {{is treated}} {{initially}} with chemotherapy aimed at inducing remission; people may {{go on to}} receive additional chemotherapy or a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Recent research into the genetics of AML {{has resulted in the}} availability of tests that can predict which drug or drugs may <b>work</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> a particular person, as well as how long that person is likely to survive. The treatment and prognosis of AML differ from those of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in part because the cellular differentiation is not the same; AML involves higher percentages of dedifferentiated and undifferentiated cells, including more blasts (myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts).|$|E
5|$|For the music, the {{development}} team felt that symphony orchestra would <b>work</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> Knights of the Old Republic II. The musical score was composed by Mark Griskey, who developed music and themes for characters and places, including the Jedi's theme, Darth Sion's theme and Darth Nihilus's theme (which both have many similarities with the Emperor's theme from The Return of the Jedi). He {{also created a}} theme for the main character, which is heard occasionally {{when he or she}} experiences internal conflict. The 70-minute score was recorded by the Sinfonia Orchestra in Seattle. The opening crawl utilizes the version of John Williams' main Star Wars theme that was re-recorded for the prequel trilogy.|$|E

25|$|Mushroom anchors are {{the most}} common anchors and <b>work</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> softer seabeds such as mud, sand, or silt. They are shaped like an {{upside-down}} mushroom which can be easily buried in mud or silt. The advantage is that it has up to ten times the holding-power-to-weight ratio compared to a dead weight mooring; disadvantages include high cost, limited success on rocky or pebbly substrates, and the long time it takes to reach full holding capacity.|$|E
25|$|The ship {{carrying}} the device also contained vases in the Rhodian style, {{leading to a}} hypothesis that it was constructed at an academy founded by Stoic philosopher Posidonius on that Greek island. Rhodes was a busy trading port in antiquity and a centre of astronomy and mechanical engineering, home to astronomer Hipparchus who was active from about 140 BC to 120 BC. The mechanism uses Hipparchus's theory for {{the motion of the}} moon, which suggests the possibility that he may have designed it or at least worked on it. In addition, it has recently been argued that the astronomical events on the Parapegma of the Antikythera Mechanism <b>work</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> latitudes in the range of 33.3-37.0 degrees north; Rhodes is located between the latitudes of 35.5 and 36.25 degrees north.|$|E
25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (although you should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would <b>work</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E

25|$|If a new bridge were built, {{the state}} {{originally}} {{said they would}} no longer own and maintain the old bridge, which was proposed {{to be used for}} pedestrians and bicycles. Linn County’s Board of Commissioners supported tearing down the old bridge and simply replace it with a new wider span. In June 2006, ODOT decided to keep the existing span in addition to the new bridge. Additional studies began in 2007 to determine which of the options for replacement would <b>work</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> fixing traffic issues across the river. Options now included adding a bypass north to connect with Oregon Route 99W. By May 2009, ODOT had two proposals, one of which would not build a new bridge near the existing span. Both options included adding a northern bypass that would connect to U.S. Route 20 and Oregon 99W.|$|E
25|$|The first Passion Pit songs, {{which would}} later become the Chunk of Change EP, were written by Angelakos at Emerson College as a belated Valentine's Day gift to his then-girlfriend. At first, he wrote and {{performed}} all his material alone using a laptop. After one of his solo shows in the Boston area, Ian Hultquist, who was attending Berklee College of Music at the time, approached Angelakos and expressed interest in creating and playing music collaboratively. They formed a group that consisted of Angelakos, Hultquist, Ayad Al Adhamy, Thom Plasse (bass), and Adam Lavinsky (drums). The band spent {{a considerable amount of}} time trying to flesh out a collaborative format and structure that would <b>work</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> them. Jeff Apruzzese and Nate Donmoyer joined the band shortly after they signed to Frenchkiss in 2008, replacing Plasse and Lavinsky, respectively. In 2012, Adhamy was replaced by Xander Singh.|$|E

The subject has their current fashion sense evaluated. The presenters take particular regard to the participant's body-shape and self-image (with {{the help of a}} 360 degree mirror cabinet) and determine what will <b>work</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> them. The participant is then given £2000 to go shopping for a new wardrobe, which is supposed to be in accordance with the advice they have been given. Although they are free to spend how they wish, they are spied upon and counselled on the ways of fashion by the show's two hosts.|$|E

We discuss performance of the image understanding algorithms and speculate on their future use in aircraft surface inspection for crack and corrosion detection.

30|$|Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) {{has been}} defined by the IOM as the “generation and {{synthesis}} of evidence” that compares the {{benefits and harms of}} alternative ways to improve care delivery or to “prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor a clinical condition” [7]. In other words, by directly comparing existing health care interventions, we can determine which <b>works</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> which patients, and which poses the greatest benefits, and harms. The core question of CER is which treatment <b>works</b> <b>best,</b> <b>for</b> whom, and under what circumstances? The general importance of CER is reinforced by the evidence that it: (1) provides evidence to inform decisions and help improve health care; (2) helps decide what forms of healthcare interventions are <b>best</b> <b>for</b> a problem; and (3) evaluates which interventions are effective, on average, across a given patient population.|$|R

50|$|Metal in Gap (MIG) {{heads are}} ferrite heads {{with a small}} piece of metal in the head gap that {{concentrates}} the field. This allows smaller features to be read and written. MIG heads were replaced with thin film heads. Thin film heads were electronically similar to ferrite heads and used the same physics, but they were manufactured using photolithographic processes and thin films of material that allowed fine features to be created. Thin film heads were much smaller than MIG heads and therefore allowed smaller recorded features to be used. Thin film heads allowed 3.5 inch drives to reach 4GB storage capacities in 1995. The geometry of the head gap was a compromise between what <b>worked</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> reading and what <b>worked</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> writing.|$|R
