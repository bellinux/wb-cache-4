Immiscible (hypermonotectic) gold-rhodium alloys were processed in the 100 meter drop tube under low gravity, containerless conditions to determine the feasibility of producing dispersed structures. Three alloy compositions were utilized. Alloys containing 10 percent by volume of the gold-rich hypermonotectic phase exhibited a tendency for the gold-rich liquid to wet the outer surface of the samples. This <b>wetting</b> <b>tendency</b> led to extensive segregation in several cases. Alloys containing 80 and 90 percent by volume of the gold-rich phase possessed completely different microstructures from the 10 percent samples when processed under low-g, containerless conditions.

In order to clarify its brazing mechanism, the wettability and interfacial reactions for such an active filler metal on A&O 3 and SIC ceramics substrates were evaluated. It was shown that the contact angle of SnlOAg 4 Ti on both ceramics decreased {{with the increase of}} temperature and heating time. The wettability of SnlOAg 4 Ti on Sic substrate was superior to that on Al 203 substrate. For all cases with better wettability, Ti was also found to aggregate more strongly at the brazing interface.

This overall wettability {{has an effect on}} the fluid flow and electrical properties of the water–hydrocarbon–rock system.

The aged sandstone core pieces were immersed into an aqueous solution of 0.3 % NaCl containing different concentrations of silica materials (100 or 200  mg/L) for 24  h. Afterward, the samples were removed and placed in an oven until dried. Then, a droplet of water was added onto the surface of silica materials-treated sandstone and the angle between the solid surface and the tangent to the drop profile at the drop edge (contact angle) was measured by visual estimation [9].

They were cleaned in a Dean–Stark apparatus for 7  days in contact with toluene vapour at ambient pressure.

The volume of the oil present in the sandstone cores was calculated using the density of the crude oil (0.7  g/mL). Then, the aged sandstone core pieces were immersed into a glass jar containing a 0.3 % NaCl aqueous solution and different concentrations of silica materials (100 or 200  mg/L). The oil that was expelled from the Berea sandstone as the nanoparticle solution imbibed was removed {{from the top of the}} glass jar using a glass pipette.

30|$|Precipitation {{distribution}} in China is {{greatly influenced by}} elevation, latitude, and distance from the sea (Ding 2008). For the last 54  years, precipitation in the Haihe River basin, the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River basin, and Southwest China has decreased, a development that suggests a drying tendency. In contrast, the precipitation of Northwest China shows an upward trend, which indicates at least a temporary <b>wetter</b> <b>tendency</b> in this region. Those {{results are consistent with}} previous studies (Yu et al. 2014; Xu et al. 2015). With a diverse pattern of precipitation in China, it is expected that the variation of historical droughts at the country level should be complicated as well. Comparing the identified drought events with the historical records in the 54  years of study data (Table  2), it is found that the run theory method identifies typical drought events reasonably according to their initiation and termination time, which shows better performance as compared to traditional drought index classification method (He 2015).|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the impact of stratospheric {{circulation}} change on water vapor in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) during the stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) events (e. g., Eguchi and Kodera, 2010). Increased Brewer-Dobson circulation associated with SSW produces cooling in the tropical lower stratosphere (LS). The cooling generally produces more cirrus clouds and decreases of the water vapor mixing ratio (WV) in the TTL, except for some regions over Africa and South American continents where penetrating clouds are expected. This time, we found a new stratospheric phenomenon which produces abrupt warming in the tropical stratosphere converse to the SSW event. The dynamical aspect of this phenomenon and {{the impact on the}} convective activity will be discussed. Due to the interaction between the subtropical jet and polar night jet in the upper stratosphere, tropical stratosphere warmed about two weeks in early December 2011. Accordingly, temperature in the TTL suddenly increased (approximately 0. 5 K at 100 hPa) and the tropical convection ceased. Further, the downward velocity anomaly appeared from stratosphere to lower troposphere through the TTL. The present study mainly focuses on the variation of WV, temperature and cirrus clouds in the upper troposphere (UT) and LS in the period of the stratospheric dynamical change. The data from EOS MLS (Earth Observing System, Microwave Limb Sounder) is used. Before the start of abrupt warming event, the tropical convection temporarily enhanced at the south of the Equator. Then the temperature in the TTL decreased with the Kelvin wave like vertical structure: the WV at 146 hPa increased, while the WV at 100 hPa decreased, and the dryer air extended to 83 hPa with a few days lag. Following the start of the warming event, the tropical convection was suppressed. In the UT and LS, the warm and <b>wet</b> <b>tendencies</b> were found in the temperature and WV anomalies from seasonal march, respectively, and the ice cloud suddenly disappeared with increasing temperature, suggesting adiabatic heating. The result found of the present study clearly shows that the stratospheric dynamical change controls the WV variation in the UT and LS, as well as the tropical convection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{influence}} on precipitation of regional sea surface temperature (SST) during a drought {{period of the}} West African monsoon is determined, using a re-gional climate model (RCM). The results from three simulations of two realistic dry years are compared. The first two experiments are initialised and nested respec-tively in 1983 and 1984 reanalysis data sets. The third experiment is a hybrid simulation of 1983 {{which is the same}} as the first experiment except that the SST field is the 1984 SST. Precipitation from the RCM is compared with several precipitation data sets and, as in observa-tions, the RCM reasonably simulates the West African monsoon (seasonal cycle and monsoon sub-period) for the two different years. In particular, the model repro-duces stage by stage the motion of the monsoon band well: installation phase, high rain period with abrupt northward shift of the rain band, and the retreat southward phase. Interannual variability and <b>wet</b> or dry <b>tendencies</b> are also represented. The most significant effect of SST is shown by the hybrid simulation, when the regional SST appears as a major factor in the sea-sonal and interannual monsoon precipitation regime over the African continent (up to 12 N) although this influence is modulated both by the surface conditions (soil and vegetation) and by the reanalysis flow intro-duced at the lateral boundaries. Dynamically, a warmer SST leads to a decrease in the magnitude of the African Easterly Jet and an increase in northward equivalent water content transport (from equator to 12 N). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} BaSO 4 {{additions}} on the wetting of alumina by molten aluminum were studied by the sessile drop technique. To study {{the effect of}} BaSO 4 decomposition (1100 – 1150 ∘C), the additions were treated at two temperatures 700 ∘C (973 [*]K) and 1450 ∘C (1723 [*]K), respectively. BaSO 4 additions at low and high temperatures did not improve the nonwetting character of these compositions. However, at higher firing temperature, the formation of BA 6 [*](BaO• 6 Al 2 O 3) has a nonwetting trend with increasing its content. To address the BA 6 specifically a pure BaO• 6 Al 2 O 3 was produced and tested. It was more nonwetting than the pure alumina. After {{the analysis of the}} contact angles for the BaSO 4 and the BA 6 [*](BaO• 6 Al 2 O 3), it was concluded that these additions to alumina do not inhibit wetting by molten aluminum. In fact, at the addition levels common for refractories, the <b>wetting</b> <b>tendency</b> of molten aluminum is enhanced.

40|$|The compatibilities {{of various}} monotectic alloy systems with several {{different}} crucible materials were evaluated. The study {{was carried out}} using small candidate alloy samples of compositions that produced fifty volume percent of each liquid phase at the monotectic temperature. Compatibility {{was based on the}} evaluation of the <b>wetting</b> <b>tendency</b> of the two immiscible phases with the crucible material in a one-g solidified sample. Three types of wetting phenomena were observed during the evaluation. Type 1 indicates an alloy-crucible combination where the L 2 phase preferentially wets the crucible material. Since L 2 is usually the minority phase in desirable alloys, this material combination would be difficult to process and is therefore considered incompatible. Type 2 behavior indicates an alloy-crucible combination where the L 1 phase preferentially wets the crucible material. This type of combination is considered compatible since surface tension effects should aid in processing the alloy to a useful form. Type 3 indicates any combination that leads to major reactions between the alloy and crucible material, gas entrapment, or separation of the metal from the crucible wall. Additional compatibility evaluations would have to be carried out on combinations of this category. The five alloy systems studied included aluminum-bismuth, copper-lead, aluminum-indium, aluminum-lead and cadmium-gallium.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 07 As {{we reach}} the {{boundaries}} of sensing systems, we are increasingly building and deploying ubiquitous computing solutions that rely heavily on inference. This is a natural trend given that sensors have physical limitations in what they can actually sense. Often, {{there is also a}} strong desire for simple sensors to reduce cost and deployment burden. Examples include using low-cost accelerometers to track step count or sleep quality (Fitbit), using microphones for cough tracking [57] or fall detection [72], and using electrical noise and water pressure monitoring to track appliances’ water and electricity use [34]. A common thread runs across these systems: they rely on inference, hence their output has uncertainty—it has an associated error that researchers attempt to minimize—and this uncertainty is user-facing—it directly affects the quality of the user experience. As we push more of these sorts of sensing and prediction systems into our everyday day lives, we should ask: does the uncertainty in their output affect how people use and trust these systems? If so, how can we design them to be better? While existing literature suggests communicating uncertainty may affect trust, little evidence of this effect in real, deployed systems has been available. I wanted to start with the simplest, most ubiquitous sensing system I could think of to see if a failure to communicate uncertainty might affect trust or usage. I turned to the home weight scale, a sensing system that has been with us for at least 100 years, but which maintains at the moment of measurement about the simplest feedback interface possible: it just tells you your weight! I conducted a series of studies, starting with qualitative investigations into people’s understanding of uncertainty in weight scales, through a study of actual variability in scale measurements, to an online survey of attitudes towards scales from a large number of scale users. I found that many people judge their scales by their perceived uncertainty, but often confuse aspects of error like bias and variance when doing so. I found that people who {{have a better understanding of}} weight variability trust their scales more. I found that the scale does little to help people along in their understanding of error at the moment of weigh-in. The design of the scale is today causing problems with trust and abandonment. How can we design it better? To investigate how to communicate uncertainty effectively to people, I turned to another domain: realtime transit prediction. I wanted to understand how to communicate uncertainty in a way that people grasp more viscerally. I sought to develop a visualization of a continuous measure (time to arrival) that capitalizes on a frequency-based (or discrete) representation to improve people’s probabilistic estimates. I introduced a novel visualization technique, quantile dotplots, that capitalizes on both a discrete presentation of uncertainty and people’s fast-counting abilities (called subitizing) to improve the precision of their probabilistic estimates by about 15 %. If my work in weight scales asks what happens when we get it wrong, this work aims to build an understanding of how to get it right. Finally, effective design for user-facing uncertainty is not limited to the visual communication of uncertainty: it is not enough to slap an effective visualization on top of whatever model exists in a predictive system. In even conceptually simple prediction tasks—is it going to rain today?—people exhibit preferences for different types of errors. In precipitation prediction, this manifests as <b>wet</b> bias [82]—the <b>tendency</b> of weather forecasters to over-predict the probability of rain to reduce the chance that people do not prepare for rain and then blame the forecaster when they are rained on. Even an effective representation of uncertainty in this case might not be optimal if the model is not tuned to reflect people’s error preferences. I propose a method for systematically estimating people’s error preferences using a simple survey and a construct I call acceptability of error. This survey instrument connects classifier evaluation metrics with acceptability and intent to use through the Technology Acceptance Model, and conceptually helps assign costs in classification in accordance with people’s preferences for different types of errors. Through face validation of the instrument I found that it is sensitive to differences in people’s preferences induced by different types of user interfaces applied to the same problem. Effective design for user-facing uncertainty is only going to become more important. Someone today might abandon their weight scale, or bus tracking app, or weather forecaster due to too much perceived error. In the future, people will be abandoning smartphone and smartwatch apps for tracking blood sugar, or heartrate variability, or blood pressure. As we push more of these sorts of low-cost sensing and prediction applications into the world, we are introducing more estimates with more error into people’s lives (your smartwatch blood pressure will not be as good as a blood pressure cuff). My work aims to help us design systems that bring users’ understanding along into this new world...|$|R
3000|$|... is due {{to their}} {{adsorption}} on the rock surface, which forms a water-wet layer on it. Adsorption of a very active and energetic material on a solid surface can significantly alter the surface energy and wettability of the system [20]. Adsorption happens when the balance between the capillary force and viscous forces changes. The viscous force is decreased, whereas the capillary force increases. Therefore, the viscous force needed to overcome capillary forces are reduced [21]. The large surface area of nanoparticles can {{lead to an increase}} in the proportion of atoms {{on the surface of the}} particles, which results in an increase in surface energy with the ability to alter the wettability of the rock [22]. Mohammed and Babadagli [23] described wettability alteration from oil-wet to mix-wet and then to strongly water-wet condition by analysing the balance between capillary and gravitational forces. The shift in wettability from strong oil-wet to water-wet is because of two mechanisms. Firstly, from strong oil-wet to mix-wet and secondly from mixed-wet to strong water-wet [24]. The main factor in the first mechanism is gravitational forces, which change the balance of the wetting forces. And displaces the weight of the fluid from the bulk to the interface. Defined as capillary forces, by reducing the capillary forces, which leads to wettability alteration from strong oil-wet to mixed-wet [24]. Also, the component for oil/brine/rock such as oil/brine component, mineral surface, and system history condition may also control the <b>wetting</b> <b>tendency</b> [25].|$|E
40|$|The summary {{below is}} an update of our {{previous}} progress report of June, 2003. That previous progress report, which was submitted as a PDF document, is not recorded on the RIMS website but {{will appear on}} the EMSP website. Our recent results are in the following areas: (1) Single-component flow through a rough-walled fracture to validate our methods, we have simulated slow single-component fluid flow through a geometry taken from analogous laboratory experiments. The permeability of this fracture is studied as the direction of the driving force is changed. We find that the lattice-Boltzmann method agrees with the experimental data and with previous numerical efforts. Additionally, flow enhancement compared to the well-known cubic law is observed in certain directions, i. e., the direction in which channels are most strongly correlated. Conversely, flow inhibition is observed in the perpendicular direction. Fluid flow appears to follow the correlated channels. We are currently extending these studies to higher Reynolds numbers where classical approximations based on assumptions of slow creeping flow are no longer valid. (2) Capillary rise in simple and complex geometries Capillary rise is studied using the lattice-Boltzmann method. The geometries used are a circular tube, a rectangular tube, and a fracture between two rough walls. The capillary rise height and the shape of the interface is studied {{as a function of the}} size of the tube, the <b>wetting</b> <b>tendency</b> of the walls, the surface tension, and the magnitude of an applied body force. In performing this study we discovered a technical problem with the lattice-Boltzmann method: it exhibited lattice pinning. This pinning created two significant problems: the entrapment of small bubbles and a history dependence of the contact angle. We solved these problems by modifying our algorithm so that it now allows interfaces to move at a smaller velocity. The new method practically removes all effects of lattice pinning. For the case of rectangular tubes, we have shown that the shape of the interface follows theoretical predictions and that the pressure drop across the interface obeys Laplace's law. Consequently our improved method solves a significant problem encountered in lattice-Boltzmann simulations of drainage and imbibition. We are presently pursuing analogous studies in more complex geometries. (3) Macroscopic laws for two-component fluid flow through rough fractures. Macroscopic two-phase flow through porous media is commonly approximated by a generalization of Darcy's law, wherein ''relative permeability's'' represent the mobility of wetting and non-wetting fluids. We have recently begun studying the applicability of this approximation for two-phase flow through rough-walled fractures. We find that when the nonwetting fluid is unconnected it can become trapped in tight geometries. Once forcing exceeds a certain capillary threshold the non-wetting fluid starts to move again. This capillary threshold depends on the roughness of the fracture surface and the size of the fracture aperture. Further simulations are being performed to better specify these dependencies along with the relationship of relative permeability to fracture roughness. (4) Multiple relaxation-time lattice-Boltzmann method. We are exploring ways to use the lattice-Boltzmann method in a rectangular lattice with different spacing in one direction. This idea is motivated by the fact that self-affine fracture surfaces exhibit different scaling perpendicular to the plane of the fracture than they exhibit in the plane. Therefore, allowing different lattice spacing in the different directions should greatly increase the efficiency of our simulations. We also seek a practical way of solving a well-known problem that derives from using the ''bounce-back'' method to approximate no-slip boundary conditions. We are pursuing a new generalization of the ''multiple relaxation time generalized lattice-Boltzmann method'' and are in the process of implementing it. (5) Study of thermal fluctuations of fluid-fluid interfaces. We have included thermal fluctuations in our model. These fluctuations lead to a roughening of fluid-fluid interfaces. We have demonstrated that the roughening follows theoretical predictions. We are presently pursuing applications to the study of the formation and growth of capillary bridges in rough fractures...|$|E
