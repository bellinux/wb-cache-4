5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car battery), with a long <b>wire</b> <b>antenna</b> slung up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM transmitters were being built by more adventurous builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality cassette recorder, a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting {{from the roof of}} a fifteen storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary transmitters on the roof of tower blocks.|$|E
25|$|The antenna is an {{integral}} part of the tuned circuit and its reactance contributes to determining the circuit's resonant frequency. Antennas usually act as a capacitance, as antennas shorter than a quarter-wavelength have capacitive reactance. Many early crystal sets did not have a tuning capacitor, and relied instead on the capacitance inherent in the <b>wire</b> <b>antenna</b> (in addition to significant parasitic capacitance in the coil) to form the tuned circuit with the coil.|$|E
25|$|On August 27, {{they were}} finally ready. The theatre was showing the opera Parsifal by Richard Wagner. Susini and his {{coworkers}} {{had set up a}} 5W transmitter on the roof using a RS-5 Telefunken tube, operating in 350m, along with a <b>wire</b> <b>antenna</b> connected to the dome on top of a neighboring building. To pick up the sound in the theater, they used a microphone originally designed to aid people with hearing loss.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, all {{the three}} steps {{required}} for implementing the M 3 -approach are illustrated for bond <b>wire</b> <b>antennas.</b> First, a methodology for efficient and accurate electromagnetic modeling of bond <b>wire</b> <b>antennas,</b> based on parameterized {{models of the}} shape and length of bond wires, is developed. The resulting model is experimentally verified and applied to extensively study the RF performance of bond <b>wire</b> <b>antennas.</b> Based on these studies, reliable design measures are derived...|$|R
50|$|Often random <b>wire</b> <b>antennas</b> {{are also}} {{referred}} to as long-wire antenna. Long-wire antennas require a length greater than a quarter-wavelength (λ/4) or half(λ/2) of the radio waves (most consider a true long wire to be least one wavelength), whereas random <b>wire</b> <b>antennas</b> have no such constraint.|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{solution}} of an integral {{important in the}} analysis of <b>wire</b> <b>antennas</b> above ground is presented in detail.

Therefore, its exact analytical solution is preferred. 1...|$|R
25|$|A crystal radio receiver, {{also called}} a crystal set or cat's whisker receiver, {{is a very}} simple radio receiver, popular {{in the early days}} of radio. It needs no other power source but that {{received}} solely from the power of radio waves received by a <b>wire</b> <b>antenna.</b> It gets its name from its most important component, known as a crystal detector, originally made from a piece of crystalline mineral such as galena. This component is now called a diode.|$|E
25|$|The {{transmission}} {{continued for}} about three hours and was received as far as Santos in Brazil, where it {{was picked up by}} a ship's radio operator. The number of listeners was limited, since the crystal set radios used at the time were rare and difficult to operate, requiring tedious fine-tuning of a lead glass crystal and installation of a <b>wire</b> <b>antenna</b> several meters long. But the newspaper La Razón published a raving review, and even president Hipólito Yrigoyen commended Susini and his group for their accomplishment.|$|E

2500|$|With an {{appropriate}} <b>wire</b> <b>antenna,</b> the Tesla coil circuit could function {{as such a}} narrow-bandwidth radio transmitter. In his March 1893 St. Louis lecture, Tesla demonstrated a wireless system {{that was the first}} use of tuned circuits in radio, although he used it for wireless power transmission, not radio communication. A grounded spark-excited capacitor-tuned Tesla transformer attached to an elevated <b>wire</b> <b>antenna</b> transmitted radio waves, which were received across the room by a <b>wire</b> <b>antenna</b> attached to a receiver consisting of a second grounded resonant transformer tuned to the transmitter's frequency, which lighted a Geissler tube. This system, patented by Tesla on September 2, 1897, was the first use of the [...] "four-circuit" [...] concept later claimed by Guglielmo Marconi. However, Tesla was mainly interested in wireless power and never developed a practical radio communication system. He never believed that radio waves could be used for practical communication, instead clinging to an erroneous theory that radio communication was due to currents in the Earth.|$|E
2500|$|The station {{began with}} physics {{experiments}} in 1918 when five {{students and a}} professor built a small radio transmitter at St. Olaf College. Using a <b>wire</b> <b>antenna</b> strung between the campus chapel and the college's [...] "Old Main" [...] (the tallest nearby building), signals from these experiments were picked up {{as far away as}} New Zealand. Eventually, the college gained the call sign 9YAJ for the experimental station. Later, on May 6, 1922, the college was granted an AM radio license and the WCAL call sign. They would broadcast two programs per week during the school year at 770kc. in the AM band. One notable achievement by the station {{in the next few years}} was the broadcast of William Shakespeare's play As You Like It, apparently the first time a play had been broadcast on radio.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{improvements}} {{were studied}} but not applied. Simple ones included {{the introduction of}} track shoes with a chevron profile to improve grip. [...] Also it was originally considered to use blocks of sodium peroxide ("oxylithe") to remove the carbon monoxide, but this was rejected {{in view of the}} fire hazard. The first testing to equip a French tank with a radio set was carried out in the summer of 1917 with a Schneider CA, using a twelve-metre <b>wire</b> <b>antenna</b> with a range of [...] A second test with a fourteen-metre antenna on 18 August 1917 established that contact could be made with an aircraft within a distance of two kilometres provided that the tank was not moving, and it was decided to equip the command tanks of two units, AS 11 and AS 12, with an Émitteur 10ter radio set.|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents a}} simple and efficient technique {{for the analysis of}} moderately thick <b>wire</b> <b>antennas.</b> The formulation uses the integral equation technique combined with the rigorous free space kernel expressed in terms of spherical Hankel function harmonics. The integral equation is solved using a full symmetric Galerkin algorithm combined with linear basis functions. The singular terms in the kernel are treated with a novel numerical procedure specially developed for <b>wire</b> <b>antennas.</b> The advantage of the technique is that it treats the rigorous kernel without complex analytical formulations, hence providing generality to treat complex wire geometries. Results show that the new technique developed is efficient and very accurate even for moderately thick <b>wire</b> <b>antennas...</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{horizontally}} polarized {{radio waves}} work better for skywave propagation (due {{to the greater}} ground absorption of vertically polarized waves), antennas based on horizontal dipoles are typically used. The most common antennas in this band are <b>wire</b> <b>antennas</b> such as <b>wire</b> dipoles and the rhombic antenna; in the upper frequencies, multielement dipole antennas such as the Yagi, quad, and reflective array antennas.
