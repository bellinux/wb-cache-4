5|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been {{insignificant}} {{during the first half}} of the 19th century, showed growth from the 1860s up until 1930 that <b>was</b> <b>so</b> impressive that it was expected to eventually become the United States of South America. This impressive and sustained economic performance was driven by the export of agricultural goods.|$|E
5|$|During the 1932–33 season Gardiner {{began to}} develop a tonsil {{infection}} that drained his strength. While he initially kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were the deciding factor in the Black Hawks win and his performance <b>was</b> <b>so</b> good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> sick he would collapse on the dressing room floor in between periods with a fever of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital. This was the first notable symptom of Gardiner's health issues.|$|E

5|$|During the Gulf War of 1991, the {{air superiority}} of the {{coalition}} forces <b>was</b> <b>so</b> great {{that the majority of}} Iraqi Su-25s did not even manage to get airborne. On 25 January 1991, seven Iraqi Air Force Su-25s fled from Iraq and landed in Iran.|$|E
5|$|He {{was the top}} scorer in Ireland that year, with a {{total of}} 1–38, earning him the inaugural Footballer of the Year title.

5|$|In 1935 Rossen {{wrote and}} {{directed}} his first play,The Body Beautiful, a comedy about a naive burlesque dancer.

5|$|In {{fact the}} place of Sir John A. Macdonald in this country <b>was</b> <b>so</b> large and so {{absorbing}} that {{it is almost impossible}} to conceive that the politics of this country, the fate of this country, will continue without him. His loss overwhelms us.|$|E
5|$|In post-production, {{the visual}} effects were handled by Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs. The {{military}} aircraft they created <b>was</b> <b>so</b> realistic that the Indian Air Force called {{to check the}} producer's permission of using an actual MiG-21.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that Bede's work, because it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> widely copied, {{discouraged}} others from writing histories and may even {{have led to the}} disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.|$|E
5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> in love with my radio and my music. I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E

5|$|Marguerite Louise's extravagances perturbed Ferdinando {{because the}} Tuscan {{exchequer}} was nearly bankrupt; it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> empty {{that when the}} Wars of Castro mercenaries were paid for, the state {{could no longer afford}} to pay interest on government bonds.

In August 1663 Marguerite Louise delivered a boy: Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa in 1667 and Gian Gastone in 1671.|$|E
5|$|Scouting <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{important}} to Ford {{that his family}} asked that Scouts participate in his funeral. A few selected Scouts served as ushers inside the National Cathedral.
