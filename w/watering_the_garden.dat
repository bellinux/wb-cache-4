5000|$|The Persian {{rulers of}} the Middle Ages had {{elaborate}} water distribution systems and fountains in their palaces and gardens. Water was carried by a pipe into the palace from a source at a higher elevation. Once inside the palace or garden it came up through a small hole in a marble or stone ornament and poured into a basin or garden channels. The gardens of Pasargades had a system of canals which flowed from basin to basin, both <b>watering</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> and making a pleasant sound. The Persian engineers also used {{the principle of the}} syphon (called shotor-gelu in Persian, literally 'neck of the camel) to create fountains which spouted water or made it resemble a bubbling spring. The garden of Fin, near Kashan, used 171 spouts connected to pipes to create a fountain called the Howz-e jush, or [...] "boiling basin".|$|E
5000|$|The work of Australian {{educational}} philosopher Vicki L. Lee further elucidates {{and breaks}} down what is [...] "trans-dermal" [...] experience—how it works {{and why it}} matters—based on her work {{in the philosophy of}} cognitive science, educational philosophy, and radical behaviorism about which she has published extensively. This complex paradigm is clearly evidenced by Lee in this thickly described example: [...] Acts are more than movements. ...Our discriminations depend on movements and their contexts seen together-at-once or as an undifferentiated whole. In discriminating <b>watering</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> from hosing the driveway, we see the bodily movements and their occasion and results. We see the garden, the watering implement, and so forth, as much as we see the body's activities. The notion of together-at-once emphasizes that we do not see movements and contexts separately and then infer the action. Rather the context is internal to the action, because without the context, the action would not be the action it is.A basic presupposition of the philosophy of transactionalism is to always consider that that which is known about the world (extra-dermal) is [...] "directly concerned with the activity of the knower" [...] and not merely from some sense of [...] "skin-boundedness." [...] The known and the knower, as Dewey and Bentley examined in detail in their collaborative publication must always be considered [...] "'twin aspects of common fact." ...|$|E

The resources will also reveal the mechanics of how they work and demonstrate their impact on the environment, whilst in a safe, virtual setting. The Rainwater Harvesting resource focuses on the controlled collection of rainwater for the purposes of redistribution and use within a domestic household.

40|$|Water usage impacts the {{management}} of our water resources. It is believed that accurate information on the hydrological cycle disseminated to the public, will considerably alter consumer usage behaviour. Evapotranspiration {{is one of the}} most variable and sensitive of the hydrological components and it is imperative that we fully understand what environmental factors directly or indirectly affect evapotranspiration. The objective of this study was to confirm the indirect affect of clouds on evaporation by examining how clouds affect variables used by the Penman-Monteith equation. As expected, during the day or night it was found that clouds had a negative correlation with solar radiation and temperature, and a positive correlation with humidity all at the earth's surface. There was no significant relationship between wind speed and clouds except during the night. Correlation coefficients, with respect to cloud, for temperature and humidity varied only slightly from day to night, but interestingly wind speed showed a significant change from 0. 077 to 0. 264. These findings may suggest that there are some occasions when 'water-wise' activities, for example <b>watering</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> at night to decrease potential evaporation, may not be as beneficial as previously thought...|$|E

40|$|Designing of {{sustainable}} water systems should {{be aimed at}} reducing the consumption of tap water {{and the use of}} alternative water sources, such as rainwater and graywater. Therefore, the aim of the researches conducted was to determine the cost-effectiveness of the economic exploitation of rainwater utilization system in single-family house. As a tool for the analysis, the methodology Life Cycle Cost was used. It provides a comparison of different investment options and the opportunity to choose the one that is characterized by the lowest costs over the entire period of exploitation of the object. The research was conducted for four installation variants: the traditional solution and a solution in which rainwater was used for flushing toilets, washing and <b>watering</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden.</b> Variable parameters for calculations applied in the model were, among other things, different number of occupants and different length of exploitation of the installations. Additionally, the study included co-financing for the initial investment, which could be an incentive for residents to undertake this type of installation. The analysis conducted has shown that the systems with the use of rainwater enable significant reductions in the consumption of drinking water, while the variant with the traditional system was a most cost-effective solution only in few cases...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of current {{household}} water use is important for forecasting future demand and for designing effective water efficiency interventions. This paper argues that to develop this understanding further {{it is necessary to}} shift away from the current focus on sociodemographic characteristics as predictors of litres used towards the everyday practices of household members through which water is consumed, i. e. routine and often habitual activities such as <b>watering</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> showering and clothes washing. It presents selected results from a survey of water using practices undertaken in southern England in 2011, focusing on garden watering as an example which demonstrates some of the added understanding that such a “practices approach” brings to how water is being used. These serve to illustrate that how individuals water the garden varies, often with little relationship to their sociodemographic characteristics. Further results demonstrate too that how individuals perform different practices varies with little relationship between the practices, so that even a set of households with similar levels of daily per capita water use can be using it in widely different ways. We end with some examples of how this understanding could help in demand forecasting and in designing more effective approaches to interventions...|$|E
40|$|Water {{is a very}} {{important}}, if not {{the most}} important natural resource. We cannot imagine life without it, still we are at the point where we have to find new solutions for saving, exploitation and reuse of water. Closing the tap while brushing our teeth simply just isn't good enough any more. Water conservation is a big challenge and is especially important in areas where water supply and sewage systems are not installed so the water has to be provided in an alternative way. Therefore problems with water supply often occur in remote areas, islands, mountain huts. On the Croatian island Silba saving water is something very common. Most houses have a system for collecting rainwater, but that is often not enough, since the water usage well exceeds the size of simple water tanks. We set out to find the optimal solution for improving water conservation and reuse in a summer house. It is our opinion that the most comprehensive solution which would also make a positive impact on nature would be to build a constructed wetland. In vicinity of the house there is enough space for the installation, furthermore maintenance costs are low and treated wastewater could be reused for flushing the toilet and <b>watering</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden...</b>|$|E
