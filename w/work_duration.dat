According to the 2014 ACS, the average commute time for adults in the United States was 26.8 minutes. The occupations with the longest commutes were Construction and Mining (33.4 minutes), Computer Science and Math (31.8), and Business Operations Specialists (30.2), while those in the military had the shortest commute (21). In general, urban and suburban workers in the US have similar commute times (about 30 minutes), while rural workers have significantly shorter commutes (22.6 minutes).

5000|$|The basic {{purpose of}} the thermal work limit index is to {{calculate}} the maximum metabolic rate, in watts of metabolic heat per square meter of body surface area, that can be continuously expended in a particular thermal environment, {{in order to keep}} the body within safe physiological limits. The TWL is an integrated measure of the dry bulb, wet bulb, wind speed and radiant heat. From these variables, and taking into consideration the type of clothing worn and acclimatization state of the worker, the TWL predicts the maximum level of work that can be carried out in a given environment, without workers exceeding a safe core body temperature [...] and sweat rate. In excessively hot conditions, the index can also determine the safe <b>work</b> <b>duration,</b> thus providing guidelines for work/rest cycling. Sweat rates are also calculated, so the level of fluid replacement necessary to avoid dehydration can be established.The thermal work limit algorithm builds on work originated by Mitchell and Whillier, who developed an index “specific cooling power,” which subsequently became known as “air cooling power” (ACP).|$|E

50|$|To {{allow the}} {{consultation}} of the deposited works {{and to establish}} the database necessary for the distribution of information, the library proposes to centralize the published and unpublished works of contemporary music (from the twentieth century on) and their recordings. The deposit of scores and recordings {{is open to all}} composers, without aesthetic bias, to the exclusion of pieces solely dedicated to education. The library regularly stimulates composers and publishers in depositing their works, emphasizing the promotional importance of such a deposit. In an effort of multi-centralization, of creating various consultation sites, for a few years composers and publishers were asked to submit several copies of each score. Cooperation talks were underway with the Lincoln Center, and the effort was carried out {{in the form of a}} second center in Slovenia from 1975 to 1985 (the idea was revived in 1999, then abandoned). For each submitted work, an index card was established and printed numerously. To allow multiple filing of each index card, the database for each deposited score contained the following information: name and surname of the composer, year and country of birth as well as nationality, title of the <b>work,</b> <b>duration,</b> year of composition, instrumentation (nomenclature), possibly the publisher and the year of publication. Subsequently the data appeared in printed directories, and was eventually entered on the site of the Médiathèque Hector Berlioz. In addition, a biographical file is opened for each composer and made accessible. All information often not being specified in the scores, one of the major tasks of the association is to obtain all the data needed to establish an entry.|$|E

40|$|Military {{activities}} in hot environments pose 2 competing demands: {{the requirement to}} perform realistic training to develop operational capability with the necessity to protect armed forces personnel against heat-related illness. To ascertain whether <b>work</b> <b>duration</b> limits for protection against heat-related illness restrict military activities, {{this study examined the}} heat strain and risks of heat-related illness when conducting a military activity above the prescribed <b>work</b> <b>duration</b> limits. Thirty-seven soldiers conducted a march (10 km; ∼ 5. 5 km h− 1) carrying 41. 8 ± 3. 6 kg of equipment in 23. 1 ± 1. 8 °C wet-bulb globe temperature. Body core temperature was recorded throughout and upon completion, or withdrawal, participants rated their severity of heat-related symptoms. Twenty-three soldiers completed the march in 107 ± 6. 4 min (Completers); 9 were symptomatic for heat exhaustion, withdrawing after 71. 6 ± 10. 1 min (Symptomatic); and five were removed for body core temperature above 39. 0 °C (Hyperthermic) after 58. 4 ± 4. 5 min. Body core temperature was significantly higher in the Hyperthermic (39. 03 ± 0. 26 °C), than Symptomatic (38. 34 ± 0. 44 °C; P = 0. 007) and Completers (37. 94 ± 0. 37 °C; P< 0. 001) after 50 min. Heat-related symptom severity was significantly higher among Symptomatic (28. 4 ± 11. 8) compared to Completers (15. 0 ± 9. 8, P = 0. 006) and Hyperthermic (13. 0 ± 9. 6, P = 0. 029).

40|$|AbstractOccupational {{exposure}} to silica and cigarette smoking {{could lead to}} slow and progressive renal injury. Assessment of renal injury based on the concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (S. cr) or total urinary protein (U. TP) is insensitive in detecting early kidney injury. Urinary biomarkers {{which could be used}} to detect nephrotoxicity at early stages and defects on various parts of the nephron include: the proteins albumin, al-microglobulin (U. a 1 M) and retinol binding protein (U. RBP; the enzymes leucine aminopeptidase (U. LAP), N-acetyl-R-Dglucosaminidase (U. NAG) and glutathione-S-transferase (U. GST). Animal studies have identified enzymes alkaline phosphatase (U. ALP) and y-glutamyltransferase (U. y-GT) and lactate dehydrogenase (U. LDH) as potential urinary biomarkers of renal injury. The nephrotoxic effects caused by silica exposure have been studied elsewhere but the effect of silica exposure on the urinary excretion of microalbumin (U. Malb), total protein (U. TP), alkaline phosphatase (U. ALP), y-glutamyltransferase (U. y-GT), and lactate dehydrogenase (U. LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (U. AST) and alanine aminotransferase (U. ALT) has not been studied in Kenyan human subjects. The present study investigated early signs of renal injury due to silica exposure and smoking by measuring urinary indicators of nephrotoxicity and the association of this excretion to <b>work</b> <b>duration.</b> The study subjects comprised 37 silica exposed male and 25 silica exposed female industrial workers and 46 male and 14 female referents. Both male and female subjects for the silica exposed and referents were subdivided into those with <b>work</b> <b>duration</b> of less than or more than ten years and into smokers and non-smokers. Glomerular function was studied by determining the urinary levels of microalbumin (U. Malb), while proximal tubular structural integrity was studied by determining the activities of alkaline phosphatase (U. ALP), yglutamyltransferase (U. y-GT), lactate dehydrogenase (U. LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (U-ALT) and alanine aminotransferase (U. AST). In addition, the levels of urinary silicon (U. Si) and creatinine (U. cr) were also measured. Compared with the: referent non-smoking males, non-smoking silica exposed males excreted significantly increased levels of U. TP, U. Malb, U. ALP, U. y-GT and U. LDH; referent smoking males, smoking silica exposed males excreted significantly increased levels of U. TP, U. Malb, and U. LDH. Silica exposed males with <b>work</b> <b>duration</b> of less than ten years had significantly reduced U. y-GT compared to those with <b>work</b> <b>duration</b> of more than ten years. Compared with the: referent non-smoking females, non-smoking silica exposed females excreted significantly increased U. Malb and non-significantly increased U. ALP and significantly decreased U. Si. Silica exposed females with <b>work</b> <b>duration</b> of less than ten years had a significantly reduced U. TP, U. Malb, U. ALP, U. y-GT, and U. LDH compared to those with <b>work</b> <b>duration</b> of more than ten years. Among the silica exposed males with <b>work</b> <b>duration</b> of less than ten years, U. TP was negatively correlated. The present study confirms: that silica exposure may lead to nephrotoxicity; that smoking has also a nephrotoxic effect on the kidney and is synergistic to nephrotoxicity of silica exposure; that the elevation of some of the measured urinary parameters in silica exposed male workers is not associated with work duration; that urinary excretion of U. TP, U. Malb, U. ALP, U. y-GT and U. LDH could be useful biomarkers for glomerular function and proximal tubular injury; and that U. AST and U. ALT may not be relevant in the diagnosis of renal injury. Kenyatta Universit...|$|E

Materials and Methods: 206 subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. Demographic properties, working conditions, NP and LBP frequency in several positions have been recorded. Subjects were assessed by Visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 - 10) pain scores, Neck Pain Disability Index (NPDI) and Roland-Morris LBP Questionnaire (RMQ). The relationship between working conditions and assessed parameters has been analyzed by Spearman correlation coefficient (0 <r< 1). Comparison between age groups (age below and above 25 yrs) were assessed by Student T test, Mann Whitney U test and chi-square test. Comparison among specialization groups were assessed by Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis and chi-square test. Results: Mean age of the subjects was 23. 5 ± 5. 0 (57 % female).
