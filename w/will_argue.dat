5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E
25|$|Driscoll {{adheres to}} Reformed or Calvinist theology, {{although}} he characterizes his position specifically as New Calvinism to differentiate {{himself from the}} more cessationist and non-missional aspects associated historically with Calvinism. Driscoll denies the orthodox Calvinist view of limited atonement and believes instead that Jesus died for all people in some sense, and for some people (the elect) in another sense. He thinks this position was what John Calvin believed, saying in a humorous tone: 'Calvinism came after Calvin... I <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> that the Calvinists are not very Calvin. I <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> against Calvinism with Calvin... What kind of Calvinist are you? I'm a Calvin, not a Calvinist, that came later'. Driscoll also believes that this position (or slight variations thereof) was held by men like Charles Spurgeon, John Bunyan, Martin Luther, and Richard Baxter.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{controversial}} and well-known of the psychological effects trauma can have on patients is repressed memory. [...] The theory/reality of repressed memory is the idea that an event is so traumatic, that the memory was not forgotten in the traditional sense, or kept secret in shame or fear, but removed from the conscious mind, still present in the long-term memory but hidden from the patient's knowledge. [...] Sigmund Freud originated the concept of repression and it has developed and changed since his original work. [...] In the eyes of critics of repressed memory, it is synonymous with false memory; however its proponents <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> that these people truly did have traumatic experiences.|$|E
2500|$|Pro-fly: This {{style of}} play {{is derived from the}} {{butterfly}} {{style of play}}, although most <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> that this {{is nothing more than a}} marketing term. Current leg pad design allows for the full face of the pad to be perpendicular to the ice, maximizing blocking area. This is also called [...] "flaring the pad", almost all modern goaltenders play this style. The stance is very wide and low to maximize the amount of body blocking the net. Many of today's great goaltenders have adopted this technique. This forces the shooter to get the puck off the ice to score. The con of this stance is that it is very hard to move quickly. The more efficient users of this style include Henrik Lundqvist of the New York Rangers, Jonathan Quick of the Los Angeles Kings, and Roberto Luongo of the Florida Panthers. This is still considered a butterfly motion, as the mechanics of making the save are the same, however it is the design of the leg pad that achieves this rotation more than anything.|$|E

2500|$|The fertile octogenarian is {{a fictitious}} {{character}} {{that comes up}} when applying the rule against perpetuities. The rule presumes that anyone, even an octogenarian (i.e., someone between 80 and 90 years of age) can parent a child, regardless of sex or health. [...] For instance, suppose that a will devises {{a piece of land}} known as Blackacre [...] "to A for her life, and then to the first of A's children to reach 25 years of age." [...] A is, at the time the will is probated, an 85-year-old woman. In applying the rule against perpetuities, an imaginative lawyer <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> (and a court must accept under the common law rule itself) that A could have a child in her 86th year and then in her 87th year all of A's other children could die, then in her 88th year A herself could die. [...] Because the interest will not vest until her new child reaches 25 years of age, which cannot happen until more than 21 years after A and her other children (together who form the [...] "lives in being" [...] to which the rule refers) have all died, the rule against perpetuities makes the entire gift [...] "to the first of A's children to reach 25 years of age" [...] void. [...] A will hold Blackacre for life, and then the property will revert to the person whose will transferred it to A in the first place. (Actually, it will go to that person's estate, since the will was probated only after his death.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{academic}} {{criticism of}} the book has sought to appropriate it {{one way or the}} other; critics like Bernard Benstock, who argued that O'Brien's embrace of myth and refusal of realism [...] "ensnare him with the second rank", have been in the minority. Vivian Mercier described it in The Irish Comic Tradition as [...] "the most fantastic novel written by an Irishman in the twentieth century– with the doubtful exception of Finnegans Wake." [...] Rüdiger Imhof has noted how works by B.S. Johnson, Gilbert Sorrentino, Alasdair Gray and John Fowles carry explicit references to At Swim-Two-Birds. Michael Cronin draws attention to the metafictional and game-playing elements of the book, comparing it to the fictions of Raymond Queneau, and responds to criticism that the book is insufficiently respectful of realist conventions:Contrary to what Benstock argues, what post-independence Ireland needed was not less but more of the type of playful, self-aware writing being proposed by Flann O'Brien in At Swim-Two-Birds.... We would all be very much poorer without Mad O'Brien's narrative chessmen.Keith Hopper has argued that, contrary to the common tendency to favour At Swim-Two-Birds as [...] "the primary defining text of the O'Brien oeuvre", the novel is in fact less, not more, experimental than O'Brien's second novel, the posthumously published The Third Policeman:At Swim-Two-Birds is best considered as a late-modernist, transitional text which critiques both realism and modernism in an openly deconstructive manner, and in the process comes to the brink of an exciting new aesthetic. I <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> that the metafictional techniques developed publicly in ... are imbricated and embedded within the texture of The Third Policeman.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{theme parks}} did evolve from more {{traditional}} amusement park enterprises, such as Knott's Berry Farm. In the 1920s, Walter Knott {{and his family}} sold berries from a roadside stand, which grew to include a restaurant serving fried chicken dinners. Within a few years, lines outside the restaurant were often several hours long. To entertain the waiting crowds, Walter Knott built a Ghost Town in 1940, using buildings relocated from real old west towns such as the Calico, California ghost town and Prescott, Arizona. In 1968, the Knott family fenced the farm, charged admission for the first time, and Knott's Berry Farm officially became an amusement park. Because of its long history, Knott's Berry Farm currently claims to be [...] "America's First Theme Park." [...] Knott's Berry Farm is now owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Lake Compounce in Bristol, Connecticut may be the true oldest continuously operating amusement park in the United States, open since 1846. Santa Claus Town, which opened in Santa Claus, Indiana in 1935 and included Santa's Candy Castle and other Santa Claus-themed attractions, is considered the first themed attraction in the United States: a precursor to the modern day theme park. Santa Claus Land (renamed Holiday World in 1984) opened in 1946 in Santa Claus, Indiana and many people <b>will</b> <b>argue</b> {{that it was the}} first true Theme Park despite Knott's history. In the 1950s the Herschend family took over operation of the tourist attraction, Marvel Cave near Branson, Missouri. Over the next decade they modernized the cave, which led to large numbers of people waiting to take the tour. The Herschend family opened a recreation of the old mining town that once existed atop Marvel Cave. The small village eventually became the theme park, Silver Dollar City. The park is still owned and operated by the Herschends and the family has several other parks including Dollywood, Celebration City and Wild Adventures.|$|E
