Founding a Wiccan group known as the Bricket Wood coven, he introduced a string of High Priestesses into the religion, including Doreen Valiente, Lois Bourne, Patricia Crowther and Eleanor Bone, through which the Gardnerian community spread throughout Britain and subsequently into Australia and the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Involved for a time with Cecil Williamson, Gardner also became director of the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft on the Isle of Man, which he ran until his death.|$|E
25|$|Reunified China's Tang Dynasty (618–907) {{high culture}} set {{a high point}} for many things, {{including}} poetry. Various schools of Buddhism (a religion from India) flourished as represented by the Chan (or Zen) beliefs of Wang Wei (701-761). His quatrains (jueju) describing natural scenes are world-famous examples of excellence, each couplet conventionally containing about two distinct images or thoughts per line. Tang poetry's big star is Li Bai (701-762) also pronounced and written as Li Bo, who worked in all major styles, both the more free old style verse (gutishi) {{as well as the}} tonally regulated new style verse (jintishi). Regardless of genre, Tang poets notably strove to perfect a style in which poetic subjects are exposed and evident, often without directly referring to the emotional thrust at hand. The poet Du Fu (712-770) excelled at regulated verse and use of the seven-character line, writing denser poems with more allusions as he aged, experiencing hardship and <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> A parade of great Tang poets also includes Chen Zi'ang (661-702), Wang Zhihuan (688-742), Meng Haoran (689-740), Bai Juyi (772-846), Li He (790-816), Du Mu (803-852), Wen Tingyun (812-870), (listed chronologically) and Li Shangyin (813-858), whose poetry delights in allusions that often remain obscure, and whose emphasis on the seven-character line also contributed to the emerging posthumous fame of Du Fu, now ranked alongside Li Bai. The distinctively different ci poetry form began its development during the Tang as Central Asian and other musical influences flowed through its cosmopolitan society.|$|E

It is also clear that St. Anne's lodge was extinct at the time of her <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Crocker’s leadership of this exclusively female Masonic lodge stands as an alternative to historical frameworks that emphasize the formal political exclusion and public silencing of women in the development of republican, liberal political practice in the West.|$|E

Ira Nadel says The Cantos is an epic, that is [...] "a poem including history", and that the [...] "historical figures lend referentiality to the text". It functions as a contemporary memoir, in which [...] "personal history [...] lyrical retrospection mingle"—most clearly represented in the Pisan Cantos. Michael Ingham sees in The Cantos an American tradition of experimental literature, <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "These works include everything but the kitchen sink, and then add the kitchen sink". In the 1960s William O'Connor described The Cantos as filled with [...] "cryptic and gnomic utterances, dirty jokes, obscenities of various sorts".|$|E

The car engine dies on the way back and they are forced to stop in the neighborhood of Little Ethiopia, where the three go into a restaurant serving Ethiopian food. Although initially averse to the exotic food, Marge is reminded that she wants to be a fun mom and therefore asks for the most authentic dish on the menu for her and her children. All three of them enjoy the food. At the restaurant, Marge, Bart, and Lisa bump into a group of foodies, who encourage them to start their own food blog, [...] "The Three Mouthketeers". The blog quickly becomes popular and the three spend much time together trying out new food and <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> This leaves Homer feeling left out and sad.|$|E
500|$|A New York Times story {{reporting}} on Disston's progress in 1883 stated that before Disston's purchase {{and the subsequent}} development, the only places worth seeing in Florida were Jacksonville and St. Augustine, with perhaps an overnight trip on the St. Johns River to Palatka; by 1883 tourist attractions had extended [...] south. More {{attention was paid to}} the St. Johns with the increasing population. Florida was portrayed as an exotic wonderland able to cure failing health with its water and citrus, and the region began to be highlighted in travel writings. To relieve his bronchitis, Ralph Waldo Emerson stayed briefly in St. Augustine, calling north Florida [...] "a grotesque region" [...] that was being swarmed by land speculators. Emerson poignantly disliked the public sale of slaves, adding to his overall distaste. Following the Civil War, however, famed author Harriet Beecher Stowe lived near Jacksonville and traveled up the St. Johns, <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> with affection: [...] "The entrance of the St. Johns from the ocean {{is one of the most}} singular and impressive passages of scenery that we ever passed through: in fine weather the sight is magnificent." [...] Her memoir Palmetto Leaves, published in 1873 as a series of her letters home, was very influential in luring northern residents to the state.|$|E

[...] Heaven said that it was a [...] "poignant and beautiful tribute" [...] to Allingham. [...] It has been called [...] "sombre yet supremely uplifting". The poem was also noticed in the United States. Jenna Krajeski, a writer for The New Yorker, described it as [...] "another strong at-bat", and said that the poem highlighted [...] "the power, but also the shortcomings, of poetry" [...] when writing about an [...] "imaginary, impossible event" [...] and also writing about <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The American poet John Lundberg said that the poem was a [...] "surprising success", adding that not only was it [...] "accessible" [...] and [...] "a fitting tribute to those who served in World War I," [...] but also [...] "simply a damn good poem with rich imagery, cinematic movement and poignant ending." [...] However, Christopher Howse, a writer for the Daily Telegraph, took a different view of the poem's merits, saying (under the title [...] "Carol Ann Duffy falls short of Henry Allingham") that Duffy's verse form was [...] "open, to the point of invisibility".|$|E
500|$|Despite Netflix {{confirming}} {{multiple times}} within the month {{that there was}} nothing they could do for the show to return, fans continued to heavily campaign for it. On June 29, 2017, the official social media accounts of the show posted a letter by Lana Wachowski which announced the release of a two-hour special targeting 2018. In her letter, Lana thanked the fans, writing that it's only thanks to their strong collective voice that this was made possible. She also acknowledged the logistics of the show have always been challenging for Netflix. While Netflix billed the special in their announcement as the series finale, Lana left open the future of Sense8 past the special's release, <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "if this experience has taught me anything, you NEVER know." [...] In August 2017, Sarandos said that at first Lana had rejected Netflix's offer of a two-hour special, as her preference was to continue with a new season. She eventually agreed to it, having been influenced by the fans asking for more. Later in August, porn site xHamster wrote an open letter to the Wachowskis, offering to produce the third season, and a few days later received a call from Lana to whom they proposed to be the distribution platform. Screen Rant has criticized the move as one of the many publicity stunts that porn companies set out to do to advertise themselves, while Inverse wrote the Wachowskis would never take their show to a platform that uses pejoratives to refer to transgender people.|$|E
500|$|Several more of Blair's {{former colleagues}} and {{political}} opponents also {{commented on the}} book. Former Conservative minister Norman Tebbit wrote in The Daily Telegraph, [...] "A Journey seems {{to be dominated by}} Blair's anxiety {{to be seen as a}} great political leader who changed his country for the better. In fact it is, as I suppose all such books are to some extent, entirely about justifying himself and blaming others." [...] However, Tebbit admitted he had not read the book at the time of <b>writing</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and based his opinion on media coverage. Writing in The Guardian, Alistair Darling, who was Chancellor under Gordon Brown, said that he [...] "read with wry amusement how Tony Blair felt after much agonising that he couldn't sack his Chancellor. History has a habit of repeating itself." [...] He concluded that the book was [...] "a good read and shows us what can be done when we have confidence, clarity and a clear sense of purpose: we can win and change the country for the better." [...] Labour Member of Parliament Tom Harris said that the book [...] "will be a reminder that opposition doesn't have to be permanent, and that great things can be accomplished by a Labour government, but only if we have a leader capable of appealing to voters beyond our own party's core." [...] Of Blair, he said, [...] "There are still many, many Labour Party members who remember Blair as an election-winning genius who, in office, was popular for an awful lot longer than he was unpopular." [...] Ed Miliband, then vying for the vacant position of Labour Party leader, said on the day of publication, [...] "I think it is time to move on from Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson and to move on from the New Labour establishment and that is the candidate that I am at this election who can best turn the page. I think frankly most members of the public will want us to turn the page." [...] He was elected as Leader of the Labour Party several weeks later.|$|E
