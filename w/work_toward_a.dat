5|$|On November 10, 2016, Curiel {{denied a}} request by Trump to delay the trial until after his inauguration as {{president}} of the United States of America. At the same time Curiel urged the parties in the lawsuits to <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> settlement, and both sides agreed to accept an offer from U.S. District Judge Jeffrey T. Miller to facilitate such talks.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, in July 1864, Saraiva's {{persistent}} diplomacy {{moved the}} Uruguayan government {{to agree to}} mediated talks including Edward Thornton (the British resident minister in Buenos Aires), Argentine foreign minister Rufino de Elizalde and Saraiva himself. Initially, the negotiations seemed promising, but soon bogged down. On 4 August, convinced that the government in Montevideo was unwilling to <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> settlement, a frustrated Saraiva delivered an ultimatum, which the Uruguayans rebuffed. On 10 August, Saraiva informed Aguirre that the Brazilian military commanders would receive orders to begin retaliation, marking {{the beginning of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Sledd {{taught at}} the Randolph-Macon Academy in Front Royal, Virginia, from 1894 to 1895, before {{returning}} to graduate school. He earned a second Master of Arts degree in Greek from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1896, and completed one year's additional graduate <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> doctoral degree. While he was at Harvard, he played for the Harvard Crimson baseball team, and he is remembered as one of Harvard's greatest athletes of the era; he was offered a professional baseball contract but turned it down. Several years later, during a break in his teaching career, Sledd completed his doctorate.|$|E

5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the argument that Article 23 legislation is constitutionally required, opponents to the government bill {{point out that the}} Basic Law does not set up a specific time for passage of the legislation, and that the Basic Law also constitutionally requires that the HK government <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> system of universal suffrage. Opponents argue that because both goals do not have time limits, {{there is no reason to}} implement Article 23 legislation before universal suffrage.|$|E
25|$|Verhofstadt {{was awarded}} the Vision for Europe Award in 2002 for his <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> more unified Europe. The {{economic}} situation gave him leeway to raise the lowest social alimonies and lowering taxation. After 2001, the economic situation worsened. The 'Aging Fund' or 'Silver Fund' was set up, {{in order to ensure}} the maintenance of pensions until 2030. But despite his efforts to boost the economy while attempting to maintain the social benefits system, unemployment rose, after previously falling during the second Dehaene cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Aspin {{served as}} an adviser to Clinton on defense matters during the 1992 presidential campaign. Given Clinton's lack of {{military}} experience, appointment of a prominent and respected defense expert to head The Pentagon seemed desirable. Because of his leadership position in the House, Aspin's views on defense issues were well known. He was skeptical about the Strategic Defense Initiative, and favored a smaller Navy, a cut in U.S. troops in Europe, and further reduction of military personnel strength. These positions, along with the assumption that Aspin would <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> substantial cut in the Defense budget, worried the military. Defense industry leaders applauded Aspin's selection because he favored maintaining a viable defense industrial base. Although questioned extensively, Aspin won easy confirmation in the Senate.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{chapter of}} this {{treatise}} includes an exposition {{of the method}} of least squares, a remarkable testimony to Laplace's command over the processes of analysis. In 1805 Legendre had published the method of least squares, making no attempt to tie it {{to the theory of}} probability. In 1809 Gauss had derived the normal distribution from the principle that the arithmetic mean of observations gives the most probable value for the quantity measured; then, turning this argument back upon itself, he showed that, if the errors of observation are normally distributed, the least squares estimates give the most probable values for the coefficients in regression situations. These two works seem to have spurred Laplace to complete <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> treatise on probability he had contemplated as early as 1783.|$|E
25|$|Wilkens and Rule both {{represented}} Seattle in the 1970 NBA All-Star Game, and Wilkens led the NBA {{in assists}} during the 1969–70 season. In June 1970 the NBA owners voted 13–4 to <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> merger with the ABA; SuperSonics owner Sam Schulman, {{a member of}} the ABA–NBA merger committee in 1970, was so ardently eager to merge the leagues that he publicly announced that if the NBA did not accept the merger agreement worked out with the ABA, he would move the SuperSonics from the NBA to the ABA. Schulman also threatened to move his soon-to-be ABA team to Los Angeles to compete directly with the Lakers. The Oscar Robertson suit delayed the merger, and the SuperSonics remained in Seattle. Early in the 1970–71 season, however, Rule tore his Achilles' tendon and was lost {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|In December 1993, Bongo won {{the first}} presidential {{election}} held under the new multi-party constitution, by a considerably narrower margin of around 51.4%. Opposition candidates refused to validate the election results. Serious civil disturbances led to an agreement {{between the government and}} opposition factions to <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> political settlement. These talks led to the Paris Accords in November 1994, under which several opposition figures were included in a government of national unity. This arrangement soon broke down, however, and the 1996 and 1997 legislative and municipal elections provided the backdrop for renewed partisan politics. The PDG won a landslide victory in the legislative election, but several major cities, including Libreville, elected opposition mayors during the 1997 local election. Bongo was eventually successful in consolidating power again, with most of the major opposition leaders being either co-opted by being given high-ranking posts in the government or bought off, ensuring his comfortable re-election in 1998.|$|E

25|$|This social trauma made itself {{manifest}} {{in many different}} ways. Some people were revolted by nationalism and what they believed it had caused, so they began to <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> more internationalist world through {{organizations such as the}} League of Nations. Pacifism became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only military strength could be relied upon for protection in a chaotic and inhumane world that did not respect hypothetical notions of civilization. Certainly a sense of disillusionment and cynicism became pronounced. Nihilism grew in popularity. Many people believed that the war heralded {{the end of the world}} as they had known it, including the collapse of capitalism and imperialism. Communist and socialist movements around the world drew strength from this theory, enjoying a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or particularly harshly affected by the war, such as central Europe, Russia and France.|$|E

500|$|With {{his victory}} in the 1952 {{president}}ial race, Dwight Eisenhower became the first Republican president in 20 years. The Republican party also held {{a majority in the}} House of Representatives and the Senate. After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that [...] "Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, a man who could get diverse factions to <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> common goal.... Leadership, he explained, meant patience and conciliation, not 'hitting people over the head.'" ...|$|E

In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The show's writers {{spent time}} researching local California {{politics}} and attending Los Angeles City Council meetings. Schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This confirmed his existing impression: [...] "I've been to some community meetings in my life, {{and it is}} often this feeling of utter sparseness. That nobody cares." [...] The depiction of public hearings in several Parks and Recreation episodes was inspired by this perspective, which was also {{the basis for the}} entire [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. Schur asked urban planners in Claremont, California, whether efforts to turn a construction pit into a park could realistically take several months or longer. They told him that was entirely plausible, and that they had recently broken ground on a park that had been in various planning stages for 18 years. Schur said the pit project was conceived as a device to bring all the characters together, which was partially inspired by the way various characters in The Wire were brought together to <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> common goal or project. The writers originally envisioned the pit becoming a park only in the series finale, although those plans were later changed and the pit was filled in during the second season.|$|E
500|$|Kanae {{wanted to}} revive the spirit of Edo-period ukiyo-e in his prints, and to this end in 1911 he founded the Tokyo Print Club to produce and {{distribute}} such prints. [...] He advertised for members in Hōsun, but after the magazine's demise most of the associated artists left Tokyo and the only member he could recruit was Hanjirō Sakamoto. [...] The pair began a series titled Sōga-butai sugata ("Stage Figure Sketches") of portraits of kabuki actors in the vein of the [...] genre of ukiyo-e. [...] The subjects were sketched from performances at the just-built Imperial Theatre and were captioned in French {{on the front and}} on the back in Japanese. [...] Though Kanae had announced that prints were to come from thirty-four theatre pieces only three sets of four prints—two by each artist in each set—appeared in June, July, and September that year. [...] The work represents a major turning point in his career as he turned away from the Western techniques that had defined his <b>work</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> more Japanese approach {{such as the use of}} flat areas of colour. [...] The prints failed to sell at first but began to find buyers only after he had left for France the following year. [...] As Kanae was away the printer was not able to issue a second printing to meet the demand.|$|E
