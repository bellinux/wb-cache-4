5|$|Nelson's former flagship, HMS Foudroyant, was moored {{alongside}} North Pier for an exhibition, but slipped {{anchor and}} was wrecked {{on the shore}} in a violent storm on 16 June 1897, damaging part of the jetty. The <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship broke up during December storms.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{footnote}} in {{the history}} of Lundy was the <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy battleship HMS Montagu. Steaming in heavy fog, she ran hard aground near Shutter Rock on the island's southwest corner at about 2:00a.m. on 30 May 1906. Thinking they were aground at Hartland Point on the English mainland, a landing party went ashore for help, only finding out where they were after encountering the lighthouse keeper at the island's north light.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, {{surveyors}} {{conducting a}} detailed preparatory survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea floor for the Neart Na Gaoithe offshore wind farm, published sonar images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two submarines, K-4 and K-17 sunk during the accident.|$|R
25|$|Spence states he has {{salvaged}} over $50,000,000 in valuable {{artifacts and}} has been responsible, through his archival research, for <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side-paddle-wheel steamers Republic and Central America from which over one billion dollars in treasure has been recovered.|$|R
5|$|In August 2015, {{members of}} the Dutch sport-diving club Duikteam Zeester dove on the <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mainz and {{retrieved}} a variety of prosaic artifacts, including a sextant and the engine telegraph. Their actions provoked criticism from German sources, who noted that the wreck was a war grave containing the remains of 89 crew members and thus should not be disturbed. The German Federal Police were investigating the incident.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2015, divers {{found the}} <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USNS Mission San Miguel (T-AO-129) within the monument. She had sunk there on October 8, 1957 {{when she ran}} aground on Maro Reef while running at full speed and in ballast. Researchers will map and study the wreck in situ.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gouldsboro was {{discovered}} when {{a section of}} riverbank collapsed in 2003 and the Army Corps of Engineers surveyed the area in 2004 to determine how best to stabilize the riverbank. There are no plans to raise the wreck, but the Corps of Engineers will preserve it in place.|$|E
500|$|The divers {{recovered}} <b>the</b> stern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keel and {{a portion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sternpost. <b>The</b> stern/keel section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> San Esteban {{is similar to}} other <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period, and contributes to a view of ship construction at the time. Experts have estimated that the ship was [...] long and displaced [...] The planks were [...] thick.|$|R

50|$|During the Tudor era (16th century) {{numerous}} adventurers from Britain {{attempted to}} colonise the region; many Scots settled in Antrim around this time. In 1588 the Antrim coast was <b>the</b> scene <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 24 <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Armada in Ireland. The Spanish vessel La Girona was wrecked off Lacana Point, Giant's Causeway in 1588 with <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> nearly 1,300 lives.|$|R
5|$|Animal remains {{have been}} found in the <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mary Rose. These include the skeletons of a rat, a frog and a dog. The dog, a mongrel between {{eighteen}} months and two years in age, was found near the hatch to the ship's carpenter's cabin and is thought to have been brought aboard as a ratter. Nine barrels {{have been found}} to contain bones of cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered and stored as ship's rations. In addition, the bones of pigs and fish, stored in baskets, have also been found.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century the area {{developed}} into a major saw-milling region, supplying the newly developing town of Dunedin with timber shipped from the ports of Waikawa and Fortrose. A -long jetty was built at Fortrose in 1875, although this has long since disappeared. Several shipwrecks occurred along the treacherous coastline during this period. Most notably, one of New Zealand's worst shipping disasters occurred here: the <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passenger-steamer Tararua, en route from Bluff to Port Chalmers, which foundered off Waipapa Point on 29 April 1881 {{with the loss of}} all but 20 of the 151 people aboard.|$|E
5|$|El Oriente resumed cargo {{service with}} the Morgan Line, and enjoyed a quiet career, {{typically}} sailing between New York and Galveston. One event of note occurred in February 1922 when El Oriente {{came upon the}} <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> schooner, Caldwell H. Colt, which had run aground on a reef near the Tortugas Light during a gale. When El Oriente came upon the hulk, only her captain remained alive, surviving without food or water for several days before his rescue. El Oriente continued on to Galveston and landed the man there.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to a new}} hotel {{opening on}} Amity Island, an {{enormous}} great white shark ambushes and kills two divers who are photographing the <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orca. A couple of days later, their camera is recovered, and the shark goes after a female water skier and speedboat driver, killing the skier, while the driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and flare gun, causing the boat to explode, which kills her and severely burns the shark's face.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} {{was the third}} attempt of Geoffrey's father, Fulk V, Count of Anjou, to build a political alliance with Normandy. He first espoused his daughter, Alice, to William Adelin, Henry I's heir. After William drowned in the <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> White Ship Fulk married another of his daughters, Sibylla, to William Clito, son of Henry I's older brother, Robert Curthose. Henry I had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to Normandy. Finally Fulk achieved his goal through the marriage of Geoffrey and Matilda. Fulk then passed his titles to Geoffrey and became King of Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mary Rose was rediscovered in 1971. It {{was raised}} in 1982 by the Mary Rose Trust, {{in one of the}} most complex and {{expensive}} projects in the history of maritime archaeology. The surviving section of the ship and thousands of recovered artefacts are of immeasurable value as a Tudor-era time capsule. The excavation and raising of the Mary Rose was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology, comparable in complexity and cost only to the raising of the Swedish 17th-century warship Vasa in 1961.|$|E
40|$|Mapping {{of natural}} and {{cultural}} marine heritage sites is substantial to national and regional inventories aiming to conservation and protection and <b>the</b> management <b>of</b> coastal and offshore resources.

5|$|The <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS Vina, a cargo steamer {{built in}} 1894, {{can be seen}} at low tide. In 1944, she was {{anchored}} offshore for use as an RAF target when a gale dragged her to her present location and sank her. After the war, some of the wreck was salvaged as scrap. The remains of the Vina are accessible at low tide, but visiting them is potentially hazardous as the wreck is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide. A warning sign on the wreck advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately.|$|E
5|$|As {{the ship}} was {{intended}} {{to function as a}} floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with victuals (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The casks used for storage on the Mary Rose have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the Tudor navy were given high priority, and their requirements set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time. As a miniature society at sea, the <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mary Rose held personal objects belonging to individual crew members. This included clothing, games, various items for spiritual or recreational use, and objects related to mundane everyday tasks such as personal hygiene, fishing, and sewing. The master carpenter's chest, for example, contained a backgammon set, a book, three plates, a sundial, and a tankard, goods suggesting he was relatively wealthy.|$|E
5|$|However, by the mid-1980s, {{reliability}} {{had become}} such a problem (even on the slower Harrisburg corridor) that trains of Metroliners were often towed by locomotives. On January 25, 1988, Amtrak began towing all Metroliner cars on the Keystone Service with AEM-7 locomotives rather than running them under their own power, although the cars had their pantographs up to power lighting and heating systems. A <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Washington-Boston Night Owl four days later in Chester, Pennsylvania took two AEM-7 locomotives out of commission, exacerbating a shortage of electric motive power available to Amtrak. On February 1, Amtrak converted all Keystone Service trains to diesel power and terminated them on the lower level of 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, as diesel-powered trains were not allowed in the tunnels to Suburban Station. The Metroliners continued {{to be used as}} coaches for several years before being replaced by Amfleet cars.|$|E

The couple were married in 1912 and went on to become hotelliers themselves, caring for Ruth's Hotel for over 60 years.|$|R
50|$|In 1859 Windeyer {{stood for}} the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Paddington and was {{defeated}} by 47 votes. He was, however, returned for the Lower Hunter at the same election. In 1860 he was returned for West Sydney, but afterwards resigned his seat on account <b>of</b> ill-health following <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City <b>of</b> Sydney on which he was returning from Melbourne in after winning a rifle match. In 1866 he was again elected for West Sydney defeating Sir John Robertson.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Battle <b>of</b> Isa Khel {{went down}} into German {{military}} {{history as the}} most bloody engagement German troops {{have been involved in}} since <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> World War II. During the months to follow 21 soldiers were awarded for exceptional bravery. Three Germans were awarded with the nation's highest award for valor; 14 Americans were awarded with the second-highest award. News images of sandal-clad Taliban warriors rejoicing on <b>the</b> scarred <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most modern German military technology had a strong effect on the German public.|$|R
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friends}} Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow {{coordinates}} that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of the Unicorn. Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find the <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unicorn. Although they recover various artefacts from it, they do not find the treasure. Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not {{to the location of}} the Unicorn, but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe, presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many films}} from the silent era, The Carpet from Bagdad was {{believed}} completely lost, but in 1982 an Oceaneering International diving expedition salvaged {{a number of}} artifacts from the <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RMS Lusitania, including one reel of film. With the assistance of BBC technical advisor Laurie Ward, the BFI National Archive was able to recover images from several feet of the film, sufficient to identify the title, but not to restore any of the film to projectable condition. Although there was a theater on the Lusitania, this print of The Carpet from Bagdad was probably being taken to London as a film distributor's preview, {{as was the case}} for several other films known to have been on board.|$|E
5|$|While {{mourning}} Roth, Lara accepts {{that the}} storms are not natural, but are somehow {{connected to the}} Sun Queen and designed to prevent anyone from leaving the island. She meets up with her friends (Reyes, Jonah, Alex, and Sam), who have evaded the Solarii long enough to secure a boat for escaping the island, provided {{that it can be}} repaired. They are joined by Whitman, who claims to have escaped, though Lara begins to suspect him of working with the cultists. Lara joins Alex in finding parts for the boat in the <b>wreck</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Endurance. She finds him injured and stuck under some rubble. They come under attack by the Solarii and Alex triggers an explosion, sacrificing himself so that Lara can escape with the tools.|$|E
50|$|Bellamy {{intended}} to loot <b>the</b> <b>wrecks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1715 Spanish treasure fleet, reportedly to impress <b>the</b> family <b>of</b> Mary Hallett, whose Cape Cod family disapproved of her marrying a poor sailor. In Boston he befriended 40-ish Newport silversmith Paulsgrave Williams whose age, wife and children, and well-to-do lineage {{made him an}} unlikely pirate. Together in early 1716 they traveled to the Caribbean with a few dozen treasure-hunters and searched the wrecks unsuccessfully. Despairing, they traded their canoes for small periaguas and turned to piracy.|$|R
50|$|Bermuda's {{settlement}} {{began in}} 1609, with <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flagship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Company, the Sea Venture. Although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{passengers and crew}} ultimately completed their voyage to Virginia, the archipelago was permanently settled from that point, and left in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Company. The first intentional settlers arrived in 1612, under the colony's first Governor, Richard Moore. A carpenter by trade, Moore ensured <b>the</b> long-term survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony by concentrating on building fortifications, including the first stone forts in the English New World, and developing St. George's Town.|$|R
50|$|He {{continued}} to write poetry, for children often, but {{was best known}} as a writer of adventure and detective novels for children. Many of these are historical novels based on <b>the</b> exploits <b>of</b> people such as Bartholomew Roberts and Twm Sion Cati. He published well over 50 books in total, including books for adults as well as children. Some of these are non-fiction titles, for example Ofnadwy Nos is an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrecking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Charter. Some of his books have been translated into English and a number have been adapted for television.|$|R
