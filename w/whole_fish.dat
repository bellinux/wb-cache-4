500|$|Among {{the most}} ancient and {{primitive}} sharks is Cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago, which has been found within Paleozoic strata in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. At that point in Earth's history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large, shallow ocean, which stretched across much of North America. Cladoselache was only about [...] long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws. Its teeth had several pointed cusps, which wore down from use. From {{the small number of}} teeth found together, it is most likely that Cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks. Its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic shortfin and longfin makos. The presence of <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> arranged tail-first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility.|$|E

I collected composite samples of sediment, detritus, aufwuchs, aquatic plants, invertebrates, and fishes from 2 river sites, 5 backwater lakes, and 2 seepage lakes. Selenium concentrations (μg/g, dry weight) were elevated in sediment (geometric mean = 0. 93, range = none detected (ND) to 4. 1); detritus (4. 50, 0. 4 - 27. 4); aufwuchs (4. 85, 2. 6 - 10. 2); Najas marina (5. 66, ND- 21. 0); Corbicula spp. (10. 54, 5. 8 - 26. 5); Procambarus clarkii (7. 70, 1. 5 - 35. 8); <b>whole</b> <b>fishes</b> (6. 70, 1. 6 - 17. 2); and fish fillets (9. 72, 5. 8 - 22. 6).

500|$|Fez {{began as}} a {{collaboration}} between Canadian indie developers Fish and Shawn McGrath. They worked on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game in which a 3D space was viewed from four 2D angles. Though their partnership broke down due to creative differences, the entirety of Fez design, story, and art descends from this game mechanic. Fish continued {{to work on the}} project in his spare time and solicited for a programmer on DeviantArt, where he found Renaud Bédard. Fez was first announced in July 2007 on The Independent Gaming Source. It was nominated for two awards at the 2008 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival (GDC IGF). When Fish's employer did not permit him time off to attend the awards, he quit. Fish later recalled this moment as [...] "when [...] became indie". The game won [...] "Excellence in Visual Art", and its presence created a surge of public interest in Fez that rode a concurrent swell of interest in indie game development as a <b>whole.</b> <b>Fish</b> received a Canadian government loan to open Polytron Corporation as a startup company and began full-time work on Fez. In July 2009, Polytron announced that Fez would launch in early 2010 as an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive. Development continued with an experimental spirit until the company ran out of money. Fish borrowed from friends and family to keep the company open and considered canceling the project before the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help. Fish felt that the Trapdoor partnership rescued the game.|$|E

2500|$|The {{ideology}} behind {{foie gras}} production {{is the ability}} that some waterfowl have to expand their esophagus and to gain weight, particularly in the liver, in preparation for migration. Unlike many birds, geese and ducks lack a crop. [...] In the wild, esophageal dilation allows them to swallow large foodstuffs, such as a <b>whole</b> <b>fish,</b> for later digestion. Wild geese may consume 300grams of protein and another 800grams of grasses per day. Farmed geese allowed to graze on carrots adapt to eating 100grams of protein, but may consume up to 2500grams of the carrots per day. [...] The increasing amount of feed given prior to force-feeding and during the force-feeding itself cause expansion of {{the lower part of}} the esophagus.|$|E

60|$|One day the <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> tribe {{came back}} very tired from a hunting expedition, and looked {{about for a}} nice, cool spot in which to pitch their camp.

So they made their fire to cook some food, right {{on the edge of a}} steep bank, which had a deep pool of water lying beneath it at the bottom. While the food was cooking they all stretched themselves lazily out under the tree, and were just dropping off to sleep when a big black cloud which they had never noticed spread over the sun, and heavy drops of rain began to fall, so that the fire was almost put out, and that, you know, is a very serious thing in savage countries where they have no matches, for it is very hard to light it again. To make matters worse, an icy wind began to blow, and the poor fishes were chilled right through their bodies.|$|E

60|$|The {{males of}} those fishes, which differ {{permanently}} in colour from the females, often become more brilliant, as I hear from Professor Agassiz and Dr. Günther, during the breeding-season. This is likewise {{the case with}} a multitude of fishes, the sexes of which at all other seasons of the year are identical in colour. The tench, roach, and perch may be given as instances. The male salmon at this season is “marked on the cheeks with orange-coloured stripes, which give it {{the appearance of a}} Labrus, and the body partakes of a golden-orange tinge. The females are dark in colour, and are commonly called black-fish.”[20] An analogous and even greater change takes place with the Salmo eriox or bull-trout; the males of the char (S. umbla) are likewise at this season rather brighter in colour than the females.[21] The colours of the pike (Esox reticulatus) of the United States, especially of the male, become, during the breeding-season, exceedingly intense, brilliant, and iridescent.[22] Another striking instance out of many is afforded by the male stickleback (Gasterosteus leiurus), which is described by Mr. Warington,[23] as being then “beautiful beyond description.” The back and eyes of the female are simply brown, and the belly white. The eyes of the male, on the other hand, are “of the most splendid green, having a metallic lustre like the green feathers of some humming-birds. The throat and belly are of a bright crimson, the back of an ashy-green, and the <b>whole</b> <b>fish</b> appears as though it were somewhat translucent and glowed with an internal incandescence.” After the breeding-season these colours all change, the throat and belly become of a paler red, the back more green, and the glowing tints subside.|$|E
60|$|One {{tropical}} species which adopts {{the tactics}} of hiding itself in the hard clay, the African mud-fish, is specially interesting to us human beings on two accounts--first, because, unlike almost all other kinds of fish, it possesses lungs as well as gills; and, secondly, because it forms an intermediate link between the true fish and the frogs or amphibians, and therefore stands in all probability in the direct line of human descent, being the living representative of one among our own remote and early ancestors. Scientific interest and filial piety ought alike to secure our attention for the African mud-fish. It lives its amphibious life among the rice-fields on the Nile, the Zambesi, and the Gambia, and is so greatly given to a terrestrial existence that its swim-bladder has become porous and cellular, {{so as to be}} modified into a pair of true and serviceable lungs. In fact, the lungs themselves in all the higher animals are merely the swim-bladders of fish, slightly altered so as to perform a new but closely allied office. The mud-fish is common enough in all the larger English aquariums, owing to a convenient habit in which it indulges, and which permits it to be readily conveyed to all parts of the globe on the same principle as the vans for furniture. When the dry season comes on and the rice-fields are reduced to banks of baking mud, the mud-fish retire to the bottom of their pools, where they form for themselves a sort of cocoon of hardened clay, lined with mucus, and with a hole at each end to admit the air; and in this snug retreat they remain torpid till the return of wet weather. As the fish usually reach a length of three or four feet, the cocoons are of course by no means easy to transport entire. Nevertheless the natives manage to dig them up <b>whole,</b> <b>fish</b> and all; and if the capsules are not broken, the unconscious inmates can be sent across by steamer to Europe with perfect safety. Their astonishment when they finally wake up after their long slumber, and find themselves inspecting the British public, as introduced to them by Mr. Farini, through a sheet of plate-glass, must be profound and interesting.|$|E
