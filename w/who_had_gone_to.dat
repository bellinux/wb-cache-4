5|$|When he {{was made}} aware of the new deal, Waylon was not sure if he should quit his gig at JD's. He then went to get the advice of his friend, RCA artist Willie Nelson, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> see one of Waylon's shows. When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and not to move to Nashville.|$|E
5|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a missing {{documentary}} film crew <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> the Amazon to film cannibal tribes. A rescue mission, led by the New York University anthropologist Harold Monroe, recovers the film crew's lost cans of film, which an American television station wishes to broadcast. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is appalled by the team's actions, and after learning their fate, he objects to the station's intent to air the documentary. The presentation of the crew's lost footage, functioning similarly to a flashback, revolutionized the found footage style of narrative filmmaking, later popularized by such films as The Blair Witch Project.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his public}} nonchalance, Seward was devastated by his {{convention}} loss, as were {{many of his}} supporters. The New Yorker was the best-known and most popular Republican, and his defeat shocked many in the North, who felt that Lincoln had been nominated through chicanery. Although Seward sent a letter stating Weed was not to blame, Seward's political manager took the defeat hard. Seward was initially inclined to retire from public life, but received many letters from supporters: distrustful of Lincoln, they urged Seward to remain involved in politics. On his way to Washington to return to Senate duties, he stopped in Albany to confer with Weed, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> Lincoln's home in Springfield, Illinois {{to meet with the}} candidate, and had been very impressed at Lincoln's political understanding. At the Capitol, Seward received sympathy even from sectional foes such as Jefferson Davis.|$|E

5|$|During {{protracted}} enquiries {{before the}} case {{went to court}} in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> sea as a boy and had last been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, {{he was charged with}} perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a criminal court jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> Bradford for the centenary festival {{formed the}} Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, the Society is {{independent}} from the Trust, but {{works closely with}} it. Its general objectives are the furtherance of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as a stimulus for young musicians to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of A Village Romeo and Juliet by Opera North, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Danny Gardella, who {{had left}} the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946, filed suit against Major League Baseball, {{claiming}} Chandler's ban on players {{who went to the}} Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood. Gardella demanded $100,000 in damages from the suspension, and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal antitrust laws. Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and Fred Martin, both of whom also played in Mexico. On June 2, 1949, a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials, but urged that the antitrust issues be adjudicated as soon as possible. Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball, Chandler lifted the bans on players <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> Mexico, reinstating them almost two years early. Lanier and Martin dropped their suits, but Gardella pursued his. After Gardella's lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball's antitrust exemption for {{a day and a half}} in September 1949, baseball executives, including Chandler, agreed to settle Gardella's case for $60,000.|$|E

5|$|Should {{the player}} choose {{to fulfill the}} promise, the protagonist begins her sophomore year at St. PigeoNation's largely as normal, but with one exception—she begins to have {{recurring}} dreams of her younger self and Ryouta, and her parents lying dead {{in front of an}} unfamiliar house. A mysterious man approaches them, promising to grant any wish that they make. On 2 September, she decides to check on Ryouta, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> the infirmary earlier that day; the next morning, she fails to show up for class. Kazuaki asks Ryouta to retrieve their class' box of print handouts, and upon retrieving it, blood is discovered leaking from a corner of the box. Ryouta opens the lid, and it is revealed that the box contains the protagonist's severed head. A siren sounds and there is an order to evacuate to the gymnasium, where Ryouta overhears other students mention that more pieces of a human corpse were found in the other print boxes. Doubting the headmaster's explanation of a natural disaster occurring, Sakuya and Ryouta resolve to figure out the identity of the protagonist's killer and leave the gymnasium, discovering a large metal dome surrounding the school. Upon returning to their classroom and finding the box empty, Yuuya explains that the protagonist's body had been gathered in the chemistry lab, where Shuu performs an autopsy concluding that the protagonist died of asphyxiation caused by illness or poison with the dismemberment occurring afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The French {{executed}} {{several attempts}} to retake the bridges. The 68th, under command of general Jean-Baptiste de Sisce, was repulsed three {{times by the}} superior numbers of Austrians and the fearsome fire of case shot from four cannons that lined the principal road. Not until 19:00 did fortune favor the French, when Colonel d'Aspré and two hundred men of the Regiment Ferdinand were captured within the fort itself. The next in command, a Major Delas, was badly wounded, leaving no one in overall command of the 38th Regiment. The French general Schauenburg, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> Strasbourg for troops, returned with some reinforcements, including part of the Strasbourg national guard, and led these troops over the pontoon bridges. They met at once an impetuous Austrian attack, but were sufficiently strong to recover. At 22:00, the Austrians still held the redoubt and the houses {{at the edge of}} the village; the arrival of a fresh battalion of the 12th Regiment led to a new attack, but it was repulsed. Ultimately, though, the Austrians had insufficient reserves to meet the fresh troops from Strasbourg. By 23:00, the French had recovered all of the Strasbourg suburbs, the village of Kehl and all of the French earthen works.|$|E
