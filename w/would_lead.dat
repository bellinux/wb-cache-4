5|$|A five issue mini-series followed, {{written by}} writer Kelly Sue DeConnick and artist Emma Rios. The mini-series <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> into a dual storyline {{running in the}} pages of New Avengers #17–24 and Avengers #18–24, in which the {{character}} formed {{a new version of the}} Dark Avengers and ultimately garnered new powers, having turned himself into a Super-Adaptoid.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of his}} favourites, Hazlitt places Cymbeline {{first in}} his discussions of Shakespeare's plays, {{according}} it extensive treatment. This includes his personal impressions of individual characters—as the book's title <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> us to expect—but also the kind of broader consideration for which {{he would not be}} credited for at least a century and a half.|$|E
5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{was first}} described by Northway in 1967, who outlined {{the conditions that}} <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> to the diagnosis. This was later expanded by Bancalari and in 1988 by Shennan, who suggested the need for supplemental oxygen at 36weeks could predict long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, Palta et al. in 1998 concluded that radiographic evidence was the most accurate predictor of long-term effects.|$|E

5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> to more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds. A complementing theory is that larger methane emissions from intensive farming activities produce more water vapour in the upper atmosphere.

5|$|Disagreement {{over who}} <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> the 10,000 Chetnik exiles in Italy {{escalated}} into a feud between Jevđević, Đujić and General Miodrag Damjanović in mid-1947. Damjanović {{had been appointed}} by Mihailović in March 1945 to lead the Chetniks into northwestern Italy. Jevđević and Đujić refused to accept this and claimed that they were Mihailović's only successors as leaders of the Chetnik movement.|$|E
5|$|During the postgame celebration, ABC {{commentator}} Jack Arute asked Dennis Franchione {{whether he}} would return to the team the following year. Coach Franchione responded by asking the announcer to let the players enjoy their victory.

5|$|Following a short illness, on {{the night}} of 14–15 June 1341 the emperor Andronikos III died at the {{relatively}} early age of 45, possibly due to chronic malaria. His nine-year-old son John (John V) was the obvious successor, but he had not been officially proclaimed or crowned as co-emperor. This left a legal vacuum, and raised the question of who <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> the Empire's government.|$|E
5|$|From 1589 Zamoyski, in {{his role}} as the hetman, tried to prevent the intensifying Tatar incursions along the Commonwealth {{south-eastern}} border, but with little success. In order to deal with the recurring disturbances in that region Zamoyski developed a plan to turn Moldavia into a buffer zone between the Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire; this <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> to a lengthy campaign.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{called his}} ideas Nai Talim (literally, 'new education'). He {{believed}} that the Western style education violated and destroyed the indigenous cultures. A different basic education model, he believed, <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> to better self awareness, prepare people to treat all work equally respectable and valued, and lead to a society with less social diseases.|$|E

5|$|He {{had also}} {{proposed}} to twin constituencies and have Members of Parliament (MPs) contest as a pair, {{one of whom}} had to be from a minority community. However, Malay MPs were upset that this implied they were not electable on their own merits. Feeling that the twinning of constituencies <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> to Malay MPs losing confidence and self-respect, the Government dropped the proposal.|$|E
5|$|He helped broker the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an {{international}} treaty designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was not ratified in the United States after a 95 to 0 {{vote in the}} Senate. The primary objections stemmed from the exemptions the treaty gave to China and India, whose industrial base and carbon footprint have grown rapidly, and fears that the exemptions <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> to further trade imbalances and offshoring arrangement with those countries.|$|E
5|$|His later {{writings}} show {{no change}} in his fundamental positions. Other elements in Zwingli's theology <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> him to deny that baptism {{is a means of}} grace or that it is necessary for salvation. His defence of infant baptism was not only a matter of church politics, but was clearly related to the whole of his theology and his profound sense of unity of the church.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, it {{was normal}} for a {{professional}} cyclist to hire pacers, who <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> them during the race. Desgrange forbade this: it was originally intended that in the final, longest, stage pacers would be allowed, but this was rescinded after the fifth stage.|$|E
