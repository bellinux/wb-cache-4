50|$|The ban on {{passengers}} {{using the}} top deck of trams on Crabble Hill was lifted in April 1919.

When the Council was told that it would cost £34,556 they immediately dropped the scheme. The purchase of three new trams was authorised, funded by a loan of £6,000 over fifteen years. Although negotiations were commenced in December 1920 to purchase land at Buckland for provision of <b>workshops,</b> <b>agreement</b> could not be reached and the scheme never got off the ground.

Based on previous work from the DfA@eInclusion project, the guidelines specify and recommend a curriculum for training ICT professionals in Universal Design. Main Content The process of initiating and developing a CWA are outlined. The final content of the standard is summarized. A survey of the Expert Committee members who oversaw its development on their views of the suitability of using a standards vehicle such as a CEN <b>Workshop</b> <b>Agreement</b> is also presented. Results The CWA process developed a high quality standards document that was consulted on widely with a wide range of stakeholders. The survey results showed that most respondents from the Expert Committee were very positively disposed towards the CWA.

40|$|An {{important}} step in building a computational model is its documentation; a comprehensive and structured documentation can improve the model applicability and transparency in science/research and for regulatory purposes. This is particularly crucial and challenging for environmental and/or human exposure models that aim to establish quantitative relationships between personal exposure levels and their determinants. Exposure models conceptually simulate the transport and fate of a contaminant from the source to the receptor and may then involve a large set of entities (e. g. all the environmental media the contaminants may pass though). Such complex models are difficult to be described in a comprehensive, unambiguous and accessible way. Bad communication of assumptions, theory, structure and/or parameterization can lead to lack of confidence by the user {{and it may be}} source of errors. The goal {{of this paper is to}} propose a standard documentation protocol (SDP) for exposure models, i. e. a generic format and a standard structure by which all exposure models could be documented. set up For this purpose, a CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) workshop was set up with objective to agree on minimum requirements for the amount and type of information to be provided on exposure models documentation along with guidelines for the structure and presentation of the information. The resulting CEN <b>workshop</b> <b>agreement</b> (CWA) was expected to facilitate a more rigorous formulation of exposure models description and the understanding by users. This paper intends to describe the process followed for defining the SDP, the standardisation approach, as well as the main components of the SDP resulting from a wide consultation of interested stakeholders.

Drag may be estimated thousands of times during a multidisciplinary design optimization, and computational fluid dynamics is not yet possible in these studies.

Its use for subsonic and transonic aircraft configurations is presented and validated. We present our parametric geometry definition, followed by the drag model description. The drag model includes induced, friction, wave, and interference drag. The model is compared with subsonic and transonic isolated wings, and a wing/body configuration used previously in drag prediction <b>workshops.</b> The <b>agreement</b> between the predictions of the drag model and test data is good, but lessens at high lift coefficients and high transonic Mach numbers.

They were exposed to a sickness provoking virtual rotating drum (210 degrees field-of-view) with striped patterns rotating at 60 degrees per second for 30 minutes (Phase 1). Sickness data were collected before, during, and after the exposure.

40|$|Abstract. In {{spite of}} many efforts {{directed}} to new technologies, the metal detector {{is still the}} main detection tool used in humanitarian landmine clearance. The most detailed proposal for a standard for testing metal detectors is the CEN <b>Workshop</b> <b>Agreement</b> 14747 : 2003.

The main purpose of the test procedures is the identification of the most appropriate device for certain conditions of application. The reliability of a detection system is influenced by the intrinsic physical capability of the method, the application factor and the human factor. The physical capabilities and some influences of application conditions can be evaluated in laboratory measurements, but the influence of the human factor and other environmental influences can be derived correctly from blind tests only, since they are conducted under field conditions. This paper discusses the design of the experiment for testing and evaluation of metal detectors based on the experiences gained from several field tests performed fro...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background We {{recently}} reported poor inter-observer agreement in identifying and quantifying individual ultrasonographic features of polycystic ovaries. Our {{objective was to}} determine the effect of a training workshop on reducing inter-observer variation in the ultrasonographic evaluation of polycystic ovaries. Methods Transvaginal ultrasound recordings from thirty women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were evaluated by three radiologists and three reproductive endocrinologists both before and after an ultrasound workshop. The following endpoints were assessed: 1) follicle number per ovary (FNPO), 2) follicle number per single cross-section (FNPS), 3) largest follicle diameter, 4) ovarian volume, 5) follicle distribution pattern and 6) presence of a corpus luteum (CL). Lin's concordance correlation coefficients (rho) and kappa statistics for multiple raters (kappa) were used to assess level of inter-observer agreement (> 0. 80 good, 0. 60 – 0. 80 moderate/fair, Results Following the <b>workshop,</b> inter-observer <b>agreement</b> improved for the evaluation of FNPS (rho = 0. 70, delta rho = + 0. 11), largest follicle diameter (rho = 0. 77, delta rho = + 0. 10), ovarian volume (rho = 0. 84, delta rho = + 0. 12), follicle distribution pattern (kappa = 0. 80, delta kappa = + 0. 21) and presence of a CL (kappa = 0. 87, delta kappa = + 0. 05). No improvement was evident for FNPO (rho = 0. 54, delta rho = - 0. 01). Both radiologists and reproductive endocrinologists demonstrated improvement in scores (p Conclusion Reliability in evaluating ultrasonographic features of polycystic ovaries can be significantly improved following participation in a training workshop.
