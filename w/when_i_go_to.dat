Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – and I always feel a lot <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Africa".|$|E

I meditate on the 'why?' of 'why people are as they are' and 'why bad things happen to good people,' and 'why good things happen to bad people'... The mystery is what I think is, almost, the grand unifying theory of all mankind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eleven {{days and}} a half gone and I have crossed three {{thousand}} miles of the perilous deep. Instead of a democratic government, I am under a monarchical government. Instead of the bright, blue sky of America, I am covered with the soft, grey fog of the Emerald Isle [...] I breathe, and lo! the chattel [...] becomes a man. I gaze around in vain for one who will question my equal humanity, claim me as his slave, or offer me an insult. I employ a cab—I am seated beside white people—I reach the hotel—I enter the same door—I am shown into the same parlour—I dine at the same table—and no one is offended... I find myself regarded and treated at every turn with the kindness and deference paid to white people. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church, I am met by no upturned nose and scornful lip to tell me, We don't allow niggers in here! ...|$|E

Melanio Moscoso, of La Higuera stated [...] "we pray to him, {{we are so}} proud he had died here, in La Higuera, fighting for us. We feel him so close", while Freddy Vallejos, of Vallegrande, proclaimed [...] "we have a faith, a confidence in Che. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed and when I wake up, I first pray to God and then I pray to Che – and then, everything is all right.

2500|$|The song title [...] "Yellow Ledbetter" [...] {{is derived}} from the actual name of an old friend of Vedder from Chicago, named Tim Ledbetter. Although many fans have made their own interpretations of the song, a common theory has been that the song is about someone {{receiving}} a letter and finding his or her brother had died overseas in war, cited from the lyrics in the Live at the Garden version [...] "I don't know whether my brother will be coming home in a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 5/3/03 - State College, Pennsylvania, Vedder sings [...] "I'd like to wish this war away, and I tried, but it just, just don't happen, don't happen that way/And my brother...they sent him off to fight for the flag. I just, I don't hope he comes home in a box or a bag", and [...] "And I know that he's just following his path. As long, as long as it's not a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 7/11/03 - Mansfield, Massachusetts, Vedder sings in the first verse [...] "I think of him <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed, and he's coming home in a box or a bag." [...] It's widely known that Vedder changes the lyrics of the song when singing it live, so it's difficult to know if what he's singing at the time are the original lyrics from 1991.|$|E
