5|$|Though Evers and Tinker {{were part}} {{of one of the most}} {{successful}} double-play combinations in baseball history, the two despised each other off of the field.

5|$|<b>Without</b> <b>speaking</b> {{directly}} of death, both verses {{indicate the}} absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.|$|E

He rejects all overtures of friendship from Claudius, then announces he has engaged a troupe of actors to perform a play that evening. Claudius and Gertrude leave, and the players enter. Hamlet asks them to mime the play The Murder of Gonzago and then sings a drinking song, playing the fool, so as not to arouse suspicion.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} Magyarization {{did not succeed}} in {{imposing}} the Hungarian language as the most used language in all territories in the Kingdom of Hungary. In fact the profoundly multinational character of historic Transylvania was reflected in the fact that during the fifty years of the dual monarchy, the spread of Hungarian as the second language remained limited. In 1880, 5.7% of the non-Hungarian population, or 109,190 people, claimed to have a knowledge of the Hungarian language; the proportion rose to 11% (183,508) in 1900, and to 15.2% (266,863) in 1910. These figures reveal the reality of a bygone era, one in which millions of people could conduct their lives <b>without</b> <b>speaking</b> the state's official language. The policies of Magyarization aimed to have a Hungarian language surname as a requirement for access to basic government services such as local administration, education, and justice.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Genie's {{stay the}} {{scientists}} saw how frequently and effectively {{she used her}} nonverbal skills, and never determined what she did to elicit such strong reactions from other people. David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed {{a father and a}} young boy carrying a toy firetruck <b>without</b> <b>speaking</b> to each other, and said the boy suddenly turned around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Curtiss also recalled one time when, while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she turned to see a woman stop at the intersection and exit her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not said anything. To take full advantage of her nonverbal communication abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn a form of sign language.|$|E

25|$|Placebo founders Brian Molko and Stefan Olsdal {{had both}} {{attended}} the American International School of Luxembourg, <b>without</b> <b>speaking</b> to each other, {{as they were}} part of different social circles. The two met by chance in 1994, in London, England. At the time, Olsdal was taking guitar lessons and was on his way home when he met Molko at the South Kensington tube station. Molko, observing that Olsdal had a guitar strapped to his back, invited Olsdal to watch him perform at a local gig. On the strength of Molko's performance, Olsdal decided that they should start a band. The two formed as Ashtray Heart, named after the Captain Beefheart song of the same name. Molko, however, denied in 2009 that Ashtray Heart was the first name of the band, dismissing this as a rumour and claiming that the band had more names initially.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, certain {{leaders of}} the Arya Samaj held {{discussion}} and debate with Ghulam Ahmad about the truthfulness of Islam {{and asked for a}} sign to prove that Islam was a living religion. In order to dedicate special prayers for this purpose and so as to seek further divine guidance, Ghulam Ahmad travelled to Hoshiarpur upon what he claimed was divine instruction. Here, he spent forty days in seclusion, a practice known as chilla-nashini. He travelled accompanied by three companions to the small two-storied house of one of his followers and was left alone in a room where his companions would bring him food and leave <b>without</b> <b>speaking</b> to him as he prayed and contemplated. He only left the house on Fridays and used an abandoned mosque for Jumu'ah (Friday prayers). It is during this period that he declared God had given him the glad tidings of an illustrious son.|$|E
25|$|Next, Surrey {{moved to}} block off the Scots' route north and so James {{was forced to}} move his army and {{artillery}} two miles to Branxton Hill. The Scottish artillery, as described by an English source, included five great curtals, two great culverins, four sakers, and six great serpentines. The King's secretary, Patrick Paniter {{was in charge of}} these cannon. When the armies were within three miles of each other Surrey sent the Rouge Croix pursuivant to James, who answered that he would wait till noon. At 11 o'clock, Thomas, Lord Howard's vanguard and artillery crossed the Twizel Bridge. (Pitscottie says the King would not allow the Scots artillery to fire on the vulnerable English during this manoeuvre.) The Scots army was in good order in five formations, after the Almain (German) manner. On Friday afternoon the Scots host descended <b>without</b> <b>speaking</b> any word to meet the English.|$|E

500|$|In the song, the woman's {{addiction}} and misdirected desire for transcendence {{are reflected in}} lines such as [...] "She runs through the streets / With her eyes painted red" [...] and [...] "She will suffer the needle chill".

[...] The title phrase is not used until {{the last line of}} the song.

McCain strategist Steve Schmidt called a meeting and demanded to know who let Palin talk to the fake Sarkozy without checking with senior advisors first. Steve Biegun, one of Palin's aides admitting to vetting the call <b>without</b> <b>speaking</b> to campaign advisors or the U.S. State Department, told the Los Angeles Times that [...] "No one's going to beat me up more than I beat myself up for setting up the governor like that." ...|$|E
