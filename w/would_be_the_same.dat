5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of direct election, the new Constitution was seen as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower house would be apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, {{while the number of}} representatives in the upper house <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> for all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach agreement, the delegates decided to leave this issue for further consideration later during the meeting.|$|E
5|$|Dreyer {{returned}} to France to begin casting and location scouting. At {{the time in}} France, {{there was a small}} movement of artistic independently financed films, including Luis Buñuel's L'Âge d'Or and Jean Cocteau's The Blood of a Poet which were both released in 1930. Through Valentine Hugo, Dreyer met Nicolas de Gunzburg, an aristocrat who agreed to finance Dreyer's next film in return for playing the lead role in it. Gunzberg had arguments with his family about becoming an actor, so he created the pseudonym Julian West, a name that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> in all three languages that the film was going to be shot in.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Daniel (1821), Chief Justice John Marshall {{recounted the}} history of tie-breaking methods on the circuit courts. If one judge or justice {{disagreed}} with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend, and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practiceas required by the Judiciary Act of 1793was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. After 1802, in cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions {{were less likely to be}} resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit-riding justice <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, {{according}} to Schück, the name Tunni {{which has no}} meaning in Old Norse should in Proto-Norse have been *Tunþa and derived from *Tunþuz. Consequently, it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> word as <b>the</b> Gothic Tunþus which meant [...] "tooth". This {{would mean that the}} name of Egil's enemy, actually meant [...] "tooth" [...] and Tunni and the bull/boar <b>would</b> consequently have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> enemy, i.e. Eofor.|$|R

5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war {{to be able to}} avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but to}} reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Scales {{like the}} Kibble balance also permit more {{flexibility}} in choosing materials with especially desirable properties for mass standards. For instance, Pt10Ir could continue to be used so that the specific gravity of newly produced mass standards <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as existing national primary and check standards (≈21.55g/ml). This would reduce the relative uncertainty when making mass comparisons in air. Alternatively, entirely different materials and constructions could be explored {{with the objective of}} producing mass standards with greater stability. For instance, osmium-iridium alloys could be investigated if platinum's propensity to absorb hydrogen (due to catalysis of VOCs and hydrocarbon-based cleaning solvents) and atmospheric mercury proved to be sources of instability. Also, vapor-deposited, protective ceramic coatings like nitrides could be investigated for their suitability to isolate these new alloys.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} of the planned University of New England {{extension}} program was to provide opportunities for people to obtain a university degree who could not easily travel to attend lectures, often because they lived in rural areas. At this time, most Australian universities were opposed to external degree programs because, among other reasons, they considered that they diluted academic standards and provided a sub-standard education. Madgwick felt that these potential issues could be overcome by careful administration and appropriate financial support from the government. In setting up the program, Madgwick directed that the program's instructors also participate in internal education and should be considered {{on a par with}} their internal colleagues. The examinations given to external students <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as those given to internal attendees. External students were required to attend some residential courses as part of their degree programs.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{began writing}} the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he {{scribbled}} down some rough ideas for later development, following {{a discussion with}} guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that {{it was he who}} conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark, author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> were Clark still alive.|$|E
5|$|Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the United States circuit {{courts were}} {{composed}} of a stationary United States district court judge and any two Supreme Court justices riding circuit. If one judge or justice disagreed with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend (as was authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1793), and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practice was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. Following a brief intermezzo with the soon-repealed Midnight Judges Act of 1801 (which briefly abolished circuit riding), under the Judiciary Act of 1802, the circuit courts were {{composed of a}} stationary district judge and one Supreme Court justice assigned to the circuit. But, a single judge (either the district judge or the circuit rider) could preside alone. In cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions {{were less likely to be}} resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit riding justice <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a meta-analysis of three sets of previous, independent protocol studies of student designers from different disciplines carrying out different design challenges. This analysis is used to confirm or deny three hypotheses about commonalities of cognitive behavior that are independent of domain and task. The previous protocol studies cover the domains of mechanical engineering and computer science. The design challenges cover three different mechanical design challenges and three different software design challenges. The meta-analysis tested the following three hypotheses describing cognitive behavior: 1. Quantitative cognitive measures describing “structure ” of <b>the</b> artifact <b>would</b> <b>be</b> statistically <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amongst <b>the</b> three groups; and 2. Quantitative cognitive measures describing “structure behavior ” of <b>the</b> artifact <b>would</b> <b>be</b> statistically <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amongst <b>the</b> three groups; and 3. Quantitative cognitive measures describing “expected behavior ” of <b>the</b> artifact <b>would</b> <b>be</b> statistically <b>the</b> <b>same</b> amongst <b>the</b> three groups. The meta-analysis used quantitative measures of the cumulative occurrence of the six design issues in the FBS ontology in these existing protocols as the foundation for the determination of commonality in testing the three hypotheses. Based on the evidence from these sets of protocols studies hypothesis 1 is fully supported, hypothesis 2 is partially supported and hypothesis 3 is not supported...|$|R
