In 1900, the island was struck by a devastating hurricane. Even post-Hurricane Katrina, this event holds the record as the United States' deadliest natural disaster.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the next}} {{two and a half}} hours, Cho {{returned}} to his room to rearm himself; he mailed a package to NBC News that contained pictures, digital video files and documents. At approximately 9:45a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to Norris Hall, a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and students, Cho committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to his temple. Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho by matching the fingerprints on the guns used in the shootings <b>with</b> <b>immigration</b> records. Before the shootings, Cho's only known connection to Norris Hall was as a student in the sociology class, which met in a classroom {{on the second floor of}} the building. Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the Norris Hall shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, forensic evidence confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents.|$|E

The region is one of the U.S. Census Bureau's nine regional divisions and the only multi-state region with clear, consistent boundaries.

25|$|The {{culture of}} Malaysia {{draws on the}} varied {{cultures}} of the different people of Malaysia.

Chinese and Indian cultural influences made their mark when trade began with those countries, and increased <b>with</b> <b>immigration</b> to Malaysia. Other cultures that heavily influenced that of Malaysia include Persian, Arabic, and British. The many different ethnicities that currently exist in Malaysia have their own unique and distinctive cultural identities, with some crossover.|$|E

25|$|The {{migration}} of the city's elite uptown increased concurrently with the mass European e{{migration of}} the middle 19th century. As immigrants settled the Battery, the location was less favorable to theater patrons and Castle Garden was closed. The structure was then made into the world's first immigration depot, processing millions of immigrants beginning in 1855, almost 40 years before its successor, Ellis Island, opened its doors. This period coincided <b>with</b> <b>immigration</b> waves resulting from Ireland's Great Famine and other pivotal European events. The structure then housed the New York Aquarium from 1896 to 1941, when it was threatened with destruction under transportation planner Robert Moses's plans.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian {{immigration}} to Iowa began in 1840 with settlement at Sugar Creek in southeastern Iowa, and continued <b>with</b> <b>immigration</b> to northern Iowa {{in the late}} 1840s.

The northern Iowa settlements extended from Allamakee and Clayton counties to Winnebago county, and came largely from settlements at Rock County, Wisconsin, Dane County, Wisconsin, and Boone County, Illinois. From the late 1850s through the 1880s, Norwegians pushed to the western portions of the state. By the early 1890s, Norwegian {{immigration to}} Iowa had dropped off.|$|E
25|$|Until the Second World War, Australia's {{status as}} a {{dominion}} of the British Empire in the then British Commonwealth meant its foreign relations were mostly defined by the United Kingdom.

The political and economic changes wrought by the Great Depression and Second World War, and {{the adoption of the}} 1931 Statute of Westminster, necessitated the establishment and expansion of Australian representation overseas, independent of the British Foreign Office. Australia began to establish its first overseas missions (outside London) in 1940, beginning with Washington, D.C., and now has a network of over 80 diplomatic (and 22 trade) posts.|$|E
