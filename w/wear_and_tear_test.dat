40|$|The paper investigates {{operational}} conditions of {{angular contact ball bearing}} МПЗ 6305 in automatic loaders and presents characteristics of its run-out due to usage conditions. An influence of vacuum plasma coating ZrN on bearing life characteristics {{has been researched}} in the paper. It has been established that an application of the mentioned coating significantly reduces the probability of bearing rolling elements corrosion, practically excludes their abrasive <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear.</b> <b>Test</b> investigations have made it possible to determine dependence of operational characteristics of strengthened bearings on coating thickness. </p...|$|E

Gas masks or respirators were used to minimise inhalation of the gas.|$|R

40|$|The {{peculiarity}} of {{the basic}} means of production, just as of all the instruments of labor, is that, {{taking part in the}} process of production during a lengthy period of time, they preserve their natural form up to the end of their productive life. Gradually they transfer their value to the newly manufactured produce, and consequently after each process of production their <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> increases <b>and</b> their remaining value decreases. The <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of basic means is not always proportional to their age, for it depends on the volume of work performed {{and a number of other}} facts. At the same time <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> {{of the basic}} means determines their efficiency, the time of their final quitting the ranks and the time for replacement. The data on the duration of <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> also are the basis for the determination of the norms of assignments for amortization and of the effectiveness of repairs, etc. All this shows the necessity of correctly calculating the <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> of the basic means and its great significance for the national economy. ...|$|R

The principles described by reliability engineering (bathtub curve) were used to describe the process of accumulation of <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear,</b> as a function of time. For the typical type of paper representative of ~ 70 – 80  % of Western library and archival collections, we looked at the ‘random failure phase’ when material weakens, {{as well as at the}} ‘wear-out failure phase’ during which reduction in DP becomes so pronounced that <b>wear</b> <b>and</b> <b>tear</b> (mechanical failure) becomes increasingly likely. If the frequency of object use is known, the curve can be experimentally determined.|$|R
