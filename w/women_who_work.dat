25|$|Regarding {{types of}} jobs, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in {{nurturing}} professions such as teaching and health generally have children {{at an earlier}} age.

25|$|Increased {{participation}} {{of women in}} the workforce is associated with decreased fertility. A cross-country panel study found this fertility factor effect to be strongest among women aged 20–39, but with a less strong but persistent effect among older women as well. International United Nations data suggests that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> because of economic necessity have higher fertility than those who work because they want to do so.|$|E

25|$|Many {{women face}} issues with sexual abuse {{while working in}} {{agriculture}} fields as well. Many of the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in these fields are undocumented and so supervisors or other male workers may take advantage of that. These women may suffer sexual abuse {{in order to keep}} their jobs and they cannot report the incident to the police because {{the fact that they are}} documented will be brought up and may be deported.|$|E
25|$|Chemical and {{occupational}} exposures {{may have some}} affect in pregnancy outcomes. A cause and effect relationship almost can never be established. Those chemicals that are implicated in increasing the risk for miscarriage are DDT, lead, formaldehyde, arsenic, benzene and ethylene oxide. Video display terminals and ultrasound have not {{been found to have}} an affect on the rates of miscarriage. In dental offices where nitrous oxide is used with the absence of anesthetic gas scavenging equipment, there is a greater risk of miscarriage. For <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> with cytotoxic antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents there is a small increased risk of miscarriage. No increased risk for cosmetologists has been found.|$|E
25|$|In four of {{the eleven}} nations {{for which there is}} data, the {{percentage}} of female workers who are in the agricultural sector as compared to the percentage of female workers in the services sector. In Turkey, for example, 42% of female workers are employed in the agricultural sector and 42% work in some form of services enterprise. Forty-nine percent of female employees work in agriculture in Egypt as compared to 46% of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in the services industry. Saudi Arabia is the only nation in which women play a negligible role agriculture. Tunisian, Nigerian, and Iranian women are more evenly distributed across the economic sectors. Iranian female workers are particularly evenly distributed across all three divisions with 3 of 10 women in agriculture, 4 of 10 in services, and just over one quarter in industry. Saudi Arabian women, on the other hand, are entirely concentrated in the services industry.|$|E

[...] "Rael's Girls" [...] is another group {{of women in the}} movement which are against the suppression of feminine acts of pleasure, including sexual intercourse with men or women. [...] Rael's Girls solely consists of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in the sex industry. [...] The women of Rael's Girls say {{there is no reason to}} repent for performing striptease or being a prostitute. [...] This organization was set up [...] "to support the choice of the women who are working in the sex industry". Rael's Girls and its founder Raël were featured in a pictorial in the October 2004 issue of Playboy.|$|E

A contest sponsored by Keep Walking Brazil project selected 30 proposed covers, and Sapienza was chosen by Madonna after being among the ten finalists. The creator {{said she did not}} know she was participating in a cover contest and explained, [...] "My work is connected to the status of women.

500|$|In 1980, {{poet and}} essayist Adrienne Rich {{expanded}} upon the political meaning of lesbian by proposing {{a continuum of}} lesbian existence based on [...] "woman-identified experience". All relationships between women, Rich proposed, have some lesbian element, regardless if they claim a lesbian identity: mothers and daughters, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> together, and women who nurse each other, for example. Such a perception of women relating to each other connects them through time and across cultures, and Rich considered heterosexuality a condition forced upon women by men. Several years earlier, DOB founders Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon similarly relegated sexual acts as unnecessary in determining what a lesbian is, by providing their definition: [...] "a woman whose primary erotic, psychological, emotional and social interest is in a member of her own sex, even though that interest may not be overtly expressed".|$|E

500|$|The eponymous {{group which}} [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] centers around was written {{as a general}} parody of boy bands, and not with any {{particular}} group in mind. Bouchard explained that the choice of using a non-specific type of parody was not brought about by fears that the episode would become dated, but rather because the staff all had different boy bands that [...] "made them chuckle." [...] He did, however, specifically research the English-Irish boy band One Direction for the episode because he [...] "wanted {{to see what the}} state of the art was" [...] and [...] "hadn't been that interested in Boyz II Men or Backstreet Boys or 'N Sync." [...] The staff had differing opinions on what Boyz 4 Now's clothes and hair would look like, choices which Bouchard ultimately left to [...] "some of the many talented <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> on the show who had much stronger feelings about boy bands." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her time}} in EastEnders, many of Dot's scenes have been set in Walford's launderette, where the {{character}} has worked as an assistant for almost the entire duration of {{her time in}} EastEnders. Here, Dot was frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, Pauline Fowler, played by Wendy Richard from 1985–2006. Author Christine Geraghty has discussed the working environment the women inhabited, indicating that because {{the owner of the}} launderette is barely present, the [...] "working relationship hinges on the friendships (or otherwise) of the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in it". As with Ethel, Dot and Pauline's friendship was often used for comedic purposes; emphasis was placed on their differences, leading to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 saw them [...] "buried alive" [...] underneath a collapsed fairground ride, {{in the midst of a}} cake-selling war. However, Pauline and Dot were most frequently shown gossiping, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette. The duo has been described by television personality Paul O'Grady as a [...] "fabulous double-act": [...] "Dot's probably Pauline's one and only confidant. Pauline eventually will break down and tell Dot things that she'd never tell anybody else." [...] On the episode marking the screen death of Pauline on 25 December 2006, Dot remarks to Pauline, “You’re the only real friend I’ve got", in a scene that Tim Teeman of The Times has described as [...] "one of the most moving scenes in a soap [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|The Pink Boots Society is an {{organization}} that supports <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> in the beer industry.

There are Pink Boots Society chapters in Canada, Australia and the United States. FemAle is another organization which supports the growth of women in brewing. In Sweden, they produced a beer named [...] "We Can Do It", modeled on the iconic Rosie the Riveter poster by Westinghouse in 2015.

2500|$|The {{prostitutes in}} illegal massage parlors {{may be forced}} to work out of {{apartment}} complexes for many hours a day.

The women may initially be lured into the US under false pretenses. In huge debt to their 'owners', they are forced to earn enough to eventually [...] "buy" [...] their freedom. In some cases women who have been sex trafficked {{may be forced to}} undergo plastic surgery or abortions. A chapter in The Slave Next Door (2009) reports that human trafficking and sexual enslavement are not limited to any specific location or social class. It concludes that individuals in society need to be alert to report suspicious behavior, because the psychological and physical abuse occurs which can often leave a victim unable to escape on their own.|$|E
2500|$|Mormon {{women are}} no more likely than other women to {{experience}} depression, however, Mormon women who experience depression have specific challenges. A 1993 dissertation by Marleen Williams found a few differences in how Mormon women experience depression. Compared to mildly depressed Protestant women, mildly depressed Mormon women felt more guilt and self-blame, took responsibility for others' behavior, and depended on others for approval. Compared to non-depressed Mormon women, mildly depressed Mormon {{women were more likely}} to have role conflicts and feel their gender role restricted their [...] behavior. A 1984 study by David Spendlove found that poor health, low income, less education, and less perceived caring from spouse were positively correlated with depression in LDS women in Utah. Spendlove also found that for women in Utah in 1984, <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>work</b> [...] "may be at a higher risk of depression" [...] than those who do not.|$|E
