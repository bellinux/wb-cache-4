40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{planning}} collision-free paths for multiple agents using optimization methods known as proximal algorithms. Recently this approach was ex-plored in Bento et al.

Unfortunately, the operators derived only ap-ply to paths in 2 D and require that any intermediate waypoints <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> agents <b>to</b> follow be preas-signed to specific agents, limiting their range of applica-bility. In this paper we resolve these limitations. We in-troduce new operators to deal with agents moving in ar-bitrary dimensions that are faster to compute than their 2 D predecessors and we introduce landmarks, space-time positions that are automatically assigned to the set of agents under different optimality criteria. Finally, we report the performance of the new operators in several numerical experiments. ...|$|R

But another approach might be to use the features of a person who has desirable HRTFs, based on some criteria. (One can sense a future 3 -D sound system where the pinnae of various famous musicians are simulated.) A set of HRTFs from a good localizer (discussed in Chapter 2) could be used if the criterion were localization performance. If the localization ability of the person is relatively accurate or more accurate than average, it might be reasonable to use these HRTF measurements for other individuals. The Convolvotron 3 -D audio system (Wenzel, Wightman, and Foster, 1988) has used such sets particularly because elevation accuracy is affected negatively when listening through a bad localizers ears (see Wenzel, et al., 1988). It is best when any single nonindividualized HRTF set is psychoacoustically validated using a 113 statistical sample of the intended user population, as shown in Chapter 2. Otherwise, the use of one HRTF set over another is a purely subjective judgment based on criteria other than localization performance. The technique used by Wightman and Kistler (1989 a) exemplifies a laboratory-based HRTF measurement procedure where accuracy and replicability of results were deemed crucial.

40|$|The {{nature of}} {{statistics}} is changing significantly with {{many opportunities to}} broaden the discipline {{and its impact on}} science and policy. To realize this potential, our curricula and educational culture must change. While there are opportunities for significant change in many dimensions, we focus more narrowly on computing and call for computing concepts to be in-tegrated into the statistics curricula at all levels. Computational literacy and programming are as fundamental to statistical practice and research as mathematics. We advocate that our field needs to define statistical computing more broadly to include advancements in modern com-puting, beyond traditional numerical algorithms. Information technologies are increasingly important and should be added to the curriculum, as should the ability to reason about compu-tational resources, work with large data sets, and perform computationally intensive tasks.

50|$|Privacy {{regulation}} {{theory was}} developed by social psychologist Irwin Altman in 1975. This theory aims to explain why people sometimes prefer staying alone but at other times like get involved in social interactions. Traditionally, privacy {{is regarded as a}} state of social withdrawal (i.e., avoiding people).Altman, however, regards it as a dialectic and dynamic boundary regulation processwhere privacy is not static but “a selective control of access to the self or to one’sgroup” (p. 18). According to Altman, “dialectic” refers to the openness and closenessof self to others (i.e., seeking and avoiding social interaction); while “dynamics”indicates that the desired privacy level (i.e., the ideal level of contact at a particulartime), which varies due to individual and cultural differences, continuously moves alongthe continuum of openness and closeness in response to different circumstances over time.In other words, the desired privacy level changes with time according to environment. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> avoid people at a particular time but desire contact at another time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the synthesis of}} reactive systems from specifications with identifiers. Identifiers are useful to parametrize the input and output of a reactive system, for example, to state which client requests a grant from an arbiter, or the type of object that a robot is expected to fetch. Traditional reactive synthesis algorithms only handle a constant bounded range of such identifiers. However, in practice, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> restrict the number of clients of an arbiter or the set of object types handled by a robot a priori. We first present a concise automata-based formalism for specifications with identi-fiers. The synthesis problem for such specifications is undecidable. We therefore give an algorithm that is always sound, and complete for unrealizable safety spec-ifications. Our algorithm is based on computing a pattern-based abstraction of a synthesis game that captures the realizability problem for the specification. The abstraction does not restrict the possible solutions to finite-state ones and captures the obligations for the system in the synthesis game. We present an experimental evaluation based on a prototype implementation that shows the practical applica-bility of our algorithm. ...|$|R

These two types of rec-ommendations are referred to as substitutes and complements: sub-stitutes are products that can be purchased instead of each other, while complements are products that can be purchased in addition to each other. Here we develop a method to infer networks of substitutable and complementary products. We formulate this as a supervised link prediction task, where we learn the semantics of substitutes and complements from data associated with products. The primary source of data we use is the text of product reviews, though our method also makes use of features such as ratings, specifications, prices, and brands. Methodologically, we build topic models that are trained to automatically discover topics from text that are suc-cessful at predicting and explaining such relationships. Experimen-tally, we evaluate our system on the Amazon product catalog, a large dataset consisting of 9 million products, 237 million links, and 144 million reviews. 1...|$|R
