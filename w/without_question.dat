5|$|It {{would be}} as great a farce of yesterday's {{election}} to designate it otherwise than a fraud. It {{was one of the}} worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges paid no attention to any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances <b>without</b> <b>question.</b> Men were marched from one ward to another and voted early and often.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{has been}} a fantastic {{ambassador}} for the club following his arrival from Northampton some four years ago. He quickly established himself in the first team {{and became one of}} the fans' favourites with his consistent performances, cheery smile and friendly manner. <b>Without</b> <b>question</b> he has played a very important part in the club's success in achieving promotion and subsequently retaining our Coca-Cola League One status.|$|E
5|$|Sergei Kirov, {{head of the}} Party {{organisation}} in Leningrad, {{was killed}} in 1934; some believed Stalin ordered his death. Kirov's death triggered a second crisis, the Great Purge. In 1938, out of the 28 People's Commissars in Molotov's Government, 20 were executed on the orders of Molotov and Stalin. The purges were carried out by Stalin's successive police chiefs, Nikolai Yezhov was the chief organiser and Kliment Voroshilov, Lazar Kaganovich and Molotov were intimately involved in the processes. Stalin frequently required Molotov and other Politburo members to sign the death warrants of prominent purge victims, and Molotov always did so <b>without</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Mulder {{arrives in}} the fields, he {{inadvertently}} drives over a patch of mushrooms which releases a cloud of hallucinogenic spores. Mulder—unbeknownst to the viewer—begins to hallucinate. He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave, and the two claim they were abducted by aliens, who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons. Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. He shows her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning <b>without</b> <b>question</b> and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings. Eventually, after seeing the yellow substance, much like Angela saw, Mulder awakens in the cave he followed Wallace into earlier, covered in the yellow secretion, being digested alive.|$|E
5|$|Exploration of {{the docks}} reveals a strange {{canister}} filled with swirling liquid. Thinking the canister contains healing or energizing properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and absorbs the contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper's body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character's skin smoothens and glows slightly. The canisters also affect the user's mental state, causing a more violent and arrogant temperament. Serviles {{remain on the}} island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed to serve them <b>without</b> <b>question</b> or hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated into three groups with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe {{that they should be}} treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors to be fought.|$|E
5|$|The post-conventional level, {{also known}} as the principled level, is marked by a growing {{realization}} that individuals are separate entities from society, and that the individual’s own perspective may take precedence over society’s view; individuals may disobey rules inconsistent with their own principles. Post-conventional moralists live by their own ethical principles—principles that typically include such basic human rights as life, liberty, and justice. People who exhibit post-conventional morality view rules as useful but changeable mechanisms—ideally rules can maintain the general social order and protect human rights. Rules are not absolute dictates that must be obeyed <b>without</b> <b>question.</b> Because post-conventional individuals elevate their own moral evaluation of a situation over social conventions, their behavior, especially at stage six, can be confused with that of those at the pre-conventional level.|$|E

60|$|Courtlaw {{found himself}} ushered <b>without</b> <b>questions</b> into Annabel's long low drawing-room, {{fragrant}} {{with flowers and}} somewhat to his surprise, crowded with guests. From the further end of the apartment came the low music of a violin. Servants were passing backwards and forwards with tea and chocolate. For a moment he did not recognize Annabel. Then she came a few steps to meet him.|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, Raskolnikov's mother, Pulkheria Alexandrovna, and his sister, Avdotya Romanovna (or Dunya), {{have arrived}} in the city. Dunya had been working as a governess for the Svidrigaïlov family until this point, but was {{forced out of the}} {{position}} by the head of the family, Arkady Ivanovich Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, a married man, was attracted to Dunya's physical beauty and her feminine qualities, and offered her riches and elopement. Mortified, Dunya fled the Svidrigaïlov family and lost her source of income, only to meet Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, a man of modest income and rank. Luzhin proposes to marry Dunya, thereby securing her and her mother's financial safety, provided she accept him quickly and <b>without</b> <b>question.</b> It is for these very reasons {{that the two of them}} come to Saint Petersburg, both to meet Luzhin there and to obtain Raskolnikov's approval. Luzhin, however, calls on Raskolnikov while he is in a delirious state and presents himself as a foolish, self-righteous and presumptuous man. Raskolnikov dismisses him immediately as a potential husband for his sister, and realizes that she only accepted him to help her family.|$|E
25|$|Kitchener {{advised the}} Dardanelles Committee (21 October) that Baghdad be seized {{for the sake}} of {{prestige}} then abandoned as logistically untenable.

25|$|His {{music is}} among the most {{experimental}} and expressive of the Renaissance, and <b>without</b> <b>question</b> is the most wildly chromatic. Progressions such as those written by Gesualdo did not appear again in music until the 19th century, and then in a context of tonality.|$|E
25|$|Newfoundland stayed {{loyal to}} Britain <b>without</b> <b>question.</b> It was {{exempt from the}} Navigation Acts and shared none of the grievances of the {{continental}} colonies.

25|$|Birds are <b>without</b> <b>question</b> Färnebofjärden's most {{numerous}} {{class of}} animal. More than 200 {{species have been}} reported of which at least 107 nest regularly in the park.

25|$|In {{communicating}} with patients {{a major challenge}} in the campaign is the problem inherent in patient-centered care of giving patients some basis for understanding how {{to make decisions about}} their health care.

40|$|Abstract. This article {{reports the}} results of two studies which {{investigated}} the im-pact of inserted questions on the studying activities of students reading their own course related materials. In both studies macro eye-movements {{of the students were}} monitored as they studied texts with or <b>without</b> inserted <b>questions.</b> In Study 1, involving 36 undergraduate university students, the Question Group showed more lookbacks to relevant information than the No Question Group with one of two sets of questions, and more lookbacks to incidental information with both sets of ques-tions. However, neither reading time nor performance on a test differed between the two groups. Study 2 was designed to extend the findings to elementary school chil-dren and {{to examine the effects of}} ability. A sample of 54 fifth-grade better and poorer readers were given course related materials either with or <b>without</b> inserted <b>questions.</b> Children given inserted questions did not look back to relevant material more often than children <b>without</b> <b>questions.</b> Poorer readers given one of two sets of Preliminary versions of the studies discussed in this article were presented at the America...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} whether asking about ethnic origin and housing tenure in a postal survey affects the response rate. DESIGN [...] The study derived from a postal survey designed to determine eligibility for a study of outpatients. A two way factorial design was used to look at the two experimental factors, questionnaires being randomly divided into four groups with or <b>without</b> <b>questions</b> about ethnic origin and housing tenure. PARTICIPANTS [...] 10, 000 people (1000 from each of 10 areas) were systematically sampled from electoral registers, the areas being chosen to give a nationally representative sample. MAIN RESULTS [...] The response rate was 66 % irrespective of whether ethnic origin was asked about, but was 65 % and 67 % respectively to questionnaires with and <b>without</b> <b>questions</b> about housing tenure. CONCLUSIONS [...] Asking about ethnic origin did not affect the overall response to this survey although {{it is possible that the}} response from some ethnic minority groups was lower. Asking about housing tenure slightly, but significantly, decreased response...|$|R

Prior to the attack, {{it was possible for}} anybody to enter a building and travel to any floor <b>without</b> <b>question.</b> After the attack, security stations were installed in lobbies, employees were required to carry identification badges that granted them access to their suites, and procedures for vendors and visitors established.|$|E
25|$|Thus Wieser's Social Economics is, in effect, {{a socialist}} economy in which, to achieve greater productivity, scarce {{resources}} are assigned by an omnipresent, benevolent planner with direct and accurate insight sufficient {{to know the}} intensities of satisfactions and needs experienced by individual members of society, which all have exactly the same tastes and the same scales of utility and receive the same incomes. Moreover, their directions are followed <b>without</b> <b>question</b> by a completely docile workforce.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} had little formal structure, and no leader. All members had one vote during meetings, but during combat operations they selected a temporary commander whom they all swore to obey <b>without</b> <b>question.</b> Secrecy was paramount. As such, members took {{care not to}} carry identifying objects, and did not engage in any display of activism in public. Members who were caught often committed suicide; they would execute their wounded comrades so {{they would not be}} taken prisoner.|$|E
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effect of}} incredulity and particle on the intonation of yes/no questions in Taiwan Mandarin. Two types of questions were examined – ones with and <b>without</b> the <b>question</b> particle ma. Results showed that to convey incredulity, the overall pitch would be raised and enlarged. Moreover, <b>questions</b> <b>without</b> particles were significantly higher in pitch and larger in pitch range than questions with particles. This thus led to a conclusion {{that the degree of}} incredulity being expressed in questions with ma might not be as great as that in <b>questions</b> <b>without</b> ma...|$|R
