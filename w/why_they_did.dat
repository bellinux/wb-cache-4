5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, {{the reason for}} the delay was probably simply that neither the Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially. This then raises the question of why the battle occurred when it did. Herodotus explicitly tells us that the Greeks attacked the Persians (and the other sources confirm this), {{but it is not clear}} <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> this before the arrival of the Spartans. There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
5|$|Because Manor Marussia {{failed to}} notify the {{stewards}} of their inability to field a car, the team was summoned by the FIA to explain <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not participate in qualifying. However, the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA's satisfaction that the team would {{have been unable to}} field their cars, even if they had violated curfew. Despite this, Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia, costs normally covered by Formula One Management.|$|E

5|$|On March 20, 2017 the British paper The Guardian {{reported}} {{that hundreds of}} banks had helped launder KGB-related funds out of Russia, as uncovered by an investigation named Global Laundromat. NatWest was listed among the 17 banks in the UK that were “facing questions over what they knew about the international scheme and <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not turn away suspicious money transfers,” as the bank processed $1.1 million in Laundromat cash.

5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|None of the offers made {{by major}} record {{companies}} appealed to Nakamura and Thornton until DreamWorks Records offered {{to release the}} album nationally. In 1997, the label released the full album in the US under the extended title Dr. Octagonecologyst, which featured five new songs. In promotion of the album, Thornton planned to perform under the Dr. Octagon name. These performances were supposed to feature a full live band, an on-stage breakdancer and appearances by Invisibl Skratch Piklz. It's unclear <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not play these shows, but Thornton, Nakamura and DJ Q-Bert played {{for the first time}} together on March 6, 2017, in San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the dwindling}} numbers on Rachel Lang's series Mercy Peak, she decided {{one way to}} attract an {{audience}} was to feature abrasive and in-your-face characters, something she promised herself would feature in her next show.

25|$|This {{has led the}} Guardians of the Cedars to {{maintain}} that Lebanese people are not Arabs. The political consequence of this stance advocates the 'de-Arabization' of Lebanon. Similarly, followers draw a distinction between Arabic and 'Lebanese', aiming to restore the form created by Lebanese philosopher Said Akl. The Guardians of the Cedars have adopted positions hostile to Pan-Arabism. This {{is believed to be}} the main reason <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not grow as a party in Lebanon outside the Maronite community.|$|E

25|$|Later, {{when the}} {{children}} {{were told that they}} could freely play with any toy they wanted, the children in the mild-punishment group were less likely to play with the steam shovel (the forbidden toy), despite removal of the threat of severe punishment. The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.|$|E
25|$|Many Acadians {{might have}} signed an {{unconditional}} oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better, while other Acadians did not sign {{because they were}} clearly anti-British. For the Acadians who might have signed an unconditional oath, there were numerous reasons <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not. The difficulty was partly religious, in that the British monarch {{was the head of}} the (Protestant) Church of England. Another significant issue was that an oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime. A related concern was whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive this as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than the Mi'kmaq. As a result, signing an unconditional oath might have put Acadian villages in dangers of attack from Mi'kmaq.|$|E
