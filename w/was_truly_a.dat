5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song <b>was</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the ALBC began {{investigating}} the Marsh Tacky {{to see if}} it <b>was</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> descendent of Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type of Colonial Spanish stock. In 2007, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy collaborated with the Equus Survival Trust to collect DNA samples and photo-document the largest herd in South Carolina, considered to be the largest remaining herd, with a heritage tracing back to the American Civil War. DNA testing was undertaken in an effort to identify horses for a new studbook, reveal what DNA markers the breed carries, and map the breed's genetic place among all other horse breeds worldwide. Sixty horses were tested in the effort.|$|E

In 2007, the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust in a project to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling, {{the creation of a new}} studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed. The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted in formulating a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E

25|$|Controversy erupted {{over the}} practice. Many people, {{both men and}} women from {{backgrounds}} of both Islamic and non-Islamic faith questioned the hijab and what it stood for in terms of women and their rights. There was questioning of whether in practice the hijab <b>was</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> female choice or if women were being coerced or pressured into wearing it. Many instances, such as a period of forced veiling for women in Iran, brought these issues to the forefront and generated great debate from both scholars and everyday people.|$|E
25|$|Editing The Ladder <b>was</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> {{full-time}} job. Longtime DOB member Helen Sandoz, who {{had taken}} over editing it after an interim period after Barbara Gittings left, was so burdened by the responsibilities that it was affecting her relationship. She {{passed it on to}} Barbara Grier in 1968, who had been contributing to the magazine as a book reviewer and poetry writer. Grier edited the magazine from Kansas City and was a relative newcomer to the workings of the DOB, despite contributing to the magazine since 1957.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Edward Witten {{discovered}} that most theories of quantum gravity could not accommodate chiral fermions like the neutrino. This led him, {{in collaboration with}} Luis Álvarez-Gaumé, to study violations of the conservation laws in gravity theories with anomalies, concluding that type I string theories were inconsistent. Green and Schwarz discovered {{a contribution to the}} anomaly that Witten and Alvarez-Gaumé had missed, which restricted the gauge group of the type I string theory to be SO(32). In coming to understand this calculation, Edward Witten became convinced that string theory <b>was</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> consistent theory of gravity, and he became a high-profile advocate. Following Witten's lead, between 1984 and 1986, hundreds of physicists started to work in this field, and this is sometimes called the first superstring revolution.|$|E

25|$|Pope Pius XII showed {{high regard}} for Benedict XV, who had consecrated him a bishop on 13 May 1917, {{the very day}} of the first {{reported}} apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima. While Pius XII considered another Benedict, Benedict XIV {{in terms of his}} sanctity and scholarly contributions to be worthy as Doctor of the Church, he thought that Benedict XV during his short pontificate <b>was</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> man of God, who worked for peace. He helped prisoners of war and many others who needed help in dire times and was extremely generous to Russia. He praised him as a Marian Pope who promoted the devotion to Our Lady of Lourdes, for his encyclicals Ad beatissimi Apostolorum, Humani generis redemptionem, Quod iam diu, and Spiritus Paraclitus, and, for the codification of Canon Law, which under della Chiesa and Pietro Gasparri, he as Eugenio Pacelli had the opportunity to participate in.|$|E
25|$|In {{this short}} story, {{a man named}} Gunnar was {{suspected}} of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess. He helped her drive Freyr's wagon with the god effigy in it, but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar {{if he had not}} promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway. When Gunnar had promised this, a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr was nothing but a piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. After a while he made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr <b>was</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of Olaf Tryggvason.|$|E

The conspiracy theory that she was murdered by intelligence agents working for the Manhattan Project was bolstered by the 1975 Church Committee, which revealed details of assassinations carried out by American intelligence agencies, and was depicted in the fictional TV series Manhattan. One doctor observed that: [...] "If you were clever and wanted to kill someone, {{this is the way}} to do it." ...|$|E

Shortly after the album's release, Townsend {{announced that he}} no longer planned to tour or make albums with Strapping Young Lad or the Devin Townsend Band. He explained that he was [...] "burnt out on travelling, touring, and self promotion" [...] and wished to do production work, write albums, and spend time with his family without the stress of interviews or touring.|$|E
500|$|Kanille told Rimsky-Korsakov to {{continue}} coming to him every Sunday, not for formal lessons but to play duets and discuss music. In November 1861, Kanille introduced the 18-year-old Nikolai to Mily Balakirev. Balakirev in turn {{introduced him to}} César Cui and Modest Mussorgsky; all three were known as composers, despite only being in their 20s. Rimsky-Korsakov later wrote, [...] "With what delight I listened to real business discussions [...] of instrumentation, part writing, etc! And besides, how much talking there was about current musical matters! All at once I had been plunged into a new world, unknown to me, formerly only heard of in the society of my dilettante friends.

"The {{spread of}} urban trading networks, and their {{extension}} along the Persian Gulf and eastern Mediterranean, created a complex molecular structure of regional foci so {{that as well}} as the zonation of core and periphery (originally created around Mesopotamia) there was a series of interacting civilizations: Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indus Valley; then also Syria, central Anatolia (Hittites) and the Aegean (Minoans and Mycenaeans). Beyond this was a margin which included not only temperate areas such as Europe, but the dry steppe corridor of central Asia. This <b>was</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> world system, even though it occupied only a restricted portion of the western Old World. Whilst each civilization emphasized its ideological autonomy, all were identifiably part of a common world of interacting components." ...|$|E

There is a long-running debate about whether this Cambrian explosion <b>was</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> very rapid period of evolutionary experimentation; alternative views are that modern-looking animals began evolving earlier but fossils of their precursors have not yet been found, or that the [...] "weird wonders" [...] are evolutionary [...] "aunts" [...] and [...] "cousins" [...] of modern groups.
