50|$|Regulations {{introduced}} in the United States for the 1968 model year vehicles meant the disappearance of fixed stand-up hood ornaments, as well as spinner <b>wheel</b> <b>protrusions.</b> Later versions featured flexibly mounted (spring-loaded) stand-up hood ornaments designed to fold without breaking on impact.|$|E
2500|$|The Debonair {{was largely}} {{the result of}} former General Motors {{designer}} Hans S. Bretzner, while the result was largely influenced by the 1961 Lincoln Continental designed by Elwood Engel, {{as evidenced by the}} slab-sided body panels, squared <b>wheel</b> wells, extended <b>protrusions</b> {{at the front of the}} vehicle, wraparound turnsignals in the front, and tapered fins at the rear, with a rear tail light cluster, exhibiting a [...] "Continental-esque" [...] appearance. It used a double wishbone front suspension with leaf springs and a differential for the rear axle for the entire generation.|$|R
40|$|NASA Lewis Research Center is {{currently}} {{engaged in a}} research effort as a team member of the High Alpha Technology Program within the NASA agency. This program uses a specially-equipped F/A- 18 A aircraft called the High Alpha Research Vehicle (HARV), {{in an effort to}} improve the maneuverability of high performance military aircraft at low-subsonic-speed, high-angle-of-attack conditions. The overall objective of the NASA Lewis effort is to develop inlet analysis technology towards efficient airflow delivery to the engine during these maneuvers. One portion of this inlet analysis technology uses computational fluid dynamics to predict installed inlet performance. Most of the F/A- 18 A HARV geometry, which includes the ramp/splitter plate, side diverter and slot, inlet lip and upper diverter, and deflected leading-edge flap has been modeled. The empennage and rear fuselage have not. A pair of vortex generators located on the bottom wall of the inlet were not modeled initially. These vortex generators were installed to alleviate any flow separation that may be induced by the <b>wheel</b> well <b>protrusion</b> into the inlet wall. Calculations completed with the PARC 3 D code showed that the pressure recovery has been underpredicted and the flow distortion over-predicted. To improve the correlation of PARC 3 D predictions with flight and wind tunnel tests, the vortex generators were included in the grid geometry and the results are presented in this report. The grid totals 27 blocks or 1. 3 million grid points for the half model, which includes the vortex generator grid blocks. Two flight cases were calculated, a high speed case with a Mach number of 0. 8 and angle of attack of 3. 4; and a low speed case with a Mach number of 0. 43 and angle of attack of 32. 2. The vortex generators {{have a significant effect on}} the inlet boundary layers at high speed, low angle of attack; and have no effect at low speed, high angle of attack...|$|R
