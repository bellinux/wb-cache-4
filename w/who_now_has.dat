5|$|On July 25, 2015, Phillies {{left-hander}} Cole Hamels {{threw his}} first career no-hitter in a 5–0 {{win over the}} Chicago Cubs at the historic Wrigley Field. He narrowly missed completing a perfect game by walking two Cubs batters. Odubel Herrera, Phillies centerfielder, nearly dropped the game's final out at the warning track after he overran a long fly ball hit by Cubs rookie sensation Kris Bryant; Herrera, however, was able to snag the ball with an awkward sliding catch to close out the game and preserve Hamels's no-hitter. In addition to this being Cole Hamels's first no-hitter, this was the fourth no hitter caught by longtime Phillies catcher Carlos Ruiz, <b>who</b> <b>now</b> <b>has</b> tied the MLB record for no-hitters caught.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man {{contacts}} Mulder, arranging {{a meeting}} at a nearby diner. There Mulder meets his sister Samantha, who calls The Smoking Man her father. Samantha claims to not remember anything about her abduction and is reluctant to stay or tell Mulder where he can find her. The next day, The Smoking Man offers Mulder the truth if he quits the FBI and comes work for him; Mulder refuses. Mulder later meets with Blevins, <b>who</b> <b>now</b> <b>has</b> evidence Skinner was withholding information concerning Ostelhoff's death. Blevins tells Mulder he can help him if he names Skinner as the traitor in the FBI. Later, Mulder meets with Scully, telling her {{he was going to}} make the deal with The Smoking Man but now will not after his meeting with Blevins. Despite Scully's pleas, he refuses to name Skinner as the traitor in the FBI.|$|E
5|$|The next installment, also titled God of War, {{was officially}} {{announced}} at Sony's 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference with a gameplay trailer. The trailer showed a fully bearded Kratos, <b>who</b> <b>now</b> <b>has</b> a son, and Kratos is teaching the boy how to hunt. The {{end of the}} trailer showed the title God of War and confirmed it is in development for the PlayStation 4. Gameplay in the trailer showed elements similar to role playing games (RPG), such as archery knowledge points, {{as well as a}} Spartan Rage timed-ability during battle. The game will take place many years after the events of God of War III and will be set in the world of Norse mythology; a concept originally considered by David Jaffe after Kratos eliminated the Greek gods. Although further games have not been officially announced, Cory Barlog confirmed that this new installment would not be Kratos' last game. At E3 2017, another trailer was shown and it was confirmed that the game will release in early 2018.|$|E

25|$|In 1930, Gillies' cousin, Archibald McIndoe, {{joined the}} {{practice}} and became committed to plastic surgery. When World War II broke out, plastic surgery provision was largely divided between the different services of the armed forces, and Gillies and his team were split up. Gillies himself was sent to Rooksdown House near Basingstoke, which became the principal army plastic surgery unit; Tommy Kilner (who had worked with Gillies during the First World War, and <b>who</b> <b>now</b> <b>has</b> a surgical instrument named after him, the kilner cheek retractor), went to Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton, and Mowlem to St Albans. McIndoe, consultant to the RAF, moved to the recently rebuilt Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, Sussex, and founded a Centre for Plastic and Jaw Surgery. There, he treated very deep burn, and serious facial disfigurement, such as loss of eyelids, typical of those caused to aircrew by burning fuel.|$|E
25|$|Led by General Crassus (Jay Simon), the Romans {{attack the}} city with Talos, a bronze giant. However, The Spartan is able to destroy Talos with catapults. That night, Ares instructs him to {{infiltrate}} the Roman camp and recover the Blades of Athena, lost since the Trojan War. Accompanied by Castor, The Spartan is successful, and during the raid, they encounter Electra (Julia Innocenti), Queen of the Amazons, who was captured whilst tracking the Romans through Greece. Imprisoned in the camp, she had killed her guard and was escaping when she met Castor and The Spartan, <b>who</b> <b>now</b> <b>has</b> the Blades of Athena. Once back in Sparta, she demands to speak to Leonidas, telling him the Romans have built an incredibly powerful weapon, capable of obliterating the entire city. She is proven correct when Crassus reveals a weapon powered by an imprisoned Medusa, with the capability of turning entire phalanxes to stone in a split second. The Spartan fights his way to Medusa, and destroys the weapon, also killing Crassus and taking his sword and magical shield.|$|E

[...] Perelman stalked off in a rage. In accepting her award, she gave an acceptance speech honoring previous black actresses who had never had the opportunity.

After describing the brief plot and shortly showing clips of the game, the Conan-lookalike leaves his room while exclaiming, [...] "The fate {{of the world is}} in your hands! Back vile beast!".

Leslie warns Greg she knows he vandalizes the town's statue of Mayor Percy every Halloween, but {{that she will be}} watching him closely and will catch him this year. Greg casually denies having any such plans. At the Pawnee town hall, Ann (Rashida Jones) talks excitedly about her upcoming Halloween party. She asks the others not to mention it to Tom (Aziz Ansari), but she is disappointed to learn Jerry (Jim O'Heir) has already told him. That night, Leslie watches Greg {{with the help of her}} boyfriend, Pawnee police officer Dave Sanderson (Louis C.K.), while Andy (Chris Pratt), <b>who</b> <b>now</b> <b>has</b> a part-time job with the parks department, guards the statue.|$|E

500|$|The {{recreation}} {{was done}} to line up two points in the fourth dimension, time, {{to get the attention}} of the person playing Ever 17; the characters see the player as a 4th-dimensional being, [...] "Blick Winkel", who can move through time; Blick Winkel appearing was what caused Hokuto's amnesia. Yubiseiharukana tells Blick Winkel that they had told her to do the recreation to save Takeshi and Coco. Blick Winkel travels to 2017, and wakes up Takeshi on the seafloor, forcing him to swim to IBF; inside, he injects Coco with Tsugumi's antibodies. Blick Winkel warns Yubiseiharukana in 2017 to not save Takeshi and Coco immediately, to avoid a time paradox; instead, Blick Winkel has Takeshi and Coco enter cryogenic suspension in IBF. They wake up in 2034, saved. Sora, <b>who</b> <b>now</b> <b>has</b> a robotic body, is given back her memories from the disk, and Yubiseiharukana leaks information about Leiblich, exposing them as the ones behind the Tief Blau outbreak.|$|E
500|$|Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians {{has been the}} subject of {{constant}} panning by critics since its inception. Brian Lowry, reviewing the show for Variety, said that the network: [...] "widens its lens to encompass the whole irritating brood — including Kim's sisters Khloé and Kourtney, mom-manager Kris and stepdad Bruce Jenner, <b>who</b> <b>now</b> <b>has</b> the distinction of having two sets of useless rich kids featured in pointless reality shows." [...] Ginia Bellafonte of The New York Times compared the show to reality series Gene Simmons Family Jewels and exclaimed that: [...] "the Kardashian show is not about an eccentric family living conventionally; it is purely about some desperate women climbing to the margins of fame, and that feels a lot creepier." [...] Laura Burrows of IGN criticized the family for being too self-seeking and using the given platform only to gain more notoriety for themselves. Following the conclusion of the second season of the series, Burrows wrote: [...] "Those of us who watch this show [...] want to believe that these whores of attention have souls and would actually do something for their fellow man and not reap the benefits of their service, but two seasons' worth of self-absorbed egocentrism speaks to the contrary." ...|$|E
500|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley), {{supported}} by her boyfriend Shane (LaMarcus Tinker), auditions {{for the role}} of Maria and impresses the directors—Emma, Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) and Artie (Kevin McHale)—with her rendition of [...] "Spotlight". They schedule a callback between her and Rachel (Lea Michele) to help them decide who should be cast in the role. Mercedes is angry about what she perceives as continued favoritism shown to Rachel, especially in the awarding of solos, and when Will pushes her in the glee club's extra dance rehearsals that Rachel is excused from, she decides she has had enough and quits glee club. When Mercedes and Rachel compete by singing [...] "Out Here On My Own" [...] in the callbacks, Mercedes gives a performance that Rachel privately concedes was better, which prompts Rachel to begin a last-minute candidacy for senior class president to improve her college prospects; this dismays Kurt, <b>who</b> <b>now</b> <b>has</b> another rival to campaign against. The three directors decide to offer the role of Maria to both contenders, with each to do half the performances, but Mercedes is convinced she deserved to win the part outright and refuses to accept half a role. She withdraws from contention, which leaves Rachel as the sole Maria, and volunteers to join Shelby Corcoran's (Idina Menzel) new glee club. The cast list is posted, with Rachel as Maria, Blaine as Tony, Santana as Anita, Mike as Riff, and Kurt as Officer Krupke.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{there are}} stunt {{people on the}} sets for each episode, the cast is {{more than willing to}} take on some of the stunt-work themselves. Welling and Schneider {{performed}} a lot of their own stunts for the scene where Clark and Jonathan, <b>who</b> <b>now</b> <b>has</b> the powers to take on his son, battle over Clark’s use of the red kryptonite in [...] "Exile". This lent to the filmmakers being able to show more of the two actor’s faces during the scene, which also lends more realism to the audience.

Kobach, his wife, and their children live on their farm near LeCompton, north of Lawrence, Kansas. Their residence is in a building, the permits for which Kobach originally received lower taxation and permitting fees due to claimed intent for agricultural exemptions, rather than residential use. He stated he intends to build a residential home on the property. When building it, Kobach [...] "closed in" [...] the plumbing and electric work {{so it was not}} possible for the building inspector to examine it without tearing up the floor and removing walls that covered wiring. There was no septic system or water source. Despite those difficulties, he was granted permit waivers by the county administration, precipitating public controversy.|$|E

Angel Eyes returns to Baker for his fee, then shoots Baker, fulfilling his contract with Stevens. Meanwhile, Mexican bandit Tuco Ramírez is rescued from three bounty hunters by [...] "Blondie", who delivers him to the local sheriff to collect his $2,000 bounty.

They repeat the process in another town for more reward money. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, and abandons him penniless in the desert. A vengeful Tuco tracks Blondie to a town being abandoned by Confederate troops. As he prepares to force Blondie to hang himself, Union forces shell the town, allowing Blondie to escape. Following an arduous search, Tuco recaptures Blondie and force-marches him across a desert until Blondie collapses from dehydration. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside is a delirious Bill Carson, who promises Tuco $200,000 in Confederate gold, buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. Tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but Carson collapses from thirst before answering.
