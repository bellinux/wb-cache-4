500|$|Former U.S. {{president}} Barack Obama {{has used}} the film to help explain how he understood the role and growth of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). [...] "There's a scene in the beginning in which the gang leaders of Gotham are meeting ... These are men who had the city divided up. They were thugs, {{but there was a}} kind of order. Everyone had his turf. And then the Joker comes in and lights the whole city on fire. ISIS is the Joker. It has the capacity to set the whole region on fire. That's why <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> it.” ...|$|E
500|$|Four days later, Benfica hosted Braga, {{who were}} searching for their first win of April. Benfica enjoyed a slight superiority {{throughout}} the match but could not surpass Braga's defence. Paulo Santos ended the game unbeaten. The third consecutive draw had negative consequences for the league race; Porto increased their lead to five points and Sporting climbed to second place in exchange for Benfica after recovering five points {{in the past three}} matchdays. Santos accepted the title was no longer an objective, saying, [...] "We are not mathematically removed from it, but we are clearly very far from winning it...Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for second place, because it is crucial." [...] On 21 April, Benfica travelled to Funchal to play Marítimo. Miccoli was essential in Benfica's game, scoring the first tow goals in a 3–0 win, the first in April for Benfica. For their last match of April, Benfica received Sporting at home. Without Simão, who was injured, Benfica suffered an early setback when Liédson scored for Sporting in the second minute. Benfica equalized with a goal from Miccoli 20 minutes later, ending the game 1–1. Santos blamed bad luck for the draw.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Kunstler's firm Kunstler, Kunstler, and Kinoy {{was asked}} to defend Jack Ruby by his brother Earl, but dropped the case because they [...] "did {{not wish to be}} in a {{situation}} where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> to get into the case". Ruby was eventually permitted to replace his original defense team with Kunstler, [...] who got him a new trial. In 1966, he also defended an arsonist who burned down a Jewish Community Center, killing twelve, because he was not provided a lawyer before he signed a confession.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1991, Graham said in {{reference}} to the Persian Gulf War, [...] "As ... President Bush has said, it is not the people of Iraq we are at war with. It is {{some of the people in}} that regime. Pray for peace in the Middle East, a just peace." [...] Graham had earlier said that [...] "there come times when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> for peace." [...] He went on to say that out of the war in the Gulf may [...] "come a new peace and, as suggested by the President, a new world order." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Hagen {{delivered}} {{a speech at}} a convention of the independent Christian organisation Levende Ord, where he stated that [...] "we Christians are very much concerned with children. Jesus said, let the small children come to me. I can't understand that Muhammad could have said the same. In the case {{that he could have}} said the same, it would have been: Let the small children come to me, so that I can exploit them in my struggle to Islamify the world." [...] He also said that if Israel lost the fight in the Middle East, Europe would [...] "bow under to Islam," [...] if Muslim fundamentalists get it as they want. [...] "They have, {{in the same manner as}} Hitler, long ago made it clear that the long-term plan is to Islamify the world. They have come a long way, they have pierced deep into Africa, and have come a long way into Europe – and then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> back." [...] He was because of the speech criticised by politicians and religious leaders within Norway. Some days later, the ambassadors of Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt and Morocco, and chargé d'affaires of Tunisia made an unusually strong attack on Hagen in a letter in the newspaper Aftenposten.|$|E
2500|$|Before the Anglo-German summit at Berchtesgaden on 15 September 1938, the British Ambassador, Sir Nevile Henderson, and Weizsäcker {{worked out}} a private {{arrangement}} for Hitler and Chamberlain to meet with no advisers present {{as a way of}} excluding the ultra-hawkish Ribbentrop from attending the talks. Hitler's interpreter Paul Schmidt later recalled that it was [...] "felt that our Foreign Minister would prove a disturbing element" [...] at the Berchtesgaden summit. In a moment of pique at his exclusion from the Chamberlain-Hitler meeting, Ribbentrop refused to hand over Schmidt's notes of the summit to Chamberlain, a move that caused much annoyance on the British side. Ribbentrop spent the last weeks of September 1938 looking forward very much to the German-Czechoslovak war he expected to break out on 1 October 1938. Ribbentrop regarded the Munich Agreement as a diplomatic defeat for Germany, as it deprived Germany of the opportunity to wage the war to destroy Czechoslovakia that Ribbentrop wanted to see; the Sudetenland issue, which was the ostensible subject of the German-Czechoslovak dispute, had been just a pretext for German aggression. During the Munich Conference, Ribbentrop spent much of his time brooding unhappily in the corners. Ribbentrop told the head of Hitler's Press Office, Fritz Hesse, that the Munich Agreement was [...] "first-class stupidity… All it means is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> the English in a year, when they will be better armed… It would have been much better if war had come now". Like Hitler, Ribbentrop was determined that in the next crisis, Germany would not have its professed demands met in another Munich-type summit, and that the next crisis to be caused by Germany would result in the war that Chamberlain had [...] "cheated" [...] the Germans out of at Munich.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were also}} {{difficulties}} with supply. Captain Marbot, who was serving with Augereau, wrote: It rained and snowed incessantly.

"Yes, yes; because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> Napoleon and Ney and Soult and {{the rest}} of them. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> hard many and many a time, and if the battle had been fought between the same armies with a change of generals, things would have gone quite {{differently}} to what they did." ...|$|R

60|$|Still {{he walked}} on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins. Not as a conqueror was he come, {{to march in}} triumph. Not to destroy, but to heal.
