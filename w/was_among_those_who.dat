5|$|Despenser was an {{energetic}} and able administrator who staunchly defended his diocese against Lollardy. In 1399, he <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> stood by Richard, following the landing of Henry Bolingbroke in Yorkshire {{towards the end}} of June. He was arrested for refusing {{to come to terms with}} Bolingbroke. The following year, he was implicated in the Epiphany Rising, but was pardoned.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, in 1926, King Ferdinand allowed Filitti {{to resume}} his {{political}} career, making him {{a member of the}} Romanian Legislative Council. An emanation of the 1923 Constitution, it comprised experts tasked with reviewing laws endorsed by Parliament, and whose exact role sparked a series of controversies. Filitti <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> described the Council as a necessary branch of the legislature, rather than as an organ of the executive.|$|E
5|$|Novelist Inez Asher <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> {{wrote for}} the series, while other scripts were {{produced}} by writers blacklisted during the heyday of McCarthyism and the House Un-American Activities Committee. These writers included Robert Lees (credited as J. E. Selby) and Adrian Scott, one of the Hollywood Ten who went to prison for contempt of the United States Congress. His wife, Joan Scott writing as Joanne Court, attended story conferences and gave her husband notes so he could do rewrites.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequences}} of the decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were dismissed from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted his work {{to be understood as}} formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
5|$|A solar cell, or {{photovoltaic}} cell (PV), is {{a device that}} converts light into electric current using the photovoltaic effect. The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s. The German industrialist Ernst Werner von Siemens <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> {{recognized the importance of}} this discovery. In 1931, the German engineer Bruno Lange developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide, although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1% of incident light into electricity. Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954. These early solar cells cost 286USD/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, the {{graveyard}} was overshadowed on its northern side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds {{of the church and}} its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then {{partially}} roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin that attracted the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011 it was {{reported}} that Benn had moved out of his home in Holland Park Avenue, London, into a smaller flat nearby that benefited from a warden. In 2012 Benn was awarded an honorary degree from Goldsmiths, University of London. He was also the honorary president of the Goldsmiths Students' Union, who successfully campaigned for him to retract comments dismissing the Julian Assange rape allegations. In February 2013 Benn <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> gave their support to the People's Assembly in a letter published by The Guardian newspaper. He gave a speech at the People's Assembly Conference held at Westminster Central Hall on 22 June 2013.|$|E
5|$|In modern history, orators such as Henry Clay would mimic Demosthenes's technique. His {{ideas and}} {{principles}} survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements of our times. Hence, he constituted {{a source of}} inspiration for the authors of The Federalist Papers (a series of 85 essays arguing for the ratification of the United States Constitution) and for the major orators of the French Revolution. French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> idealised Demosthenes and wrote a book about him. For his part, Friedrich Nietzsche often composed his sentences according to the paradigms of Demosthenes, whose style he admired.* P. J. M. Van Tongeren, Reinterpreting Modern Culture, 92.|$|E

5|$|Through 1866, Greeley editorialized that Davis, who {{was being}} held at Fortress Monroe, should either be set free or put on trial. Davis's wife Varina urged Greeley to use his {{influence}} to gain her husband's release. In May 1867, a Richmond judge set bail for the former Confederate president at $100,000. Greeley <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> signed the bail bond, {{and the two men}} met briefly at the courthouse. This act resulted in public anger against Greeley in the North. Sales of the second volume of his history (published in 1866) declined sharply. Subscriptions to the Tribune (especially the Weekly Tribune) also dropped off, though they recovered during the 1868 election.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle is an {{ambassador}} for the Kick It Out scheme, which campaigns for inclusion and equality in football. He is also {{currently on the}} Management Committee of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), and it was announced on 17 November 2010 that Carlisle would succeed Chris Powell {{as the chairman of}} the PFA. As part of his work with the PFA, he collects the views of his fellow professionals and reports back to the committee. He also visits local schools to give talks to the students. Carlisle <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> criticised FIFA president Sepp Blatter following his comments in November 2011 that racism was no longer a problem in football. In February 2012, he was part of a PFA delegation that met with British Prime Minister David Cameron to discuss the issues of racism and homophobia in the sport.|$|E
5|$|During April 2011 {{internal}} deliberations of the president's innermost {{circle of}} advisors {{over whether to}} order U.S. special forces to conduct a raid into Pakistan against Osama bin Laden, Clinton <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> argued in favor, saying the importance of getting bin Laden outweighed the risks to the U.S. relationship with Pakistan. Following completion of the mission on May 2, which resulted in bin Laden's death, Clinton {{played a key role}} in the administration's decision not to release photographs of the dead al-Qaeda leader. During internal discussions regarding Iraq in 2011, Clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 10,000–20,000 U.S. troops there (all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement failed).|$|E

5|$|Stories of Leif's {{journey to}} North America had a {{profound}} effect on the identity and self-perception of later Nordic Americans and Nordic immigrants to the United States. The first statue of Leif (by Anne Whitney) was erected in Boston in 1887 at the instigation of Eben Norton Horsford, who <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> believed that Vinland could have been located on the Charles River or Cape Cod; not long after, another casting of Whitney's statue was erected in Milwaukee. A statue was also erected in Chicago in 1901, having been originally commissioned for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition to coincide with the arrival of the reconstructed Viking ship from Bergen, Norway. Another work of art made for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, the painting Leiv Eiriksson oppdager Amerika by Christian Krohg, was in the possession of a Leif Erikson Memorial Association in Chicago before being given back to the National Gallery of Norway in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Allen and Clay, both lawyers by profession, {{were hurt}} by a general {{distrust}} of lawyers by the Kentucky electorate. Further, Allen {{had served as}} general counsel for Aaron Burr, and several anonymous letters to the state's newspapers {{accused him of being}} privy to Burr's alleged scheme to create an independent state in the southwest. Henry Clay <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> vigorously defended Allen from the charges. Scott also frequently spoke in highly complimentary terms of Allen. As a legislator, Green Clay pushed for measures favorable to debtors; he consequently enjoyed strong support from settlers south of the Green River, many of whom were squatters and land speculators who owed substantial debts to the state. To counter Scott's hero image, Clay supporters pointed to his service with George Rogers Clark in a 1782 expedition against the Shawnee, but the impact of this line of campaigning was minimal. As the most senior Revolutionary War officer in Kentucky, Scott became the recognized leader of the state's veterans' lobby. The Independence Day celebrations held around the state just before the August 1 election provided a boost for his campaign. On election day, he garnered 22,050 votes, compared to 8,430 votes for Allen and 5,516 votes for Clay.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly {{a minute and a}} half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} ship began its homeward voyage Christian and his discontented {{followers}} seized Bligh and {{took control of}} the vessel. Bligh and 18 loyalists were set adrift in an open boat; Heywood <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> remained with Bounty. Later, he and 15 others left the ship and settled in Tahiti, while Bounty sailed on, ending its voyage at Pitcairn Island. Bligh, after an epic open-boat journey, eventually reached England, where he implicated Heywood as one of the mutiny's prime instigators. In 1791 Heywood and his companions were met with in Tahiti by the search vessel , and held in irons for transportation to England. Heywood and one other actually went out to the Pandora in canoes , very happy to be rescued-as they thought. They were then arrested and treated barbarously by the Captain, Edward Edwards, who had them and 12 others fettered and handcuffed in an 11 ft. box built for the purpose on deck. Their subsequent journey was prolonged and eventful; Pandora was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef, four of Heywood's fellow prisoners were drowned, and Heywood himself was fortunate to survive, being the 3rd last {{to get out of the}} box, which had only an exit 18 inches sq. in the roof..|$|E
5|$|Stigwood and Russell {{decided to}} hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's {{worldwide}} productions, with an undisclosed number performing screen tests in New York and London. In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at Elstree Studios. Karla DeVito <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> auditioned {{for the role of}} Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested Liza Minnelli wearing a blonde wig and custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better suited for the role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted Elaine Paige, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed the outlines of the stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on gurneys in white corridors as she is being treated for cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.|$|E
5|$|While {{active as}} a runner, Nurmi {{was known to}} be secretive about his {{training}} methods. Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him. Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him. After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden. However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games. In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men's clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki. It became a popular tourist attraction, and Emil Zátopek <b>was</b> <b>among</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> visited the store trying to meet Nurmi. The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction. As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each. Within five years, he was rated a millionaire. His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi's flats, at half price. Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people.|$|E
