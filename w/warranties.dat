5|$|In 2004 and 2005, two state-level {{class action}} suits were filed against Apple in New York and California alleging the first, second, and third {{generation}} iPod music players sold prior to May 2004 {{did not have}} the battery life represented and/or that the battery's capacity to take and hold a charge substantially diminished over time. Rather than litigate these claims, Apple entered into a settlement agreement in August 2005 after a fairness hearing in the California action, with the settlement terms designed to end the New York action as well. An appeal followed the California court's approval of the settlement but the appellate court upheld the settlement in December 2005. Eligible members of the class were entitled to extended <b>warranties,</b> store credit, cash compensation, or battery replacement, and some incentive payments, with all unfiled claims expiring after September 2005. Apple agreed to pay all costs of the litigation, including incentive payments to the class members and the plaintiffs' attorney fees, but admitted no fault. In 2006 Apple Canada, Inc., also settled several similar Canadian class action suits alleging misrepresentations by Apple regarding iPod battery life.|$|E

25|$|Statements of fact in a {{contract}} or in obtaining the contract {{are considered to}} be either <b>warranties</b> or representations. Traditionally, <b>warranties</b> are factual promises which are enforced through {{a contract}} legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance. Representations are traditionally precontractual statements which allow for a tort-based action (such as the tort of deceit) if the misrepresentation is negligent or fraudulent; historically a tort was the only action available, but by 1778, breach of warranty became a separate legal contractual action. In U.S. law, the distinction between the two is somewhat unclear; <b>warranties</b> are viewed as primarily contract-based legal action while negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations are tort-based, but there is a confusing mix of case law in the United States. In modern English law, sellers often avoid using the term 'represents' in order to avoid claims under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, while in America 'warrants and represents' is relatively common. Some modern commentators suggest avoiding the words and substituting 'state' or 'agree', and some model forms do not use the words; however, others disagree.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, <b>warranty</b> {{has its own}} {{priority}} in business strategy for a manufacturer to protect their benefit {{as well as the}} intense competition between the manufacturers. In fact, <b>warranty</b> is a contract between manufacturer and buyer in which the manufacturer gives the buyer certain assurances as the condition of the property being sold. In industry, an accurate prediction of optimal <b>warranty</b> period and <b>warranty</b> costs is often counted by the manufacturer. A <b>warranty</b> period may be unprofitable for the manufacturers if the choice of duration given is either too short or too long. Same thing goes to <b>warranty</b> cost which is an underestimation or overestimation of the <b>warranty</b> cost may have a high influence to the manufacturers. This paper presents a methodology to adapt historical maintenance <b>warranty</b> data with neuro-fuzzy approach. The main motivations for conducting this paper are simplicity and less computational mass of the neuro-fuzzy based on previous studies on this method compared to single method such neural network and fuzzy logic.

40|$|We {{consider}} a repairable product with known market entry and departure times. A <b>warranty</b> policy is offered with product purchase, under which a customer {{can have a}} failed item repaired free of charge in the <b>warranty</b> period.

40|$|Abstract—Customer {{feedback}} in {{the form}} of warranty/field performance is an important direct indicator of quality and robustness of a product.

The methodology consists of identifying relations between <b>warranty</b> failures and design/process variables using rough sets-based analysis on training data consisting of <b>warranty</b> information and manufacturing measurements.

40|$|<b>Warranty</b> is an {{important}} part of many organizations. <b>Warranty</b> costs take money directly away from corporations' bottom line. General Motors Corporations <b>warranty</b> liability costs its shareholders upwards of billion dollars annually. General Motors currently uses RedX, a systematic design of experiments methodology, to try to reduce <b>warranty</b> costs. Although this approach has reduced <b>warranty</b> costs, it has not done so neither fast nor sufficiently as high costs remains. The General Motors' <b>warranty</b> system was mapped and diagnosed. Interviews were conducted with all involved parties with the <b>warranty</b> system. Competitors <b>warranty</b> systems were compared and contrast to General Motors' <b>warranty</b> system. Other factors considered were new quality methods. The major factors limiting General Motors goals to reducing <b>warranty</b> are time to discover the failure and the time the fix the failure once it is discovered. Another factor is the culture and the lack of team environment within the <b>warranty</b> organization. General Motors should use telematics, onboard diagnostics, signature analysis, and a systemic approach which involves integrating the design and <b>warranty</b> organizations to predict and quickly eliminate defects from its manufacturing facilities. This approach will either eliminate failures quickly or prevent them from even becoming failures in the first place. by Jelani H. Ellington. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{success of}} a new product depends on both {{engineering}} decisions (product reliability) and marketing decisions (price, <b>warranty).</b> A higher reliability results in a higher manufacturing cost and higher sale price. Consumers {{are willing to pay}} a higher price only if they can be assured about product reliability. Product <b>warranty</b> is one such tool to signal reliability with a longer <b>warranty</b> period indicating better reliability. Better <b>warranty</b> terms result in increased sales and also higher expected <b>warranty</b> servicing costs. <b>Warranty</b> costs are reduced by improvements in product reliability. Learning effects result in the unit manufacturing cost decreasing with total sales volume and this in turn impacts on the sale price. As such, reliability, price and <b>warranty</b> decisions need to be considered jointly.
