5|$|As {{the result}} of the {{accidents}} in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably following the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, in 1988 the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler <b>Weather</b> <b>Radar</b> stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.|$|E
5|$|Isabel dropped {{light to}} {{moderate}} precipitation across {{the eastern half}} of Ohio, with isolated locations reporting over 3in (75mm). Moisture from Isabel dropped light rainfall across eastern Michigan and peaked at 1.55inches (39mm) at Mount Clemens. Additionally, Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> estimated rainfall approached 2.5inches (64mm) in St. Clair County. No damage was reported from Isabel in the region.|$|E
5|$|Rainbands are {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to}} as banded structure. Rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature.|$|E
50|$|Winburn {{was also}} {{involved}} {{in the implementation of}} the first operational <b>weather</b> <b>radars.</b> In 1952, a Radar Storm Detection Unit, which was a modified World War II Navy radar, was installed in Amarillo. Then, in 1961, one of the Weather Bureau's first network <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> (WSR-57) was commissioned in Amarillo. Other rapid changes in technology were ushered in by Winburn, such as the installation of warning teletype communications in 1955, and the transfer of Upper Atmospheric (Radiosonde) observations to the local office in 1956.|$|R
5000|$|Research in <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> in Canada {{began at}} the end of the Second World War with [...] "Project Stormy Weather". After the war, J.S. Marshall {{continued}} at McGill University the work with the [...] "Stormy Weather Group". The Canadian network was thus gradually formed and by 1997, there were 19 <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> of two kinds across the country: 18 five centimeter wavelength (C-Band) radars and 1 ten centimeter wavelength (S-Band) at McGill, all of the radars detected reflectivity and are equipped with Doppler capabilities.|$|R

5|$|Unlike birds, {{many small}} insects are swept {{along by the}} {{prevailing}} winds {{although many of the}} larger insects are known to make migrations. Aphids are known to be transported long distances by low-level jet streams. As such, fine line patterns associated with converging winds within <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> imagery, like the WSR-88D radar network, often represent large groups of insects.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this general}} {{support for the}} concept of wind power in the public at large, local {{opposition}} often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects. For example, there are concerns that some installations can negatively affect TV and radio reception and Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radar,</b> as well as produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values. Potential broadcast-reception solutions include predictive interference modeling {{as a component of}} site selection. A study of 50,000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected.|$|E
5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, the NHC was {{separated}} from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami {{was no longer in}} a position above the hurricane center director. By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in San Francisco was decommissioned. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blew the WSR-57 <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and the anemometer off the roof of NHC's/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Alpha's origins {{were from}} a {{tropical}} wave that developed near the Windward Islands on October20. Satellite images indicated that a low pressure center associated with the tropical wave formed near Barbados and moved west-northwest with increasing convective activity. In an area of light wind shear, the convection increased and Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> data from Puerto Rico detected a well-defined cyclonic circulation. On October22, the {{area of low pressure}} organized into Tropical Depression 25, southeast of Hispaniola. Shortly thereafter, satellite imagery indicated that a closed circulation had developed, and the associated convection had started banding. Later that same day, the depression had organized enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Alpha; {{this was the first time}} the National Hurricane Center had to use a Greek name for an Atlantic hurricane.|$|E
5|$|As the day wore on, {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and more favorable for thunderstorms, and {{more and more}} similar to the events of March 20. <b>Weather</b> <b>radar</b> images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E
40|$|The Python ARM Radar Toolkit is {{a package}} for reading, visualizing, {{correcting}} and analysing data from <b>weather</b> <b>radars.</b> Development began {{to meet the}} needs of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility and has since expanded to provide a general-purpose framework for working with data from <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> in the Python programming language. The toolkit is built on top of libraries in the Scientific Python ecosystem including NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, and makes use of Cython for interfacing with existing radar libraries written in C and to speed up computationally demanding algorithms. The source code for the toolkit is available on GitHub and is distributed under a BSD license...|$|R
50|$|NEXRAD or Nexrad (Next-Generation Radar) is {{a network}} of 159 {{high-resolution}} S-band Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> operated by the National Weather Service (NWS), an agency of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) within the United States Department of Commerce, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) within the Department of Transportation, and the U.S. Air Force within the Department of Defense. Its technical name is WSR-88D, which stands for <b>Weather</b> Surveillance <b>Radar,</b> 1988, Doppler.|$|R

5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of a wake depression. The most direct is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of mesoscale networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On weather satellite and <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> imagery, wake lows and heat bursts normally occur on the rear side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity data from a WSR-88D doppler radar, high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low.|$|E
5|$|Nymphs live {{primarily}} in streams under rocks, in decaying vegetation, or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, {{but they are}} among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which Ephemera vulgata burrows, the filamentous gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange.|$|E
5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that these events share similar patterns in observed synoptic <b>weather,</b> <b>radar,</b> and lightning characteristics, suggesting the possibility of predicting these events prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing {{research in this area}} is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.|$|E
30|$|From this simplification, the SIR of the WRNS can be {{expected}} to be around 29 dB if we assume that other factors (antenna H/W, weather conditions, etc.) are the same or similar over the <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> in the network.|$|R
50|$|Phazotron builds radars and radar {{weapon and}} defense control systems for aircraft, gun-missile {{ground-based}} and ship-borne air defense systems.

5000|$|The antenna {{blind cone}} is also {{referred}} to as the cone of silence, especially in America. This term is also used for <b>weather</b> <b>radars.</b> NEXRAD radars make two-dimensional scans at varying angles ranging from 0.5° above level to 19.5° above level (during a significant weather event). These levels become much closer to the ground, and closer to each other, as they get closer to the radar site, rendering them of little use for the three-dimensional profiling such multi-level scanning is meant to provide. Thus, a weather event located very close to and/or directly overhead of the radar site will be mostly situated in the [...] "cone of silence." [...] This {{is part of the reason}} why most U.S. <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> partially overlap each other's territories.|$|R
5|$|Rigorous {{attempts}} to warn of tornadoes {{began in the}} United States in the mid-20th century. Before the 1950s, the only method of detecting a tornado was by someone seeing it on the ground. Often, news of a tornado would reach a local weather office after the storm. However, {{with the advent of}} <b>weather</b> <b>radar,</b> areas near a local office could get advance warning of severe weather. The first public tornado warnings were issued in 1950 and the first tornado watches and convective outlooks in 1952. In 1953 it was confirmed that hook echoes are associated with tornadoes. By recognizing these radar signatures, meteorologists could detect thunderstorms probably producing tornadoes from dozens of miles away.|$|E
5|$|The AW101 is {{equipped}} with the Blue Kestrel search and detection radar which is capable of 360 degree scanning and can detect small targets as far as 25 nautical miles. As part of the Royal Navy's Merlin HM2 upgrade program, Lockheed Martin implemented a series of improvements to the radar, notably allowing it to track 40 {{times the number of}} targets previously capable. Danish EH101s are fitted with the RDR-1600 search and <b>weather</b> <b>radar.</b> Royal Navy Merlins are equipped with the AQS901 anti-submarine system for processing sonographic data from sonobuoys to detect and target submerged submarines. The AQS901 was derived from the system on the earlier Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} types of thunderstorms: single-cell, {{multi-cell}} cluster, multi-cell lines, and supercells. Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can {{be responsible for the}} development of hurricanes. Dry thunderstorms, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: <b>weather</b> <b>radar,</b> weather stations, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century. Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and, probably, Venus.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring the Mesoscale Alpine Programme experiment, three Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> and a VHF wind-profiler radar were {{deployed}} in the lago Maggiore area. The VHF radar was located in the area scanned by the <b>weather</b> <b>radars.</b> For IOP- 2 a (September 17 – 18, 1999), 3 -D wind fields were retrieved from dual Doppler weather observations using the MANDOP analysis. In this paper, we present {{the impact on the}} reconstruction of the wind field when VHF wind-profiler radar data are used as an additional constraint among dual Doppler-radar measurements. The interest of VHF radar data is related to observations at the upper limit of, and above, the convective cell; and to the vertical wind measurements, not measured by Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radars.</b> The experiment consists to integrate the horizontal wind, or the vertical wind and both of them in the retrieval. For each case, the difference between the reference and the new wind-field is computed. The positive effect of including VHF wind measurements in the upper layers, above 5 km, is demonstrated in that it helps to get a better conditioning of the system, especially along the radar base line, which is the classical “hard region” for retrieving the three-dimensional wind field in a dual Doppler-radar configuration...|$|R
