5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, {{drastic changes}} to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E
5|$|Cohn {{picks up}} Dales and takes {{him to the}} office of the Director who gives him a speech about patriotism and convinces him to help bring in Skur. They take Dales back to the bar to meet Skur, who attacks Dales. Bill Mulder and the other agent <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> until they think Dales is dead before rushing in to find that Dales has handcuffed Skur and is still alive.|$|E
5|$|Roger rallies Don as they <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> Baxter's (Ray Wise) office. Inside, Don puts aside Baxter's {{concerns}} about the advertised anti-smoking letter and insists Dow Chemical needs a new agency, despite having 50% of the market share. Don chides Baxter and his staff for allowing Dow {{to be satisfied with}} a 50% market share when they should go after more - and SCDP is the agency that can help them do it.|$|E

5|$|The three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals Bobby's phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick {{go inside}} while Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy {{attack from the}} peanut butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by {{stabbing}} him with an EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale reluctantly <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen) is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, {{she sends}} Lauren {{a message and}} meets her outside the police station, looking rough, as she has been arrested for shoplifting. Whitney opts to live with Dot Branning (June Brown) instead of her close family, but Dot convinces her {{to move back to}} Ricky's. When Ryan returns from a holiday, he learns of Whitney's ordeal and urges her to go to the police and get tested for sexually transmitted infections. She says she is not ready to go to the police but agrees to the test, which shows she has a chlamydia infection. When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells her how much he loves her, but when Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave. Fatboy calls Ryan, who comes to Southend to look for Rob. When he finds him, they fight and fall {{over the edge of the}} pier. The next day, a body is recovered from the sea, and is later revealed to be Rob who has died. Whitney thinks Ryan may also be dead until he appears. She tells him she has told the police everything about Rob, including Ryan's fight with him, and Ryan tells Whitney he has to leave. They say an emotional farewell.|$|E
25|$|Canberra Cabs {{and partner}} taxi {{companies}} {{provide services to}} the airport taxi rank. An enclosed waiting area was opened in November 2013, aiming to improve the experience for arriving passengers who would otherwise <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> in Canberra's relative climate extremes. Hire car companies maintain {{a presence in the}} terminal and Uber pick-up and drop offs are permitted with a $3 fee charged to drivers.|$|E

25|$|Alexander VI had {{initially}} sided with Ferdinand of Aragon but in 1498 recognized Louis XII of France, the heir of Charles VIII, as {{the king of}} Naples. Nevertheless, Ferdinand had made serious gains in the war, forcing Louis to send a reinforcement force in 1503 which neared Rome when Alexander VI died in August. Rather than continue to Naples, Louis XII ordered his force to <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> Rome {{for the duration of}} the conclave. The Neapolitan army was only forty miles to the South as well.|$|E
25|$|Davis was a {{headliner}} at The Frontier Casino in Las Vegas, but he {{was required}} (as were all black performers in the 1950s) to lodge in a rooming house {{on the west side}} of the city, instead of in the hotels as his white colleagues did. No dressing rooms were provided for black performers, and they had to <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> by the swimming pool between acts. Davis and other black artists could entertain but could not stay at the hotels where they performed, gamble in the casinos, or dine or drink in the hotel restaurants and bars. Davis later refused to work at places which practiced racial segregation.|$|E
25|$|A {{condition}} with this task is that candidates {{are advised to}} arrive back at the boardroom, or designated finish line, by a certain time or receive a fine for lateness; in this instance, the candidates had to {{be back at the}} boardroom by 5:30pm on this task. Although there appeared to be considerable uncertainty over whether Impact's sub-team of Saira, Paul and Raj would arrive back in time, it was later revealed that they had done so comfortably ahead of the deadline, and had been told to <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> for a while by the production crew in order to add a degree of suspense to the final edit.|$|E

25|$|Welles {{was in the}} {{meantime}} preparing an expedition for the relief of the garrison at Fort Sumter. As he was unaware that Powhatan would not be available, he included it in his plans. When the other vessels assigned to the effort showed up, the South Carolina troops at Charleston began to bombard Fort Sumter, and the Civil War was on. The relief expedition could only <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> the harbor. The expedition had little chance {{to be successful in}} any case; without the support of the guns on Powhatan, it was completely impotent. The only contribution made by the expedition was to carry the soldiers who had defended Fort Sumter back to the North following their surrender and parole.|$|E
25|$|Males and new queens take {{on their}} {{responsibilities}} in mid-September and mid-October, respectively. During this time, their body color becomes intense {{and the weight}} of the queen increases about 20%. Once the males and queen leave the nest, they do not return. In V. mandarinia, males <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> the nest entrance until the queen emerges. Once the queen emerges, they attack her midair, bring her to the ground, and copulate from 8 to 45 seconds. After this episode, the males return to the entrance for a second chance, while the queen leaves. Interestingly, many queens attempt to fight off the males and leave unfertilized. After this episode, queens are found in moist, subterranean habitats.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{learning}} from fellow tenants of 23 Cranley Gardens that the tenant {{of the top}} floor flat from where the human remains had been flushed was Dennis Andrew Nilsen, and that he worked in a job centre in Kentish Town, Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay and two colleagues opted to <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> 23 Cranley Gardens until Nilsen returned home from work. When Nilsen returned home, DCI Jay introduced himself and his colleagues; explaining {{they had come to}} enquire about the blockage in the drains from his flat. Nilsen asked why the police would be interested in his drains and also if the two officers present with Jay were health inspectors. In response, Jay informed Nilsen the other two were also police officers and requested access to his flat to discuss the matter further.|$|E

25|$|Task Review - The losing {{team are}} {{subjected}} to a more detailed, extensive review of their performance in the boardroom, with Lord Sugar and his advisers being more openly critical of any team member's performance on the task, particularly those who performed poorly or contributed very little, while candidates argue their case for staying in the competition, often highlighting others in their team and countering any criticism they receive that they feel is unfounded. Once discussions are brought to an end, the team's project manager for the task is asked to select two candidates from their team to accompany them into for a final boardroom discussion, {{with the power of}} their choice meaning that anyone can be selected, whether they were responsible for the failure of the task or considered to be by the PM, or are someone whom the PM has issues with such as personality clashes. Those not picked are sent back to the candidates' accommodation for that series, while Sugar and his advisers have a private discussion amongst themselves about the PM and their choices after the group are told to <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> the boardroom; if the team only consists of two or three candidates, they are simply told to step outside {{at the end of the}} team's discussion period.|$|E
25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or {{to the back of}} the store, brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product on the same day but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E
500|$|As Lennon and Ono {{walked to}} a limousine, shared with the RKO Radio crew, they were {{approached}} by several people seeking autographs. Among them was Mark David Chapman. It was common for fans to <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> the Dakota to meet Lennon and ask for his autograph. Chapman, a 25-year-old security guard from Honolulu, Hawaii, had previously travelled to New York to murder Lennon in October (before the release of Double Fantasy), but had {{changed his mind and}} returned home. Chapman silently handed Lennon a copy of Double Fantasy, and Lennon obliged with an autograph. After signing the album, Lennon asked, [...] "Is this all you want?" [...] Chapman smiled and nodded in agreement. Photographer and Lennon fan Paul Goresh took a photo of the encounter.|$|E

500|$|When Stewart finished, he {{went into}} the hall to find Colbert was gone to tape his show. On the set of The Colbert Report, Colbert was {{discussing}} John McCain's rise in the polls, and joked that since the media had said that [...] "a vote for Mike Huckabee is a vote for McCain", and Colbert was Huckabee's [...] "running mate," [...] then Colbert, [...] "by the transitive property of Huckabee", was really McCain. He was soon interrupted by Stewart and O'Brien, who had just left the set of The Daily Show to continue their fight. [...] Stewart jokingly claimed that, since he had [...] "made" [...] both Colbert and O'Brien, Stewart himself was McCain—clearly provoking O'Brien. After some playful attacks, Colbert persuaded the two to <b>wait</b> <b>outside</b> until he finished taping his show.|$|E
500|$|At {{the concert}} venue, Louise scoffs at the band's obsessed female fans, warns Tina that [...] "a lot of puberty" [...] awaits {{her at the}} concert, and plans to <b>wait</b> <b>outside.</b> However, she is forced to bring Tina inside to prevent her from fainting. Meanwhile, Gene impresses the judges with a magic-themed table display and {{advances}} to the top four. Having not fully read the competition rule book, however, he is left unprepared to produce a second table display for the next round. The concert begins before Louise can exit, and she remains unimpressed until the band's prepubescent youngest member, Boo Boo, comes onstage. Louise is left frozen in awe by his looks, and once the band's first song starts she starts excitedly screaming out his name. Horrified at what she has done, she runs out in denial about liking Boo Boo, having never had a previous crush.|$|E
500|$|This {{resulted}} in a three-part comedic battle between the three faux-pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows on February 4, 2008. It all began {{on the set of}} The Daily Show, when Colbert, to thunderous applause, interrupted the middle of a seemingly normal show to thank Stewart for settling the feud. [...] Stewart at first responded happily to this, but then grew visibly frightened once Colbert informed him of O'Brien's response from a few days before. Colbert then began taunting O'Brien, calling him [...] "cheap", [...] "stupid" [...] and [...] "lazy"—much to Stewart's chagrin, who begged Colbert to stop. It was too late, however, as O'Brien, accompanied by thunderous applause, quickly walked in and furiously scolded the two for keeping the feud going. [...] A seething Colbert, nonetheless, refused to back down, and even snarled at O'Brien: [...] "You want to tangle, Red?" [...] O'Brien agreed, but as the two prepared to take the fight outside, Stewart reminded them that he had to finish his show. O'Brien and Colbert agreed to <b>wait</b> <b>outside,</b> where they engaged in idle chit chat.|$|E
