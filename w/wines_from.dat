5|$|Riesling <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Germany cover a {{vast array}} of tastes from sweet to off-dry halbtrocken to dry trocken. Late harvest Rieslings can ripen to become very sweet dessert wines of the beerenauslese (BA) and trockenbeerenauslese (TBA) class.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, {{and the types of}} harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|The {{taste of}} the red wine depends on the {{ripeness}} of the grapes from which it is made. Red berry fruit flavors like raspberry predominate in <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> cooler areas, whereas blackberry, anise and pepper notes are more common in wines made in warmer areas and in wines made from the earlier-ripening Primitivo clone.|$|E
25|$|Red <b>wine</b> <b>from</b> the Santenots {{vineyard}} {{is classified}} as Volnay Santenots, whereas white <b>wine</b> <b>from</b> the same vineyard can call itself Meursault Premier Cru or Meursault Santenots.|$|R

5|$|Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc {{was one of}} {{the first}} fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in {{commercial}} quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These wines are kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. <b>Wines</b> <b>from</b> cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E

5|$|Two other {{well known}} Cabernet Sauvignon flavors are mint and eucalyptus. Mint flavors are often {{associated}} with wine regions that are warm enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. There is some belief that soil {{could also be a}} contributor to the minty notes, since the flavor also appears in some <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> the Pauillac region but not from similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus flavors tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wines</b> <b>from</b> the Languedoc {{can carry}} an {{enormous}} number of names, ranging from broad regional designations like Vin de Pays d'Oc to very specific geographical classifications with restrictions on grape variety, like Corbières and Minervois. Since the 1990s, the INAO has been creating smaller AOC classifications which take into account the intricate microclimates and soil variations in the Languedoc-Roussillon. Younger appellations like the Cabardes and subregions like Minervois la Livinière, Corbières-Boutenac and St-Chinian-Berlou are much smaller in scope. While these new appellations have been praised for consistently improving their product, others have criticized the additions for further complicating an already esoteric system of classification.|$|E
5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E

25|$|Chianti Classico are premium Chianti wines {{that tend}} to be medium-bodied with firm tannins and {{medium-high}} to high acidity. Floral, cherry and light nutty notes are characteristic aromas with the wines expressing more notes on the mid-palate and finish than {{at the front of}} the mouth. As with Bordeaux, the different zones of Chianti Classico have unique characteristics that can be exemplified and perceived in some <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> those areas. According to Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, Chianti Classico <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> the Castellina area tend to have a very delicate aroma and flavour, Castelnuovo Berardegna wines tend to be the most ripe and richest tasting, <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> Gaiole tend to have been characterised by their structure and firm tannins while <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> the Greve area tend to have very concentrated flavours.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} the Finger Lakes wine {{industry}} in New York State {{and the success of}} Riesling <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> the region has resulted in an increasing number of producers such as Swedish Hill Vineyards making méthode champenoise sparkling <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> primarily or 100% Riesling. Finger Lakes producers such as Glenora and Casa Larga are also producing méthode champenoise sparkling wine from other grapes such as the traditional Chardonnay and Pinot noir.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wines</b> <b>from</b> the Central Valley of La Morra and Barolo {{tend to be}} very perfumed and velvety {{with less}} tannins than other Barolos. The soil of the Central Valley itself is more clay based with {{increased}} levels of magnesium oxide and manganese. The <b>wines</b> <b>from</b> the Serralunga Valley are more full bodied and tannic and require aging of 12–15 years before they hit their peak. The soil of the Serralunga is heavy in sand, iron, limestone, phosphorus and potassium.|$|E
