25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, {{who do not know}} what to do with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The way it works, if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E

500|$|Faust and the {{production}} team have acknowledged some of the fandom and fan-created elements of the show and incorporated them into the animation. Though Hasbro's priority is to deliver a child-friendly show, the writers and production staff, according to Linda Steiner, {{senior vice president of}} Hasbro Studios, [...] "We will certainly, for fun, do the 'bronie' check to see if this could pass with them, but our job is to deliver to the kids first." [...] Margaret Loesch, {{president and chief executive of}} Hub Network, said that they have kept their nods to the fandom to subtle hints. She added, [...] "We haven't driven this movement, the fans have, and we don't want to get ahead of that. We want to nourish this phenomenon, not manipulate it." [...] A writer for the show, Meghan McCarthy, said, [...] "Some pop culture-y things are thrown in, but we don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that's too 'wink wink'. It detracts from the story that we're trying to tell". Many of the nods to the older audience are drawn in by the storyboard artists and animators, who are challenged to populate scripted scenes with background ponies; McCarthy points the example of ponies fashioned after the main characters from The Big Lebowski due to having to fill in space for scenes set in a bowling alley for the episode [...] "The Cutie Pox".|$|E
500|$|The Berle shows drew {{such high}} ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 {{appearance}} on NBC's Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, no fan {{of rock and}} roll, introduced a [...] "new Elvis" [...] in a white bow tie and black tails. Presley sang [...] "Hound Dog" [...] {{for less than a}} minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bow tie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, [...] "Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd... set things up so that Presley would show his contrition". Allen, for his part, later wrote that he found Presley's [...] "strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing" [...] and simply worked the singer into the customary [...] "comedy fabric" [...] of his program. Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, [...] "I'm holding down on this show. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance." [...] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career. Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local TV show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism to which he was being subjected, Presley responded, [...] "No, I haven't, I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong.... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music.... I mean, how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Herald Tribune began {{a decline}} shortly after World War II that had several causes. [...] The Reid family was long {{accustomed}} to resolve shortfalls {{at the newspaper}} with subsidies from their fortune, rather than improved business practices, seeing the paper [...] "as a hereditary possession to be sustained as a public duty rather than developed as a profit-making opportunity". [...] With its generally marginal profitability, the Herald Tribune had few opportunities to reinvest in its operations as the Times did, and the Reids' mortgage on the newspaper {{made it difficult to}} raise outside cash for needed capital improvements. After another profitable year in 1946, Bill Robinson, the Herald Tribunes business manager, decided to reinvest the profits to make needed upgrades to the newspaper's pressroom. [...] The investment squeezed the paper's resources, and Robinson decided {{to make up the difference}} at the end of the year by raising the Tribunes price from three cents to a nickel, expecting the Times, which also needed to upgrade its facilities, to do the same. [...] However, the Times, concerned by the Tribunes performance during the war, refused to go along. [...] "We didn't want to give them any quarter," [...] Times circulation manager Nathan Goldstein said. [...] "Our numbers were on the rise, and we didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to jeopardize them. 'No free rides for the competition' was the way we looked at it." [...] The move proved disastrous: In 1947, the Tribunes daily circulation fell nine percent, from 348,626 to 319,867. [...] Its Sunday circulation fell four percent, from 708,754 to 680,691. [...] Although the overall percentage of advertising for the paper was higher than it was in 1947, the Times was still higher: 58 percent of the average space in the New York Times in 1947 was devoted to advertising, versus a little over 50 percent of the Tribune. [...] The Times would not raise its price until 1950.|$|E

500|$|Oxbow drew post {{position}} {{five for}} the Haskell, carried the highest weight at 122 pounds, {{and was the}} second favorite in the race behind Verrazano. [...] Leading for {{the early part of}} the race, Oxbow was challenged for the lead by Verrazano at the three-quarter-mile marker, then weakened and finished fourth, earning another $60,000. Stevens felt something was wrong with Oxbow at the half-mile pole, later saying the horse [...] "didn’t feel like he did in any of the Triple Crown races", and Lukas stated the jockey [...] "kind of held" [...] Oxbow from that point on. Oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing the finish line, then his rider jumped off and removed the saddle when Oxbow failed to jog sound on the track. [...] The horse walked back to the barn without obvious sign of injury, and radiographs of his right front ankle revealed no fracture, but he did have a soft tissue injury to the area, described as a [...] "sprain". Of Oxbow's overall health, Lukas commented, [...] "he had a pretty set of X-rays. It's amazing. For a horse with that many , they were really clean." [...] Nonetheless, as a result of the soft tissue injury, Oxbow was taken out of races for the duration of the summer, and after three weeks of hand-walking at Saratoga was shipped home to Calumet in mid-August, with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013. Lukas said: [...] "He's been a warrior and a hell of a nice horse for us and I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to jeopardize his future down the line." [...] On October 25, 2013, Calumet Farm announced the decision to retire Oxbow. Combined with his winnings in his two-year-old season, his lifetime race earnings were $1,243,500. [...] He stood at stud for the 2014 breeding season at [...] Taylor Made Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for an introductory stud fee of $20,000. He closed out the year ranked 17th in earnings with $1,146,000 won in 2013.

2500|$|In April 1961 Stevenson {{suffered}} the greatest humiliation of his diplomatic {{career in the}} Bay of Pigs invasion. After hearing rumors that [...] "a lot of refugees {{wanted to go back}} and overthrow Castro", Stevenson voiced his skepticism about an invasion, but [...] "he was kept on the fringes of the operation, receiving...nine days before the invasion, only an unduly vague briefing by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr." [...] and the CIA. [...] Senior CIA official Tracy Barnes told Stevenson and his staff that [...] "there {{was going to be a}} clandestine operation in Cuba...it was strictly a Cuban affair. It would have some American cooperation, but only with the training and financing." [...] According to historian Peter Wyden, Barnes did not tell Stevenson that there would be a large-scale invasion of Cuba, nor did he provide details about the full extent of American support for, and involvement with, the Cuban rebels, nor did he tell Stevenson about the planned air strikes to destroy Castro's air force. Assistant Secretary of State Harlan Cleveland, who attended the briefing, felt that Barnes was [...] "too evasive", that he had been sent to reassure Stevenson that Kennedy [...] "knew what he was doing", and that [...] "evidently Stevenson was not to be told" [...] the full details of the invasion plan. Historian Garry Wills has written that [...] "news of the invasion was leaking out...Castro knew the landings would occur; only Adlai Stevenson was kept in the dark" [...] about the invasion by President Kennedy and his aides. Kennedy, anticipating that Stevenson might be angered at being left out of the discussions over whether to invade Cuba, told Schlesinger that [...] "the integrity and credibility of Adlai Stevenson constitute one of our great national assets. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to jeopardize that", and he asked Schlesinger to let Stevenson know that the president was shielding him from many of the details to protect him in case the clandestine operation failed. Instead, as Robert Dallek has written, [...] "by leaving him out of the discussion it led to his humiliation." [...] Unaware that the anti-Castro Cuban exiles landing at the Bay of Pigs were being armed and assisted directly by the CIA and US Navy, and that American pilots were participating in bombing raids of Cuban targets, Stevenson unwittingly [...] "repeated a CIA cover story in a speech before the UN General Assembly." [...] He argued that the rebels were not assisted in any way by the U.S. government; when this claim was proven to be false Stevenson complained that [...] "I took this job on the understanding that I would be consulted and kept fully informed on everything. Now my credibility has been compromised and therefore my usefulness." [...] When he told his friend Harlan Cleveland that his own government had [...] "deliberately tricked" [...] him into believing there was no direct American involvement in the invasion, Cleveland replied [...] "I feel as betrayed as you do." [...] Stevenson seriously considered resigning, but was convinced by his friends and President Kennedy to stay.|$|E
