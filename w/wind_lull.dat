40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to assess the health impact from air {{pollution}} in Ravenna, a small Italian city located in the Pianura Padana. In this area the environmental pressure, because of air pollution, is worsened by unfavourable meteorological conditions. In fact Ravenna, {{in addition to being}} a large industrial area and one of the most important commercial harbours of Italy, has a temperate-continental climate characterised by a high relative humidity, because of the presence of fog, frequent thermal inversions during the winter and frequent conditions of <b>wind</b> <b>lull.</b> Because of these peculiar meteorological conditions and high pollutant emissions, e. g. from intense industrial activities, often alarming levels of air pollution occur, giving public health concern. These conditions stimulated the present study of the effects of air pollution on health in the area of Ravenna using the EVA model. This system was developed in the Atmospheric Modelling (ATMO) section of the Environmental Science Department of the Aarhus University (DK) to assess health-related economic externalities of air pollution, considering the main emission sectors and quantifying their relative importance in term of impacts on human health...|$|E
60|$|Bert {{watched his}} partner as he strode rapidly across the prairie, now lost to sight as a racing troop of snow-waves, running shoulder-high, shot between, now reappearing as the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{about half}} an hour the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled</b> a little and I could get a better view of our surroundings, {{although}} I could not see very far through the swiftly descending snow.|$|R
60|$|Before it was {{sufficiently}} light to distinguish surrounding objects the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled,</b> and, standing erect each looked anxiously {{down the side}} of the mountain, waiting impatiently for the rising of the sun.|$|R
60|$|He {{soon found}} that, until the wind {{went down and}} the surf moderated somewhat, no {{communication}} could be effected. The next morning, however, the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled,</b> and a crowd of curious native boats were seen putting off from the shore.|$|R
60|$|And now {{the shadows}} of evening were slowly invading the plains. The autumn <b>wind,</b> <b>lulled</b> for a time to rest with {{the setting of the}} sun, had sprung up in angry gusts, lashing up clouds from the {{southwest}} and sending them to tear along and efface the last vestige of the evening crimson glow.|$|R
60|$|The <b>wind</b> <b>lulled</b> {{as if it}} feared to waken them. Feathery drifts of snow, shaken {{from the}} long pine boughs, flew like white winged birds, and settled about them as they slept. The moon through the rifted clouds looked down upon {{what had been the}} camp. But all human stain, all trace of earthly travail, was hidden beneath the spotless mantle mercifully flung from above.|$|R
6000|$|Some one at this {{critical}} time, with the characteristic eagerness of poor {{human nature to}} [...] "put its finger in the pie," [...] cried out [...] "Now!" [...] and another shouted [...] "Pull!" [...] but Mr Coxwell, regardless of every one, decided for himself; and, just when the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled</b> and the sun shone bright, and the balloon stood proudly erect, he pulled the trigger and they were free.|$|R
60|$|Because of {{the fury}} of the tempest, {{it seemed as if}} its force must be quickly spent, and the besieged waited in painful suspense, fearing that the downpour of water would speedily cease; but the moments went by amid the {{flashing}} of lightning and crashing of thunder, without any abatement of the tempest, save as the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled</b> for a few seconds to come in yet more spiteful gusts.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} in the boat {{for the next five}} minutes, as the boys sat with their heads bent down. More than one choking sob might have been heard, had the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled,</b> as they thought of the dear ones at home. Suddenly there was a flash of light ahead, and the boom of a gun {{directly}} afterwards came upon their ears. Then a rocket soared up into the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "With me then, sir, let the {{responsibility}} rest. I request that Captain Manual, with twenty men, may be put under my orders, if that gentleman does not dislike the duty." [...] The marine bowed, and cast a glance of triumph at Barnstable. [...] "I will take my own cutter, with her tried crew, go {{on board the}} schooner, and when the <b>wind</b> <b>lulls,</b> we will run in to the land, and then be governed by circumstances." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{ground was}} {{as soft as}} velvet, and my {{footsteps}} gave forth no sound. When the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled</b> I paused behind a tree and waited for another gusty roar. I kept {{very close to the}} trail, for that was the only means by which I could return to my horses. I felt the skin tighten on my face. Suddenly, as I paused, I beard angry voices, pitched high. But I could not make out the words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neville, {{you must}} answer me a question," [...] said the mother to him one morning {{when they were}} out together, looking down upon the Atlantic when the <b>wind</b> had <b>lulled</b> after a gale.|$|R
60|$|In one {{of these}} pauses borne in the wind faintly as if from very far away he heard a sound of {{knocking}}, just knocking on wood. He noticed that the <b>wind</b> had <b>lulled</b> suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|The truth is, {{my father}} was an object of {{suspicion}} to the frontiersmen. Even as a child I knew this, and resented it. He had brought me up in solitude, and I was old for my age, learned in some things far beyond my years, and ignorant of others I should have known. I loved the man passionately. In the long winter evenings, when the howl of wolves and [...] "painters" [...] rose as the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled,</b> he taught me to read from the Bible and the [...] "Pilgrim's Progress." [...] I can see his long, slim fingers on the page. They seemed but ill fitted for the life he led.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{put into}} harbour somewhere {{as soon as}} the <b>wind</b> <b>lulls.</b> We cannot venture yet, though we do steam; and then we can telegraph. I am longing to relieve Miss Prescott. We can take you home all the way. We were on our way into Rock Quay to take up Mysie Merrifield if she can go. It really was a {{wonderful}} and most merciful thing that we made you out just as it was getting light before running you down. My father saw you first, and old Griggs would hardly believe it, but then we heard Mr. Delrio's hail! But it was a terrible business getting you up the ship's side." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} the wind had dropped entirely. The {{topgallant}} masts were sent up with their yards and sails, and by dinner-time the Flying Scud looked more like herself. As soon as the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled</b> all on board were conscious of a sudden fall of temperature. Bundles of wraps were undone and greatcoats and cloaks got out, and although the sun was still shining brightly the poop of the Flying Scud soon presented a wintry appearance. There was no sitting about now. Even the ladies had abandoned their usual work, and by the sharp {{walking up and down}} on deck it was evident that even the warm wraps were insufficient in themselves, and that brisk exercise was necessary to keep up the circulation.|$|R
60|$|Nor was {{the village}} less {{attractive}} in its sounds {{than in the}} natural pleasing disorder of its aspect and the sheltering warmth of its street. In the fields and by the skimpy hedges perfect silence reigned; only the wind blowing in your face filled your ears with a rushing aerial sound like that which lives in a seashell. Coming back from this open bleak silent world, the village street seemed vocal with bird voices. For the birds, too, loved the shelter which had enabled them to live through that great frost; and they were now recovering their voices; and whenever the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled</b> and a gleam of sunshine fell from the grey sky, they were singing {{from end to end}} of the long street.|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} the wind moved the loose {{scales of the}} dragon. During an instant Ulpius {{remained}} silent, listening to the noise they produced. For the first time an expression of dread appeared on his face. His memory was obscurely reviving the incidents of his discovery of the deadly machinery in the vault when he first made his sojourn in the temple, when--filled with the confused remembrance of the mysterious rites and incantations, the secret sacrifices which he had witnessed and performed at Alexandria--he had found and followed the subterranean passage {{which led to the}} iron grating beneath the dragon. As the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled</b> again, and the clashing of the metal ceased with it, he began to give these recollections expression in words, uttering them in slow, solemn accents to himself.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{considerable}} time before Godfrey {{went off to}} sleep owing to the rapid changes of the angle at which he was lying. Sometimes his head was two or three feet higher than his feet, and directly afterwards the position was exactly reversed. The rolling was but slight, and this he scarcely felt, being too tightly packed in along with the furs and the dog to move much. But at last {{the noise of the}} water and the roar of the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled</b> him to sleep. He woke once, and then went off again, and his watch told him that he had been altogether asleep twelve hours. When he next woke, he felt at once that the motion was slighter than it had been and that the wind had greatly abated.|$|R
60|$|It was Sunday morning, the church-bells ringing, no <b>wind,</b> a <b>lull</b> in the sou'westerly gale--one {{of those}} calms that {{fall in the}} night and last, as a rule, twelve or fifteen hours, and the garden all strewn with leaves of every hue, from green spotted with yellow to deep copper.|$|R
60|$|It was a verdant valley, deep-set in the {{mountain}} walls, wild and sad and lonesome. The waterfall dominated {{the spirit of the}} place, dreamy and sleepy and tranquil; it murmured sweetly on one breath of <b>wind,</b> and <b>lulled</b> with another, and sometimes died out altogether, only to come again in soft, strange roar.|$|R
60|$|The {{stillness of}} the night, the {{soothing}} sounds of the foliage, moved to and fro by the gentle <b>wind,</b> soon <b>lulled</b> him to sleep, despite his anxiety; and when he next opened his eyes {{the sun was shining}} directly upon him through the leaves; but neither Sewatis nor the prisoner could be seen.|$|R
60|$|The English {{lieutenant}} {{knew his}} business too well, {{to abandon the}} ship while {{there was a chance}} of recovering her. The <b>wind</b> <b>lulled</b> a little, and he thought the hope of success worth an effort. Merely taking all the oars out of the Speedy's cutter, he dashed on in our wake. At first he gained, nor was I unwilling he should, for I wished to speak him. The main and fore-sheets were eased off, and Neb was told to keep the top-sails lifting. Thus favoured, he soon got within fifty yards of us, straining every nerve to get nearer. The officer pointed a musket at me, and ordered me to heave-to. I jumped off the taffrail, and, with my body covered to the shoulders, pointed one of the French muskets at him, and warned him to keep off.|$|R
60|$|Just at this time, {{when the}} <b>wind</b> seemed to <b>lull</b> for an instant, Jonas {{thought he heard}} a cry. He stopped his oxen to listen.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly, as {{the first}} puff of the night wind fanned my cheek, a strange, sweet, low moaning and sighing came to my ears. I almost thought I was in a dream. But the canyon, now blood-red, was there in {{overwhelming}} reality, a profound, solemn, gloomy thing, but real. The wind blew stronger, and then I was to a sad, sweet song, which <b>lulled</b> as the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled.</b> I realized at once that the sound {{was caused by the}} wind blowing into the peculiar formations of the cliffs. It changed, softened, shaded, mellowed, but it was always sad. It rose from low, tremulous, sweetly quavering sighs, to a sound like the last woeful, despairing wail of a woman. It was the song of the sea sirens and the music of the waves; it had the soft sough of the night wind in the trees, and the haunting moan of lost spirits.|$|R
60|$|The moon {{broke from}} behind a mass of clouds, and {{the eye of the}} woman was enabled to follow the finger of Ishmael. It pointed to a human form {{swinging}} in the wind, beneath the ragged and shining arm of the willow. Esther bent her head and veiled her eyes from the sight. But Ishmael drew nigher, and long contemplated his work in awe, though not in compunction. The leaves of the sacred book were scattered on the ground, and even a fragment of the shelf had been displaced by the kidnapper in his agony. But all was now in the stillness of death. The grim and convulsed countenance of the victim was at times brought full into the light of the moon, and again as the <b>wind</b> <b>lulled,</b> the fatal rope drew a dark line across its bright disk. The squatter raised his rifle, with extreme care, and fired. The cord was cut and the body came lumbering to the earth a heavy and insensible mass.|$|R
60|$|Strangely enough it was I who chanced {{upon the}} Nollichucky Trace, which follows the meanderings of that river northward {{through the great}} Smoky Mountains. It was made long ago by the Southern Indians as they {{threaded}} {{their way to the}} Hunting Lands of Kaintuckee, and shared now by Indian traders. The path was redolent with odors, and bright with mountain shrubs and flowers,--the pink laurel bush, the shining rhododendron, and the grape and plum and wild crab. The clear notes of the mountain birds were in our ears by day, and the music of the water falling over the ledges, mingled with that of the leaves rustling in the <b>wind,</b> <b>lulled</b> us to sleep at night. High above us, as we descended, the gap, from naked crag to timber-covered ridge, was spanned by the eagle's flight. And virgin valleys, where future generations were to be born, spread out and narrowed again,--valleys with a deep carpet of cane and grass, where the deer and elk and bear fed unmolested.|$|R
60|$|During {{the weight}} of the gust, no one had leisure, or indeed {{inclination}} to look to aught beyond its effect on the brig. Had one been otherwise disposed, the attempt would have been useless, for the wind had filled the air with spray, and near the islets even with sand. The lurid but fiery tinge, too, interposed a veil that no human eye could penetrate. As the tornado passed onward, however, and the <b>winds</b> <b>lulled,</b> the air again became clear, and in five minutes after the moment when the Swash lay nearly on her side, with her lower yard-arm actually within a few feet of the water, all was still and placid around her, as one is accustomed to see the ocean in a calm, of a summer's afternoon. Then it was that those who had been in such extreme jeopardy could breathe freely and look about them. On board the Swash all was well--not a rope-yarn had parted, or an eyebolt drawn. The timely precautions of Spike had saved his brig, and great was his joy thereat.|$|R
60|$|The thunder still pealed from without, but {{the rain}} and <b>wind</b> had {{partially}} <b>lulled.</b> The night hours had moved on more swiftly than our narrative {{of the events that}} marked them. It was now midnight.|$|R
60|$|When {{they were}} about half-way across the lake the <b>wind</b> {{suddenly}} <b>lulled,</b> and once more they heard the awful scream, {{and this time it}} sounded as though the crier was quite close to them. The occupants of the boat were terribly frightened, and one of them, after suddenly shrieking 'he's here,' fainted, and lay still {{at the bottom of the}} boat, while the monk and the other man stared straight before them, as though petrified.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} we are," [...] Frank said; [...] "but {{there is nothing}} to do but to keep on rowing. The <b>wind</b> may <b>lull</b> or it may shift and give us a chance of making for Ramsgate. The boat is a good sea boat, and may keep afloat even if we are driven out to sea. Or if we are missed from shore they may send the {{lifeboat}} out after us. That is our best chance." ...|$|R
5000|$|... and 6 {{months later}} it was {{reported}} asThe Rose, schooner, has returned from {{the wreck of the}} Jane Lockhart, on Masthead Reef, whither she went on June 15 Captain Dwyer informs us that the Jane Lockhart still lies in a very snug position, and he has no doubt but that himself, and Mr Norris, the purchaser of the wreck, will be able, ultimately, to raise the vessel and bring her safely to RockhamptonNearly the whole of the period that they were at the reef, very heavy weather prevailed, staving operations towards the recovery of the cargo, but luckily the strong SE <b>winds</b> <b>lulled</b> for about three days Captain Dwyer availed himself of the occasion, set to work, rigged up a staging between the masts of the Lockhart, schooner, and by means of a rope and a South Sea Island diver, managed to bring up from eighty to ninety large iron pulley wheels, besides a quantity of machinery and sundries, comprising Ale, porter, liqueur brandy, cutlery, ironmongery, etc Unfortunately the Roses water ran out, much to the chagrin of the crew, who would have raised a great deal more, only having to run into port for supplies ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of the tempest there came a sudden <b>lull.</b> <b>Wind</b> and water alike seemed hushed. And out of the lull, as if in answer to the woman's question, there came a loud cry--the shriek of a man in deadly peril.|$|R
6000|$|... "She likes a good blow {{as well as}} we do," [...] Virtue said enthusiastically, as the yawl rose lightly {{over each}} wave. [...] "What do you think of it, Watkins? Is the <b>wind</b> going to <b>lull</b> a bit as the sun goes down?" ...|$|R
