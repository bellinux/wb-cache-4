25|$|James Horsfall was a <b>wire</b> <b>drawer</b> from Digbeth {{who invented}} {{high tensile steel}} wire. He moved to Hay Mill, a disused blade and sword factory at a water mill on the River Cole, {{rebuilding}} it as a steam-driven mill. The mill originally belonged to Hay Hall in Tyseley. In 1855 his company merged with Joseph Webster's of Penn Mill, Sutton Coldfield. He was a major manufacturer and exporter of the piano wire to Europe in 1824. In 1853 Horsfall had patented a heat treatment process which strengthened the wire. This led to improved piano wire (giving a near monopoly), wire for making needles in Redditch, fishhooks, and umbrella frames. The firm made the armoured wire for first successful transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866, using 30,000 miles of wire (1600 tons), made by 250 workers over 11 months. The strengthened wire also made possible the construction of aeroplanes and automobiles. The company today also makes springs.|$|E

5000|$|On {{introduction}} of the 1825 Inclosure Act, the area saw little expansion due to common land becoming privately owned. [...] The 1841 census listed eight families in the area, including agricultural workers, a painter, an Irish carrier, and a <b>wire</b> <b>drawer.</b> [...] It {{is likely that the}} latter worked at Penns Mill, a nearby wire mill run by the Webster family (with Baron Dickinson Webster's business involvements including the transatlantic telegraph cable).|$|E
50|$|The {{association}} {{struggled through}} the Long Depression of the 1870s, and almost collapsed, being refounded in 1886 as the Iron and Steel <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawers</b> Trade Superannuation Gift and Burial Society of Great Britain. On this basis, it gained membership across {{the north of}} England and also in Birmingham, finally persuading the Halifax Small <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawers</b> to affiliate. In 1890, it became the Federated <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawers</b> Trade and Sick Benefit Society of the United Kingdom, with membership rising above 1,000 {{by the end of}} the decade.|$|R
5000|$|In 1901, the {{federation}} adopted a more centralised structure and was again renamed, as the Amalgamated <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawers</b> Trade and Sick Benefit Society of the United Kingdom, then in 1908 {{it became the}} Amalgamated <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawers</b> Society of Great Britain, membership soon moving over 2,000. From 1916, unskilled wire workers were admitted, taking membership to 5,000 and prompting a further name change to the Amalgamated Society of <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawers</b> and Kindred Workers. [...] In 1922, it merged into the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation (ISTC), but left again only two years later, re-establishing an independent existence.|$|R
50|$|The union {{originated}} in 1840 as the Federated <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawers</b> Association, bringing together various local unions. Although {{it had some}} success among {{those involved in the}} manufacture of thick wire, workers in thin wire did not join. By 1868, its total membership was only 700 and based entirely in England, but it adopted the new name of the Thick Iron and Steel <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawers</b> Association.|$|R

50|$|Shaw {{was educated}} at Boothtown Board School, and started {{work as a}} {{labourer}} in a cloth mill {{at the age of}} 13. He became apprenticed to a <b>wire</b> <b>drawer,</b> but the low wages on offer were not attractive and he soon took a series of unskilled jobs in local engineering works. He was thus well placed to join his father in a new business repairing small machine tools used in munitions production during the First World War. After his father's death in 1929, he started his own small business as a road contractor, repairing roads until his death in the 1970s. He received an OBE in 1965.|$|E
5000|$|Hester Neden or Needham was baptised in London on 7 October 1708, the {{daughter}} of John Neden or Needham. On 20 May 1732 she married a gold chain maker and <b>wire</b> <b>drawer</b> called John Bateman. During their marriage, {{she gave birth to}} six children: John Joseph (Joss), Letitia, Ann, Peter, William and Jonathan. John Bateman died of consumption (tuberculosis) in 1760, leaving his tools to his wife in his will. She took over the family business and registered her first sponsor's mark at the Goldsmith's Hall in 1761, simply [...] "HB" [...] in script. From the time up to the late 1770s, not much Bateman work is known, possibly because she was supplying pieces for other silversmiths that were subsequently overstamped with their marks.|$|E
25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) began {{organizing}} unskilled {{iron and}} steel workers into federal unions in 1901. Local groups of <b>wire</b> <b>drawers,</b> house men, tube workers, blast furnace men and others had all formed unions. The Federal Association of <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawers</b> was chartered in 1896, the Tin Plate Workers' Protective Association in 1899, the International Association of Blast Furnace Workers in 1901, and the International Association of Tube Workers in 1902. Most internationals disbanded after a short time, but many local federal unions became deeply entrenched in the workplace.|$|R

50|$|The {{district}} {{takes its}} full name from Hay Mill which {{stood on the}} River Cole near James Road/ Mill Road. The mill belonged to the occupants of Hay Hall and ground corn from at least 1495. Converted to blade grinding probably during the Civil War, this trade continued until about 1830 when James Horsfall, a <b>wire</b> <b>drawer</b> of Digbeth moved here. There was no settlement at Hay Mills in 1834, but by 1888 {{the south side of}} the Coventry Road was being built up from Heybarnes Road to Forest Road. He had the old buildings demolished and rebuilt some 100m north of the old site. Here a larger mill with a larger pool was built for wire drawing. Other industries included Iron founding, brick manufacture, cabinet manufacture, electrical switch making and the embryonic British motorcycle industry in Kings Road. By 1906 there was considerable urbanisation, although Hay Mills was still separated from Small Heath by the undeveloped Cole valley and becoming part of Birmingham in1911.|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} importance {{was based}} on the one hand by the central functions of the town for the surrounding locations, and by the metal ore mining in the wider surrounding area ("osemund"/osmond iron), which were exploited in the Middle Ages. While the ore was processed in the hammers and <b>wire</b> <b>drawers</b> with the water power in the surrounding valleys, a number of artisanal smitheries in Lüdenscheid made finished products of those materials. In order to market these products to a wider area, Lüdenscheid joined the Hanseatic League.|$|R
5000|$|W Elliott & Sons, Metal Rollers and <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawers</b> were {{established}} in 1853 {{on the site of}} Sturges Chemical Works. Elliott’s Patent Sheathing and Metal Co. was formed in 1862. In 1866 they bought Charles Green‘s business. Charles Green had taken out a patent (1838) for [...] "seamless" [...] tubes with respect to the drawing of copper tubes. [...] In a major expansion plan in 1928 they were taken over by ICI Metals Group and in 1964 transferred to Kynock Works at Witton.Their products included rolled brass and copper sheet, drawn brass and copper wire, brass and copper tubes. There was significant production of an alloy known as Muntz metal, a patent of George Frederick Muntz, used for sheathing the hulls of wooden ships. They also made telegraph wire for the post office. The management included Neville Chamberlain from 1897-1924. During the war they made munitions and also millions of rivets for army boots.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Today's {{brushless}} {{permanent magnet}} (PM) drive systems usually adopt motors including the advancements in magnet technology, e. g. better thermal characteristics and higher magnetic strength. By this means, they become capable in the roughest applications yet maintain a high accuracy at competitive prices. These drive {{systems are not}} only appreciated for their high performance, {{but they are also}} advantageous for the applications requiring tough, dependable, and continuous-duty operations, e. g. hybrid or complete electrical vehicles, extruders, <b>wire</b> <b>drawers,</b> winders, cranes, conveyors, and roll formers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide an extended comparative study of the different motor configurations for the hybrid electric drive application, aiming at a compromise between high power density and extended speed capability. Design/methodology/approach – To suit strict design requirements, such as the very limited volumetric envelope, high-output power, wide constant power speed range, and pre-selected in-direct cooling system, the constraint variants of possible motor types are researched. Findings – Considerably, high torque density and an extended speed range limit the options of PM rotor configurations for this motor design. The considered rotor configurations are the surface PM (SPM) and interior PM (IPM) types. The advantage of the (non-salient) SPM configuration is its applicability with higher levels of magnetic flux densities without causing significant saturation in the rotor. On the other hand, an IPM rotor, which places the magnets in special rotor slots, open or closed (by saturation bridges), can operate on both the reluctance torque and the magnet alignment torque. This generally leads to a better performance in a wide speed range. However, this advantage can be eliminated by severe iron saturation resulting from the required high-specific power. Originality/value – The most appropriate rotor configuration will finally be selected between the two considered types, depending on detailed electromagnetic and thermal analysis. This paper usefully studies the correlation between the motor parameters required for high power density and field-weakening performance...|$|R
