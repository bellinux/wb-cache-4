5|$|A {{controversy}} that has occupied scholars {{for more than}} a century concerns whether Cabral's discovery was by chance or intentional. If the latter, that <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that the Portuguese had at least some hint that a land existed to the west. The matter was first raised by Emperor Pedro II in 1854 during a session of the Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute, when he asked if the discovery might have been intentional.|$|E
5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a protoplanetary disk. This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity. The lack of a deep convection zone <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> that the outer layers would retain higher abundance ratios of these heavy elements.|$|E

Celltech completed the purchase of OGS in April 2003.

Celltech was itself purchased by the Belgian drugmaker UCB in mid-2004.|$|R

5|$|In March 2009, it was {{announced}} that Jim Knight, Minister of State for Schools and Families, had approved plans that <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> the closure of both Ladymead Community School and the nearby St Augustine of Canterbury RC/CoE School both in the Priorswood area of Taunton. The schools closed in August 2010, and were replaced in September 2010 by The Taunton Academy.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of Ypresiomyrma queens collected {{suggests that these}} ants mated in swarms, but the alates were poor flyers due to their large size. The morphology of the mandibles indicate they were specialised tools for excavating chambers in soil or wood during colony foundation; their large size and common occurrence in their geographical range <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> they were an important food source {{to a variety of}} birds and Paleogene animals that predominately fed on insects.|$|E

5|$|The {{control of}} Vijithapura was {{essential}} to both sides. The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would significantly reduce their capability to resist Duthhagamani's advance.

5|$|The post-expansion {{financial}} crisis would eventually elicit {{a response from}} the NFL. By the end of 1996, speculation was rampant that if the NFL placed a franchise in Toronto, it <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> {{the end of the}} CFL. Instead, in exchange for a new player agreement between the leagues, the NFL provided the CFL franchises with marketing assistance and a $3 million loan in 1997.|$|E
5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let {{themselves}} into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said {{she had not been}} pushed but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such a verdict <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> Cynthia had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.|$|E

5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one could determine that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{there were}} no public art {{galleries}} in England with permanent collections. In 1816, {{in the face of}} his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.|$|E

5|$|By {{the winter}} of 1939, the Soviets further reduced their demands and sent Boris Stein to negotiate. Stein and Erkko met five times. Erkko {{rejected}} the Soviet proposals, saying that the Soviet demands <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> {{the end of the}} Finnish neutrality policy and displease the Germans. When the chairman of the Finnish Defense Council C.G.E. Mannerheim was informed of the negotiations, he opined that Finland should give up the Suursaari islands because their defence would anyway be impossible during a war, but his arguments did not persuade the majority of the Finnish government. Stein departed Helsinki empty-handed on 6 April.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. They could use the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, {{there was a significant}} chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|However, Sitchin, {{who died}} in 2010, denied any {{connection}} between his work and Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set {{the time for the}} last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which <b>would</b> <b>mean,</b> given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however say that he believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, Canon {{invested}} US$100million in NeXT, {{giving it}} a 16.67percent stake, making NeXT worth almost $600million.

After NeXT exited the hardware business, Canon produced a line of PCs, called object.station, including models 31, 41, 50 and 52, specifically designed to run NeXTSTEP/Intel.

5|$|In Ian Fleming's stories, James Bond {{is in his}} mid-to-late thirties, {{but does}} not age. In Moonraker, he admits to being eight years shy of {{mandatory}} retirement age from the 00 section—45—which <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> he was 37 at the time. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, , gives him a birth date of 11 November 1920, while a study by Bond scholar John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921. According to Griswold, the Fleming novels take place between around May 1951, to February 1964, by which time Bond was aged 42.|$|E
5|$|In response, Tyler, already {{ejected from}} the Whig party, quickly began to {{organize}} a third party in hopes of inducing the Democrats to embrace a pro-expansionist platform. By running as a third-party candidate, Tyler threatened to siphon off pro-annexation Democratic voters; Democratic party disunity <b>would</b> <b>mean</b> the election of Henry Clay, a staunchly anti-Texas Whig. Pro-annexation delegates among southern Democrats, with assistance {{from a number of}} northern delegates, blocked anti-expansion candidate Martin Van Buren at the convention, which instead nominated the pro-expansion champion of Manifest Destiny, James K. Polk of Tennessee. Polk unified his party under the banner of Texas and Oregon acquisition.|$|E
