But, in {{laying out}} the garden which is to assist {{the effect of the}} building, we must observe, and {{exclusively}} use, the natural combinations of flowers.[42] Now, as far as we are aware, bluish purple is the only flower color which Nature ever uses in masses of distant effect; this, however, she does in the case of most heathers, with the Rhododendron ferrugineum, and, less extensively, with the colder color of the wood hyacinth. Accordingly, the large rhododendron may be used to almost any extent, in masses; the pale varieties of the rose more sparingly; and, on the turf, the <b>wild</b> <b>violet</b> and pansy should be sown by chance, so that they may grow in undulations of color, and should be relieved by a few primroses. All dahlias, tulips, ranunculi, and, in general, what are called florist's flowers, should be avoided like garlic.|$|E
6000|$|... 11. And first, let us {{be clear}} that the native colour of the violet is violet; and that the white and yellow kinds, though pretty in their place and way, {{are not to be}} thought of in {{generally}} meditating the flower's quality or power. A white violet is to black ones what a black man is to white ones; and the yellow varieties are, I believe, properly pansies, and belong also to wild districts for the most part; but the true violet, which I have just now called 'black,' with Gerarde, [...] "the blacke or purple violet, hath a great prerogative above others," [...] and all the nobler species of the pansy itself are of full purple, inclining, however, in the ordinary <b>wild</b> <b>violet</b> to blue. In the 'Laws of Fésole,' chap, vii., §§ 20, 21, I have made this dark pansy the representative of purple pure; the viola odorata, of the link between that full purple and blue; and the heath-blossom of the link between that full purple and red. The reader will do well, as much as may be possible to him, to associate his study of botany, as indeed all other studies of visible things, with that of painting: but he must remember that he cannot know what violet colour really is, unless he watch the flower in its early growth. It becomes dim in age, and dark when it is gathered--at least, when it is tied in bunches;--but I am under the impression that the colour actually deadens also,--at all events, no other single flower of the same quiet colour lights up the ground near it as a violet will. The bright hounds-tongue looks merely like a spot of bright paint; but a young violet glows like painted glass.|$|E

I know you would like that to be true; you would think it a pleasant magic if you could flush your flowers into brighter bloom by a kind look upon them: nay, more, if your look had the power, not only to cheer, but to guard;--if you could bid the black blight turn away, and the knotted caterpillar spare--if you could bid the dew fall upon them in the drought, and say to the south wind, in frost--"Come, thou south, and breathe upon my garden, that the spices of it may flow out."

50|$|The name of Flower Hill can {{be traced}} to the early 18th century when the village {{consisted}} of several residences and other buildings located where today Port Washington Boulevard, Bonnie Heights Road and Country Club Drive intersect. This was a village that served farmers whose land was located along Port Washington Boulevard and extended down to Hempstead Harbor. Three of the original farmhouses in Flower Hill are still in existence: The Willets House, on the west side of Port Washington Boulevard, home of the Cow Neck Historical Society, The Williams House, also on the west side of Port Washington Boulevard and the Hewlett Homestead on the east side. Proximity to the water was important because those farms shipped vegetables, grain and fruits to New York City from docks in Roslyn or Manhasset Bay. In the spring many flowering cherry trees line the road to the farms with fields and meadows always filled with <b>wild</b> <b>violets</b> and other lovely wildflowers. There are even some apple trees still standing that date to the days when Flower Hill farms sold the produce from their apple, pear and peach orchards.|$|R

50|$|The vine ripens {{relatively}} quite late, producing good yields {{with high}} resistance to fungal disease and rot. The grape crossed with another Veneto wine grape, Marzemina bianca, to produce Raboso Veronese. It produces quite a large, tight, cylindrical bunch {{with one or}} two wings and a sturdy bunchstem. Its spheroid grape has a blue-black, very tough skin with good bloom. The flesh has a varietal, neutral flavour which is slightly meaty and sweet-acidulous-astringent.Each grape has two or three average-sized, pear-shaped seeds. This vigorous vine can produce an abundant yield. Optimal vinification requires appropriate maceration of juice and skins: this results in a full-bodied wine, acidic and tannic when young, ideal for laying down.Left to age in wooden barrels, it will gradually acquire a deep ruby colour with garnet tinges, a broad and full bouquet of <b>wild</b> <b>violets</b> with a concentrated note of morello cherry; the palate is dry, attractively astringent, and full-flavoured.At full maturity, Raboso Piave {{is one of the great}} Venetian reds, probably the best among the traditional wine of Eastern of Veneto.

It is also a superb sipping wine, an ideal accompaniment to long winter evenings in the company of friends.|$|R
6000|$|If we glance {{through the}} {{references}} to pleasant landscape which occur {{in other parts of}} the Odyssey, we shall always be struck by this quiet subjection of their every feature to human service, and by the excessive similarity in the scenes. Perhaps the spot intended, after this, to be most perfect, may be the garden of Alcinous, where the principal ideas are, still more definitely, order, symmetry and fruitfulness;[89] the beds being duly ranged between rows of vines, which, as well as the pear, apple, and fig trees, bear fruit continually, some grapes being yet sour, while others are getting black; there are plenty of [...] "orderly square beds of herbs," [...] chiefly leeks, and two fountains, one running through the garden, and one under the pavement of the palace to a reservoir for the citizens. Ulysses, pausing to contemplate this scene, is described nearly in the same terms as Mercury pausing to contemplate the wilder meadow; and it is interesting to observe, that, in spite of all Homer's love of symmetry, the god's admiration is excited by the free fountains, <b>wild</b> <b>violets,</b> and wandering vine; but the mortal's, by the vines in rows, the leeks in beds, and the fountains in pipes.|$|R

It had once been the haunt of many a gay picnicking crew in hoops and bag-wigs and all the faded fashion of the past, when hosts and guests had planned a wilder escapade than the grove before the casino invited, with its tables of moss-painted marble.
