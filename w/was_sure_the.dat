5|$|Dowding {{later wrote}} a memo {{considering}} several aircraft for the role, rejecting the Boulton Paul Defiant two-seat fighter {{due to its}} cramped rear turret area. He <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Beaufighter would be perfect for the role, {{but it would not}} be ready for some time. So he selected the Bristol Blenheim light bomber for the immediate term, sending two of the early prototypes to Martlesham Heath to be fitted with the radar from the Battles. Blenheim K7033 was fitted with the radar, while K7034 acted as the target. Both of these aircraft lost a propeller in flight but landed safely; K7033s propeller was never found, but K7034s was returned to Martlesham the next day by an irate farmer.|$|E

25|$|Meier told Donald that he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> Democrats {{would win}} the {{election}} because they had considerable information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Hughes {{that had never been}} released, and that it resided with Larry O'Brien. According to Fred Emery, O'Brien had been a lobbyist for Hughes in a Democrat-controlled Congress, and the possibility of his finding out about Hughes' illegal contributions to the Nixon campaign {{was too much of a}} danger for Nixon to ignore.|$|E

25|$|Meier, in {{collaboration}} with former Vice President Hubert Humphrey and others, wanted to feed misinformation to the Nixon campaign. Meier told Donald that he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> Democrats would win the election because Larry O'Brien {{had a great deal}} of information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Howard Hughes that had never been released; O'Brien did not actually have any such information, but Meier wanted Nixon to think he did. Donald told his brother that O'Brien was in possession of damaging Hughes information that could destroy his campaign. Terry Lenzner, who was the chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, speculates that it was Nixon's desire to know what O'Brien knew about Nixon's dealings with Hughes that may have partially motivated the Watergate break-in.|$|E
25|$|When the Fascist leader Benito Mussolini {{marched on}} Rome in October 1922, Giolitti was in Cavour. On 26 October, former prime {{minister}} Antonio Salandra warned current Facta that Mussolini was demanding his resignation {{and that he was}} preparing to march on Rome. However, Facta did not believe Salandra and thought that Mussolini would govern quietly at his side. To meet the threat posed by the bands of fascist troops now gathering outside Rome, Luigi Facta (who had resigned but continued to hold power) ordered a state of siege for Rome. Having had previous conversations with the king about the repression of fascist violence, he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> king would agree. However, Victor Emmanuel III refused to sign the military order. On 28 October, the King handed power to Mussolini, who was supported by the military, the business class, and the right-wing.|$|E

Madsen declared, [...] "I do not think it is morally tarnished to show that people have affairs with people they are not married to. It's a beautiful description of a relationship that falls apart in a time that had great personal cost." ...|$|E

500|$|Poco Pine {{was shown}} {{about five times}} as a weanling, winning all the halter classes he was shown in. Curtner, however, {{felt that he was}} slow to develop and {{therefore}} didn't show him as a yearling or as a two-year-old. By 1957 Curtner felt that Poco Pine was once again ready to perform, and took him to a show in Fort Worth, Texas. Although Poco Pine won his class, Curtner <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> horse wouldn't win either Grand Champion or Reserve Grand Champion, and ended up betting B. F. Phillips and Billy Bush that Poco Pine would not win the championship or reserve. [...] Poco Pine won the Championship, which meant that Curtner lost money on his horse winning.|$|E
500|$|Having posted similar {{offensive}} {{statistics in}} the regular season, the Eagles and Cardinals were expected to play a tight game. Played in a blizzard at Philadelphia's Shibe Park, the game's only score was a fourth quarter rushing touchdown by Van Buren from five yards out. The 7–0 win gave the Eagles their first league title. Van Buren finished with 98 yards on 26 carries, though he nearly missed the game entirely. Thinking the game would not be played in the blizzard, he remained home until coach Greasy Neale called {{him and told him}} the game was still on. He had to catch three trolleys and walk six blocks {{in order to make the}} game on time.

According to Blabbermouth.net, the band was considering recording its next album {{in the second half of}} 2011. In November 2010, during an {{interview with}} The Pulse of Radio, Ulrich said Metallica would return to writing in 2011. Ulrich said, [...] "There's a bunch of balls in the air for 2011, but I think the main one is we really want to get back to writing again. We haven't really written since, what, '06, '07, and we want to get back to kind of just being creative again. Right now we are going to just chill out and then probably start up again in, I'd say, March or April, and start probably putting the creative cap back on and start writing some songs." ...|$|E

500|$|Super Smash Bros. was {{developed}} by HAL Laboratory, a Nintendo second-party developer, during [...] Masahiro Sakurai was interested in making a fighting game for four players. As he {{did not yet have}} any original ideas, his first designs were of simple base characters. He made a presentation of what was then called Kakuto-Geemu Ryuoh (Dragon King: The Fighting Game) to co-worker Satoru Iwata, who helped him continue. Sakurai understood that many fighting games did not sell well and that he had to think of a way to make his game original. His first idea was to include famous Nintendo characters {{and put them in a}} fight. Knowing he would not get permission, Sakurai made a prototype of the game without sanction from Nintendo and did not inform them until he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> game was well-balanced. The prototype he presented featured Mario, Donkey Kong, Samus and Fox as playable characters. [...] The idea was later approved.|$|E
500|$|The year 1926 {{was lacking}} in variety entertainment, a fact largely {{attributed}} to the UK general strike that had occurred in May of that year. The strike was unexpected by Robey, who had signed the previous year to star {{in a series of}} variety dates for Moss Empires. The contract was lucrative, made more so by the comedian's willingness to manage his own bookings. He took the show to the provinces under the title of Bits and Pieces and employed a company of 25 artists as well as engineers and support staff. Despite the economic hardships of Britain in 1926, large numbers of people turned out to see the show. He returned to Birmingham, a city where he was held in great affection, and where he <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> audiences would embrace his new show. [...] However, censors demanded that he omit the provocative song [...] "I Stopped, I Looked, I Listened" [...] and that he heavily edit the sketch [...] "The Cheat". The restrictions failed to dampen the audiences' enthusiasm, and Bits and Pieces enjoyed rave reviews. [...] It ran until Christmas and earned a six-month extension.|$|E
500|$|More than 40 {{years after}} the Meckiff incident, Jones <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> bowler's fate had been predetermined. He said [...] "They'd {{decided to do it}} a week before the game, so the poor bloke had no hope...I was {{chairman}} of the umpires selection committee." [...] Jones remained convinced of Bradman's intention to have Meckiff called for throwing, something Bradman flatly denied. Gibbs remains suspicious of the motives for selecting Meckiff. He pointed out that although the pitch was conducive to spin bowling, Australia chose five specialist batsmen, two spinners and three fast bowlers. Gibbs speculated that the selection of an extra fast bowler—the most common strategy is to use four bowlers and six batsmen—instead of another batsman betrayed fears that Meckiff would be unable to complete the match. Alan Connolly remained adamant that his teammate's action was legitimate and implied a conspiracy, saying [...] "I wasn't amazed ...There was a good reason for that which I can't disclose and won't disclose." [...] Tom Veivers, who made his Test debut for Australia in Meckiff's last match, hinted at the same. He recalled [...] Rowan's words at the pre-match function: [...] "It's {{going to be a very}} interesting game".|$|E

[...] The book, Maus, appeared one chapter at a time as an insert in Raw beginning with the second issue in December 1980. [...] Spiegelman's father did not live to see its completion; he died on 18 August 1982. [...] Spiegelman learned in 1985 that Steven Spielberg was producing an animated film about Jewish mice who escape persecution in Eastern Europe by fleeing to the United States. [...] Spiegelman <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> film, An American Tail (1986), was inspired by Maus and became eager to have his unfinished book come out before the movie to avoid comparisons. [...] He struggled to find a publisher until in 1986, after the publication in The New York Times of a rave review of the work-in-progress, Pantheon agreed to release a collection of the first six chapters. [...] The volume was titled Maus: A Survivor's Tale and subtitled My Father Bleeds History. [...] The book found a large audience, {{in part because it}} was sold in bookstores rather than in direct-market comic shops, which by the 1980s had become the dominant outlet for comic books.|$|E

2500|$|A British {{reconnaissance}} aircraft sighted Bismarck {{in the early}} morning hours of 26 May by following its oil slick. At dusk on 26 May, Fairey Swordfish torpedo aircraft from HMS Ark Royal attacked. Though much of the damage was superficial, one torpedo jammed Bismarcks rudders and steering gear. Lindemann <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>the</b> damage could be repaired, but Lütjens apparently was quick to accept the worst. As Lindemann and his engineering officers discussed ways to repair the damage Lütjens compiled a note to the German command and people just 30 minutes after the torpedo struck and before the full extent of the damage was known. Divers were put over the side, but reported they could not clear the damage, as the sea was then too rough. The officers also considered using the aircraft hangar doors on board the ship as makeshift rudders but the proposals came to nothing. The crew was still able to steer Bismarck somewhat by adjusting the revolution speed of her propellers, but it reduced the ship's top speed to [...] and effectively left it circling in the water.|$|E
