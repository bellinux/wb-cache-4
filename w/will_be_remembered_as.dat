5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E

25|$|O'Hehir {{subsequently}} {{became a}} staple of the BBC's coverage of the famous annual Grand National steeplechase. He would invariably pick up the commentary at the Becher's Brook fence and take the race to Valentine's Brook, a vital section of the race where many a favourite fell. Foinavon's famous victory in 1967 <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> one of O'Hehir's finest moments in racing commentaries and won him great respect for the speed and smoothness with which he picked out the unconsidered outsider. O'Hehir later confessed {{in an interview that he}} it had been his inability to identify the colours on his card when inspecting the riders silks in the weighing room prior to the race that had led him to question rider John Buckingham who his mount was. Buckingham advised O'Hehir that Foinavon's silks had been changed at the last minute as his regular green colours were considered unlucky. It was because of this chance meeting that he was able to identify the 100/1 outsider and carry the commentary.|$|E
500|$|In Wisden, Richie Benaud wrote, [...] "Chappell <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> {{much for}} {{his bid to}} improve the players' lot as he will for his run-getting and captaincy". During the WSC period, he founded a players' {{association}} with a loan provided by Kerry Packer. Despite Chappell's continued support for the organisation after his retirement, apathy {{and a lack of}} recognition from the ACB led to its demise in 1988. Revived in 1997 as the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA), it is now an important organisation within the structure of Australian cricket. In 2005, Chappell {{became a member of the}} ACA executive.|$|E

In 2013, Lindsey Weber from Vulture put [...] "Girl" [...] at number five on her list of the top 25 songs by Destiny's Child praising it for giving an accurate and [...] "catchy" [...] portrayal of concerned women.|$|E
500|$|The {{rivalry between}} Silva and Jackson has been {{regarded}} as [...] "exceptionally violent," [...] and the fights in the Pride Fighting Championship have been considered to be {{two of the most}} brutal matches to ever take place in the organization. Chris Parry of the Vancouver Sun asserted that the two fights in Pride <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> [...] "some of the best fights in this era," [...] and as [...] "some of the most devastating boxing and kickboxing exchanges seen in years." [...] The rematch at Pride 28 has been noted as an exciting fight with back-and-forth action, and was also named the 2004 Fight of the Year by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards. The first fight at Pride Final Conflict 2003 has also gained fight of the year consideration.|$|E
500|$|... "1+1" [...] {{garnered}} acclaim {{from music}} critics, who noted its {{resemblance to the}} work of American singers Prince and Sam Cooke. It was also complimented for its subtle instrumentation, which provides emphasis on Beyoncé's vocals. [...] "1+1" [...] peaked at number 82 on the Canadian Hot 100 chart and at number 57 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Its accompanying music video was directed by Beyoncé herself, alongside Lauren Briet and Ed Burke, and it premiered on August 26, 2011. The video was a [...] "different" [...] direction {{in the sense that it}} does not incorporate the heavy dance routines Beyoncé is known for, and that it experiments with psychedelic visual effects as well as innovative lighting, which give the clip a cinematic feel. The clip met with generally positive reception from music critics, who praised its aesthetic and sexual theme and claimed that it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> one of Beyoncé's most iconic visuals.|$|E

500|$|More hostile was Chamberlain's {{relationship}} with fellow center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, ten years his junior. Although Abdul-Jabbar idolized {{him as a}} teenager and was once part of his inner circle, the student/mentor bond deteriorated into intense mutual loathing, especially after Chamberlain retired. Chamberlain often criticized Abdul-Jabbar for a perceived lack of scoring, rebounding, and defense. Abdul-Jabbar accused Chamberlain of being a traitor to the black race for his Republican political leanings, support of Richard Nixon, and relationships with white women. When Abdul-Jabbar broke Chamberlain's all-time scoring record in 1984, Chamberlain repeatedly called on Abdul-Jabbar to retire. When Abdul-Jabbar published his autobiography in 1990, he retaliated by writing a paper titled [...] "To Wilt Chumperlane [...] " [...] in which he stated [...] "Now that I am done playing, history will remember me as someone who helped teammates to win, while you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> a crybaby, a loser, and a quitter." [...] Their relationship remained mostly strained until the end.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} to the handheld praises its accomplishments, but defines it as a [...] "niche" [...] device that appeals to only certain gamers. Jeremy Parish considers the WonderSwan the ultimate expression of Gunpei Yokoi's design philosophy and notes its modest impact on the market, but blames Bandai for its lack of success, stating, [...] "While WonderSwan ultimately <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> a highly localized blip {{in the history of}} handheld games, as a platform it genuinely held its own... the system's obscurity resulted more from poor timing and Bandai's strangely meek strategy, not from any inherent flaws {{in the design of the}} machine itself." [...] Parish also goes on to hypothesize on the lack of a WonderSwan release in North America, stating, [...] "given how hard it was to find Neo Geo Pocket systems and games at U.S. retail, it's hard to imagine they were clamoring for yet another niche portable from Japan." [...] Luke Plunkett from Kotaku praised the WonderSwan's challenge to Nintendo, stating, [...] "t tried some pretty unique and interesting things, and put up a much sterner fight than most other handhelds ever managed." [...] Retro Gamers Kim Wild criticizes some aspects of the handheld, including its lack of a headphone and AC port, as well as its poor control scheme for left-handed individuals and inability to play multiplayer link games with the headphone adapter connected. Wild offers some praise for the handheld, however, stating [...] "what [...] managed with the WonderSwan was impressive given the competition. The low price even today makes it more than worthy of consideration." ...|$|E
