500|$|Lautner {{has stated}} {{that he does not}} want to be just known for his looks, as some have {{attributed}} his popularity to that and not his actual acting skill. In an interview, the actor revealed that he was originally supposed to have a baring scene in the movie Valentine's Day. He stated, [...] "The script said <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>walking</b> into school and Willy takes off his shirt. I said, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa. Time out. He's gonna take off his shirt in the middle of school? No, no, no. The reason I took off my shirt for New Moon is because it's written in the book that way. And there's reasons behind it." [...] Lautner later said he would not bare his chest for any role that did not call for it. In June 2010, Lautner covered GQ magazine. The actor was lampooned in conservative writer Laura Ingraham's satirical The Obama Diaries, commenting to have Lautner as a mascot for the White House Easter Egg Roll, to fit their health-conscious theme, and have Lautner don a furry bunny head and appear shirtless. In 2010, Lautner was ranked number two on Glamours [...] "50 Sexiest Men of 2010 [...] " [...] list. Men's Health ranked him at third on their list of [...] "Top 10 Summer Bodies." [...] Additionally in 2010, he was ranked fourth on Peoples [...] "Most Amazing Bodies" [...] list.|$|E

I'd always had this {{reservation}} about my first encounter with top dog players and I thought they were rubbishing me, but with traditional black people communication always happens very slowly and that's how it was. After a while I got to understand that they were pleased at seeing it being played by a whitefella with his own spirit.
