5|$|In 1927, {{to prepare}} Fleming for {{possible}} {{entry into the}} Foreign Office, his mother {{sent him to the}} Tennerhof in Kitzb√ºhel, Austria, a small private school run by the Adlerian disciple and former British spy Ernan Forbes Dennis and his novelist wife, Phyllis Bottome. After improving his language skills there, he studied briefly at Munich University and the University of Geneva. While in Geneva, Fleming began a romance with Monique Panchaud de Bottomes and the couple were briefly engaged in 1931. His mother disapproved and made him break off the relationship. He applied for entry to the Foreign Office, but failed the examinations. His mother again intervened in his affairs, lobbying Sir Roderick Jones, head of Reuters News Agency, and in October 1931 he was given a position as a sub-editor and journalist for the company. In 1933 Fleming spent time in Moscow, where he covered the Stalinist show trial of six engineers from the British company Metropolitan-Vickers. While there he applied for an interview with Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, and <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>to</b> receive a personally signed note apologising {{for not being able to}} attend.|$|E
500|$|In the Skanda Purana, Parvati {{requests}} Shiva {{to allow}} her to reside with him, embracing [...] "limb-to-limb", and so Ardhanarishvara is formed. It also tells that when the demon Andhaka wanted to seize Parvati and make her his wife, Vishnu rescued her and brought her to his abode. When the demon followed her there, Parvati revealed her Ardhanarishvara form to him. Seeing the half-male, half-female form, the demon lost interest in her and left. Vishnu <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>to</b> see this form and saw himself in the female part of the form.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, it was {{announced}} that it would reopen in October under a new chef-owner, Chris Harrod. Harrod had previously worked under Raymond Blanc at two Michelin starred restaurant Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons. He had been looking for a restaurant with rooms to purchase, having originally thought to look for one in the Chiltern Hills where they could be added. Harrod said that [...] "I went and had a look and <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>to</b> find that the Crown at Whitebrook ticked all the boxes for what I was looking for. It had the location, the quality suppliers and I knew straight away that I had been looking in the wrong place." [...] The Crown at Whitebrook reopened the following October, and gained a new Michelin star under the new team in the 2014 list. In February 2015, the restaurant was renamed to The Whitebrook.|$|E

500|$|Among the {{alternative}} musicians who have cited Love as an influence are Scout Niblett; Brody Dalle of The Distillers; Dee Dee Penny of Dum Dum Girls; and Nine Black Alps. Contemporary female pop artists Lana Del Rey, Avril Lavigne, Tove Lo, and Sky Ferreira have also cited Love as an influence. Love has frequently {{been recognized as}} the most high-profile contributor of feminist music during the 1990s, and for [...] "subverting [...] mainstream expectations of how a woman should look, act, and sound." [...] According to music journalist Maria Raha, [...] "Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism." [...] Patti Smith, a major influence of Love's, also praised her, saying: [...] "I hate genderizing things... when I heard Hole, I <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>to</b> hear a girl sing like that. Janis Joplin was her own thing; she was into Big Mama Thornton and Bessie Smith. But what Courtney Love does, I'd never heard a girl do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1907, {{newspapers}} {{across the}} country published an x-ray of McGuire's left hand (pictured, above at right), showing [...] "36breaks, twists or bumps all due to baseball accidents."

In several joints the bones are flattened and pushed to the side." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} was [...] "cloudy, opalescent upon being stirred, and of low viscosity" [...] and usually was thrown away. However, Kwolek persuaded the technician, Charles Smullen, {{who ran the}} spinneret, to test her solution, and <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>to</b> find that the fiber did not break, unlike nylon. Her supervisor and her laboratory director understood the significance of her accidental discovery and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose. By 1971, modern Kevlar was introduced. However, Kwolek was not very involved in developing the applications of Kevlar.|$|E

The squadron broke into a few scattered horsemen at the guns and seemed to melt away completely. For a time I, at any rate, {{had the impression that}} I was the only man left alive. I <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>to</b> discover we were the victors".|$|E

While away down the coast Maclean <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>to</b> receive a garbled message from Cairo, with a clear sentence [...] "King now in Cairo, Will be dropped to you at first opportunity."
