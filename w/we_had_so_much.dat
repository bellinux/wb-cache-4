500|$|On November 22, 2011, the behind-the-scenes {{footage of}} the video was posted online. In the footage, her stylist said that the {{inspiration}} for the video was [...] "trailer-trash, ghetto fabulous, out-there, [...] edgy." [...] During the footage Beyoncé said [...] "I like this video. It's no choreography, no pressure. All I have to do is party and have a good time." [...] She also revealed that the video is supposed to reflect her simplistic childhood, adding: [...] "Growing up, I had really amazing parents and I had a great childhood. We went from nicer homes to being in apartments with our lights cutting off. It didn't matter where we were 'cause we had love and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun. It's great when you don't have as much how you improvise and you have more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot on a stretch of beach {{on the coast of}} California in Malibu and {{directed}} by Marcus Raboy. In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna spoke about the development of the shoot for the video, saying [...] "The water was so cold... but oh my gosh, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun... We were bumping each other off the Jet Skis and just had a ball". During the interview, the singer elaborated further upon the content of the video and the meaning behind it, saying [...] "This video is about having fun, giving off the vibe of the Caribbean... we did some mermaid-looking stuff down on the sand...and I'm just [...] to the camera as if it were my boyfriend. Now we're going to do [...] the Tiki torches. It's going to be incredible". [...] The dance routines in the video were choreographed by noted choreographer Fatima Robinson.|$|E
500|$|In early May 1967, Taylor {{announced}} that Smile had been scrapped, but the Beach Boys were still under pressure and {{a contractual obligation}} to record and present an album to Capitol. On June 2, Brian declared to his bandmates {{that most of the}} material recorded for Smile was now off-limits. According to Carl, [...] "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a homespun version of it instead. We're just going to take it easy. I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was Smiley Smile." [...] In interviews conducted over the next year, Brian intimated that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". He says: [...] "I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things ... And <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun. The Smiley Smile era was so great, it was unbelievable. Personally, spiritually, everything, it was great. I didn't have any paranoia feelings." [...] Carl described the end product as [...] "a bunt instead of a grand slam".|$|E

6000|$|... "I am glad <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of your company," [...] said Mr. Effingham [...] "for {{that is our}} own church, and in it my {{daughter}} was baptized. But, do you divide your religious opinions in halves, Mr. Bragg?" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Justin Francis, and co-directed by Nick Cannon {{on the island of}} Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The video became notable for the pair, {{due to the fact that}} it was during its conception and recording that they began dating, and eventually wed two months later. The video was shot in early April 2008, but was delayed until May, with several critics suggesting it because of the couples engagement. In an interview with Fox News, Cannon spoke of his feelings when first speaking with Carey regarding the video:"From the first time we sat down to discuss the video at the Beverly Hills Hotel, we connected. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in common spiritually, and we laugh at the same things. I didn't have to put on my Mac Daddy suave mode. I was able to be myself with her. We are both eternally 12 years old." [...] The pair eloped in the Bahamas, at Carey's private estate in Eleuthera, and wed on April 30, 2008. The couple stayed on the island for over two weeks after the nuptials for their honeymoon, which is why the video was delayed until mid-May, so Carey would be able to promote it in time.|$|E
500|$|The band began {{recording}} {{without much}} material {{and needed to}} compose songs on the spot, either by jamming or talking through ideas. Morrison enjoyed not having multiple takes, as on The Soft Parade, and showed up to the sessions on time and sober, unlike sessions for that album. The absence of Rothchild helped as he was a perfectionist who insisted on many takes. In 1994, guitarist Robby Krieger stated, [...] "Rothchild was gone, {{which is one reason}} why <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun. The warden was gone." [...] Despite its troubled beginnings, L.A. Woman contains some of the Doors' most critically acclaimed songs, {{as well as some of}} their most blues-oriented. Lyrically, it deals with contemporary topics such as love, life in Los Angeles, and complex aspects of the human experience. Manzarek explained the band did not [...] "approach the album with one vision, but after we started working on the songs, we realized that they're talking about L.A. They're about men, women, boys, girls, love, loss, lovers-lost, and lovers-found in Los Angeles". The album, as a whole, demonstrated Morrison's songwriting abilities, combined with his poetic phrasing and enthusiasm for Los Angeles, and a desire to leave the city with his partner, Pamela Courson. Artistically, L.A. Woman saw the band mixing blues, psychedelia, and jazz, often within a single song. For the first time since [...] "The End" [...] and [...] "When the Music's Over", the group incorporated longer songs, including [...] "L.A. Woman" [...] and [...] "Riders on the Storm".|$|E
500|$|The {{songs on}} the album were written {{at the same time}} as the songs on Body Talk Pt. 1. In mid-July 2010, music {{magazine}} Billboard reported that the mixing of the songs had been completed. Robyn worked primary with Swedish producer and songwriter Klas Åhlund, who was heavily involved in the production of Body Talk Pt. 1. Unlike the first installment, Body Talk Pt. 2 saw Robyn working with a few producers apart from Åhlund, such as Diplo, Kleerup, Niggaracci and electronic duo Savage Skulls. She also worked with American rapper Snoop Dogg on the song [...] "U Should Know Better". The two originally met when Robyn was asked to sing vocals on a remix of his single [...] "Sexual Eruption" [...] (2007). Six months later, they met up once again to write and record [...] "U Should Know Better." [...] While being interviewed by Billboard, Robyn spoke of the experience of working with the rapper, stating, [...] "It was really cool to be able to be in the studio with him, first because I always was a fan but also because he was really creative and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of an exchange in being there together, both as vocalists. I had an idea and he really got it and got into it, which was awesome." [...] She also worked with Savage Skulls on two {{songs on the}} album; [...] "Love Kills" [...] and the iTunes exclusive [...] "Bad Gal". Robyn spoke of the duo, saying that [...] "these really young guys who are part of a scene that I probably would've gotten into if I wasn't away so much when I was younger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure they}} would rather have you and Bertha here, {{and it would be}} much more {{convenient}} in every way. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to think about now, and there will be so many arrangements to be made." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will if I {{can find}} time. It's a hard winter and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to do," [...] she would answer smiling, {{and then go}} home to {{struggle}} back into the patient mood she tried to make habitual.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fan, dear," [...] {{said the}} other, after {{returning}} from the bedroom {{to make sure that}} Merton still slept, [...] "we must talk in as low a tone as possible, I mean without whispering. And <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to say to each other." ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{and again}} that day we were cursed for our knuckle talking by {{whatever}} guard was on. But we could not refrain. The two of the living dead had become three, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to say, while the manner of saying it was exasperatingly slow and I was not so proficient as they at the knuckle game.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is exactly}} why I would halt here," [...] Isaac replied, and Corporal 'Lige would have rejoiced had he known how rapidly his recruit was {{learning}} his duties as a soldier. [...] "We do not know in which house Captain Baker lives, and while making inquiries, still having the prisoners with us, we might come upon those who would turn the tables once more, before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as gained speech with the officer." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{prepared}} to camp as usual between his moose-hide and the fire, but it beginning to rain suddenly he took refuge under the tent with us, {{and gave us}} a song before falling asleep. It rained hard {{in the night and}} spoiled another box of matches for us, which the Indian had left out, for he was very careless; but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the better night for the rain, since it kept the mosquitoes down.|$|E
6000|$|... "It 's so {{long since}} we parted, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{to say to each}} other!" [...] Bernard exclaimed at last, and he {{accompanied}} this declaration with a laugh much more spontaneous than the one he had given a few moments before.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hardly that, Watson. There {{are some}} points which are {{as dark as}} ever. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{that it will be}} our own fault if we cannot get the rest. We will go {{straight}} to Whitehall Terrace and bring the matter to a head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will have}} to marry some day," [...] she said dreamily--"both of us. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money that <b>we</b> {{will not be allowed}} to {{disappoint}} the public. Do you want me to tell you the kind of a man I could love, Sis?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} {{worked so hard}} to educate {{yourself}} from nothing, Mr. Brant. You couldn't read, I think, when you first came to us. No? Could you really? I know it has been very difficult for Susy to get on with her studies in proportion. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to first eradicate in the way of manners, style, and habits of thought which the poor child had picked up from her companions, and for which SHE was not responsible. Of course, with a boy that does not signify," [...] she added, with feline gentleness.|$|E
6000|$|That {{hour and}} twenty minutes went like a flash, for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{to say to}} each other that we never even got to the things we wanted to say. For instance, I began to tell her about King Solomon's Mines, which was a long story; and she to tell me what {{happened}} after we parted on the shores of the Red Sea. At least the first hour and a quarter went, when suddenly the door opened and Alfred in a somewhat frightened voice announced--"Mr. and Mrs. Atterby-Smith, the Misses Atterby-Smith and Mr. Atterby-Smith junior." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{found the}} people, as I {{observed}} of the other, very inoffensive and sincere; not quarrelsome, nor treacherous, nor mischievous in the least. And we took care {{not so much}} as to let them know the use or manner of our fire-arms for a great while; neither was there one piece fired all the time we were among the other people, where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> gold. If there had, it had been very probable that they would have fled the country, {{in spite of all the}} good usage we could have been able to have shown them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] said Seaforth quietly. [...] "Still--because of what I {{saw at the}} ranch--I {{am sorry}} for her, and Harry, {{who has been a}} very good friend to me, is being punished too. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> you and I, and he has nothing now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All that we understand; but reckon on puttin' a goodly {{distance}} between us an' yonder encampment before to-morrow mornin'. Unless there is an accident the escape will not be known for many hours, and then should <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the lead that we could count {{with some degree of}} assurance upon gaining Cherry Valley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you know, dear Glastonbury,' resumed Sir Ratcliffe, 'I {{had little}} hope in our late visitation. I cannot say I had {{prepared}} {{myself for the}} worst, but I anticipated it. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> unhappiness in our family, that I could not persuade myself that the cup {{was not going to}} be dashed from our lips.' ...|$|R
60|$|First Caddy {{declared}} (and {{would at}} first declare nothing else) that I {{was the best}} adviser that ever was known. This, my pet said, was no news at all; and this, I said, of course, was nonsense. Then Caddy told us {{that she was going}} to be married in a month and that if Ada and I would be her bridesmaids, she was the happiest girl in the world. To be sure, this was news indeed; and I thought we never should have done talking about it, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to say to Caddy, and Caddy had so much to say to us.|$|E
60|$|All {{the while}} I have been writing, I have had another matter in my eye; of which I scarce like to speak: You know {{of course that}} I am {{thinking}} of Sir Percy and his widow. The news has reached me {{in the shape of}} a newspaper cutting, I have no particulars. He had a sweet, original nature; I think I liked him better than ever I should have liked his father; I am sorry he was always a little afraid of me; if I had had more chance, he would have liked me too, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in common, and I valued so much his fine soul, as honest as a dog's, and the romance of him, which was like a dog's too, and like a poet's at the same time. If he had not been Shelley's son, people would have thought more of him; and yet he was the better of the two, bar verses.|$|E
60|$|Such was {{my first}} voyage at sea, for I count the passage round from Halifax as nothing. I had been kept in the cabin, it is true, but our work had been {{of the most active}} kind. The Sterling must have brought up, and been got under way, between fifty and a hundred times; and as for tacking, waring, chappelling round, and box-hauling, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of it by the channel pilots, that the old barky scarce knew which end was going foremost. In that day, a ship did not get from the Forelands up to London without some trouble, and great was our envy of the large blocks and light cordage of the colliers, which made such easy work for their men. We singled much of our rigging, the second voyage up the river, ourselves, {{and it was a great}} relief to the people. A set of grass foresheets, too, that we bought in Spain, got to be great favourites, though, in the end, they cost the ship the life of a very {{valuable}} man.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Bridge is an {{incredible}} nuanced serial killer thriller, but what writer Ben Richards has done is something particular to the whole French-British experience.

[...] - Jane Featherstone on the British and French dynamic of the series ...|$|R
5000|$|Marshall was an {{advocate}} for gay rights, once telling an interviewer: [...] "I think to be gay is to be blessed. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> freedom, <b>so</b> many choices.

5000|$|... 2017 {{sees the}} release of a ‘Get Me On’, a new EP from Kruse and her long-time {{collaborators}} Pig&Dan, with whom she’s made four EP’s with. Talking about her relationship with the duo, Kruse says [...] "I’m always happy to spend time with my brothers in the studio because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun and it just flows." ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{walked along}} towards the Grand Union Hotel, where Ida and her cousin were staying, and my astonishment grew upon me at every step. However, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{to say to}} one another about {{everything}} in general, and Ida was so unaffectedly pleased at my keeping my engagement, made half in joke, that I found no time to unravel the mystery. When we reached the great doorway, Ida took leave of me for the time, but made me promise to call for her again early the next morning. [...] "Unhappily," [...] she said, [...] "I have to go this afternoon to a most tedious party--a set of Boston people; you know the style; the best European culture, bottled and corked as imported, and let out again by driblets with about as much spontaneousness as champagne the second day. But I must fulfil my social duties here; no canoeing on the Isis at Saratoga. However, we must see {{a great deal of}} you now that you've come; so I expect you to call, and drive me down to the lake at ten o'clock to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{discourse}} {{upon this}} and the old affairs that it took up all our time at his first visit. I was a little importunate with him {{to tell me how}} he came to find me out, but he put it off for that time, and only obtaining my leave to visit me again, he went away; and indeed my heart was so full with what he had said already that I was glad when he went away. Sometimes I was full of tenderness and affection for him, and especially when he expressed himself so earnestly and passionately about the child; other times I was crowded with doubts about his circumstances. Sometimes I was terrified with apprehensions lest, if I should come into a close correspondence with him, he should any way come to hear what kind of life I had led at Pall Mall and in other places, and it might make me miserable afterwards; from which last thought I concluded that I had better repulse him again than receive him. All these thoughts, and many more, crowded in so fast, I say, upon me that I wanted to give vent to them and get rid of him, and was very glad when he was gone away.|$|E
6000|$|... "He has, ma'am," [...] replied Captain Wopper, with {{a decisive}} nod. [...] "You see, {{out in the}} gold-fields of Californy, we had long nights {{together}} in our tent, with nothin' to do but smoke our pipes, eat our grub, and spin yarns, for we had no books nor papers, nothin' to read except a noo Testament, and we wouldn't have had even that, ma'am, but for yourself. It was the Testament you gave to Willum at partin', an' very fond of it he was, bein' your gift. You see, {{at the time we}} went to Californy, there warn't many of us as cared for the Word of God. Most of us was idolaters that had run away from home, our chief gods--for we had many of 'em--bein' named Adventure, Excitement and Gold; though there was some noble exceptions, too. But, as I was saying, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time on our hands that we recalled all our past adventures together over and over again, and, you may be sure, ma'am, that your name and kindness was not forgotten. There was another name," [...] continued Captain Wopper, drawing his chair nearer the fire, crossing his legs and stroking his beard as {{he looked up at the}} dingy ceiling, [...] "that Willum often thought about and spoke of. It was the name of a gentleman, a clerk in the Customs, I believe, who saved his life one day when he fell into the river just below the bridge." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nagusuca {{said she}} {{intended}} to make women's issues and the fight against poverty a priority in Parliament.
