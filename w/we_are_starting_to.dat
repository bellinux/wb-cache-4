In March 2016, the company revoked its contract with Israel, with G4S chief executive Ashley Almanza saying that the company expected to exit a number of businesses [...] "in the next 12 to 24 months ... including G4S Israel". This was claimed by the national committee of the Palestine-based BDS group {{as a result of an}} international campaign against Israel, with Mahmoud Nawajaa (a representative of the group) saying: As the height of the international boycott of apartheid South Africa, BDS pressure is making some of the world’s largest corporations realise that profiting from Israeli apartheid and colonialism is bad for business. Investment fund managers are increasingly recognising that their fiduciary responsibility obliges them to divest from Israeli banks and companies that are implicated in Israel's serious human rights violations, such as G4S and HP, because of the high risk entailed. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> notice a domino effect.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most recent}} {{published}} figures for 2014/15 {{state that the}} evasion rate is between 5 and 6%. For the year 2005-6, TV Licensing reported that they [...] "reduced estimated evasion to a record low of 4.7%". However, this figure rose during the following year to 5.1% and remained at 5.1% during 2007-8. For the year 2010/2011 the evasion rate is stated as 5.2%. According to the BBC [...] "the published rate of evasion has increased marginally to 5.5% in 2012/13". The evasion rate is far from uniform across the UK, with Scotland having a far higher rate than the UK as a whole.One reason given by the BBC for evasion is lack of money in a household. For example, in the BBC Full Financial Statement 2012/13 the BBC says: 'as household budgets come under pressure, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>starting</b> <b>to</b> see an increase in licence fee evasionrates over their prior year level'. However, {{this is not the}} only reason given for TV licence evasion, since according to a submission made by the BBC to the Information Commissioner's Office: 'the BBC said that it is also aware that a growing number of individuals deliberately evade the licence fee due to dissatisfaction with the BBC'.|$|E

In May 1973, while still promoting 360 Degrees of Billy Paul, he was asked about a follow-up LP: [...] "I'm afraid that there will be something of a delay. As of right now, there are two sides actually completed. I have to tell you about one of them — Kenny and Leon wrote it especially and it's a definite single at some point. It's called [...] "I Was Married" [...] and I honestly think it will be bigger than [...] "Me and Mrs. Jones".
