40|$|Field {{research}} {{was carried out}} in autumn 2002 to test improved physical and mechanical weed control strategies in organic spinach. Four different work chains were compared. Specific operative machines (spring tine harrow, flame <b>weeder</b> <b>and</b> precision <b>hoe)</b> were set for the conventional soil preparation (ridge 1, 4 m wide) adopted by farmers for organic spinach for fresh market (hand picking). Throughout the testing period weed community, weed density and its total biomass were sampled. Preliminary results showed that relevant improvement in weed control and crop production may be obtained by new tested operative machine. Good contro...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} stale seedbed {{preparations}} and several weed control methods on {{the emergence of}} weeds in lettuce were studied. The specific goal was {{to evaluate the use}} of a stale seedbed in combination with chemical or mechanical weed control methods in the field. Depending on location and year, stale seedbed preparations followed by weed control prior to planting reduced the amount of weeds during crop growth by 43 ¿ 83 %. Control of the emerged seedlings after a stale seedbed preparation was more effective with glyphosate than with a rotary harrow. Covering the rotary harrow during control to prevent light reaching the soil improved its effect on the weed density during crop growth in two of 3 years. Radiation with far red light (FR) did not reduce the number of emerging weeds in this study. Mechanical control by finger <b>weeder,</b> torsion <b>weeder</b> <b>and</b> <b>hoe</b> was applied without stale seedbed preparations. These measures reduced the weed densities by 88 ¿ 99 %, compared with the untreated control and were more effective than chemical weed control with carbetamide and chlorpropham. The results show that the stale seedbed technique in combination with mechanical control of emerging weeds can reduce the weed population during crop growth as effectively as chemical control. The technique may therefore help reduce the use of herbicides in lettuce crops in the future...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{barriers}} for conventional farmers converting to organic production is weed control. An experiment {{was set up to}} evaluate the efficacy of three mechanical weed control methods, tine <b>weeder,</b> spoon <b>weeder</b> <b>and</b> inter-row <b>hoe</b> (only in the beans (Phaseolus vulgaris)), in four organically grown crops. In borage (Borago officinalis), weed dry matter (DM) was reduced by 41 % in tine-weeded plots but there was no treatment effect on crop DM or yield. There was no treatment effect in the peas (Pisum sativum). In linseed (Linum usitatissimum), mechanical weeding reduced weed DM by 41 % and resulted in a 28 % increase in crop yield. In beans, weed DM was reduced by 74 % in mechanically-weeded plots but the tine weeder reduced crop DM compared with the other mechanical weeding treatments...|$|R
60|$|But do not {{let this}} image mislead you. When the Socialist speaks of a plan, he knows clearly that it is {{impossible}} to make a plan as an architect makes a plan, because while the architect deals with dead stone and timber, the statesman and Socialist deal with living and striving things. But he seeks to make a plan as one designs and lays out a garden, so that sweet and seemly things may grow, wide and beautiful vistas open and weeds and foulness disappear. Always a garden plan develops and renews itself and discovers new possibilities, but what makes all its graciousness and beauty possible is the scheme and the persistent intention, the watching and the waiting, the digging <b>and</b> burning, the <b>weeder</b> clips <b>and</b> the <b>hoe.</b> That is the sort of plan, a living plan for things that live and grow, that the Socialist seeks for social and national life.|$|R
40|$|The {{integrated}} approach of weed management {{refers to a}} combination of direct and indirect methods in order to limit chemical applications. In oilseed rape, sunflower and soybean, mechanical weed control can be an alternative or a complement to herbicides and should take progressively a larger place in the direct weed control options, taking into account of the policy of restriction of chemical use. CETIOM launched a research program to assess, in different backgrounds, the selectivity and the efficacy of three tools, used either alone or combined with herbicides: the rotary <b>hoe,</b> the finger <b>weeder</b> <b>and</b> the in-row <b>hoe.</b> As an alternative or a complement to herbicides, mechanical weed control strategies were selective enough for oil crops if they were used in appropriate conditions (crop stage, soil surface moisture, adjustments of the tools). Linked with long term preventive measures to maintain weed population at a low level, they could be as efficient as herbicides but with an irregularity and strongly dependent on weed development stage. These techniques could be economically competitive but require often more working time. Mechanical management can thus be an answer to some of the new requirements of the agricultural context but operator skill, experience and knowledge are critical to success. Introducing these weed control methods in a farm requires a deep change of state of mind which appears today as a major restraint for the farmers...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effect of HOE 140 (a bradykinin β 2 receptor antagonist) and N(w) -nitro-L-arginine methyl-ester (L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) on endothelial and β-cell function in induced streptozotocine (Stz) diabetic rats. The decrease in the insulinogenic index after Stz efffect (control 286. 03 ± 104. 12 and Stz 18. 22 ± 10. 77 *, *P < 0. 001 vs. Control) was partially prevented by L-NAME (46. 54 ± 10. 12, P < 0. 001) <b>and</b> <b>HOE</b> 140 (105. 12 ± 23. 06, P < 0. 001). It was observed in diabetic rats: L-NAME increased the pancreatic endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) production <b>and</b> <b>HOE</b> 140 did not. L-NAME <b>and</b> <b>HOE</b> 140 decreased the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, increased prostacyclin 1 - 2 (PGI 2), and did not modify thromboxane A- 2 (TxA 2). These results indicate that L-NAME <b>and</b> <b>HOE</b> 140 had a protective effect on the development of diabetes in the rat. The protective effect of L-NAME <b>and</b> <b>HOE</b> 140 on the insulinogenic index could be related to ET- 1, bradykinin, PGI 2, and NO. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
