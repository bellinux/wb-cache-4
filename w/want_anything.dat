5|$|During {{his tour}} of New Japan in late August and early September, he started {{competing}} again as his Prince Devitt identity, utilizing an Irish superstar gimmick. He eventually turned heel and started teaming with the Control Terrorism Unit (CTU) in an apprenticetype role. While teaming with CTU, {{he began a}} losing streak, aggravating his teammates {{to such a degree}} that they did not <b>want</b> <b>anything</b> to do with him anymore. This led to him being given one final chance on 6 October, where he rose to the occasion and impressed his CTU teammates enough to continue his association with them. To solidify his status with the stable, Devitt teamed with CTU leader, Jushin Thunder Liger to take on Wataru Inoue and Ryusuke Taguchi. In a huge twist, Devitt was the one to make the final cover on Inoue following a stiff brainbuster. From then on he was officially recognized as a member of the CTU.|$|E

25|$|There {{was much}} debate {{regarding}} {{the future of}} Ground Zero following {{the destruction of the}} World Trade Center. Disagreement and controversy regarding who owned the property and what would be built there hindered construction at the site for several years. Many wanted the Twin Towers to be rebuilt, but stronger and taller. The project for new Twin Towers was called Twin Towers II which was led by the informal organization, Twin Towers Alliance. Others did not <b>want</b> <b>anything</b> built there at all or wanted the entire site to become a memorial. Finally, a master plan was agreed upon, which would feature a memorial and museum where the original Twin Towers stood and six new skyscrapers surrounding it.|$|E
25|$|After {{giving birth}} to their son, Ricky Williams, Isabella was {{convinced}} that her life would get better.

Paul's jealousy {{got the best of}} him, and he raped Christine, which Isabella later found out about and decided to dump Paul. Isabella was suspicious of a woman named Kelly Simmons that tried to investigate her, without realizing it was Christine in disguise. Paul {{decided to go back to}} Isabella and was even ready to move away with her. Christine found out about Michael's plot with Isabella and told everything to Paul. The couple reunited, and an unhappy Isabella decided to have her revenge. She made it seem like Christine had murdered her and, at the same time, she was plotting her next move. While everyone thought she was dead, Isabella confronted Christine in a bathtub after drugging her. Isabella was about to kill Christine when Paul arrived to stop her in time. Christine and Paul reunited but were unaware that Isabella was still alive. Michael came just in time to save Christine's and Paul's lives and Isabella was committed to a psychiatric hospital in Los Angeles.|$|E

When they return to Naomi's place to celebrate, Alec, Max's business partner tells Naomi that her and Max's relationship is a mistake. He tries multiple times to sabotage their relationship, but ultimately fails. Fed up of always fighting with Alec, Naomi asks Max to choose between her and Alec. While Max chooses her, which forces him to fire Alec from his company, their relationship becomes strained. Max and Naomi search for a replacement to Alec and when she sees the resume of Bryce Woodbridge, she tells Max to meet him as {{he seems to be}} the best candidate. However, after she discovers that Bryce is actually a woman, Naomi says she will do the job. After an unsuccessful attempt at the job, she asks Bryce to reconsider their offer.

Monteux was the conductor {{for the two}} outstanding works of the season, Vaslav Nijinsky's ballet version of Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, made with the composer's approval, and Fokine's Daphnis et Chloé to a score commissioned from Ravel. Monteux later recalled [...] "Debussy was behind me when we played L'après midi d'un faune {{because he did not}} <b>want</b> <b>anything</b> in his score to be changed on account of the dancing. And when we came to a forte, he said 'Monteux, that is a forte, play forte'. He did not <b>want</b> <b>anything</b> shimmering. And he wanted everything exactly in time".|$|E

500|$|On Monday, November 28, 1887, Gray's {{hand and}} arm became paralyzed {{while he was}} coming down the stairs for breakfast. Even though the {{paralysis}} worsened, {{he was able to}} address two letters. On Thursday he lost the ability to speak in a steady rhythm. He lay speechless and quiet for two months, and died on January30, 1888. He was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery. He did not <b>want</b> <b>anything</b> fancy on his gravestone, so his wife had it engraved with a cross and [...] "Asa Gray 1810–1888". The cemetery's Asa Gray Garden, with a central fountain and numerous unusual tree varieties, is named in his honor.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, {{a number}} of changes were made in New Haven and in the {{subsequent}} two weeks of previews in Boston. The show was running long; Logan persuaded his friend, playwright Emlyn Williams, {{to go over the}} script and cut extraneous dialogue. [...] There were wide expectations of a hit; producer Mike Todd came backstage and advised that the show not be taken to New York [...] "because it's too damned good for them". The show moved to Boston, where it was so successful that playwright George S.

500|$|Cisneros {{currently}} {{resides in}} San Miguel de Allende, {{a city in}} central Mexico, but for years she lived and wrote in San Antonio, Texas, in her briefly controversial [...] "Mexican-pink" [...] home with [...] "many creatures little and large." [...] In 1990 when Pilar E. Rodríguez Aranda asked Cisneros in an interview for the Americas Review why she has never married or started a family, Cisneros replied, [...] "I've never seen a marriage that is as happy as my living alone. My writing is my child and I don't <b>want</b> <b>anything</b> to come between us." [...] She has elaborated elsewhere that she enjoys living alone because it gives her time to think and write. In {{the introduction to the}} third edition of Gloria E. Anzaldúa's Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Cisneros wrote: [...] "It's why I moved from Illinois to Texas. So that the relatives and family would allow me the liberty to disappear into myself. To reinvent myself if I had to. As Latinas, we have to...

500|$|Frusciante's {{approach}} to album composition has changed. On his early recordings, he welcomed sonic imperfections, noting that [...] "even on [...] there are off-pitch vocals and out-of-tune guitars." [...] However, on later albums such as Shadows Collide With People, he pursued the opposite: [...] "I just wanted {{everything to be}} perfect—I didn't <b>want</b> <b>anything</b> off pitch, or off time, or any unintentional this or that." [...] Frusciante views songwriting as taking time, and does not force it: [...] "If a song wants to come to me, I'm always ready to receive it, but I don't work at it." [...] Much of his solo material is first written on an acoustic or unamplified electric guitar. He also prefers to record his albums on analog tapes and other relatively primitive equipment. This preference stems from his belief that older equipment can actually speed up the recording process, and that modern computerized recording technology gives only an illusion of efficiency. Frusciante tries to streamline the recording process as much as possible, because he thinks [...] "music comes alive when [...] are creating it fast". He also enjoys the challenge of having to record something in very few takes, and believes that when musicians are unable to handle the pressure of having to record something quickly they often get frustrated or bogged down by perfectionism. With his focus on new styles of music, Frusciante describes having worked with the computer as an instrument, and having found the ability to merge old and new production techniques together. He has noted {{that there has been}} a change in how he works on an album. In the past he would work on one song at a time, but with the new [...] "Progressive Synth Pop" [...] that he has been working on, he feels much more comfortable to work within the album as a whole. He currently uses the music tracker Renoise as his main Digital audio workstation along with some drum machines, sequencers, and other hardware, along with his Doepfer, Arp, and other modular synthesizers.|$|E
