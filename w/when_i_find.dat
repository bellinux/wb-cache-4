500|$|Musically, [...] "Deuces" [...] is a slow, down-tempo R ballad that {{displays}} {{elements of}} house and pop music. The song has {{a length of}} four minutes and thirty-six seconds. It is backed by synth chords and [...] "eerie harmonies", with Brown's [...] "smooth vocals" [...] making use of auto-tune effects. According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, the song contains lyrical content about [...] "breaking {{it off with a}} girl after failed attempts to make the relationship work". In the first verse, Brown sings: [...] "All that bullshit is for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture / Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up / You'll regret the day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> another girl, that knows just what I need / She knows just what I mean." ...|$|E
500|$|Hank Williams, {{who heard}} both the Miller and Griffin versions, started {{performing}} the {{song on the}} Louisiana Hayride shortly after joining in August 1948. Horace Logan, the show's producer and programming director for KWKH, reported that the audience [...] "went crazy" [...] the first time Williams performed the song on the show. [...] In light of the live audience's strong positive reaction, Williams decided to record the song. His decision was questioned by his musicians and also his producer, Fred Rose, who felt that the song did not merit a recording. Williams, mindful of the reaction he received live, [...] persisted, and the recording {{took place during the}} final half-hour of a session recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 22, 1948. For this recording, Williams replaced the jazz musicians with a modern country music band, using a rhythm guitar, mandolin, string bass, drums and a steel guitar. [...] Williams' session band was composed of Clyde Baum (mandolin), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Louis Innis (rhythm guitar), Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Willie Thawl (bass). With little time left, Byrd and Turner replicated the musical arrangement they previously used on an Ernest Tubb session for a cover of Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "Waiting for a Train". [...] In the episode of American Masters about Williams, Drifting Cowboy Don Helms recalls, [...] "When they recorded 'Lovesick Blues,' Fred told Hank, 'That song's out of meter! [...] Got too many bars in it. [...] And you hold that note too long.' [...] And Hank said, 'Well, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> a note I like, I wanna hold on to it as long as I can,' you know, just tryin' to be funny. [...] And Fred said, 'Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. [...] That thing is so much out of meter, I'm gonna get me {{a cup of coffee and}} when I get back maybe ya'll have that thing cut.' [...] And they did, but it was still out of meter. [...] So Fred lived with that the rest of his life." [...] Williams combined Griffin's lyrical arrangement with a two-beat honky-tonk track, borrowing the yodeling and beat drops from Miller's recording. [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] was recorded in two takes.|$|E
