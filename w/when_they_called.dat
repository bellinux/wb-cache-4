Divas Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle were {{traded to}} Raw for Raw Divas Stacy Keibler and Christy Hemme, who were moved to SmackDown!. During their debut, the duo of Torrie and Candice began a new storyline <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> Diva Search 2005 winner Ashley Massaro to ringside to congratulate her for winning the competition, but instead they taunted and {{attacked}} her, becoming villains in the process. The next week, Torrie and Candice recruited the evil Victoria to join them, and the three began harassing Massaro on a regular basis. They also taunted and embarrassed her during matches.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Navarins actions during the Battle of Tsushima on 27–28 May as {{there were very few}} {{survivors}} from the ship and visibility was poor for most of the battle. The ship was apparently not heavily engaged during {{the early part of the}} battle, but was badly damaged later in the day when she was third from last in the Russian line of battle. She was hit four times by large-caliber shells on the waterline that caused major flooding aft. Her quarterdeck was awash up to her rear 12-inch turret by 2100 and the ship was forced to stop for repairs. Around that time she was attacked by Japanese torpedo boats that may have made one or two torpedo hits. Navarin managed to get underway again and damaged one torpedo boat badly enough that she sank later that night. Around 0200 on 28 May, the ship was attacked again by the Fourth Destroyer Division which dropped six strings of mines ahead of her. These consisted of four mines linked together with cables so that hitting any part of the string would draw the mines onto the ship. Two of these mines struck Navarin, which quickly capsized and sank. Some 70 men were able to abandon ship before she sank, but only three were alive when they were found 16 hours later. One man was rescued by a Japanese torpedo boat while the other two were rescued by a British merchant ship. The rest of her crew of 674 officers and enlisted men were lost. The rescued men had said that <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> out for help, they were fired on by Japanese torpedo boats.|$|E

25|$|The only {{fact that}} can be adduced {{in support of the}} {{assertion}} that Grimm wished to deprive Rask of his claims to priority is that he does not expressly mention Rask's results in his second edition. But {{it was part of the}} plan of his work to refrain from all controversy or reference to the works of others. In his first edition, he expressly calls attention to Rask's essay, and praises it ungrudgingly. It is true that a certain bitterness of feeling afterwards sprang up between Grimm and Rask, but this may have well been Rask's fault, who, impatient of contradiction and irritable in controversy, refused to consider the value of Grimm's views <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> for the modification of his own.|$|E

25|$|The group {{moved over}} to the north end (La Salle side) after talks between Cojuangco and Letran Rector Fr. Regino Cortes. Only then did the Letran bleachers fill up. With the game on the way, Letran was toting a 22–18 lead <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> a {{time-out}} halfway through the first half; then, the south end reserve section (Letran side) erupted with at least five burly men (part of the guests of La Salle's team manager) ganging up on a hapless Letran high school sophomore student for a full minute before police could intervene. But for the mauled student, none was picked up (by the police). Almost simultaneously, the La Salle bench suddenly stood up, the players hunched and protecting their heads with towels and jackets against various missiles pelted on them.|$|E
25|$|During the 1st {{seven minutes}} of the 2nd half, neither team took a lead larger than 2 while Duke would have a 45-43 lead <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> a 30-second timeout. Then, Brian Zoubek would make a basket to give Duke a 47-43 lead. In the next 35 seconds, Gordon Hayward made two free throws to cut the Duke lead to 49-47. In the next minute, Jon Scheyer scored five points to give Duke a 56-51 lead. During the next 35 seconds after Butler called a 30-second timeout, Matt Howard and Gordon Hayward each made a pair of free throws to cut the Duke lead to 56-55 and Duke would call a 30-second timeout. Then, Kyle Singler made a basket to give Duke a 58-55 lead and Butler would call a 30-second timeout. With 3:16 {{remaining}}, Nolan Smith made a pair of free throws to give Duke a 60-55 lead. Within the next minute after 1:50 was remaining in the game, Matt Howard scored four points to cut the Duke lead to 60-59. With 3 seconds left, Brian Zoubek made one of two free throws to give Duke a 61-59 lead. Gordon Hayward narrowly missed a buzzer-beating half-court shot which would have won the game for Butler and it resulted in a 61-59 win for Duke and the National Championship.|$|E

500|$|After {{two months}} of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting. His fee was a {{guaranteed}} minimum of $10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes. He appeared {{with most of the}} leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities. Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary. At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat. Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, [...] "You know, this doesn't happen to me in Paris." [...] Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon. Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity. He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> him [...] "the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion".|$|E

It rose to number one the next week with total sales of 65,764 copies, and {{remained}} at the top for three weeks. In an interview with Daily Mail, Gaga explained her feelings on reaching number-one in the United Kingdom saying, [...] "It's been a long running dream {{to have a big}} hit in the UK– my fans there are so sexy and the people are so innovative and free in how they think about pop culture and music. I was in my apartment in Los Angeles {{getting ready to go to}} dance rehearsal <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> and told me, and I just cried."

500|$|... "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Castellaneta, who voices {{characters}} such as Homer and Krusty on The Simpsons, and his wife Deb Lacusta. American comedian and actress Joan Rivers guest starred in the episode as Annie. She recorded her lines in March 2011. In an interview with E! News at that time, Rivers noted {{that this was not}} her first animated voice-over role, though it was her biggest one yet. She further added that she is a fan of the show because it is [...] "so clever and so funny on so many levels. So <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> and said, 'Do you want to do it?' without even reading a script I said, 'Absolutely.'" [...] Adam Buckman, a former television columnist at the New York Post, noted on his blog that the story of the episode is similar to a period in Rivers' life {{at the end of the}} 1980s. At that time, she was hosting The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers on the Fox network. When Rivers challenged Fox executives who wanted to fire her husband Edgar Rosenberg as the show's executive producer, the network fired them both. Rosenberg committed suicide just three months later. Buckman wrote that the story of [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] was [...] "no doubt devised with Rivers’ approval and possibly with her input", and that [...] "only a comedian of her stature and experience" [...] would attempt to spoof a personal tragedy such as this one. Other guest stars in the episode include actor Kevin Dillon and stand-up comedian Janeane Garofalo as themselves, and stand-up comedian Jackie Mason in a minor reprisal of his role as Krusty's father, speaking only one line.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{alphabetic}} {{nature of}} its script, Manchu was not taught phoneme by phoneme per letter like western languages are, rather, Manchu children were taught to memorize all the syllables in the Manchu language separately as they learned to write, like Chinese characters.

They made, for instance, no such use of the consonants I, m, n, and r, as westerners do <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>called</b> them liquid; hence if the Manchu letters s, m, a, r, t, were joined in that order, a Manchu would not able to pronounce them as English speaking people pronounce the word [...] "smart".
