5|$|In Wicca, salt is {{symbolic}} of the element Earth. It is also believed to cleanse an area of harmful or negative energies. A dish of salt and a dish of <b>water</b> <b>are</b> almost always present on an altar, and salt is used {{in a wide variety}} of rituals and ceremonies.|$|E
40|$|Cliches come {{easy when}} the {{importance}} of <b>water</b> <b>is</b> discussed. <b>Water</b> <b>is</b> life. <b>Water</b> <b>is</b> destiny. "Whiskey is for drinking and <b>water</b> <b>is</b> to fight over" is an oft used phrase to acknowledge water's more immediate influence, especially in the West. Many speakers have proclaimed that <b>water</b> <b>is</b> a driving force in western politics and a wave upon which much of the economic activities of the region rise and fall. In short, <b>water</b> <b>is</b> pretty important stuff...|$|R

5000|$|Traditionally, mineral <b>waters</b> <b>were</b> used or {{consumed}} {{at their}} spring sources, {{often referred to}} as [...] "taking the waters" [...] or [...] "taking the cure," [...] at places such as spas, baths, or wells. The term spa was used for a place where the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> consumed and bathed in; bath where the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> used primarily for bathing, therapeutics, or recreation; and well where the <b>water</b> <b>was</b> to be consumed.|$|R

50|$|One puzzling {{consequence}} of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators <b>are</b> necessary. If <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O, then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H2O' {{pick out the}} same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H2O'. Therefore, <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, {{but that does not}} affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed <b>is</b> that <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O, but conditionally, if <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it <b>is</b> true), then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O.|$|R

5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of <b>water</b> <b>are</b> classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{can also}} be applied to natural kinds. If <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O, then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H2O' pick out the same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H2O'. Therefore, <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, {{but that does not}} affect the necessity of identities.

5|$|Benign conditions, {{sometimes}} {{also referred}} to as confined <b>water,</b> <b>are</b> environments of low risk, where it is extremely unlikely or impossible for the diver to get lost or entrapped, or be exposed to hazards other than the basic underwater environment. These conditions are suitable for initial training in the critical survival skills, and include swimming pools, training tanks, aquarium tanks and some shallow and protected shoreline areas.|$|E
5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of <b>water</b> <b>are</b> absent from their definitions. In the example above, one newton is the force required to accelerate {{a mass of}} one kilogram by one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.|$|E
5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and is less polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile is less basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for <b>water</b> <b>are</b> included for comparison.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} {{close proximity to}} its neighbouring communities, a motorized pirogue trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took {{an hour and a}} half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from Cap Skirring via Cachouane is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt <b>water</b> <b>are</b> not easily navigated.|$|E
5|$|Lakes in the {{watershed}} of Leggetts Creek include the Griffin Reservoir, Maple Lake, and Summit Lake. These bodies of <b>water</b> <b>are</b> in South Abington Township and Scott Township. The Griffin Reservoir supplies water {{to people in}} the Leggetts Creek watershed. The creek and the reservoir serve as a supplemental drinking water supply for more than 100,000 people as of the late 20th century. A spring known as Fountain Springs is in {{the watershed}} in South Abington Township. The Justus Meadows are in the watershed in Scott Township. Most of the watershed is developed, but there are still a few undeveloped reaches of the creek.|$|E

5|$|Of {{most vital}} {{importance}} to marshes are invertebrate animals, {{the foundation of}} food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations. Mosquitos, born in <b>water,</b> <b>are</b> in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.|$|E
5|$|Stony Creek's {{water is}} the hardest water in the Nescopeck Creek watershed, with a {{concentration}} of over 100 milligrams per liter of dissolved minerals. Other streams in the watershed with hard <b>water</b> <b>are</b> Reilly Creek (28 milligrams per liter) and Long Run (21 milligrams per liter). Some of the least hard waters in the Nescopeck Creek watershed are those of Little Nescopeck Creek A (3 to 8 milligrams per liter), Conety Run (5 milligrams per liter), and Oley Creek (7 milligrams per liter). However, the largest source of pollution in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is acid mine drainage (AMD).|$|E
5|$|Storms of Category2 {{intensity}} often damage {{roofing material}} (sometimes exposing the roof) and inflict damage upon poorly constructed doors and windows. Poorly constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped. Mobile homes, whether anchored or not, are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed, and many manufactured homes also suffer structural damage. Small craft in unprotected anchorages may break their moorings. Extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable <b>water</b> <b>are</b> likely, possibly lasting many days.|$|E
