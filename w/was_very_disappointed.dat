5|$|Stalin <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> and infuriated by {{the early}} reports of heavy Soviet losses in the battle, and {{on the evening of}} 12 July he scolded Rotmistrov via a phone call. He {{considered}} sacking Rotmistrov and having him court-martialed, but ended up not doing so. The same evening, he dispatched Zhukov, who had been overseeing Operation Kutuzov, to Vatutin's headquarters as Stavka representative, in order to assume control of coordinating the operations of the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts.|$|E
5|$|Joining Mikulski as an {{advocate}} for servicing Hubble was NASA's Chief Scientist, physicist John Grunsfeld, who {{was present at the}} meeting when O'Keefe announced the cancellation of the mission. A veteran astronaut of four shuttle missions, including two Hubble servicing missions, Grunsfeld had devoted years to Hubble, and <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> when O'Keefe canceled the mission. He briefly considered retiring from NASA, but realized if he stayed, he could continue to advance physics in other ways. Instead, Grunsfeld dedicated himself to finding alternate ways to service the telescope, possibly by sending a robot into orbit to do the job. When O'Keefe announced his resignation as Administrator in December 2004, five days after a National Academy of Sciences committee opposed O'Keefe's position regarding servicing Hubble, the media and science community saw hope for the telescope's servicing mission to be reinstated.|$|E
25|$|Watson's {{first game}} back from glandular fever {{was at the}} French Open. Despite playing well, Watson lost to Stefanie Vögele in three sets, saying after the match she {{knew it would be}} tough but that she <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|E

25|$|While glad {{to regain}} his freedom, Hoffa <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the {{condition}} imposed on his release by President Nixon, which prevented Hoffa from engaging in union activities until March 1980. He accused senior Nixon administration figures, including Attorney General John N. Mitchell and White House Special Counsel Charles Colson, of depriving him of his rights by initiating this clause; Mitchell and Colson both denied this. It was likely imposed upon Hoffa {{as the result of}} requests from the Teamsters' leadership, although IBT President Frank Fitzsimmons also denied this.|$|E
25|$|England won the toss, {{chose to}} bat {{and made an}} {{impressive}} start to their innings, with the opening stand being worth 133 in 39 overs. Michael Vaughan played some exquisite shots, bringing back memories of his performances against India and Australia in 2002 {{when he reached the}} top of the world rankings. It took a freakish dismissal to remove him, the ball getting caught in the trousers of the short leg fielder who then managed to grab it before it hit the ground. Vaughan had made 87, and <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> to have to leave the crease when he had the potential to make a very large score.|$|E
25|$|In the election, Taylor won 47.3% of {{the popular}} vote and a {{majority}} of the electoral vote, giving the Whigs control of the presidency. Cass won 42.5% of the vote, while Van Buren finished with 10.1% {{of the popular}} vote, more than any other third party presidential candidate at that time. Despite the increasingly polarizing slavery debate, Taylor and Cass both won a mix of northern and southern states. However, much of Van Buren's support came from northern Democrats. Polk <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the outcome as he had a low opinion of Taylor, seeing the general as someone with poor judgment and few opinions. Polk left office on March 4, 1849, and departed Washington on March 6.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1913, Deakin {{resigned}} as Leader of the Opposition. Forrest and Joseph Cook contested the leadership, with Cook winning {{by a single}} vote. Forrest <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed,</b> especially since Deakin, whom he considered a friend, had voted against him. Five months later, in the May 1913 federal election, the Liberal Party returned to power, with Cook as Prime Minister. Forrest was appointed treasurer for the third time. However, the government's majority of just one seat in the House of Representatives, along with Labor's large majority in the Senate, {{made it difficult to}} get anything done. In June 1914, Cook asked the Governor-General for a double dissolution, and Australia was sent back to the polls. Forrest retained his seat, but the Liberal Party was soundly defeated and Forrest was again relegated to the crossbenches.|$|E
25|$|On June 6, Woods {{stated that}} he would remain with {{longtime}} agent Mark Steinberg after the agent's contract was not renewed by the International Management Group. The following day, {{he announced that he}} would not be playing in the 2011 U.S. Open, set to begin June 16, due to continued pain in his left Achilles tendon and left anterior cruciate ligament. Woods stated he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> to be unable to play in the season's second major championship, but that he was listening to his doctors, continuing to work on his recovery, and planning for the long term. Woods also missed the 2011 British Open, still recovering from injury. He fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams following the AT National in early July; Williams now caddies for Adam Scott.|$|E
25|$|After Joan Crawford's third divorce, Gable and she {{resumed their}} affair and lived {{together}} for a brief time. Gable was acclaimed for his performance in The Hucksters (1947), a satire of postwar Madison Avenue corruption and immorality. A very public and brief romance with Paulette Goddard occurred after that. In 1949, Gable married Sylvia Ashley, a British model and actress who was previously married to Douglas Fairbanks. The relationship was profoundly unsuccessful; they divorced in 1952. Soon followed Never Let Me Go (1953), opposite Gene Tierney. Tierney was a favorite of Gable and he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> when she was replaced in Mogambo (because of her mental health problems) by Grace Kelly. Mogambo (1953), directed by John Ford, was a somewhat sanitized remake of his earlier Pre-Code film Red Dust, with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor, which had been a greater success. Gable's on-location affair with Grace Kelly (1929–1982), who was {{young enough to be}} his daughter, gradually ended after filming was completed.|$|E

Shortly after her performance, juror [...] expressed how he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> by Stan's act, as she didn't provide live vocals. In an interview with Cancan, Stan confessed that [...] " [...] conditions of appearance at Vocea României were previously discussed with the producers of the show, so no one should have been surprised about [...] performing playback". [...] "Cherry Pop" [...] was included on the track list of her Unlocked Tour (2014) and her Cherry Pop Summer Tour (2014).|$|E
500|$|Volk {{was cut by}} the Broncos in August 1976 {{and signed}} by the Miami Dolphins two weeks later. He did not play for the Dolphins in 1976 and was signed mid-season by the New York Giants. [...] Volk played in 8 games for the Giants in 1976 and tallied 2 interceptions and a fumble recovery. Volk was cut by the Giants in early September 1977, shortly {{before the start of}} the regular season. [...] Volk {{recalled}} the disappointment at being cut by the Giants at age 32: [...] "I felt I should have been in New York, but they went with younger people. [...] I <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed,</b> especially to get cut at the end of training camp. [...] I'd done all the hard training and was ready for the season [...] the fun time." [...] He returned to his home in Baltimore and worked during the fall as a manufacturer's representative.|$|E
500|$|When Horne {{found out}} that the 14th RWF had not moved and that their attack had been pushed back to 8 July, he summoned Ivor Philipps to Corps {{headquarters}} and sacked him. General Douglas Haig, commander of the BEF, noted this event in his diary. He wrote: [...] "visited HQ XV Corps and saw General Horne. He <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the work of the... 38th Welsh Div". Haig further commented that Philipps was relieved of his command as the majority of the division had [...] "never entered" [...] the woods despite the [...] "most adequate... bombard", had suffered [...] "under 150 casualties" [...] during their attack and that: [...] "a few bold men [...] entered the Wood found little opposition". Historian Don Farr wrote that Haig's entries are at odds with the facts and that he relied heavily on what Horne had told him. Farr states that Horne's account to Haig was self-serving, did no justice [...] "to the difficulties confronting the troops on the ground", and did not acknowledge the failure of the bombardment. He also suggests that the sacking of Philipps may have been political, by a distrusting officer corps towards a perceived political appointee.|$|E

500|$|On 31 July 2009, Digital Spy {{conducted}} a poll asking {{if it was}} [...] "time to move on" [...] from Ianto. However, a week later the website did not immediately publish the results, announcing [...] "unfortunately it seems that this particular Poll {{was the subject of}} a campaign by diehard fans to distort the outcome". Neil Wilkes opined that this action by the fans [...] "suggests the answer to the question 'Have people overreacted to Ianto's death?' is quite obvious". Later, a footnote amendment noted that 31.4% said it was time to move on, [...] "while the remainder demanded RTD's head on a plate", a reference to his own wording of the original poll, which gave readers the option of moving on from Ianto, or the executive producer's head on a plate. James McCarthy of Wales Online described the reaction from some fans as [...] "sickening" [...] and quoted [...] "crazed" [...] fans on DeviantArt and Facebook who made explicit death threats against the Children of Earth writers. Gareth David-Lloyd stated he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> in those fans, whose message board conduct he does not support at all and called [...] "completely unacceptable". David-Lloyd added that he [...] "would hope the writers would be able to ignore comments like that". A number of fans were upset by the tone of the first Wales Online article, and their response prompted a follow up from McCarthy. In their comments, fans pointed out that his article disproportionately highlights what they called the [...] "ill-conceived, knee-jerk reactions" [...] of a few individuals, and stressed that these reactions in no way represent the movement to bring Ianto Jones back, which they hold as fundamentally respectful towards the show's actors and writers. Fans have distanced themselves from the small minority of extremists, and have been keen to stress their peaceful activism, described as [...] "thousands of fans who are raising money for charity, sending polite letters, and doing what we can to be supportive of the character and actor". In 2010, Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat told fans who contacted him that he wouldn't want to resurrect Ianto even if he could: [...] "Not reversing it. Stop asking." [...] In a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live Interview with writer John Fay, 70% of respondents replied that the decision to kill Ianto had been the right one, with 19% responding [...] "indifferent" [...] and only 11% stating that it had been the wrong decision, contrasting with the initial fan response. In response to a question, Fay also stated that he had not been affected by the [...] "scary" [...] fan reaction, maintaining that [...] "a universe in which fictional characters aren't 'allowed' to die is ridiculous and limiting".|$|E

Jones stated {{in an interview that}} he thought k-os' comments were a [...] "lame response," [...] and that [...] "a five-year-old could come up with something wittier." [...] k-os and Danko shared a rehearsal space and often had in depth conversations during their breaks outside the rehearsal space.

2500|$|On the {{official}} Arsenal matchday {{program for the}} game against Wigan Athletic on 11 February 2007, Pirès revealed his heartbreak of being substituted so early on during the Champions League final. Pirès stated: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointed.</b> When I saw my number on the fourth official’s board to be substituted, I couldn't believe it. It was my last game after six years at the club, a Champions League Final {{in front of all}} my family in Paris where I became World Cup champion and it lasted just 12 minutes. That was very hard to take". Pires was in fact substituted on 18 minutes for backup goalkeeper Manuel Almunia after goalkeeper Jens Lehmann who had received a straight red card.|$|E
