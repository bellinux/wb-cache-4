5|$|Outside of China, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} texts to mention gunpowder is Roger Bacon's Opus Majus (1267) and Opus Tertium in what has been interpreted as a reference to firecrackers. In the early 20th century, a British artillery officer proposed that another work tentatively attributed to Bacon, Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae, et de Nullitate Magiae, also known as Opus Minor, dated to 1247, contained an encrypted formula for gunpowder. These claims have been disputed by science historians. The formula itself, claimed to have been hidden <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> through encryption, is not useful for firearm or even firecrackers, burning slowly and producing mostly smoke.|$|E

Although embedded <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> of <b>the</b> New Testament, these creeds are a distinct source for Early Christianity.

25|$|The gospel's title {{appears at}} the end of the Coptic {{manuscript}} in a colophon; the only connection with Philip the Apostle <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> is that he is the only apostle mentioned (at 73,8). The text proper makes no claim to be from Philip, though, similarly, the four New Testament gospels make no explicit claim of authorship. The Gospel of Philip was written between 150 AD and 350 AD, while Philip himself lived in the first century, making it extremely unlikely to be his writing. Most scholars hold a 3rd-century date of composition.|$|E
25|$|Ovid {{has been}} seen as taking on a persona in his poetry that is far more emotionally {{detached}} from his mistress and less involved in crafting a unique emotional realism <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> than the other elegists. This attitude, coupled with the lack of testimony that identifies Ovid's Corinna with a real person has led scholars to conclude that Corinna was never a real person—and that Ovid's relationship with her is an invention for his elegiac project. Some scholars have even interpreted Corinna as a metapoetic symbol for the elegiac genre itself.|$|E
25|$|Zechariah 1–8, {{sometimes}} referred to as First Zechariah, was written in the 6th century BC. Zechariah 9–14, often called Second Zechariah, contains <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> no datable references to specific events or individuals but most scholars give the text a date in the fifth century BCE. Second Zechariah, in the opinion of some scholars, appears {{to make use of the}} books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, the Deuteronomistic History, and the themes from First Zechariah. This has led some to believe that the writer(s) or editor(s) of Second Zechariah may have been a disciple of the prophet Zechariah. There are some scholars who go even further and divide Second Zechariah into Second Zechariah (9–11) and Third Zechariah (12–14) since each begins with a heading oracle.|$|E

25|$|The {{consequences}} {{of reducing the}} costs of production of the 8th edition can be seen today in surviving sets. With only 402 plates, this edition has the fewest since the second edition, and far fewer woodcuts <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> pages were used than in the 7th edition. The maps are all reprinted from the 7th edition, even the ones {{that should have been}} updated. In the first few volumes, a sheet of onion-skin paper faces each plate, but after volume 6, they were eliminated. To save money, the end pages and covers were not marbled, as this was an expensive process. Finally, the end pages contain advertisements for other products sold by A & C. Black, such as atlases and travel guides, and advertisements encouraging subscribers to continue their enrollments.|$|E
25|$|The parts resembled {{pamphlets}} {{and contained}} {{the text of}} several chapters between outer pages of steel-plate engravings and advertising. Woodcut engravings, which could be set along with normal moveable type, appeared <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b> The same engraved illustration appeared on the canary-yellow cover of each monthly part; this colour became Thackeray's signature, as a light blue-green was Dickens's, allowing passers-by to notice a new Thackeray number in a bookstall from a distance. Vanity Fair was the first work that Thackeray published under his own name and was extremely well received at the time. After the conclusion of its serial publication, it was printed as a bound volume by Bradbury & Evans in 1848 and was quickly picked up by other London printers as well. As a collected work, the novels bore the subtitle A Novel without a Hero. By the end of 1859, royalties on Vanity Fair had only given Thackeray about £2000, {{a third of his}} take from The Virginians, but was responsible for his still more lucrative lecture tours in Britain and the United States.|$|E
25|$|In the Sunni tradition, {{the number}} of such texts is ten {{thousand}} plus or minus a few thousand. But if, say, ten companions record a text reporting a single incident {{in the life of the}} prophet, hadith scholars can count this as ten hadiths. So Musnad Ahmad, for example, has over 30,000 hadiths—but this count includes texts that are repeated in order to record slight variations <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>text</b> or within the chains of narrations. Identifying the narrators of the various texts, comparing their narrations of the same texts to identify both the soundest reporting of a text and the reporters who are most sound in their reporting occupied experts of hadith throughout the 2nd century. In the 3rd century of Islam (from 225/840 to about 275/889), hadith experts composed brief works recording a selection of about two- to five-thousand such texts which they felt to have been most soundly documented or most widely referred to in the Muslim scholarly community. The 4th and 5th century saw these six works being commented on quite widely. This auxiliary literature has contributed to making their study the place of departure for any serious study of hadith. In addition, Bukhari and Muslim in particular, claimed that they were collecting only the soundest of sound hadiths. These later scholars tested their claims and agreed to them, so that today, they are considered the most reliable collections of hadith. Toward the end of the 5th century, Ibn al-Qaisarani formally standardized the Sunni canon into six pivotal works, a delineation which remains to this day.|$|E

500|$|Around 1611, Kepler {{circulated}} {{a manuscript}} {{of what would}} eventually be published (posthumously) as Somnium [...] Part {{of the purpose of}} Somnium was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet, to show the feasibility of a non-geocentric system. The manuscript, which disappeared after changing hands several times, described a fantastic trip to the moon; it was part allegory, part autobiography, and part treatise on interplanetary travel (and is sometimes described as the first work of science fiction). Years later, a distorted version of the story may have instigated the witchcraft trial against his mother, as the mother of the narrator consults a demon to learn the means of space travel. Following her eventual acquittal, Kepler composed 223 footnotes to the story—several times longer than the actual text—which explained the allegorical aspects as well as the considerable scientific content (particularly regarding lunar geography) hidden <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>text.</b>|$|E
