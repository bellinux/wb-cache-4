Tillman never forgave this slight, and became a bitter enemy of Roosevelt, Tillman was {{inclined}} to oppose Roosevelt anyway, who soon after becoming president had dined at the White House with Booker T. Washington, an African American, provoking Tillman to say, [...] "the action of President Roosevelt in entertaining that nigger will necessitate our killing a thousand niggers in the South before they learn their place again." ...|$|E

5000|$|SV {{has been}} criticised for no-platforming certain feminists and women. In January 2017, it <b>withdrew</b> <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> UK {{journalist}} and gender-critical radical feminist campaigner Julie Bindel {{to speak at}} its Women's Conference, alleging [...] "transphobia". Julie Bindel was to speak about prostitution, and not about issues relating to trans-women's access to women's politics, domestic violence shelter's, and sexuality. Feminist activist and prostitution survivor Rachel Moran withdrew from attending in solidarity with Julie Bindel. Twitter threads reveal that the protest was orchestrated by some male members of SV who are unhappy with Norway's sex buyer laws criminalizing the purchase of sex, and the SV's support of that law. http://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/01/05/whats-current-104/ ...|$|R
5000|$|In March, 2009, the Union <b>withdrew</b> <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> {{euthanasia}} campaigner Philip Nitschke after Nitschke {{had already}} accepted the <b>invitation.</b> Nitschke received <b>a</b> second email cancelling the invitation {{in the interests}} of there being a [...] "fair debate", and was told other speakers were unwilling to speak alongside him. The debate topic was the legalisation of assisted suicide, a field in which Nitschke is prominent. The reason given by Oxford Union president Corey Dixon was that two other speakers [...] "disagree with his particular take on suicide". According to Dixon, the speakers who successfully pressured the Union <b>to</b> <b>withdraw</b> Nitschke's <b>invitation</b> were <b>a</b> member of the public, whose brother had undergone assisted death, and British euthanasia campaigner Michael Irwin. However, Irwin later denied that he had applied pressure to exclude Nitschke.|$|R
5000|$|The Anoka-Hennepin School District, {{the largest}} school {{district}} in Minnesota, revised its policies following a challenge of the book at Anoka High School. The parents of an Anoka High student, partnering with a citizen's group within the district, had challenged the book’s place in school libraries, calling it “vile profanity" [...] because of its crude language. They cited 227 instances of coarse language and sexuality and demanded it be pulled from library shelves. [...] The district and the Anoka County Library <b>withdrew</b> <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> the author {{to speak about the}} book. When the Anoka High principal convened a committee of parents, staff and a student to review the book, the committee determined that it was powerful, realistic and appropriate for high schoolers. During this controversy, the book received support from the National Coalition Against Censorship, which noted irony in the school district canceling an appearance by the author that was scheduled to occur during Banned Books Week.|$|R

5000|$|After {{a regular}} guest spot on RNZ's show The Panel, the network <b>withdrew</b> <b>an</b> <b>invitation</b> for Bradbury <b>to</b> return as a {{panellist}}. While Bradbury {{claimed he had}} been [...] "banned" [...] for criticising the New Zealand Prime Minister, John Key, RNZ {{said he had not}} been banned, and that he had been removed as a panellist after breaching their editorial policy. According to Radio NZ “Mr Bradbury’s comments were inconsistent with information that he had provided to programme producers before going on air. Mr Bradbury later apologised to the programme’s executive producer. It was made clear to him that while his <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> appear as <b>an</b> occasional guest on The Panel was being withdrawn, it was not a ‘lifelong ban’ and it did not apply to other Radio New Zealand programmes".|$|R
