40|$|A {{new process}} for etching {{trenches}} in bulk silicon for {{the generation of}} trench capacitors in highly integrated DRAM's is reported. Trenches, 1 ~m wide and up to 2 ~m deep, were etched in RIE mode with CBrF 3 using a single <b>wafer</b> <b>etcher.</b> The trenches have very smooth sidewalls. The slope of the sidewall can easily be controlled by the RF power. The possibil-ity of tapering the trench in bulk silicon is attributed to the low selectivities of the process {{with regard to the}} oxide mask, leading to enhanced sputter etch of the mask. Anisotropic dry etching processes for the generation of trenches in bulk sil icon are intensively developed for highly integrated DRAM's. Deep trenches are used in these devices for trench capacitors to replace planar ca-pacitors; thereby higher integration without capacitance loss can be achieved (1, 2). To obtain uniform thickness and qual ity of the dielectric, the trench must have very smooth sidewalls and a rounded bottom. Therefore, the etching process must not lead to enhanced etch attack a...|$|E
