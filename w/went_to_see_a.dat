5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15. While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand so he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E
25|$|Netzer {{discovered}} the Roman Theatre {{just before his}} death in late 2010. A loggia, or a theatre box, was discovered. This means that when Herod or other notable officials <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> play, they would receive luxury treatment. The rest of the audience would be seated below on benches that could accommodate about 650 people. What is quite unique about this find is that frescoes of landscapes were discovered. This suggests that the painters were well traveled; they depict scenes of Italy and even the Nile River in Egypt. It is also assumed that the painters were on loan to Herod from Caesar in Rome.|$|E

25|$|Zoffany <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> play at Covent Garden {{concerning}} {{the death of}} Captain Cook {{who had been killed}} in Hawaii on his third voyage to find the North-West Passage in 1779. This is thought to have inspired him to paint the death of Cook at the hand of the Hawaiian natives. Cook had been given a mahiole (feathered helmet) and a feather cloak which was given to the Leverian Museum. Zoffany borrowed these as props for the construction of the painting which was not intended to be accurate and included poses that were taken from classic statues. This helmet remained in Sir Ashton Lever's collection, which was originally housed in Leicester Square. The feathered helmet that had been given to Cook and included in this painting is now in a museum in Vienna.|$|E

They <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> local doctor in Čadca, Dr. Pollack, someone Vrba knew from {{his time in}} the first transit camp. Pollack had a contact in the Slovak Judenrat (Jewish Council), which was {{operating}} an underground group known as the [...] "Working Group", and arranged for them to send people from their headquarters in Bratislava to meet the men. Pollack was distressed to learn the probable fate of his parents and siblings, who had been deported in 1942.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles was {{extensively}} researched for the game. The team organised {{field research}} trips with tour guides and architectural historians, and captured around 250,000 photographs and {{many hours of}} video footage. Houser said, [...] "We spoke to FBI agents that have been undercover, experts in the Mafia, street gangsters who know the slangwe even <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> proper prison". He considered the open world's research and creation the most demanding aspects of the game's production. Google Maps and Street View projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks. The team studied virtual globe models of the city, census data and documentaries to recreate its geographical and demographic spread. The team opted to condense the city's spread into an area that players could comfortably traverse, and captured [...] "the essence of what's really there in a city, but in a far smaller area", according to Houser. The New Yorker Sam Sweet opined that the [...] "exhaustive field work...wasn't conducted to document a living space. Rather, it was collected to create an extremely realistic version of a Los Angeles that doesn't actually exist. The map of Los Santos is familiar but its contents are condensed". Garbut noted that Los Angeles was used merely {{as a starting point}} and that the team were not [...] "dictated by reality" [...] while building Los Santos.|$|E

500|$|On July 30, Richard <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> {{chiropractor}} who rotated {{his neck}} to fix {{the flow of blood}} in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in {{the left side of his}} body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by neurologist William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. A CAT scan of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. While pitching, his clavicle and first rib pinched his subclavian artery. As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his subclavian artery, his arm would start to ache in pain and eventually start to feel [...] "heavy". His wife at the time, Carolyn, told reporters, [...] "It took death, or nearly death, to get an apology. They should have believed him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Four {{years before}} the {{assassination}} of President Kennedy, Ruby <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> man named Lewis McWillie in Cuba. Ruby considered McWillie, who had previously run illegal gambling establishments in Texas, {{to be one of}} his closest friends. At the time Ruby visited him, in August 1959, McWillie was supervising gambling activities at Havana's Tropicana Club. Ruby told the Warren Commission that his August trip to Cuba was merely a social visit at the invitation of McWillie. The House Select Committee on Assassinations would later conclude that Ruby [...] "…most likely was serving as a courier for gambling interests." [...] The committee also found [...] "circumstantial," [...] but not conclusive, evidence that [...] "…Ruby met with [...] Santo Trafficante in Cuba sometime in 1959." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 15, 1977, the Cubs traded Coleman to the Oakland Athletics for pitcher Jim Todd. [...] Oakland owner Charlie Finley {{released}} Coleman in the spring, {{but then}} reversed the decision after being told Coleman had a two-year contract {{that would have}} to be paid. [...] Coleman rebounded during the 1977 season with the assistance of a hypnotist. [...] In addition to the skull fracture sustained in 1971, Coleman had been hit by line drives 10 or 12 times in 1974. Chicago coaches noticed in 1976 that Coleman was recoiling immediately after throwing each pitch. [...] Coleman recalled, [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> Catholic priest who doubles as a hypnotist. He put me under seven times in four days. After that, I didn't have any fear of getting hit, and my control was better." ...|$|E
