25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall we {{perceive}} {{that the system}} of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility of the people, we are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. But <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of the single-shot sequences was a challenging, time-consuming process that sparked concerns from the studio. It took fourteen days {{to prepare for the}} single shot in which Clive Owen's character searches a building under attack, and five hours for every time they wanted to reshoot it. In the middle of one shot, blood splattered onto the lens, and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki convinced the director to leave it in. According to Owen, [...] "Right in the thick of it are me and the camera operator because we're doing this very complicated, very specific dance which, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to shoot, we have to make feel completely random." ...|$|E
500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I {{want you to take}} good care of all the {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E

500|$|The album's cover {{art is a}} {{modified}} Hubble Space Telescope photo of the planetary nebula MyCn 18, popularly known as the Hourglass Nebula. Hubble Space Telescope photos of the Helix Nebula and Eagle Nebula are also featured in the inside cover and liner notes for this album, respectively. The photos were used {{with the permission of}} NASA. Regarding the artwork, Ament said, [...] "The reason that we went with Tchad [...] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs....So, I think we wanted the artwork to represent that....One of the themes that we've been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music that we make <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> together, no matter how powerful it is, it's still pretty minuscule. I think for me the whole space theme {{has a lot to do}} with scale. You know, you look at some of those pictures, and there are thirteen light years in four inches in that picture." ...|$|E
500|$|The Allied fleet {{sailed to}} Salamis, {{off the coast}} of Attica, to assist with the {{evacuation}} of the remaining Athenians. En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:"Men of Ionia, that what you are doing is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you." ...|$|E
500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film. [...] " [...] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," [...] Rodriguez recalls, [...] "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway." ...|$|E

2500|$|People {{living on}} their own are certain to be selected, so we simply add their income to our {{estimate}} of the total.

2500|$|The {{following}} statement expresses Wilcox's unique blending of New Thought, Spiritualism, and a Theosophical belief in reincarnation: [...] "As we think, act, and live here today, we build {{the structures of}} our homes in spirit realms after we leave earth, and we build karma for future lives, thousands of years to come, on this earth or other planets. Life will assume new dignity, and labor new interest for us, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to the knowledge that death is but a continuation of life and labor, in higher planes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Saladin {{proceeded}} to take Nusaybin which offered no resistance. A medium-sized town, Nusaybin {{was not of}} great importance, but it was located in a strategic position between Mardin and Mosul and within easy reach of Diyarbakir. In the midst of these victories, Saladin received word that the Crusaders were raiding the villages of Damascus. He replied [...] "Let them... whilst they knock down villages, we are taking cities; <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back, we shall have all the more strength to fight them." [...] Meanwhile, in Aleppo, the emir of the city Zangi raided Saladin's cities {{to the north and}} east, such as Balis, Manbij, Saruj, Buza'a, al-Karzain. He also destroyed his own citadel at A'zaz to prevent it from being used by the Ayyubids if they were to conquer it.|$|E

2500|$|Damon Albarn got {{the idea}} for Plastic Beach while on a beach next to his house: [...] "I was just looking for all the plastic within the sand", he said. On 17 September 2008, Albarn and Jamie Hewlett {{announced}} that they would be doing another Gorillaz album in an interview with CBC News. Hewlett said that from their work on Monkey, [...] "we just learned more about what we do, musically and artistically. That's a great place to come at <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to another Gorillaz album. It doesn't have to be animation and music". Hewlett also expressed annoyance at having to draw the band members again: [...] "I'm so f--king bored of drawing those characters. But then we had a moment where we had a new angle on it... I'm gonna adapt them". In a later interview Hewlett said: [...] "they'll be the same characters, but a little bit older and told in a different way".|$|E
2500|$|Venizelos, at that time, was in {{an electoral}} tour of the island. Once, he [...] "saw Canea in flames", he hurried to Malaxa, near Chania, {{where a group of}} about 2,000 rebels had assembled, and {{established}} himself as their header. He proposed an attack, along with other rebels, on the Turkish forces at Akrotiri in order to displace them from the plains (Malaxa is in a higher altitude). Venizelos' subsequent actions at Akrotiri form a central set-piece in his myth. People composed poems on Akrotiri and his role there; editorials and articles spoke about his bravery, his visions and his diplomatic genius as inevitable accompaniment of later greatness. Venizelos spent the night in Akrotiri and a Greek flag was raised. The Ottoman forces requested help from the foreign admirals and attacked the rebels, with the ships of the Great Powers bombarding the rebel positions at Akrotiri. A shell threw down the flag, which was raised up again immediately. The mythologizing became more pronounced <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to his actions in that February, as the following quotes display: ...|$|E
2500|$|The show's pilot {{episode is}} told almost entirely in retroversions to three {{different}} time frames. According to Nick Wauters, the show's creator, later episodes would use flashbacks more {{to develop the}} characters. [...] "There will be big reveals and big clues in each episode," [...] he said, promising that viewers {{would not have to}} wait too long for answers to questions raised. After the pilot aired, he and executive producer Steve Stark answered some viewer questions on their Twitter feeds, one being the fate of the plane used in the assassination attempt, which ended up disappearing through a portal before it could crash. The characters also have Twitter feeds, and one had a blog, truthseeker5314.com, which would reveal additional information. The last two episodes before and all episodes following the show's hiatus no longer featured flashbacks. Cast member Blair Underwood said regarding the removal of the flashbacks, [...] "We had been jumping around a lot and doing flashbacks and that was confusing to people," [...] and [...] "So <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> back, that device is done with! We are now telling the story straight through so people can track it and follow it easier." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of Christianity, he said: [...] "it is not now true for me.... Every believing Christian is, I am sure, my spiritual brother... but if systemically I called {{myself a}} Christian I feel that to most men I should imply {{too much and}} so tell a lie". Of other world {{religions}}, he writes: [...] "All these religions are true for me as Canterbury Cathedral is a true thing and as a Swiss chalet is a true thing. There they are, and they have served a purpose, they have worked. Only they are not true for me to live in them.... They do not work for me". In The Fate of Homo Sapiens, published in 1939, Wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies, stating [...] "there is no creed, no way of living {{left in the world}} at all, that really meets the needs of the time… <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> to look at them coolly and dispassionately, all the main religions, patriotic, moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today, appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement, like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast, sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.|$|E
