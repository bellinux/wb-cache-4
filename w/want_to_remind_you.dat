60|$|ANN. [fondly, to {{his great}} terror] I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of anything. But I knew {{the people they}} {{happened}} to, and heard about them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said Kate, looking down—"oh, because—well, it’s ridiculous. I’d sooner {{have you}} stay here and feel what a stupid you’ve been making of yourself. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of it sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{any time}} you send for me," [...] the Bishop replied. [...] "Meanwhile, Mr. Fenn, before I leave I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> once more of the {{original}} purpose of my call upon you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had {{you been}} at that race, young man," [...] {{retorted}} Allan, [...] "you would have <b>wanted</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> {{of it for}} the longest day you have to live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} let me finish," [...] he resumed, [...] "you will {{understand}} {{me a little}} better than that. Whatever blame there may be, Miss Regina, I am quite ready to take on myself. I merely <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that I was put in an awkward position, and that I couldn't civilly {{find a way out of}} it. As for your aunt, I will only say this: I know of hardly any sacrifice that I would not submit to, if I could be of the smallest service to her. After what I heard, while I was in her room--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had no {{intention}} of offending you, sir," [...] she said, a little confusedly. [...] "I only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that there are some things which a gentleman in your position--" [...] She stopped, tried to finish the sentence, failed, and began another. [...] "If I had been a young lady in your own rank of life," [...] she went on, [...] "I might have thanked you for paying me a compliment, and have given you a serious answer. As it is, I am afraid that I must say that you have surprised and disappointed me. I can claim very little for myself, I know. But I did imagine--so long as there was nothing unbecoming in my conduct--that I had some right to your respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] said Mr. Todd, {{lighting}} his pipe, [...] "afore {{we get on}} to {{the business}} of this meeting I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that there is another meeting, of ladies, at four o’clock; so we’ve got to hurry up. O’ course, if it should happen that we ain’t finished——" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now listen," [...] Mr. Fentolin went on. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> {{of certain}} things, Meekins. We are among friends here--no secrecy, you understand, or {{anything}} of that sort. You need not be afraid! You know how you came to me? You remember that little affair of Anna Jayes in Hartlepool?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Britt listened gravely. [...] "There {{is one way}} of escape," [...] he said at last, with a smile, both mocking and tender. [...] "I don't {{pretend to}} say it's to your mind, but <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that my offer is still open. If you give me the {{necessary}} authority I will stop this crusade with a jolt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no future," [...] the man {{interrupted}} doggedly; [...] "no future here, or in {{any other}} place. I have got my deserts. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of that night when you came to see me in my rooms, after I'd been sent down for being drunk. I suppose you were the first gentleman who had ever crossed my threshold, and I remember wondering what on earth you'd come for! You didn't lecture me, and you didn't preach. You came and sat down and smoked one of my cigars, and talked just as though we were friends, and tried to make me see what a fool I was. It didn't do much good in the end--but I never forgot it. You shook hands with me when you left, and for once in my life I was ashamed of myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I say forget, I mean forget," [...] he declared. [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be <b>reminded</b> by <b>you</b> {{of my own}} business. D'ye think I don't know it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{come and}} tell you that I was sorry," [...] she {{continued}} softly, [...] "and I <b>wanted,</b> too, <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that you are still young, and that the loss of a fortune is not the most terrible thing in the world. I heard yesterday that you were out upon Salthouse Neck, close to the quicksands. You know it is never safe there, with these winter tides. Life is not a thing to be trifled with. It may seem terrible to you just now to have lost your great fortune, to be once more a poor man. These things, after all, don't count for much against the gift of life. I know it sounds like humbug to hear me talk like this, but they were gossiping about you in the village. One man was saying that he shouldn't be at all surprised to hear that you had disappeared, and to find--to find--" [...] she added, with a little shiver, [...] "your body come up the creek with the next tide. You wouldn't do anything like that, would you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you,</b> sir, that I have at any rate, thus far, {{not been}} PROVED to be wrong. Bearing that in mind, {{be pleased to}} remember, at the same time, that I am {{an officer of the}} law acting here under the {{sanction}} of the mistress of the house. Under these circumstances, is it, or is it not, your duty as a good citizen, to assist me with any special information which you may happen to possess?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{coming to}} that," [...] he told her. [...] "Please be patient. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> of {{something}} else. So far as I remember, my only request, when I gave you your liberty and half my income, {{was that your}} friendship with the Draconmeyers should decrease. Almost the first persons I see on my arrival in Monte Carlo are you and Mr. Draconmeyer. I learn that you came out with them and that you are staying at the same hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, Andrew," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> {{again of}} what I said just now. I warned you! No, don't interrupt. It may have sounded like {{nonsense}} to you. I meant every word I said. I honestly {{tried to make}} you understand. I came here; I risked many things. I failed! I returned to England. Up till then you had nothing to complain of. Then, Heaven knows why, but the very girl whom I had gone to Paris to seek came to Runton in the guise at least of an adventuress." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written as {{a plea for}} Germanotta to have the open-heart surgery he needed for his condition. In October 2009, Gaga {{confirmed}} that Germanotta had undergone the surgery. [...] "My Daddy had open-heart surgery today. And after long hours, and lots of tears, they healed his broken heart, and mine," [...] she announced through her official Twitter account. She stated that she hoped the song would inspire her younger fans to appreciate their parents. [...] "I {{have a lot of}} fans who are really lovely, young, troubled fans, but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> them that <b>you</b> only get one set of parents," [...] she said.|$|R
40|$|HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{shows no}} sign of abating. If anything global figures are frightening and access to anti-retroviral drugs is not yet a reality even though the cost of medication has gone down. But all is not lost. There is evidence to show the epidemic has leveled off in several sub Saharan countries such as Uganda. None the less, as Ntozi et al 1 show, very high-risk groups such as commercial sex workers, street children, long haul truck drivers, barmaids and adolescents have only changed their sexual behaviour a little: no solace for those campaigning hard for significant change! Keeping within the sexual practices theme, this issue of African Health Sciences also contains a very significant article by Dr. Odar and colleagues 2 who report on sexual practices of women within six months of child birth. Almost half the women resumed sexual intercourse during the peuperium in response to the spouse’s demand. The early resumption of sexual intercourse was associated with high morbidity rates a situation calling for appropriate post partum sexual advice. African Health Sciences also brings you a report of acute toxicity of the root-bark of Fagara zanthoxylodes an important source of herbal medicines used for elephantiasis, toothache, impotence, gonorrhoea and amenorrhoea 3. The authors conclude that Fagara zanthoxyloides is safe but associated with death through some yet unkown cerebral mechanism. Meel 4 has carried out an interesting operational study on the adequacy and efficiency of nursing staff in a child-welfare clinic at Umtata General Hospital, South Africa. The conclusion was that there is under-utilization of the staff at the hospital. Other points covered include a case report of imaging features of brain tuberculoma from Tanzania, a review for CME in the relevance of the nutrition for mother and child health. We have an interesting letter from a patient in Nairobi, Kenya who visited his G. P. with a stomach complaint. He ended up fighting his physician who tried to do a recal examination (which the patient thought was outright sodomy!) on him. The letter reminds the doctors and other health workers to explain all procedures and “carry ” the patient with us all along. Finally I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that African Healt...|$|R
5000|$|... "Speechless" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga and {{produced}} by Ron Fair. Gaga explained in a November 2009 interview that her father, Joseph Germanotta, had a heart condition for approximately 15 years. She went on to say, [...] "He has or {{he had a bad}} aortic valve, and his body {{for a very long time}} was only pumping a third of the blood that you're supposed to get every time his heart beat." [...] She added,"My mom called me and I was very depressed. I was on tour and I couldn't leave, so I went into the studio and I wrote this song 'Speechless,' and it's about these phone calls. My dad used to call me after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't know what to say. I was speechless and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there."The song was written as a plea for Germanotta to have the open-heart surgery he needed for his condition. In October 2009, Gaga confirmed that Germanotta had undergone the surgery. [...] "My Daddy had open-heart surgery today. And after long hours, and lots of tears, they healed his broken heart, and mine," [...] she announced through her official Twitter account. She stated that she hoped the song would inspire her younger fans to appreciate their parents.

6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "as most of {{you have}} laid in a solid foundation, we can talk over the dessert; and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that we have several reasons for celebrating this occasion. A start at growing fruit on a big scale has just been made; we're to have a wharf; and there's a wagon trail to be bridged and graded. All this brings you nearer the market. You have held on and put up a good fight with rocks and trees, and now when you'll have no trouble in turning your produce into money you're going to reap the reward of it. But that's not our main {{business}} to-night." ...|$|E
50|$|The SV {{groups in}} the USA and Canada are {{in close contact with}} certain Christian groups which are not being reached very {{effectively}} by the General Movements...(but) I do <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that there is a considerable movement of extremely reactionary students springing up {{in many parts of the}} world including Great Britain. We are simply crazy if we think that this movement is not going to make real headway in our American colleges.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{resignation}} of the RF member for the Salisbury constituency of Arundel, Welensky was given a chance to re-enter the political arena. Clifford Dupont, Deputy Prime Minister, resigned his constituency in Charter to oppose Welensky. Welensky knew if the RF won the byelections it would appear as a mandate for unilateral independence; the campaign, for only two seats, was intense. At public meetings, Welensky was heckled by opponents to ironic cries of 'Communist', 'traitor', and 'coward'. Sharing a television platform with Smith on 3 September, Welensky talked of the economic and political dangers of a UDI, but nonetheless wished Smith luck when he departed for independence talks in London. Welensky had much more antipathy for the British Government than his RF opponents, and was disgusted at their treatment of the Rhodesians during constitutional talks: [...] I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that I am no friend of the present Government in Rhodesia: I have opposed their policies and can be considered a political opponent. But I was as horrified as any other Rhodesian at this cavalier treatment of a country which has, since its creation, staunchly supported, in every possible way, Britain and the Commonwealth.|$|E

"Sir," [...] {{said the}} Baron frostily, [...] "you compel me <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that the rank you hold {{is that of}} Capitaine de Vaisseau, and {{that you are in}} the {{presence}} of the General of the Armies of France by Sea and Land in America. <b>You</b> compel me <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> further that there is a deference due from your rank to mine." ...|$|R

5000|$|According to Hayes, {{the link}} between {{atrazine}} and altered [...] "aromatase and estrogen production has been demonstrated... in fish, frogs, alligators, birds, turtles, rats and human cells", and, [...] "I believe that the preponderance of the evidence shows atrazine to be a risk to wildlife and humans. I {{would not want to}} be exposed to it, nor do I think it should be released into the environment." [...] He travels and lectures extensively, both to academic, professional and lay audiences. He famously wrote a song called The Atrazine Rap to cleverly summarize and convey his message which he will often share in summation {{at the end of a}} talk: “So let me remind you / don't put this behind you / Atrazine ain't a good thing / it causes male frogs to grow eggs / contributes to extra legs / and exposed males don't want to sing / If that ain't enough / when you combine the stuff / with a few other pesticides / it causes greater than additive effects / unpredictable defects / exposed larvae don't grow / and they develop slow / and they contract diseases that otherwise could be beaten / you see this exposure effects their composure and determines who gonna eat and who gonna be eaten … published that yet / and when I do / how will it affect you? / you may never know / because if the EPA / has their way / it may take 40 years or more / so if you're sitting there thinking / that the water you're drinking / is fine well that ain't the case / because you see this endocrine disruption that leads to biological disruption is relevant to all species / including the human race / so what? you might say / who cares anyway? / if somehow you still don't see the connection to you / I'm here to remind you that your son or daughter will develop in water / just like my tadpoles do / and so as we approach the hour I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>you</b> that you've got the power / and that the whole world is waiting on your stance” He also has raised issues of environmental racism, [...] "warning that the consequences of atrazine use are disproportionately felt by people of color. 'If you’re black or Hispanic, you’re more likely to live or work in areas where you’re exposed,' he has said." ...|$|E
