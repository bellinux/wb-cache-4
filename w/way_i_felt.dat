500|$|After {{the start}} of the 21st century, Buckles {{continued}} living near Charles Town, West Virginia, and was still driving a tractor on his farm at age 103. He stated in an interview with The Washington Post on Veterans' Day 2007 that he believed the United States should not go to war [...] "unless it's an emergency". He has also stated that, [...] "If your country needs you, you should be right there, that is the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> when I was young, and that's the way I feel today." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{defending}} champion was seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry who defeated O'Sullivan 9–6 in last year's final. Hendry was still angry at his loss at the Grand Prix to McCulloch, explaining, [...] "The <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> at the Grand Prix {{was down to}} the fact that I know what I'm still capable of". The total prize fund was £200,000 and the host broadcaster was Eurosport. O'Sullivan was considered the favourite, with his mentor Ray Reardon saying [...] "Ronnie {{is in the form of}} his life and looks very close to being unstoppable at the moment". Although few top players reached the final eight in the Grand Prix, O'Sullivan said he would not be surprised if they performed well in this tournament.|$|E
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{took the}} title from {{a passage in}} Paradise Lost where Adam says to Eve that their {{expulsion}} from Paradise [...] "will prove no sudden but a slow pac'd evil,/ A Long Day's Dying to augment our pain," [...] and {{with the exception of}} the old lady Maroo, what all the characters seem to be dying of is loneliness, emptiness, sterility, and such preoccupation with themselves and their own problems that they are unable to communicate with each other about anything that really matters to them very much. I am sure that I chose such a melancholy theme partly because it seemed effective and fashionable, but I have no doubt that, like dreams generally, it also reflected the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> about at least some dimension of my own life and the lives of those around me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... you ask who Mr. Millard is {{and what}} reason lies in his {{prejudice}} against Missions in general. Mr. Ament does not know him and I have inquired of several missionaries in Peking, none of whom know anything about him. He wrote to the Mail as late as Jan. 12th from Peking. You have probably seen his articles {{in some of the}} magazines of America – Scribners or Cosmopolitan. These reporters come through Japan where there is a strong prejudice against Christianity, especially in newspaper circles, and then they stop a few days among the clubs in Shanghai where they are filled with all the yarns about missionaries. I have known of three or four who have admitted that they came north with prejudices against missionaries and that they vanished on acquaintance with our Peking and Tung Chou people. Chamberlain of the Sun was one of these and I think it was he who rebuked another reporter for his tirade against missions by saying [...] "That is the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> too, when I first came but I have changed my mind since I have known the missionaries." [...] We have received copies of a five-column interview with Mr. Ament in the Kobe Herald. He had been terribly slandered by the Kobe Chronicle, whose Editor has announced his purpose to do all the harm to the cause of Christianity that he can, so that we are glad to see an explanation in the same city. We expect Mr. Ament to do much good in setting these things right in the public mind. One of Millard's proteges, Edgar Snow described Millard's [...] "anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, pro-independence, pro-equality of nations, pro-Republican, pro-self-determination and very pro-American [...]" ...|$|E

5000|$|In a July 2014, {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, she spoke about Ryan Adams producing the album, saying: [...] "In some <b>ways,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{like he was}} needling me. He was winding me up. I was somewhat agitated at times, and I think it {{put me in a}} really cool place to perform those songs. Ryan is the most unique producer I've ever worked with, in his approach and behavior… He made me listen to five or six Creed songs, really loudly on these beautiful tube speakers. My ears were bleeding. And it was Creed! He was like, [...] "This is great music. I want you to hear it." [...] And by the third song, I was like [...] "Huh. Umm. Yeah, I can maybe see that." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I attempt {{to address a}} serious {{criticism}} of the “Anthropic Landscape ” and “Discretuum ” approach to cosmology, leveled by Banks, Dine and Gorbatov. I argue that in this new and unfamiliar setting, the gauge Hierarchy may not favor low energy supersymmetry. I don’t believe I ever met Ian Kogan but in many <b>ways</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> he was a friend. We shared both a struggle and a hobby.

5000|$|Stonefish made a brief {{return in}} 2003 {{for his brother}} Toadie's wedding to Dee Bliss (Madeleine West). After Toadie accidentally drove the wedding car off a cliff and into the sea, Stonie helped to save his brother. In August 2007, Stonefish {{returned}} to Neighbours to [...] "cause some trouble for little brother Toadie". Stonie came to stay with Toadie following marital problems. He was also battling a drug problem and when Toadie learned of this, he threw Stonie out. But Toadie's girlfriend Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) took pity on Stonie and allowed him to move back in. Engleman {{did not hesitate to}} return to the show upon learning that Stonie would be going through a [...] "rocky time" [...] in his life. He was pleased to play out such an interesting storyline for his character, saying [...] "In some <b>ways,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> drama was missing from Stonie's storylines in the past. He was always just chasing girls or trying to get rich quick." ...|$|R

6000|$|In a blind vague <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that {{to leave}} Boston {{was to leave}} all hope of a {{literary}} career and yet I saw no way of earning money in the city.

60|$|Now, {{the whole}} place was, or it should have been, quite as {{delightful}} a place as ever; and yet it did not impress me in the same <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> rather disappointed with it. Perhaps it was because little Em'ly was not at home. I knew the way by which she would come, and presently found myself strolling along the path to meet her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not know, I ..." [...] She {{shook her}} head in a bewildered manner. [...] "I cannot put into words the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt.</b> It was strangeness in me. I was unlike other maidens, who sought the young men slyly. I could not care for the young men that way. It would have been a great wrong, it seemed, and an ill deed." ...|$|E
500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against me while I was on stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in any <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> still <b>felt</b> as if they all disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist {{in front of the}} wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|R
60|$|This speech both {{surprised}} and embarrassed me, for I {{had never before}} attempted anything in the <b>way</b> of exposition. <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> however, {{that it would never}} do for a man in charge of an outpost in the Great Nor'-West to exhibit weakness on any point, whatever he might feel; I therefore resolved to comply.|$|R
500|$|In 1976, at age 16 and as {{a member}} of the Melbourne punk rock band Young Charlatans, Howard wrote [...] "Shivers". Discussing the song's origins, Howard said that [...] "Shivers" [...] was [...] "intended as an ironic comment on the <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that people <b>I</b> knew were making hysterical things out of what were {{essentially}} high school crushes". He further explained that the emotional responses of people he knew who were in relationships seemed [...] "incredibly insincere and blown out of proportion" [...] and inspired the cynical lyrics of the song.|$|R
6000|$|So I {{was full}} of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and then see if I can pray.

His horse ambled past, and he smiled and nodded to those he knew in the crowd, and then was lost to sight.|$|E
60|$|I {{was annoyed}} at this.

500|$|In the new forewords to the Cleis Press editions, Bannon {{addressed}} the criticisms of her characters as self-destructive in limiting roles, explaining that she simply depicted {{what she knew}} and felt at the time.

60|$|But {{did every}} one suspect him? What about Mrs. Cavendish? I watched {{her as she}} sat {{at the head of the}} table, graceful, composed, enigmatic.

6000|$|At first, no result at all crowned my efforts, though I 'divided my swift mind,' now hither, now thither, in a <b>way</b> that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{sure would}} have made AEneas green with envy: but the dimly-seen oval {{remained}} as provokingly blank as ever--a mere Ellipse, as if in some mathematical diagram, without even the Foci that might be made to do duty as a nose and a mouth. Gradually, however, the conviction came upon me that I could, by a certain concentration of thought, think the veil away, and so {{get a glimpse of}} the mysterious face--as to which the two questions, [...] "is she pretty?"

5000|$|On 19 March 2012, Anderson {{announced}} that she was four-and-a-half months pregnant, and joked {{that she would have}} to conceal her bump on-screen with large handbags and by standing behind the bar, before going on maternity leave. Alicia was temporarily written out of the show and her exit storyline saw her sent to prison, after she punched Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick) in the face. Of learning about the storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I told the show I was pregnant I had no idea what they were going to do. I had absolutely no say and, to be honest, I really thought they would say, 'She's gone off in a taxi to see her sister', something really normal, and that would be that. Then this elaborate story came about with a previous conviction and I was going, 'thank you'. I just thought it was brilliant. It's really good fun and comic in a lot of <b>ways.</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> privileged they had thought of it that way." [...] The actress was six-and-a-half months pregnant when she filmed Alicia's exit. The storyline began with Alicia declaring her love for David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden). After Val interrupted, Alicia ended up punching her. When Val reported her to the police, it emerged that Alicia had broken the terms of a previous suspended sentence and she was sent to prison. Before she went, Alicia married David, so he could look after Jacob for her. Alicia returned on 18 December 2012, while Anderson signed a new one-year contract.|$|R
