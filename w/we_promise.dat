Petrie stated that more layers {{were added to the}} series' atmosphere to keep the season dark but provide more clarity to the viewer, an issue that occurred in the first season. Petrie also talked about the costumes for characters such as Elektra, noting that they had to not only look at the comics and [...] "what looks cool", but also [...] "what would you really fight in? What would protect you?...will people be wearing kick ass costumes in this show? At some point, everybody does. <b>We</b> <b>promise.</b> But, that said, we want to make them feel as organic and grounded as possible.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} Thursday, Benfica visited Vigo for {{the third}} round of the UEFA Cup. Benfica made club history in the match; at half-time they were already losing 4–0, and three more goals in the second half broke the record for goals conceded, in their worst defeat ever. At their next training session hundreds of fans booed the team, and the club president compelled his players to apologize for their performance. Team captain João Pinto read a statement: [...] "To Benfica, and to their supporters; aware of the abnormality of the result from the match in Vigo; the players, represented by the captain and vice-captain, publicly acknowledge that they didn't perform to club standards. <b>We</b> <b>promise</b> to redouble our commitment, towards dignifying this club. To them and to the millions of fans, we formally apologize." [...] November's final game, a 2–0 victory over Campomaiorense, retained Benfica's league lead.|$|E
5000|$|I {{modestly}} {{believe that}} in this new moment for Spain and asking for your vote I'm not bringing my papers empty, nor am I a mystery. <b>We</b> <b>promised</b> to return sovereignty to the Spanish people, and tomorrow they exert it. <b>We</b> <b>promised</b> to normalize our political life, manage the transition peacefully, build democracy from the law, and we believe that, with the logical deficiencies, we've succeeded. <b>We</b> <b>promised</b> that all political families may {{have a place in}} Parliament, and they can do it on Wednesday.|$|R

500|$|The {{conflict}} was resolved when son Jay became a substitute drummer {{for his father}} during parts of the Working on a Dream Tour that Max could not make due to commitments to the O'Brien show. Springsteen said, [...] "Once again, I want to express my appreciation to Conan O'Brien, and everyone on his team, for {{making it possible for}} Max to continue to do double duty for both us and for him. [...] <b>We</b> <b>promise</b> to return him in one piece." [...] The younger Weinberg began playing during segments of the tour's shows, and got a very positive response from audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band. Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] In one case, Jay did one show of a two-night stand on the East Coast and Max then took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E
500|$|As {{had been}} the {{practice}} since the Reunion Tour in 1999, Springsteen and the band began rehearsals at Asbury Park Convention Hall. [...] Beginning on March 11, some of the Springsteen faithful listened outside closed doors for what songs and arrangements the tour might bring. [...] The presence of Max Weinberg's 18-year-old son Jay, a freshman at Stevens Institute of Technology and also a drummer, at rehearsals indicated {{that he might be}} the one to replace his father for European leg shows where Tonight Show duties came into play. [...] On one occasion on the Magic Tour, Jay Weinberg had sat in on drums for [...] "Born to Run". [...] This was confirmed by Springsteen on March 20, who said that Jay Weinberg would be drumming at a small number of shows during the tour. [...] Springsteen added, [...] "Once again, I want to express my appreciation to Conan O'Brien, and everyone on his team, for making it possible for Max to continue to do double duty for both us and for him. [...] <b>We</b> <b>promise</b> to return him in one piece." [...] Van Zandt said, [...] "I’ve been avoiding this question for weeks! Thank God they finally announced it. We already did three days of rehearsals. Jay's a fantastic drummer. It’s in the Weinberg DNA." ...|$|E

2500|$|A brief {{contract}} was drafted {{to address this}} issue, later known as the Mayflower Compact, promising cooperation among the settlers [...] "for the general good of the Colony unto which <b>we</b> <b>promise</b> all due submission and obedience." [...] It organized them into what was called a [...] "civill body politick," [...] in which issues would be decided by voting, the key ingredient of democracy. [...] It was ratified by majority rule, with 41 adult male Pilgrims signing for the 102 passengers (seventy-three males and twenty-nine females). Included in the company were nineteen male servants and three female servants, along with some sailors and craftsmen hired for short-term service to the colony. At this time, John Carver {{was chosen as the}} colony's first governor. It was Carver who had chartered the Mayflower and his is the first signature on the Mayflower Compact, being the most respected and affluent member of the group. [...] The Mayflower Compact was the seed of American democracy and has been called the world's first written constitution.|$|E

But when two men want the work done, and there is only one man ready to do it, the two men who want it done over-bid each other, and the workman is over-paid.|$|E
