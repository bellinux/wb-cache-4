25|$|The pupal form of {{the beetle}} is similar in {{appearance}} to the adult form. They have outer cells produced in the larval stages that are reinforced with proteinaceous cement. This makes their outer shell harder and protects them during this vulnerable stage. While they pupate they breathe through spiracles on the abdomen. The beetle is non-feeding and immobile in this stage, as their internal structure is breaking down and rebuilding to its adult form. Under good temperature conditions the Hister beetle <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the pupal stage for about a week.|$|E
