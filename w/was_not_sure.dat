5|$|The State Bank <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> {{how much}} it {{actually}} lost from the robbery, but the best estimates were around 341,000 rubles, worth around 3.4million US dollars as of 2008. About 91,000 rubles were in small untraceable bills, with the rest in large 500-ruble notes that were difficult to exchange because their serial numbers were known to the police.|$|E
5|$|In the January 1977 {{issue of}} Starlog, Roddenberry said he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> when the novel would be complete, but {{confirmed}} {{that it would}} discuss the meaning of God. By March 1978, the novel {{was said to be}} half-completed. Publisher Bantam Books told Roddenberry it would wait until he finished production on Phase II to resume work on the novel. When later in 1978 that production turned into The Motion Picture, Bantam gave Roddenberry an extension because the novelization was thought to be a full-time effort.|$|E

5|$|Several of the Japanese {{performers}} had voiced {{their characters}} in the games, {{but they were also}} given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress Sanae Kobayashi <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> {{she would be able to}} effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and Ōtsuka's desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E

He then went to get the advice of his friend, RCA artist Willie Nelson, who had gone to see one of Waylon's shows. When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and not to move to Nashville.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E

5|$|Albert Brooks guest {{starred in}} the episode {{as the voice of}} Cowboy Bob. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if he wanted to be {{identified}} with a cartoon show or not at the time, like many of the other early guest stars on The Simpsons, and was therefore credited as A. Brooks in the ending credits. This episode was a satire of the Bigfoot specials that had aired on the Fox network at the time when this episode was written. A lot of resources were spent on the backgrounds in the episode, trying to make them look realistic with many observational details such as trees, rocks, fences and the way the cars were positioned. Burger King figurines were made out of the camping designs of the Simpsons family in this episode.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether or not Britten would have {{described himself as a}} Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science {{proved the}} unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are {{connected}} genetically. He also felt Christianity taught {{the unity of}} man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling {{it was more important}} to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

5|$|In January 2015 in {{his column}} in Weekly Famitsu, Sakurai alluded to the {{possibility}} of retirement, expressing doubt that {{he would be able to}} continue making games if his career continued to be as stressful as it was. In December 2015, Sakurai once again stated that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> if there will be another Smash Bros. game in the series. In January 2016, it was rumoured that a Super Smash Bros. game was being developed by Bandai Namco and that the game was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch.

The Best of John Belushi edition in VHS format sold approximately 200,000 copies. It reached number three on Billboard's Top Videocassettes Sales Chart in February 1986.|$|E
5|$|Unexpectedly, this weak push by Młokosiewicz {{and his men}} {{probably}} {{forced the}} Russians to reconsider their plans and postpone any further attacks until the following day. At that moment Paskevich <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> what the Poles would do. He feared a Polish counter-attack would retake the forts of Wola, or strike a wedge between his I and II Corps. He ordered all offensive actions in Wola halted. His artillery continued to duel with the Poles, but infantry was withdrawn and Paskevich himself left his forces {{to look for the}} Corps of General Muraviev to the south, somewhere between Szczęśliwice and the Jerozolimskie Gate.|$|E

5|$|Because he {{acts as a}} {{link between}} the other main {{characters}} of the series, Kakashi is rarely featured prominently in promotional artwork, instead appearing in the background while his students are the focus of the scene. In an interview in Shōnen Jump's, Kishimoto said that if he were to make an extra story from the manga with a different character, such character would be Kakashi. In early 2014, Kishimoto commented he wanted to reveal Kakashi's face but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether {{it would be in the}} manga or an upcoming movie. The Raikiri, one of Kakashi's most common techniques, had a different name, but the author forgot about its original name. Nevertheless, he found the name Raikiri fitting for this lightning-based technique. Kakashi's Sharingan was introduced to give the character mystery as only members from the Uchiha clan could possess it. By chapter 16 of the manga, Kishimoto had already decided how Kakashi obtained the Sharingan. He also added that Kakashi's face was difficult to draw since it is covered by a mask.|$|E

He had not played a tournament since February 2014, but he started the 2015 Apia International Sydney with a straight-sets win against Sergiy Stakhovsky. In the second round, his {{opponent}} was world No. 19 and top seed Fabio Fognini. It was a tough test for del Potro, but he proved to be stronger than the Italian. Del Potro was through to the quarterfinals, but lost to Mikhail Kukushkin in two tiebreakers. After his Sydney campaign, he was drawn to play Jerzy Janowicz {{in the first round of}} the 2015 Australian Open, del Potro withdrew due to his wrist injury. Del Potro played in Miami and was not seen for nearly a year, undergoing surgery again in June 2015.|$|E
5|$|On 8 September 1994 the DoD {{announced}} the actions {{it would take}} {{in response to the}} investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an Article 32 hearing in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that he was sure of his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.|$|E

5|$|When {{dramatic}} plot developments made Sasuke {{one of the}} series' antagonists, Kishimoto compared him and Naruto to the yin {{and yang}} due to their notable differences and complementary natures. He has mentioned that when one progresses, he makes sure the other does as well. In 2013, as the series approached its climax, Kishimoto encouraged readers {{to look forward to}} Sasuke and Naruto's final fight. Since it started serialization, Kishimoto had planned that the series' ending would feature the final fight between the two characters, although he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether the characters would end the duel as friends or enemies. While the two use ninja techniques in the beginning, in the climax the author wanted both fighters to rely on hand-to-hand combat. In the end, Kishimoto decided to have Naruto forgive Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato, another former enemy. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of this fight, the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by working so much into this fight due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.|$|E
