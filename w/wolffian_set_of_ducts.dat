5000|$|Following {{a summary}} of the prior, Fausto-Sterling shows her points on the gender {{development}} theories by noting how XY and XX chromosomes stay identical up until the 6th week of development in the womb. During these six weeks, the XY/XX embryos develop an indifferent gonad, an extra layer that isn't affected by the chromosome embryo due to their indistinguishable similarity at the time. This external process develops in a similar manner to the various male and female reproductive organs that later develop within the body. By {{the end of the first}} month and a half, all embryos would've developed, regardless of gender. In addition, the chromosomes within the cells will have developed different <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> Mesonephric <b>ducts</b> that are indifferent to gender. A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ducts</b> ultimately becomes the aforementioned reproductive organs based on the gender of the fetus. Once the Y chromosome in the XY embryo triggers, an extensive and lengthy process is detailed on the development of male fetuses. Conversely, far less is known on the development of XX fetuses. What is known about the female XX is that the fetuses produce approximately the same amount of estrogen in comparison to the testosterone production in the male XY. Later down the line of fetus growth, the originally identical genitalia of the two types of fetus will differentiate on the eighth week. In some cases the XY fetus will initially begin to develop a female crotch instead of the male penis and scrotum due to a deficiency in dihydrotestosterone. After detailing the opinions of John Money and Julianne Imperato-McGuinely on gender identity, Fausto-Sterling concludes with the three influences that affect gender - genetic regulatory information, intrusion from outside the womb, and [...] "chance variation" [...] in development - and two points on sexual development." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper an {{iterative}} time-reversal algorithm that retrofocuses an acoustic wave field to its controllable part is established. For a fixed temporal support, i. e., transducer excitation time, the algorithm generates an optimal retrofocusing in the least-squares sense. Thus the iterative time-reversal algorithm reduces the temporal support of the excitation from the requirement of negligible remaining energy to the requirement of controllability. The time-reversal retrofocusing is analyzed from a boundary-control perspective where time reversal is used to steer the acoustic wave field towards a desired state. The wave field is controlled by transducers located at subsets of the boundary, i. e., the controllable part of the boundary. The time-reversal cavity and time-reversal mirror cases are analyzed. In the cavity case, the transducers generate a locally plane wave in the fundamental mode through a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>ducts.</b> Numerical examples are given to illustrate the convergence of the iterative time-reversal algorithm. In the mirror case, a homogeneous half space is considered. For this case the analytic expression for the retrofocused wave field is given for finite temporal support.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the detailed skeletal anatomy of chasmopinid trilobites from the Ordovician of the Oslo region, and Phacops from the Polish Devonian. Lamination of the cuticle {{is similar to}} that previously reported, and the outermost prismatic layer has been conclusively proved. Several types of tubercles or pustules {{on the surface of the}} exoskeleton have been identified, for which a classification is proposed. Canals through the exoskeleton range from about 1 - 40 micro-m in diameter. In Chasmops spp. apparently smooth tubercles have a thin central canal through the outer zone changing downwards into a wide canal. This smooth tubercle organ shows some resemblance with the sensory campanular organ (mechanoreceptor) in Recent arthropods. Sections of the big composite tubercles or pustules in Phacops have revealed two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>ducts,</b> partly with different directions: (1) numerous close-set fine (4 micro-m) canals in a fan-like arrangement, and (2) diffuse ramifying branches or tubes with distal bundles of tubules, the blunt terminals of which are inserted into the lower surface of the outer zone of the exoskeleton. This internal tubules organ might possibly, in general features, be analogous with the much smaller campanular organ in the halteres in Diptera. Just below the prismatic layer there are numerous small (10 - 20 micro-m) subsphaeric cavities apparently connected with the epidermis by a single thin (1. 5 - 2. 0 micro-m) perpendicular canal, which are termed Osmolska cavity organs. There is a considerable variation in muscle-scar pattern. Some species have calluses on the inner surface corresponding to shallow pits on the outer surface. Similar pits and dark patches, and knobs or calluses on the inner surface of the exoskeleton, are scars or small apodemes of muscles leading from the dorsal exoskeleton to the presumed thin membrane representing the ventral body wall inside the marginal doublure. ...|$|R

The assembly for each of the side-mounted engines can be pivoted 20 degrees in either direction, vectoring the thrust to provide flight control, particularly during landing and taking off; the rear-mounted engines are fixed. By employing thrust vectoring, the engines can direct their thrust downwards to provide additional lift during takeoff. A series of four triangular-shaped variable vanes are positioned behind the engines to provide further control authority; such as by re-directing thrust from the rear engines over the tail fins.|$|R

The width also increases with the flow-rate as the fluid rheology shifts from Newtonian at low shear rates γ̇ towards a shear thinning behaviour at higher γ̇ values. The width also increases with the polymer concentration at high flow-rates.

Along with the development <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, many researchers have studied the aerodynamic characteristics of various types <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotors (Rajagopalan and Keys 1997; Bandoh et al. 1998; Vuillet and Morelli 1986). In recent years, the main method which investigates the aerodynamic performance <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor is CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) method. Among those CFD methods, momentum source method {{is one of the}} commonly used methods. The momentum source with functional relationship to the local flow conditions represents the spanning rotor in flow field and are added to the N-S equations by UDF procedure. Cao and Yu (2005) used it to solve the numerical simulation of turbulent flow around ducted tail rotor. The method not only can predict the flow field but also investigate the performance <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotors. Song et al. (2009) applied it to analyze the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor. To obtain the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, the author solved the N-S equation added by the source.

Even though momentum source method is quite successful for the prediction of the aerodynamic performance <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, detailed three dimensional flow features cannot be accurately predicted. Because of the approximation of the blade shape parameters, the accuracy of the momentum source method is still limited. In addition, it is difficult to obtain the accurate noise source information by using the momentum source method. In this work, a CFD method which is considered the blade shape parameters has been proposed to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>ducted</b> tail rotor, and the method is based on moving reference frame (MRF) model instead of momentum source method.|$|R
