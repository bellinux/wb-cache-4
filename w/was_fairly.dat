5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located farther west, experienced similar winds; however, damage was slightly more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of the dock and sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{distance}} of Neptune from Earth, its angular diameter only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of the}} Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to study it visually.

5|$|Damage <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> light, {{estimated}} at approximately $50million (2007 USD). Precipitation peaked at 14.13inches (358.9mm), while wind gusts to 85mph (137km/h) were reported. The heavy rainfall caused widespread flooding, which {{damaged or destroyed}} dozens of homes, and closed several highways. Trees and power lines were downed, knocking out power {{to hundreds of thousands}} of customers. The hurricane caused one fatality in the State of Texas. Additionally, as the storm progressed inland, rainfall was reported throughout the Southeast United States.|$|E
5|$|Despite President Obama's {{winning the}} state easily, and winning {{all of the}} state's counties, this race <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> close. As expected, Warren {{performed}} very well in Suffolk County, which {{is home to the}} state's largest city and its capital Boston. Brown performed well {{in the southern part of}} the state near Cape Cod. Warren made history by becoming the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate in the state of Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Faryl <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> well {{received}} by critics, who praised Smith's performances and Cohen's production. However, criticism {{was directed at}} {{the use of the}} orchestra and at the song choices. As one of the ten best-selling classical albums in the UK in 2009, Faryl was nominated for a Classical BRIT Award in the album of the year category, but lost to Only Men Aloud's Band of Brothers. In 2013, the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry.|$|E

5|$|Gotland {{began to}} {{gradually}} abandon Norse religion and adopt Christianity during the 11th century. While the earliest churches were wooden, construction of stone churches began during the 12th century. The church building period <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> short; {{in the countryside}} stone churches were erected between the early 12th and mid-14th centuries, while in Visby the last churches were inaugurated during the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|His next film, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye, {{was another}} gangster movie, {{which was the}} first by Cagney Productions since its acquisition. While {{compared}} unfavorably to White Heat by critics, it <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> successful at the box office, with $500,000 going straight to Cagney Productions' bankers to pay off their losses. Cagney Productions was not a great success, however, and in 1953, after William Cagney produced his last film, A Lion Is in the Streets, the company came to an end.|$|E

50|$|Greenops {{average size}} is about 1 to 1.5 in. They <b>were</b> <b>fairly</b> common trilobites, and are easily identified. While {{it is rare}} to find a {{complete}} disarticulated body, segments and tails <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> common. They <b>are</b> <b>fairly</b> common finds in Late Devonian limestones, especially storm deposits. They are identified by their tails, which sport several spines. They were medium to small sized trilobites, which were most likely preyed upon by ammonoids, straight cephalopods, sharks, and small placoderms, hence the defensive spines. All of these animals {{have been found in}} close association with this trilobite. Greenops can also be found in deep marine deposits, but there it <b>is</b> <b>fairly</b> rare. Greenops <b>was</b> a small, yet charmingly beautiful trilobite, like its close companion Phacops.|$|R

5|$|No {{significant}} impact {{was reported in}} Canada, as the strongest winds were south and east of the center. Prior to the storm's arrival, the Newfoundland Weather Forecast Office issued a hurricane warning for southeastern Newfoundland. The ferry between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was disrupted, and boats across the region were sent back to harbor. Rainfall <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> light, peaking at 2.39inches (60.8mm) in southeastern Newfoundland, and sustained winds reached 71mph (115km/h) at Cape Race.|$|E
5|$|The 1981–82 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} {{destructive}} and deadly in Madagascar, where four cyclones killed 100people and caused $250million (USD) in damage. The season <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> active, lasting from October to May. There were nine named storms that attained gale-force winds, {{or at least}} 65km/h (40mph). Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, which have 10minute sustained winds of at least 120km/h (75mph).|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the airframe <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> conventional, with a semi-monocoque frame and multi-spar wing. The aircraft used a measure of magnesium and titanium in the fuselage, the latter limited largely to {{the area around the}} engines and to fasteners. Titanium was still expensive and not widely used because it was difficult to machine.|$|E

5|$|Before 1948, Haifa's Municipality <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> unusual as it {{developed}} {{cooperation between the}} mixed Arab and Jewish community in the city, with representatives of both groups involved in the city's management. Under mayor al-Haj, between 1920 and 1927, the city council had six Arab and two Jewish representatives, with the city run as a mixed municipality with overall Arab control. Greater cooperation was introduced under Hasan Bey Shukri, who adopted a positive and conciliatory attitude toward the city's Jews and gave them senior posts in the municipality. In 1940, the first Jewish mayor, Shabtai Levy, was elected. Levy's two deputies were Arab (one Muslim, the other Christian), with {{the remainder of the}} council made up of four Jews and six Arabs.|$|E

5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} trouble, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to amalgamate {{they could not}} obtain government agreement until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> basic and trains were separated by time interval. As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E
5|$|Deerfield {{and other}} {{communities}} collected funds to ransom the captives. French authorities and colonists also worked to extricate the captives from their Indian captors. Within a year's time, {{most of the}} captives were in French hands, a product of frontier commerce in humans that <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> common at the time on both sides. The French and converted Indians worked to convert their captives to Roman Catholicism, with modest success. While adult captives proved fairly resistant to proselytizing, children were more receptive or likely to accept conversion under duress.|$|E
5|$|Early in its duration, Keith {{produced}} {{moderate to}} heavy rainfall in Honduras, Jamaica, and Cuba. Minimal damage {{was reported in}} Mexico, which was still recovering {{from the effects of}} Hurricane Gilbert two months prior. Keith, the last of four named tropical cyclones to hit the United States during the season, produced moderate rainfall, rough storm surge, and gusty winds across central Florida. Overall damage <b>was</b> <b>fairly</b> minor but widespread, totaling $7.3million (1988USD; $ USD). Near the coast of Florida, damage occurred mainly from storm surge and beach erosion. Further inland there were floods, downed trees and power lines. No fatalities were reported.|$|E
