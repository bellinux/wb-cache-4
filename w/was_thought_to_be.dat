5|$|Alternative {{theories}} are that La Reforma is a dome which was eroded {{to form a}} circular pattern or a set of tectonic blocks. Although the dome <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> formed by the older Comondú volcanics, {{it appears to be}} a product of La Reforma activity.|$|E

5|$|Before the Voyager 1 {{encounter}} with Io on March 5, 1979, Io <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a dead world {{much like the}} Moon. The discovery of a cloud of sodium surrounding Io led to theories that the satellite would be covered in evaporites.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the discoveries}} {{of the early}} 21st century, astronomers had no real need for a formal {{definition}} for planets. With the discovery of Pluto in 1930, astronomers considered the Solar System to have nine planets, along with thousands of smaller bodies such as asteroids and comets. Pluto <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> larger than Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Bradwall is not {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book, completed in 1086 for William I of England, at which time the area <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> uncultivated moorland between Brereton and Warmingham, that formed part of the southern boundary of the Barony of Kinderton, the historic name of Middlewich.|$|E
5|$|Sex-specific {{responses}} to stress {{have also been}} demonstrated in the rat, {{to have an effect}} on the hippocampus. Chronic stress in the male rat showed dendritic retraction and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female. This <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones.|$|E

50|$|CU {{traits are}} {{relatively}} stable, though {{some studies suggest}} that they may decrease over time through effective treatment. Early intervention <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more effective because CU traits <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more malleable early in life.|$|R

5|$|There {{is also a}} {{skeleton}} in Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze, which it obtained from France in 1833, but was mislabelled as a cassowary until correctly identified by Italian zoologist Enrico Hillyer Giglioli in 1900. Several elements of this skeleton are missing, and some have been replaced with wooden copies. Its right metatarsus was damaged during life and had healed incorrectly. It <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a male, but is now {{known to be a}} composite of two individuals. A fourth specimen <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kept in the Liverpool Museum, but it may simply be a juvenile mainland emu. Apart from the King Island emu specimens brought to France, a few are also known to have been brought to mainland Australia in 1803, but their fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{retrospective}} study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use {{for more than}} one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K, which is necessary for bone health, and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional.|$|E
5|$|A six-page writeup {{about the}} {{building}} appeared in Architect and Engineer in December 1937. The article listed {{the owners and}} the structural engineer, but did not name the architect. In the early 1980s, geologist and architectural historian Gray Brechin discovered that Irvin Goldstine had designed the building; Brechin subsequently interviewed Goldstine regarding his career. An article about the discovery was printed in Metro Magazine, a defunct San Francisco magazine. Until that time, the building <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> designed by the Mallochs.|$|E

5000|$|This <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> due <b>to</b> {{increased}} sulfur containing substrate {{available to}} gut microbiota enabling increased volatile sulfur compound (VSC) release during gut fermentation (VSC <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the primary {{contributors to the}} odor of flatus and feces).|$|R
50|$|The {{uppermost}} rocks <b>are</b> gravels which <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Cretaceous in age {{while the}} basal shales <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Permian in age.

5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further sightings {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|All the {{structures}} in Old Yosemite Village, {{except for the}} chapel, were either moved to the Pioneer Yosemite History center in Wawona or demolished during the 1950s and 1960s. Other structures in the park were also moved to the history center. Cedar Cottage, the oldest building in Yosemite Valley, was demolished in 1941 along with others, {{even though they had}} not been flooded. Little regard was given to historic preservation, as the priority <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the preservation and restoration of natural scenery.|$|E
5|$|Although the DPP {{passed a}} {{resolution}} to ban all factions within the party in 2006, the dissent between former members of different factions was still present and <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{one of the factors}} that led to DPP's loss in the presidential election. Chai, along with Koo Kwang-ming emphasized the importance of consolidating the party's policy on independence, while Tsai Ing-wen focused on the cooperation of former factions and expansion of the party's support base.|$|E
