W. Bush again, the fourth of five trips he made to the United States. Savimbi paid Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly, a lobbying firm based in Washington, D.C., $5million to lobby the Federal government for aid, portray UNITA favorably in <b>Western</b> <b>media,</b> and acquire support among politicians in Washington. Savimbi was highly successful in this endeavour.|$|E
5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the <b>Western</b> <b>media.</b> Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect on the women who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E
5|$|From 1999–2001, <b>Western</b> <b>media</b> {{reports on}} Falun Gong—and in particular, the mistreatment of practitioners—were frequent, if mixed. By {{the latter half}} of 2001, however, the volume of media reports {{declined}} precipitously, and by 2002, coverage of Falun Gong by major news organizations like the New York Times and Washington Post had almost completely ceased, particularly from within China. In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less balanced, and more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of Falun Gong or human rights groups.|$|E

The courage demonstrated by the Chinese soldiers at Triangle Hill was repeatedly glorified in various forms of media, including several major motion pictures. Qin Jiwei was also celebrated as the hero of Shangganling and eventually rose to become the Minister of Defense and the Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress.

Magazine and newspaper publishers in Hong Kong distribute and print in both Chinese and English, with a focus on sensationalism and celebrity gossip. The media in Hong Kong is relatively free from official interference compared to Mainland China, although the Far Eastern Economic Review pointed to signs of self-censorship by media whose owners have close ties to or business interests in the People's Republic of China and states that even <b>Western</b> <b>media</b> outlets are not immune to growing Chinese economic power.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in <b>Western</b> <b>media,</b> Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevailing}} consumerism in Chinese cyberspace is {{a growing}} element of Chinese culture and {{an important aspect of}} this book. Chinese bloggers, who have strongly embraced consumerism and tend to be apathetic about politics, have nonetheless demonstrated political passion over issues such as the <b>Western</b> <b>media’s</b> negative coverage of China. In this book, Jiang focuses upon this passion — Chinese bloggers’ angry reactions to the <b>Western</b> <b>media’s</b> coverage of censorship issues in current China — in order to examine China’s current potential for political reform. A central focus of this book, then, is the specific issue of censorship and how to interpret the Chinese characteristics of it as a mechanism currently used to maintain state control. While Cyber-Nationalism in China examines fundamental questions surrounding the political implications of the Internet in China, it avoids simply predicting that the Internet does or does not lead to democratization. Applying a theoretical approach based on the Foucauldian notion of governmentality, the book builds on current scholarship that has attempted to move beyond examining the dynamics of the socio-cultural and political use of new media technologies. Instead, this book’s more intricate theoretical approach does not only accommodate the kind of liberal (apolitical or political) use observed on the Internet in China, but indicates that desires for political change, such as they are, are implicitly embedded in the relationship between China’s online communities and state apparatus — noting, however, that the latter claims total governance over the Internet {{in the name of the}} people...|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the “Going Out” Program CPC realized CCTV would meet some obstacles in <b>western</b> countries, because <b>media</b> organizations like CNN and BBC are dominants in western world while CCTV is an Asian broadcaster. Besides, westerners have some kind of stereotyped opinions to Asian, especially to Chinese. It is not an easy job to change their perspective to Chinese, as a result China moved to Africa, where <b>western</b> <b>medias</b> did not cover too much. That’s why CCTV moved their attention to Africa in 2012. As Zhang mentioned that “the Africa-oriented ‘channel’ is a ‘testing ground’ for the construction of an expand state-centered Sino centric media discourse aimed at showcasing China’s soft power and challenging the perceived Western-centric world order” (Zhang, 2013). China understands that the Africans are facing the same problem, which is the misrepresenting image in the world, so it is much easier for CPC to bring the voice there. It is an essential as well as a significant step that push Chinese media steps to global.|$|R
