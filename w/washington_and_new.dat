5|$|Beecher's Handmade Cheese is an artisan cheesemaker {{and retail}} shop with {{locations}} in the Pike Place Market, Seattle, <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York City's Flatiron District. The company was founded by Kurt Beecher Dammeier in 2003 and opened in the Pike Place Market after Dammeier obtained a difficult to obtain storefront lease in the Market. Because Dammeier {{had never been a}} cheesemaker, he sought out the assistance of Brad Sinko, who helped run a family cheese-making business in Oregon. A second location was opened in 2011 in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Oregon in the United States has {{established}} an international reputation for its production of wine, ranking {{fourth in the}} country behind California, <b>Washington,</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York. Oregon has several different growing regions within the state's borders that are well-suited to the cultivation of grapes; additional regions straddle the border between Oregon and the states of Washington and Idaho. Wine making dates back to pioneer times in the 1840s, with commercial production beginning in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Tucker {{traveled}} to New York and Philadelphia and, with letters of introduction in hand, {{was able to}} further acquaint himself with his adopted country and meet noted leaders, including George <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York governors John Jay and George Clinton. Despite his enjoyment of this high society, he returned to Williamsburg and there began a courtship with Mary Byrd Farley, who was possessed of much charm and fortune, and to whom he proposed. Though he had initially preferred to delay the wedding until he had passed the bar, he gave in to his heart's desire, borrowed the needed funds from an uncle, and they married in October 1797. To help Mary, who was chronically ill with consumption, Tucker arranged a trip to his old home in Bermuda. The stay there provided Mary no relief from her illness and confirmed his desire to be in Virginia. They returned to Williamsburg, setting up residence, with his intention to read for the bar exam. Except for trips to North Carolina to collect rents on his wife's property, Tucker avoided his work, attended horse races in Fredericksburg, and frequented fashionable watering places with friends and family; he made Thomas Jefferson's acquaintance at this time. Mary never recovered from her infirmities, and died childless in 1799.|$|E

25|$|Having been {{ejected from}} Noah Webster's home, Greenleaf moved to Philadelphia (possibly {{because it was}} {{considered}} the halfway point between <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York City). On March 9, 1795, Greenleaf purchased the Landsdowne estate of John Penn (the last colonial governor of Pennsylvania) for $37,000. (Penn built a luxurious mansion on the estate about 1773, and died on February 9, 1795). Then on April 15, 1795, Greenleaf purchased General Philemon Dickinson's house on Chestnut Street in Philadelphia for $28,000. On an opposite corner was Robert Morris' home. Greenleaf gave lavish parties at both homes.|$|E
25|$|Hewett {{spent most}} of late 1904 and 1905 {{shuttling}} between <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Mexico, helping Lacey with a nascent Act of Congress at the one and continuing his archaeological fieldwork at the other. This {{was a time of}} personal misfortune for him, however, as Cora Hewett's illness had become terminal. While in Geneva, she had to use a wheelchair much of the time; after their return to the United States, she entered a sanatorium in Santa Fe, New Mexico for a time. She died in the fall of 1905. Hewett kept on working.|$|E
25|$|The New York to New Haven {{line has}} long been {{completely}} grade-separated, and the last grade crossings between <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York were eliminated in the 1980s. In 1994, during planning for electrification and high-speed Acela Express service between New Haven and Boston, a law was passed requiring USDOT {{to plan for the}} elimination of all remaining crossings (unless impractical or unnecessary) by 1997. Some lightly used crossings were simply closed, while most were converted into bridges or underpasses. Only thirteen remained by 1999, of which lightly used crossings in Old Lyme, Connecticut and Exeter, Rhode Island were soon closed.|$|E

25|$|Textile {{companies}} and related businesses {{continued into the}} 21st century, when most went bankrupt, reorganized, and/or merged with other companies as textile manufacturing jobs moved offshore. Greensboro is still a major center of the textile industry, with the main offices of International Textile Group (Cone, Burlington Industries), Galey & Lord, Unifi, and VF Corporation (Wrangler, Lee, The North Face, and Nautica). ITG Brands, maker of Kool, Winston and Salem brand cigarettes, is the third largest tobacco company in the United States and is headquartered in Greensboro. Rail traffic continues to be important for the city's economy, as Greensboro is a major regional freight hub. In addition, four Amtrak passenger trains stop in Greensboro daily on the main Norfolk Southern line between <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Orleans by way of Atlanta.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1920s, Trains #524 and #525 {{were among the}} B's ten daily {{passenger}} trains in each direction between <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York. On May 29, 1929, the B dubbed its mid-afternoon deluxe Washington-New York train the Columbian. By the early 1930s, intense competition from the Pennsylvania Railroad in the New YorkWashington market prompted the B to air condition the train in 1932, the first railroad to do so. Also introduced were the richly-appointed Martha Washington-series dining cars, celebrated for their decor and fresh Chesapeake Bay cuisine served on Dresden china in ornate cars with glass chandeliers and colonial-style furnishings. Dining car specialties included oysters and Chesapeake Bay fish served with cornmeal muffins. In September 1941, the B introduced a new WashingtonChicago all-coach train, calling it the Columbian. The Columbian's former afternoon schedule between New York and Washington was renamed the Marylander.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Congress {{authorized}} {{an overhaul}} of the system between Washington and Boston. Called the Northeast Corridor Improvement Project (NECIP), it included safety improvements, modernization of the signaling system by General Railway Signal, and new Centralized Electrification and Traffic Control (CETC) control centers by Chrysler at Philadelphia, New York and Boston. It allowed more trains to run faster and closer together, and set the stage for later high-speed operation. NECIP also introduced the AEM-7 locomotive, which lowered travel times between cities and became the most successful engine on the Corridor. The NECIP set travel time goals of 2 hours and 40 minutes between <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York, and 3 hours and 40 minutes between Boston and New York. These goals were not met because of the low level of funding provided by the Reagan Administration and Congress in the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Dickinson {{is taught}} in American {{literature}} and poetry classes in the United States from middle school to college. Her poetry is frequently anthologized and {{has been used as}} texts for art songs by composers such as Aaron Copland, Nick Peros, John Adams and Michael Tilson Thomas. Several schools have been established in her name; for example, Emily Dickinson Elementary Schools exist in Bozeman, Montana,Redmond, <b>Washington.,</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York City. A few literary journals—including The Emily Dickinson Journal, the official publication of the Emily Dickinson International Society—have been founded to examine her work. An 8-cent commemorative stamp in honor of Dickinson was issued by the United States Postal Service on August 28, 1971 as the second stamp in the [...] "American Poet" [...] series. A one-woman play titled The Belle of Amherst first appeared on Broadway in 1976, winning several awards; it was later adapted for television.|$|E

500|$|As the 1930s dawned, the B's New York {{passenger}} service faced {{two significant}} competitive disadvantages, {{compared to the}} Pennsylvania Railroad. First, the B lacked direct access to Manhattan, resulting in slower overall travel time. Second, the Pennsylvania's move in the early 1930s to replace steam power with modern, smokeless electric service along its entire New YorkWashington mainline was met with enthusiastic public approval. The B responded by introducing Diesel locomotives, air conditioning, and streamlining on its New York trains. On June 24, 1935, the B inaugurated the first lightweight, streamlined train in the eastern U.S., when it began operating a re-christened Royal Blue train between <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> York. When the specially modified 4-4-4-type steam locomotive prepared for the run proved less than satisfactory in terms of stability at speed, a new EMC 1800 hp B-B diesel-electric engine with a carbody by General Electric and mechanicals by Electro-Motive Corporation and numbered 50 replaced it, which was yet another first east of the Mississippi River. [...] In 1937 this was replaced with the more demurely streamlined locomotive #51 and booster 51x, among {{the first of the}} new E-Series road Diesel locomotives from General Motors' Electro Motive Company. Previously, early experiments with internal combustion engines to replace steam in railroad applications included short, articulated trainsets (such as Burlington's Pioneer Zephyr and Union Pacific's M-10000), double-head sets of [...] "boxcab" [...] locomotives (developed by EMC) used to power the 1936 version of the AT (Santa Fe) Super Chief (similar to number 50), and the cab/booster unit combinations developed with Union Pacific's M-10002 and M-10003 - M-10006 trainsets. The E units took the most advanced developments of Diesel locomotive technology and made them available to all operators using the consists of their choice, and allowed Number 50 and the aluminum trainset to migrate west to subsidiary Alton, where it operated as the Abraham Lincoln. [...] The earliest adopters of the new E units demonstrated the improved flexibility, efficiency and reduced maintenance costs of Diesel power in daily service compared to steam and gave impetus to the Dieselization of the railroad industry.|$|E
