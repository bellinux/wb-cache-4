Outage costs representing the economic and non-economic consequences of service curtailments to customers {{can be used as}} an effective parameter of RDP in electricity markets. This paper examines the theoretical aspects of an RDP scheme, and derives the optimal decisions of consumers and electric utilities for long-term transactions. The proposed RDP is demonstrated through a case study on a <b>wheeling</b> <b>service...</b>|$|E

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Electric power {{is said to be}} wheeled when the transmission lines of one or more utilities are used to transport electric energy from a seller of power to a buyer. The best way to price the <b>wheeling</b> <b>service</b> depends on one's pricing objective and the environment within which the objective is pursued. This study examines the best way to price wheeling so as to encourage good decisions about the use and expansion of electric power transmission networks. The current setting of laws, regulations, and other limitations placed on utilities, regulators, and wheeling customers somewhat constrains ratemaking from achieving this goal. Conditions appear to be changing...|$|E

Determination of residual stress distribution {{is necessary for}} the prediction of <b>wheel</b> <b>service</b> life and possible catastrophic failure. Therefore experimental section is devoted to residual stress measurement using strain gauges according to standard EN 13262 + A 1. During measurement, several segments of tested wheel were cut by abrasive water jet to detect changes of residual stresses on specified places. It was found that abrasive water jet technology can cut wheel segments faster, more accurately and with negligible mechanical and thermal load compared to mechanical cutting by band saw. Therefore the use of abrasive water jet is recommended for the measurement of residual stresses in railway wheels.

40|$|Abstract: Power {{distribution}} companies face great {{challenges in}} balancing profit maximization with the regulatory board requests. Modeling uncertainties has been essential to distribution investment risk assessment. For the Brazilian environment, the uncertainties {{in setting the}} price of <b>wheeling</b> <b>services,</b> coming from the Electricity Regulatory Agency, add more volatility to the investment return, {{as well as to}} other common uncertainties, like interest rates and equipment costs. The proposed investment analysis method encompasses the effects of price-cap regulation in association with the irreversibility, flexibility and uncertainty of a new investment. A Real Options framework is used to valuate investment opportunities under the regulated wheeling charge, providing the optimal investment frontier in terms of price. Examples coming from a real company are used for illustrating the concepts introduced in this paper...|$|R
