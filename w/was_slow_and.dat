5|$|As before, the MPGA {{supported}} and assisted the new fundraising campaign. However, although {{the campaign was}} initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising <b>was</b> <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised. The churchwardens and the MPGA began to consider ideas for initiatives which would publicise the campaign and provide a reason to justify preserving {{the whole of the}} park.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{ticket sales}} from Morden South station {{increased}} from 9,840 in 1930 to 50,817 in 1938 but, from the SR's perspective, {{the line was}} not a great success. The service, originally operating from West Croydon to Holborn Viaduct station in Central London, <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> indirect {{and many of the}} potential passengers from the line's catchment area continued to use the buses and tube route via Morden.|$|E
5|$|Progress in {{clearing}} and covering the burial ground <b>was</b> <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was not}} until 28 October 1880 that the churchyard was reopened as a public park. Laid out with flower beds and gravel paths, the park became a popular place for local workers to spend breaks.|$|E

5|$|Progression {{towards an}} erect limb posture, which would {{increase}} the animals' stamina by avoiding Carrier's constraint. But this process <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> erratic: for example, all herbivorous nonmammaliaform therapsids retained sprawling limbs (some late forms may have had semierect hind limbs); Permian carnivorous therapsids had sprawling forelimbs, and some late Permian ones also had semisprawling hindlimbs. In fact, modern monotremes still have semisprawling limbs.|$|E
5|$|Regent Street {{was one of}} {{the first}} planned {{developments}} of London. The desire to impose order on the city's medieval street pattern dates back to the aftermath of the Great Fire of London (1666) when Sir Christopher Wren and John Evelyn drew plans for rebuilding the city on the classical formal model, but progress <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> houses were rebuilt on the old street network anyway.|$|E
5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks {{was well}} established, Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming directly involved in brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million bricks a year. It was decided that 5million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> obstructed by the local authority.|$|E

5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> strong winds, which did not help the dismasted Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E
5|$|Before 1907, all {{magnitude}} {{measurements for}} stars were obtained through visual comparison of relative brightness, {{a process that}} <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> inexact. Later photographic methods would use starlight to make a representation on a photographic plate. Regardless, neither method was adequate for quantitative measurements. The drawback of previous methods of measuring stellar magnitude made the use of electricity for empirically gathering astronomical data revolutionary for the science of astronomy. Joel Stebbins' pioneering research for astronomical photometry {{took place at the}} observatory.|$|E
5|$|For the 1937–38 cricket season, Miller {{transferred}} to the VCA Colts, where he won the team's batting trophy for having the best average. At this stage, his method of playing <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> steady accumulation of runs. Late in the summer, he made his first-class debut for Victoria and hit 181 against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In 1938–39, he rejoined South Melbourne and also played four further matches for Victoria, scoring 125 runs {{at an average of}} 25.00. However, he was yet to play in the Sheffield Shield competition, having appeared only in one-off matches.|$|E

5|$|HMS Valiant {{was laid}} down 1 February 1861 by Westwood, Baillie in Cubitt Town. This company went {{bankrupt}} in November 1861 and was ultimately bought by Thames Ironworks, which delayed the ship's launching until 14 October 1863. In August 1865, after Valiant had been towed to Portsmouth for fitting out, {{the ship was}} inspected by French officers during a port visit by ironclads of the French Navy. Production of the new muzzle-loaded rifles <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> ships already in commission had priority so Valiant was not commissioned until September 1868, nearly five years after she was launched.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{several months}} {{after the release of}} Net-2, William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz wrote {{replacements}} for those six missing files, ported BSD to the Intel 80386-based microprocessors, and called their new operating system 386BSD. They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> after a period of neglect, a group of 386BSD users decided to branch out on their own and create FreeBSD so that they could keep the operating system up to date. The first version of FreeBSD was released on November 1993.|$|E
5|$|Single-celled {{microorganisms}} {{were the}} first forms of life to develop on Earth, approximately 3–4 billion years ago. Further evolution <b>was</b> <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> for about 3 billion years in the Precambrian eon, (much {{of the history of}} life on Earth), all organisms were microorganisms. Bacteria, algae and fungi have been identified in amber that is 220 million years old, which shows that the morphology of microorganisms has changed little since the Triassic period. The newly discovered biological role played by nickel, however — especially that brought about by volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps — may have accelerated the evolution of methanogens {{towards the end of the}} Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Britain proved for {{the first}} time that the Junkers Ju 87 was {{vulnerable}} in hostile skies against well-organised and determined fighter opposition. The Ju 87, like other dive bombers, <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> possessed inadequate defences. Furthermore, it could not be effectively protected by fighters because of its low speed, and the very low altitudes at which it ended its dive bomb attacks. The Stuka depended on air superiority, the very thing being contested over Britain. It was withdrawn from attacks on Britain in August after prohibitive losses, leaving the Luftwaffe without precision ground-attack aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Blackburn Firebrand was a British {{single-engine}} strike fighter for the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy designed during World War II by Blackburn Aircraft. Originally {{intended to}} serve as a pure fighter, its unimpressive performance and the allocation of its Napier Sabre piston engine by the Ministry of Aircraft Production for the Hawker Typhoon caused it to be redesigned as a strike fighter to take advantage of its load-carrying capability. Development <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> the first production aircraft was not delivered until {{after the end of the}} war. Only a few hundred were built before it was withdrawn from front-line service in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{transition}} from timber to stone keeps are unclear, and the process <b>was</b> <b>slow</b> <b>and</b> uneven, taking many years to take effect across the various regions. Traditionally {{it was believed that}} stone keeps had been adopted because of the cruder nature of wooden buildings, the limited lifespan of wooden fortifications and their vulnerability to fire; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as sophisticated as their stone equivalents. Some wooden keeps were not converted into stone for many years and were instead expanded in wood, such as at Hen Domen. Nonetheless, stone became increasingly popular as a building material for keeps for both military and symbolic reasons.|$|E

5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic {{developments}} are usually {{linked to the}} periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist <b>was</b> <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderately}} powerful ridge persisted {{north of}} Tropical Storm Oliwa, which caused a slow west to west-northwest track. Water temperatures were slightly warmer than usual, {{and there was}} a favorable upper-level environment for strengthening. Initially, however, Oliwa was somewhat disorganized on satellite imagery, and on September4, as it crossed the International Date Line, there may have been multiple circulations. Upon entering the western Pacific Ocean, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began issuing advisories on the system (9719). Despite the favorable conditions, further intensification <b>was</b> <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> it reached typhoon status - winds of at least 75mph (120km/h) - on September8. Prior to that time, Oliwa co-existed with a weak tropical cyclone that formed in a similar location in the south Pacific.|$|E
5|$|After the 1841 general election, Melbourne was {{replaced}} as Prime Minister by Sir Robert Peel, who appointed Albert {{as chairman of}} the Royal Commission in charge of redecorating the new Palace of Westminster. The Palace had burned down seven years before, and was being rebuilt. As a patron and purchaser of pictures and sculpture, the commission was set up to promote the fine arts in Britain. The commission's work <b>was</b> <b>slow,</b> <b>and</b> the architect, Charles Barry, took many decisions out of the commissioners' hands by decorating rooms with ornate furnishings that were treated as part of the architecture. Albert was more successful as a private patron and collector. Among his notable purchases were early German and Italian paintings—such as Lucas Cranach the Elder's Apollo and Diana and Fra Angelico's St Peter Martyr—and contemporary pieces from Franz Xaver Winterhalter and Edwin Landseer. , of Dresden, assisted Albert in buying pictures of the highest quality.|$|E
