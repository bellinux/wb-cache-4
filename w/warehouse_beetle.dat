50|$|Wright {{then began}} {{work for the}} Stored Grain Research Laboratory in Australia to control the <b>warehouse</b> <b>beetle</b> and its harmful impact on stored grains and stored grain commodities. The <b>warehouse</b> <b>beetle</b> is not {{indigenous}} to Australia and originally {{an attempt was made}} to eradicate them. Wright worked with other researchers to find that the <b>warehouse</b> <b>beetle</b> had spread from plants and silos with stored grain into the wild across Australia and that complete eradication was impossible. Wright and her team found the most effective amounts of heat and fumigants used in grain to control the <b>warehouse</b> <b>beetle.</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>Warehouse</b> <b>beetle,</b> Trogoderma variabile (Coleoptera: Dermestidae), is {{an internationally}} {{significant}} invasive pest of packed goods and stored grain. When {{it was first}} documented in Australia at Griffith, New South Wales, in 1977, an eradication campaign was initiated. After several years and considerable effort, the eradication campaign was abandoned. To monitor the presence and spread of T. variabile, surveys were carried out by government agencies in 1992 and 2002. When survey data was compared, {{it was concluded that}} the distribution of morphologically identified T. variabile had doubled in most Australian states. Here, we used samples from the 2002 survey to conduct a phylogenetic study using partial sequences of mitochondrial genes Cytochrome oxidase I and Cytochrome B, and the nuclear gene 18 S, to examine the distribution and dispersal of T. variabile and detect the presence of misidentified species. Based on our molecular results, we show that only 47 % of the samples analysed were T. variabile, and the remaining were a mixture of six putative species. In addition, T. variabile was found in only 78 % of the trapping sites. We discuss the importance of correct diagnosis in relation to the eradication campaign...|$|E
40|$|Although high {{concentrations}} of zinc and manganese were found in mandibles of insect larvae that bore into seeds, these metals were not detected in mandibles of insect larvae that attack previously damaged seeds. Metals {{were present in the}} larval mandibles of a lepidopteran, the Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella), and eight coleopterans, the lesser grain borer (Rhyzopertha dominica), cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne), drugstore beetle (Stegobium paniceum), spider beetle (Gibbium aequinoctiale), <b>warehouse</b> <b>beetle</b> (Trogoderma variabile), cadelle (Tenebroides mauritanicus), larger black flour beetle (Cynaeus angustus), and cowpea weevil (Callosobruchus maculatus). Larvae of these species can chew into seeds. Larvae of six other coleopterans, the varied carpet beetle (Anthrenus verbasci), sawtoothed grain beetle (Oryzaephilus surinamensis), rusty grain beetle (Cryptolestes ferrugineus), red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), longheaded flour beetle (Latheticus oryzae), and granary weevil (Sitophilus granarius) have little if any ability to chew into seeds, and did not have metal in their mandibles. Larvae of the granary weevil hatch and feed within seeds that were penetrated previously during egg deposition by adults. However, newly hatched larvae of the cowpea weevil and the Angoumois grain moth have to bore through the seed coat before they begin feeding, and they have mandibles with {{high concentrations}} of zinc. These dat...|$|E

40|$|Stored-product insects can {{potentially}} {{be exposed to}} grain protectants for variable time periods. Adults of three species, the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera: Bostrychidae), the granary weevil Sitophilus granarius (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) were exposed for 1, 4, 8, and 24 h on brown rice treated with the pyrethroid deltamethrin at the label rate of 0. 5 ppm, then removed and placed on untreated rice. Adults of these same species plus the rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and the <b>warehouse</b> <b>beetle,</b> Trogoderma variabile Ballion (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) were exposed on treated brown rice mixed with varying amounts of untreated rice to assess progeny production. Immediate and delayed mortality of exposed adults did not exceed 7 % for any exposure interval, but progeny production for T. castaneum was generally lower in comparison with that for the other species. Increasing the amount of treated rice decreased progeny production of R. dominica but not for any Sitophilus species. Mixed results were obtained for T. castaneum and T. variabile. Results show that long exposure times and treatment of an entire rice mass {{may be necessary to}} give complete control of stored-product beetles...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryBhadriraju SubramanyamHeat {{treatment}} of grain-processing facilities involves using elevated temperatures of 50 - 60 ˚C for 24 h {{or less to}} manage stored-product insects. Heat is an alternative to a non-ozone depleting fumigant sulfuryl fluoride, which was registered in the United States in 2004 for disinfestation of grain-processing facilities. In this study, life history traits of the <b>warehouse</b> <b>beetle,</b> Trogoderma variabile Ballion, were characterized on ground cat food at 28 °C and 65 % RH to facilitate harvesting life stages of a specific age for bioassays with heat. Eggs laid by females were observed for daily eclosion. Eggs hatched on days 6 through 10, and the mean proportion for egg hatching was 87 %. Larvae hatching from eggs (first instars) were reared on ground cat food and their head capsule widths were measured every 2 d until all larvae became pupae. Head capsule widths indicated six instars and the total larval duration ranged from 28 - 40 d. Pupae became adults in 3 - 9 d. Newly eclosed unmated female adults lived 7 d longer than unmated males (16 d), whereas mated males lived 2 d longer than mated females (8 d). Eggs were not observed when food was not provided to male and female pairs. Females started laying eggs 2 d after pairing until the fifth day. The total number of eggs laid by mating pairs {{in the presence of}} food ranged from 30 to 135. Exposure of eggs, young larvae, old larvae, pupae, and adults of T. variabile at 46, 50, and 54 °C and 15 - 20 % RH for four fixed time periods showed pupae to be generally more heat tolerant than other life stages. At 46, 50, and 54 °C, complete mortality of all stages occurred at 1440, 120, and 30 min, respectively. Pupae also were generally more heat tolerant than other life stages during tests in pilot flour and feed mills at Kansas State University and in a commercial grain-processing facility. However, results from pilot and commercial mills were not as conclusive as the results at fixed temperatures in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Grain Science and IndustrySubramanyam BhadrirajuHulya DoganLarvae of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hübner), {{have the}} ability to invade or {{penetrate}} packaging materials and infest the food within. Energy bars with three polypropylene packaging types were challenged with eggs (for first instars), third, and fifth instars of P. interpunctella to determine package resistance to larvae at 28 °C and 65 % r. h. to determine which provided the greatest protection against P. interpunctella larval penetration. Third and fifth instars showed a higher propensity to infest all packaging variations. First instars showed a reduction in package pentration abiltiy compared to third and fifth instars. Methoprene is an insect growth regulator labeled in the USA for use as an aerosol spray, a residual surface treatment, and as a grain protectant, and recently has been impregnated into a polymer-based packing film to prevent insect infestations of packaged products. The objectives of these studies were 1) determine the effect of short term exposure time and temperature on four week old larvae, continual exposure on egg-to-adult emergence of beetles, and sub-lethal effect on adults of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and <b>warehouse</b> <b>beetle,</b> Trogoderma variabile Ballion, on the inside and outside surfaces of methoprene-treated woven packaging material at 27 and 32 °C at 60 % r. h.; 2) evaluate fecundity, egg hatch, and egg-to-adult emergence of T. castaneum and T. variabile, when exposed to two methoprene-impregnated polymer packaging on the inside and outside surfaces at 27 and 32 °C at 60 % r. h.; and 3) determine the effect of methoprene-treated foil packaging on larval emergence, penetration, and invasion ability of T. variabile and P. interpunctella at 27 °C and 60 % r. h. Short term exposure results indicated that adult emergence from larvae of T. castaneum and T. variabile decreased with increasing exposure time. The number of eggs laid per female of T. castaneum and T. variabile did not vary from their controls. Continual exposure demonstrated 100 % supression of T. castaneum adult emergence, irrespective of exposure to outside or inside surfaces. T. variabile exposed to inside surfaces were unaffected and normal adult emergence was reduced in those exposed to outside surfaces [...] The number of T. variabile eggs laid per female was not significantly different among polymer packaging types. The methoprene-treated polyethylene terephthalate to polyethylene packaging, PET-PE reduced the number of T. castaneum eggs laid per female. Both polymer packaging reduced the percent hatch of both species. No T. castaneum adults emerged on the inside surface of PET-PE and both sides of the polyethlyene to polyethylene (PE-PE). Egg-to-adult emergence of T. variabile was arrested at the pupal stage on the outside surface of PE-PE packaging. The PET-PE packaging greatly reduced the number of normal adults by 87 to 97 % when exposed to inside surfaces at both temperatures. The foil packaging had no significant effect on hatch of either species. T. variabile were unable to penetrate/invade any foil packages. P. interpunctella invaded all packaging containing pinholes. Therefore, continual exposure of T. castaneum and T. variabile to methoprene impregnated packaging could be a vaiable tool to protect food packages...|$|E
