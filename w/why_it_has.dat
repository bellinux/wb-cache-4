5|$|A {{maximum of}} three Nobel laureates and two {{different}} works may be {{selected for the}} Nobel Prize in Physics. Compared with other Nobel Prizes, the nomination and selection process for the prize in Physics is long and rigorous. This is a key reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> grown in importance {{over the years to}} become the most important prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{geographic}} {{location of the}} city, {{with respect to the}} principal storm tracks, is especially favorable which is <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> earned the reputation as a vacation destination. It is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast in which many species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. Spanish moss, for example is near the northernmost limit of its natural range at First Landing State Park, and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other plants like Sabal palmetto, Pindo Palm, Windmill Palm, Hardy Citrus, and Oleander are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west.|$|E
25|$|The Rotunda has a {{diameter}} of 24.5 m. Its walls are more than 6 m thick, which is <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> withstood Thessaloniki's earthquakes. The walls are interrupted by eight rectangular bays, with the south bay forming the entrance. A flat brick dome, 30 m high at the peak, crowns the cylindrical structure. In its original design, {{the dome of the}} Rotunda had an oculus, as does the Pantheon in Rome.|$|E

25|$|It is {{the grain}} of Yule Marble that gives an {{appearance}} of smooth texture, a homogeneous look, and a luminous surface that polishes well. These qualities are <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been chosen {{for a number of}} major national and state landmarks, most notably the Lincoln Memorial. Because of its aesthetic value, architect Henry Bacon successfully urged that it be used to clad the whole exterior of the Memorial, even though it was the most expensive material.|$|E
25|$|Church doctrines {{teach that}} those who were once saved by God are {{completely}} detached from the sins they will ever commit {{in the future and}} guaranteed a path to heaven. Unlike other Christian organizations, the group is alleged to focus little on repentance ― a reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been described as a cult. The church was held to be a cult by the conservative Christian denomination, the General Assembly of Presbyterian Churches, in 1992. Evangelical Baptist Church is unrelated to the Korea Baptist Convention.|$|E
25|$|China's navy {{had long}} lacked an air defense missile system, hence <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{been a major}} area of weakness. China's SAM {{development}} had been seriously jeopardized by the Cultural Revolution, and the {{break away from the}} Soviet Union meant that no Soviet assistance in air defense missiles was given. The first naval SAM system was not developed until the late 1960s. This was {{in the form of the}} HQ-61 SAM, originally a short-range land based system. The first PLAN ship to be armed with SAM was the Type 053K frigate Jiangdong, launched in 1970. However it took many years for the design to mature and the obsolete system was never ideal for naval operations. The Jiangdong had two twin launchers of the HQ61 SAM. The missile was capable of engaging enemy air targets out to 10km. The HQ-61 was applied to only a limited degree. The Jiangwei I class of four units, were armed with a sextuple launcher. The weakness, however, was lack of automatic reload systems, so the crew had to manually reload.|$|E

500|$|Robert Christgau thought {{highly of}} the album, however, writing in The Village Voice at the time: [...] "The {{music is not}} only simple and attractive, with the {{synthesizer}} used mostly for texture and the guitar breaks for comment, but it actually achieves some of the symphonic dignity (and cross-referencing) that The Dark Side of the Moon simulated so ponderously." [...] He later wrote: [...] "My favorite Pink Floyd album has always been Wish You Were Here, and you know <b>why?</b> <b>It</b> <b>has</b> soul, that's why – it's Roger Waters's lament for Syd, not my idea of a tragic hero {{but as long as}} he's Roger's that doesn't matter." ...|$|E
500|$|Nominative {{determinism}} is {{the hypothesis}} that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work that fit their names. The term was first used in the magazine New Scientist in 1994, after the magazine's humorous Feedback column noted several studies carried out by researchers with remarkably fitting surnames. These included a book on polar explorations by Daniel Snowman and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon. These and other examples led to light-hearted speculation {{that some sort of}} psychological effect was at work. Since the term appeared, nominative determinism has been an irregularly recurring topic in New Scientist, as readers continue to submit examples. Nominative determinism differs from the related concept aptronym, and its synonyms aptonym, namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name, in that it focusses on causality. [...] "Aptronym" [...] merely means the name is fitting, without saying anything about <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> come to fit.|$|E

2500|$|Chinese {{herbology}} (...) is {{the theory}} of traditional Chinese herbal therapy, which accounts {{for the majority of}} treatments in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

2500|$|The {{coelacanths}} which {{live near}} Sodwana Bay, South Africa, rest in caves at depths of 90 to 150 m during daylight hours, but disperse and swim to depths as shallow as 55 m when hunting at night. The depth {{is not as}} important as their need for very dim light and, more importantly, for water which has a temperature of 14 to 22°C. [...] They will rise or sink to find these conditions. The amount of oxygen their blood can absorb from the water through the gills is dependent on water temperature. [...] Scientific research suggests the coelacanth must stay in cold, well-oxygenated water or else its blood cannot absorb enough oxygen. The fish seems to be very well adapted to its environment, which is seen as one of the reasons <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> the slowest evolving genome of all known vertebrates.|$|E

2500|$|After filming in {{the desert}} concluded, {{production}} moved to Malibu Creek State Park, northwest of Los Angeles, on Las Virgenes Road off Mulholland Highway, where the 20th Century Fox's Malibu Ranch was located. Ape City {{was built on the}} ranch, and a field of corn grown, by which Heston first encounters Harrison. [...] "It was stinking hot," [...] Harrison recalled. [...] "The scenes of us in cages were also shot at Ape City." [...] From the Malibu Ranch, production moved to the coast, where the penultimate scenes were shot between Malibu and Oxnard. The final scenes were filmed in a secluded cove between Zuma Beach and Point Dume on the far eastern end of Westward Beach. Harrison's Nova was the sole human witness to Taylor's outburst on the beach, after which she looks up and, in the film's iconic ending, sees the ruined Statue of Liberty, without comprehending <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> caused her mate's grief.|$|E
2500|$|O'Connell {{describes}} typical textbook {{descriptions of}} the clitoris as lacking detail and including inaccuracies, saying {{that the work of}} Georg Ludwig Kobelt in the early 19th century provides a most comprehensive and accurate description of clitoral anatomy. She argues that the bulbs appear {{to be part of the}} clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the center of female sexual function and orgasm. By contrast, Nancy Tuana, at the 2002 conference for Canadian Society of Women in Philosophy, argues that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction, but that this is <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been [...] "historically ignored", mainly because of [...] "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear". She reasoned that this fear is the cause of the ignorance that veils female sexuality.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the above}} theory is true, {{the next stage}} of {{development}} ought to be triple algebra and if [...] truly represents a line in a given plane, it ought to be possible to find a third term which added to the above would represent a line in space. Argand and some others guessed that it was [...] although this contradicts the truth established by Euler that [...] De Morgan and many others worked hard at the problem, but nothing came of it until the problem was taken up by Hamilton. We now see the reason clearly: The symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and an angle. In it the angles are confined to one plane. Hence the next stage will be a quadruple algebra, when the axis of the plane is made variable. And this gives the answer to the first question; double algebra is nothing but analytical plane trigonometry, and this is <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been found to be the natural analysis for alternating currents. But De Morgan never got this far. He died with the belief that “double algebra must remain as the full development of the conceptions of arithmetic, so far as those symbols are concerned which arithmetic immediately suggests”.|$|E
