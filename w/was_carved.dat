5|$|Butterflies have {{appeared}} in art from 3500 years ago in ancient Egypt. In the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, the brilliantly coloured image of the butterfly <b>was</b> <b>carved</b> into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and emblazoned on incense burners. The butterfly was sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar, and some species {{were considered to be}} the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors.

According to the current head of the Konparu school, the mask <b>was</b> <b>carved</b> by the legendary regent Prince Shōtoku (572-622) over a thousand years ago. While the historical accuracy of the legend of Prince Shōtoku's mask may be contested, the legend itself is ancient as it is first recorded in Zeami's Style and the Flower written in the 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul's {{history and}} growth as a landing port {{are tied to}} water. The city's {{defining}} physical characteristic, {{the confluence of the}} Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, <b>was</b> <b>carved</b> into the region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys. The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.|$|E

The Renaissance cameos are typically white on a grayish background and <b>were</b> <b>carved</b> {{from the shell}} of a mussel or cowry, the latter a tropical mollusk.|$|R

Despite heavy weathering, the figure can be seen holding a spear and a shield with an owl above the left shoulder to symbolise wisdom. There is also a carving of an altar where offerings were left. The only rock-cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain, the Minerva shrine is a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|To Cairano, also, is {{attributed}} the Altar of San Girolamo {{in the church}} of St Francis. One of the critical issues of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia {{is the lack of}} historical sources on its origin. Certainly the altar <b>was</b> <b>carved</b> after 1506, given its high quality and artistic originality, indeed the highest level of art in the Brescian period, and evokes several features of Cairano's earlier work on the Loggia and front-yard of San Pietro's church in Oliveto.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (Alfkors, Älvkors or Ellakors), which <b>was</b> <b>carved</b> into buildings or other objects. It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram {{and it was still}} frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in {{order to protect}} against elves. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Stela 5 was {{situated}} {{at the base of}} Structure 1 in the East Plaza. It <b>was</b> <b>carved</b> with a rounded frame containing a figure in profile facing to the left.

The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.|$|E
