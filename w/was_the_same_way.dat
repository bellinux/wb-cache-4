60|$|At last {{there came}} a day when he missed that cheery whistle. He waited and waited.

60|$|They first {{passed through}} many {{beautiful}} gardens of flowers, which grew nearest the city; but Dorothy could hardly tell {{what kind of}} flowers they were, because the colors were constantly changing under the shifting lights of the six suns.

60|$|After {{walking a}} long time {{they came to a}} little brook that trickled across the path, and here Ojo sat down to rest and eat {{something}} from his basket.

6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> {{with the}} {{cultivation}} of the sugar-cane, a plant indigenous to the island; peculiarly fitted to the soil and climate, and of so excellent a quality that Bligh took slips {{of it to the}} West Indies. All the plantations went on famously for a while; the natives swarming in the fields like ants, and making a prodigious stir. What few plantations now remain are owned and worked by whites; who would rather pay a drunken sailor eighteen or twenty Spanish dollars a month, than hire a sober native for his [...] "fish and tarro." ...|$|E

60|$|Some young birds come along, {{flying a}} yard {{or two at}} a time and lighting. Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain.

I was going to catch some of them, but Jim wouldn't let me. He said it was death.

60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> {{with the}} blacks.

That their appearance was coincidental {{with the arrival of the}} Arangi was an association that occurred as a matter of course in Jerry's brain. Further, he did not bother, save that there was a companion association, namely, that their occasional disappearances into the beyond was likewise coincidental with the Arangi's departure.|$|E
60|$|Wind? Out {{of all my}} {{experience}} I could not have believed {{it possible for the}} wind to blow as it did. There is no describing it. How can one describe a nightmare? It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> with that wind. It tore the clothes off our bodies. I say TORE THEM OFF, and I mean it. I am not asking you to believe it. I am merely telling something that I saw and felt. There are times when I do not believe it myself. I went through it, and that is enough. One could not face that wind and live. It was a monstrous thing, and the most monstrous thing about it was that it increased and continued to increase.|$|E

The Witch did not wish me to marry the girl, so she enchanted my sword, which began hacking me to pieces. When I lost my legs I went to the tinsmith, Ku-Klip, and he made me some tin legs. When I lost my arms, Ku-Klip made me tin arms, and when I lost my head he made me this fine one out of tin. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> with my body, and finally I was all tin.

Old Mother Nature didn't say anything, but watched him and smiled to herself. You see, she knew that Mr. Coon was {{beginning}} a good habit, a very good habit indeed--the habit of neatness. So, though she knew perfectly well that he was doing it just to get ahead of her, she was glad, for she was fond of Mr. Coon in spite of the bad ways he had grown into, and she knew that good habits are like bad habits--once started they grow and grow, and are very likely to lead to more good habits.|$|E

More than once, at first, {{one or the other of}} us had our rifles taken away for a week just because of a tiny speck of rust. We had to know how to build fires in the driving rain, too, out of wet wood, when we camped out, which was the hardest thing of all--except grammar, I do believe. We learned more from Dad and Von than from the governesses; Dad taught us French and Von German. We learned both languages passably well, and we learned them wholly in the saddle or in camp.|$|E
