5|$|Lord Wraxall's widow, Ursula, Lady Wraxall, {{was left}} <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>children</b> under {{two years of}} age, little income, and a large estate. Noted for her {{efficiency}} and practicality, when the clock tower, {{the focal point of}} the house, needed substantial repairs in 1935 to overcome dry and wet rot, she simply had it disassembled, stored the metal parts for possible later usage and realigned the roof as if the clock tower had never existed.|$|E

5|$|Mary Patricia Mohan {{was born}} at 2 Third Avenue, Fazakerley, Liverpool. After two years Mary's father met and married his second wife, Rose, while {{on a trip to}} Monaghan, in Ireland. Rose arrived in Liverpool <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>children</b> from a {{previous}} marriage, but Mary, who had until then been looking after the Mohan family, realised that Rose did not care much for domesticity or her new husband's children. After a year she chose to live with her aunts. In 1923, at the age of 14 years, Mary started work as a nurse trainee at the Smithdown Road Hospital, and then took a three-year training course at Walton Road Hospital in Rice Lane, Liverpool, eventually becoming a state registered nurse.|$|E
5|$|But {{in early}} August, Holmes à Court {{contacted}} Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson only raised {{his bid to}} $47.5million, {{but he had the}} advantage of being able to close the deal faster, having completed due diligence of ATV Music prior to any formal agreement. He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes à Court and appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Holmes à Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university. Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5million on August 10. 1985. In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit Perth, Western Australia and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fruit, {{fish and}} wild pigs provide {{plentiful}} food, {{and at first}} the boys' life on the island is idyllic. They build a shelter and construct a small boat using their only possessions: a broken telescope, an iron-bound oar, and a small axe. Their first contact with other humans comes after several months when they observe two large outrigger canoes in the distance, one pursued by the other. The two groups of Polynesians disembark {{on the beach and}} engage in battle; the victors take fifteen prisoners, and kill and eat one immediately. But when they threaten to kill one of the three women captured, along <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>children,</b> the boys intervene to defeat the pursuers, earning them the gratitude of the chief, Tararo. The next morning they prevent another act of cannibalism. The natives leave, and the boys are alone once more.|$|E

5|$|The Simpson family {{attends a}} prison rodeo where Marge meets Jack Crowley, a convict whom she {{believes}} to have great artistic potential after becoming {{impressed with his}} work. She later teaches a class on being an artist to the prisoners and befriends Jack. With Marge's help, Jack is granted parole under her custody. Marge soon finds a mural-painting job at Springfield Elementary School for him. Jack paints a powerful mural symbolizing school spirit with a warrior woman riding a puma, which the whole school likes, but Principal Skinner demands he tone it down using his idea of a cartoonish puma walking <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>children</b> under a rainbow in a fantasy land. Jack reluctantly gives into his wishes; however, upon its unveiling, the new mural is panned by everyone in town. Skinner blames Jack and fires him.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{buildings}} {{have been named}} in Robinson's honor. The UCLA Bruins baseball team plays in Jackie Robinson Stadium, which, because of the efforts of Jackie's brother Mack, features a memorial statue of Robinson by sculptor Richard H. Ellis. The stadium also unveiled a new mural of Robinson by Mike Sullivan on April 14, 2013. City Island Ballpark in Daytona Beach, Florida was renamed Jackie Robinson Ballpark in 1990 and a statue of Robinson <b>with</b> <b>two</b> <b>children</b> {{stands in front of}} the ballpark. His wife Rachel was present for the dedication on September 15. 1990. A number of facilities at Pasadena City College (successor to PJC) are named in Robinson's honor, including Robinson Field, a football/soccer/track facility named jointly for Robinson and his brother Mack. The New York Public School system has named a middle school after Robinson, and Dorsey High School plays at a Los Angeles football stadium named after him. In 1976, his home in Brooklyn, the Jackie Robinson House, was declared a National Historic Landmark. Brooklyn residents want to turn his home into a city landmark. Robinson also has an asteroid named after him, 4319 Jackierobinson. In 1997, the United States Mint issued a Jackie Robinson commemorative silver dollar, and five-dollar gold coin. That same year, New York City renamed the Interboro Parkway in his honor.|$|E
