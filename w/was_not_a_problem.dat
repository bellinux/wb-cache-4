Microsoft confirmed the problem and offered to replace scratched Halo 3 Limited Edition discs free of charge until the end of January 2008. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in either the Legendary Edition or the Standard Edition.|$|E
5|$|To {{reinforce}} {{the connection with}} Love's Last Shift and capitalise on its unexpected success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, Amanda, and Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber. Keeping Rogers as Amanda <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> since she was not an actress that the companies fought over, but holding on to John Verbruggen and Colley Cibber posed challenges, to which Rich rose with energetic campaigns of bribery and re-seduction. Filling {{the rest of the}} large Relapse cast presented a varied palette of problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.|$|E
5|$|Favre {{spent his}} early adult years among the natives along the Tombigbee River, being {{initially}} {{employed by the}} French as an interpreter of the Choctaw language, but soon coming into the employ of the British and later the Spanish. Favre also understood the Chickasaw language, but at one point his translation was challenged by James Colbert (grandfather of Holmes Colbert), who had married into the Chickasaw tribe, replaced Favre as interpreter. which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> earlier for Spain during the Treaty of Natchez in 1793, nor {{at any other time}} in the long history of his duties for France. Favre was said to be a confidante and personal friend of the celebrated Choctaw Indian chief Pushmataha. Genealogist Heitzmann relates that at one point Favre acted as the interpreter between Pushmataha and the military commanders Andrew Jackson and General Thomas Hinds.|$|E

25|$|A's {{labor costs}} {{were higher than}} those of most competitors. Because A stopped growing, a rising {{percentage}} of its workers were making higher wages due to their seniority. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for most of A's competitors because they were rapidly expanding and had relatively fewer workers with high seniority. To offset higher labor costs, A tried to operate stores with fewer employees, resulting in long lines at checkouts and empty shelves.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of a very few sculptures, Waddell always creates figurative statues of people who are nude. The 1964 work, Family, was one of {{the exception}}s. In that work and despite his objections, Waddell was obliged to place shorts on the male figure of the group. Female nudity <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> so the figure of the woman was allowed to remain unclothed. Another clothed work is the portrait of his patron Walter Reed Bimson.|$|E

25|$|At {{any time}} many {{contemporary}} sculptures have usually been {{on display in}} public places; theft <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> as pieces were instantly recognisable.

25|$|For a long time, {{video games}} {{had a very}} limited number of objects to treat, and so {{checking}} all pairs <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> In two-dimensional games, in some cases, the hardware was able to efficiently detect and report overlapping pixels between sprites on the screen. In other cases, simply tiling the screen and binding each sprite into the tiles it overlaps provides sufficient pruning, and for pairwise checks, bounding rectangles or circles called hitboxes are used and deemed sufficiently accurate.|$|E

25|$|This {{parking orbit}} was quite low by Earth orbit standards, {{and it would}} have been {{short-lived}} due to aerodynamic drag. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> on a lunar mission because of the short stay in the parking orbit. The S-IVB also continued to thrust at a low level by venting gaseous hydrogen, to keep propellants settled in their tanks and prevent gaseous cavities from forming in propellant feed lines. This venting also maintained safe pressures as liquid hydrogen boiled off in the fuel tank. This venting thrust easily exceeded aerodynamic drag.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the 2nd Circuit Federal Court in New York {{issued a}} {{decision}} in the famous Coca-Cola case. Coca-Cola took over assets of Jews expelled from Egypt in the 1950s and was sued in New York. Bigio v. Coca-Cola Company, 448 F.3d 176 (2d Cir. 2006), certiorari to Sup. Ct. denied. In that case, the plaintiffs were Canadians and non‐residents of New York. The court denied Coca-Cola’s FNC motion and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari. The 2nd Circuit stated {{that the fact that}} the New York court would need to apply “modest application” of Egyptian law <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> because “courts of this Circuit are regularly called upon to interpret foreign law without thereby offending the principles of international comity”. Also, {{the fact that there were}} witnesses abroad <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> either. They could be flown into the U.S. or Letters Rogatory could be issued to the Egyptian courts to collect their testimony. Further, it was held that in an FNC scenario, a court applies the balance of conveniences, but preference (and weight) must be given to the fact that plaintiffs chose this particular forum for “legitimate reasons”. The fact that plaintiffs could sue in Canada was not relevant because Coca-Cola was a U.S. company and it was “perfectly reasonable to sue in the US”.|$|E
25|$|Flooding in the Holderness Level {{increased}} between 1840 and 1880, {{as farmers}} used tile drains {{to keep their}} land free of standing water. These carried the water away more quickly to the main drains, increasing the peak flow. Where this drained into the upland drain, this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> but where it entered the lowland drain, it caused difficulties, particularly when Marfleet was tide locked. Following the successful introduction of steam pumping on the Beverley and Barmston drain, {{to the west of}} the River Hull, the Trustees looked at the possibility of installing pumps as Marfleet. However, help came from another source.|$|E

25|$|The book, purportedly {{based on}} a true story, {{describes}} the house at 112 Ocean Avenue as remaining empty for 13 months after the DeFeo murders. In December 1975, George and Kathleen Lutz bought the house for what was considered to be a bargain price of $80,000. The five-bedroom house was built in Dutch Colonial style and had a distinctive gambrel roof. It also had a swimming pool and a boathouse, as it was located on a canal. George and Kathy married in July 1975 and each had their own homes, but they wanted to start fresh with a new property. Kathy had three children from a previous marriage: Daniel, 9, Christopher, 7, and Melissa (Missy), 5. They also owned a crossbreed Malamute/Labrador dog named Harry. During their first inspection of the house, the real estate broker told them about the DeFeo murders and asked if this would affect their decision. After discussing the matter, they decided that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
25|$|On March 19, 1944 the Germans invaded Hungary and Gestapo chief Adolf Eichmann {{immediately}} {{organized the}} round-up, ghettoization, and deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. The Klausenburg ghetto was established on May 1, 1944, and was liquidated via six transports to Auschwitz between late May and early June. Knowing that the Gestapo targeted community leaders first, the Rebbe hid {{in an open}} grave in a cemetery for several weeks. He then fled {{to the town of}} Nagybánya, where he was conscripted into a forced-labor camp along with 5000 other Hungarian Jews. Though hunger <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> here (the barbed-wire enclosure had a back exit through which Jews could buy bread and milk from non-Jews) the Hungarian soldiers constantly badgered and searched inmates for their valuables. The Rebbe shaved his beard as authorized by the Hungarian Chief Orthodox Rabbinate. He continued to conduct prayer services and even a Shabbat tisch. Conditions were not harsh, and he and many prisoners bribed the authorities to refrain from labor.|$|E
25|$|In ancient galleys under sail, most of {{the moving}} power came from a single square sail. It was rigged on a mast {{somewhat}} forwards {{of the center of}} the ship with a smaller mast carrying a head sail in the bow. Triangular lateen sails are attested as early as the 2nd century AD, and gradually became the sail of choice for galleys. By the 9th century lateens were firmly established as part of the standard galley rig. The lateen rig was more complicated and required a larger crew to handle than a square sail rig, but this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in the heavily manned galleys. Belisarius' Byzantine invasion fleet of 533 was at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that by the time the lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation in the Mediterranean. Unlike a square sail rig, the spar of a lateen sail did not pivot around the mast. To change tacks, the entire spar had to be lifted over the mast and to the other side. Since the spar was often much longer than the mast itself, and not much shorter than the ship itself, it was a complex and time-consuming maneuver.|$|E
