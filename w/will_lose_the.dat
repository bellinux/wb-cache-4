Laurie cheats, taking naps at every {{possible}} opportunity, accepting that she <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> bet, but enjoying the opportunity to mess with Travis. When the bet is over, they acknowledge how much they will miss each other when Travis leaves for college.|$|E

Don spurns {{the idea}} and leaves, but the remaining partners reluctantly agree to offer Joan $50,000. They decide to withhold Christmas bonuses and extend their credit line to cover the cost, unaware that Lane had already extended the credit line by $50,000 in the previous episode.|$|E
5|$|Back at {{the bowling}} alley, Homer {{and his friends}} enter the bowling league competition, calling {{themselves}} the Pin Pals. They beat three teams before moving up into second place in their league. Meanwhile, Burns recovers from his stupor and discovers the check he wrote to Homer. Burns wants to join the team (replacing Otto in the team), but since Burns is a horrible bowler, the team is convinced they <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> championship.|$|E

5|$|The Elves {{view the}} sexual act as {{extremely}} special and intimate, for {{it leads to}} the conception and birth of children. Extra-marital and premarital sex are unthinkable, adultery is also unheard of and fidelity between spouses is absolute. Yet separation during pregnancy or {{during the early years}} of parenthood (caused by war, for example) is so grievous to the couple that they prefer to have children in peaceful times. Living Elves cannot be raped or forced to have sex; before that they <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> will to endure and go to Mandos.|$|E
5|$|Bashir is {{startled to}} see Kira appear as a Russian spy, who {{introduces}} herself as Colonel Anastasia Komananov, KGB. She has no idea who Major Kira is. Eddington informs Bashir and Garak that they can't shut down the program or let the characters die or else they <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> patterns of the other crew members. Komananov explains that a scientist called Dr. Noah is planning {{to take over the}} world using lasers to cut into the Earth's crust resulting in the shrinking of the tectonic plates sinking and causing global flooding. Bashir's orders are to rescue Professor Honey Bare (Dax) from Noah. Falcon (O'Brien) attempts to assassinate Bashir, who must stop Komananov from killing him or else O'Brien's pattern will be lost. Bashir, Garak and Komananov go to a casino in Paris to speak to Duchamps (Worf), an associate of Noah. Bashir manages to buy his way into a meeting with Noah after winning the money at cards but the trio are knocked out by Duchamps using a powdered drug.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule is judged to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E

Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{covenant}} Yahweh has promised Israel {{the land of}} Canaan, but the promise is conditional: if the Israelites are unfaithful, they <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> land. The Deuteronomistic history explains Israel's successes and failures {{as the result of}} faithfulness, which brings success, or disobedience, which brings failure; the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians (721 BCE) and the Kingdom of Judah by the Babylonians (586) are Yahweh's punishment for continued sinfulness.|$|E
25|$|In August 1944, a coup d'état against Ante Pavelić, {{known as}} the Lorković–Vokić plot, failed and its conspirators were arrested or executed. The main {{plotters}} wanted to align NDH with the Allies. As the war progressed and it became clearer that the Axis <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> war, the desertion rate in the NDH armed force grew, especially among the Croatian Home Guard. The Chetniks also showed similar signs of desertion. In contrast, the Ustaše Militia rarely disintegrated or defected to the Partisans.|$|E
25|$|In {{relative}} numbers {{the values}} lost in bank card fraud are minor, calculated in 2006 at 7 cents per 100 {{dollars worth of}} transactions (7 basis points). In 2004, in the UK, the cost of fraud was over £500 million. When a card is stolen, or an unauthorized duplicate made, most card issuers will refund {{some or all of}} the charges that the customer has received for things they did not buy. These refunds will, in some cases, be at the expense of the merchant, especially in mail order cases where the merchant cannot claim sight of the card. In several countries, merchants <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> money if no ID card was asked for, therefore merchants usually require ID card in these countries. Credit card companies generally guarantee the merchant will be paid on legitimate transactions regardless of whether the consumer pays their credit card bill.|$|E

25|$|While New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a 2D platformer, {{some of the}} {{characters}} and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect (also seen in New Super Mario Bros.) that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. Players can play as either Mario, his brother Luigi or two Toad characters: one blue and one yellow (with the first player always as Mario). Controls {{are similar to those}} of New Super Mario Bros., albeit with the added abilities of spinning in mid-air by shaking the Wii Remote; and picking up, carrying, and throwing other players. The game does not feature online multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, there can be up to four players simultaneously. If players lose a life, but have at least one life in reserve, they will re-emerge encased inside a bubble, and can resume play once another player frees them by touching the bubble or tossing a fire ball, ice ball or Koopa shell (the player can shake the Wii Remote to move their bubble closer to an active player, but they cannot free themselves). If players lose a life and do not have any more lives, they must use a Continue and start over from their last save point with five lives left. Players can also encase themselves inside the bubble by pressing the A button while a more skilled player traverses a difficult segment. If every character in a co-op session enters a bubble at the same time (whether through death or by pressing the A button), they <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> level and must restart.|$|E
25|$|In {{selective}} schools, various languages may {{be offered}} as electives {{like in a}} SPFL program, {{as well as other}} subjects such as computer programming and literary writing like in STEM schools or Laboratory High Schools. Chinese schools have language and cultural electives. International Schools offers electives or subjects like writing, culture, history, language, art, or a special subject unique to the school. Preparatory schools like technical vocational schools or schools with TVL Program usually add some business, entrepreneurship, and accountancy courses. Special science high schools like those of PSHS System (administered by DOST) and RSHS System (administered by DepEd) have biology, chemistry, and physics at every level and or exclusive and advanced science and math subjects as well as subjects in technology, pre-engineering, and research. These science schools are more exclusive and with higher standards compared to general high school's STEM Program. PSHS or RSHS students may transfer to a STEM program school but not the way around. PSHS students may also transfer to a RSHS and vice versa only for incoming sophomore year. Both PSHS and RSHS students must maintain an average grade especially in their advanced sciences and math subjects on a quarterly basis or else <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>the</b> chance of continuing education in these schools, therefore, will make students transfer to a STEM Program school or a general high school. This systems makes sure the quality and exclusiveness of science high schools. In special government-run art school such as Philippine High School for the Arts, which is administered by the Cultural Center of the Philippines in coordination with Department of Education, and as well as the National Commission for Culture and the Arts offers a much specialized and exclusive curricular program than general high school's SPA Program. Like the PSHS and RSHS to STEM schools system, students from PHSA should maintain grades in their art field of specialization or will transfer to an SPA school or a general high school. But SPA students can enroll in PHSA only for incoming sophomores passing exclusive test, auditions, and interviews, and not from general high schools but from SPA school only. Both schools of Philippine Science High School System and the Philippine High School for the Arts are administered by government agencies apart from DepEd but still is in coordination with it. These schools offers scholarship for students with high aptitude and talents in science fields or the art fields granting those who passes rigorous and exclusive tests with many special benefits like free board and lodging, free books, a monthly stipend, and classes taught by experts, masters, and active practitioners of their respective fields among others.|$|E
