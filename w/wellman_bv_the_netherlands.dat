30|$|The {{impact of}} {{non-functional}} and functional INTs-WS 2 on coagulation was studied using the calibrated thrombin generation test (cTGT) as previously reported [41]. For each experiment, a fresh mixture of fluorogenic substrate/calcium chloride buffered solution was prepared as follows: 2.6  mL of Fluo Buffer® (Thrombinoscope <b>BV,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Netherlands)</b> were mixed with 65  μL of Fluo substrate® (100  mM in DMSO, Thrombinoscope <b>BV,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Netherlands).</b> PPP-Reagent, PPP-Reagent LOW, MP-Reagent and Thrombin Calibrator (Thrombinoscope <b>BV,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Netherlands)</b> are four inducers, giving final assay concentrations of 5  pM tissue factor (TF) with 4  μM phospholipids (PL) and 16.7  mM CaCl 2; 1  pM TF with 4  μM PL and 16.7  mM CaCl 2; 4  μM PL and 16.7  mM CaCl 2; and 620  nM α 2 - macroglobulin-thrombin complex, respectively. They are reconstituted with 1  mL distilled water {{according to the}} instructions provided by the manufacturer. A calibration curve was simultaneously performed using the thrombin calibrator. The acquired data were automatically processed by the software, which provided thrombin activity curves and 3 parameters based on this curve: lagtime (minutes), peak concentration (nM) and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP, nM[*]×[*]minutes). The INT/f-INTs suspensions were tested at final concentrations from 5 to 500  μg/mL. Statistical analyses were conducted with an unpaired t-test using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad software, v 5.01, USA).|$|R

The SEM software (Phenom Pro Suite, Phenom-World <b>BV,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Netherlands)</b> was used to quantity the surface morphology by reconstructing a 3 D surface, from which mean surface roughness values (Ra) and mean surface depth values (Rz) were calculated. Three different regions of each image were selected for 3 D reconstruction and calculation. Ra is the arithmetic mean of the absolute departures of the roughness profile from the mean line. Rz is the roughness depth, calculated as {{the sum of the}} height of the highest profile peak from the mean line and the depth of the deepest profile valley from the mean line.|$|R

40|$|The {{cannabis}} plant (Cannabis sativa L.) {{has a long}} history as a recreational drug, but also as part of traditional medicine in many cultures. Nowadays, it is used by a large number of patients worldwide, to ameliorate the symptoms of diseases varying from cancer and AIDS to multiple sclerosis and migraine. The discovery of cannabinoid-receptors and the endocannabinoid system have opened up a new and exciting field of research. But despite the pharmaceutical potential of cannabis, its classification as a narcotic drug has prevented the successful development of cannabis into modern medicine. Although a huge number of scientific papers has been published on cannabis, there is currently no scientific consensus on the usefulness of medicinal cannabis. In 2004, <b>The</b> <b>Netherlands</b> became <b>the</b> first country to make herbal cannabis available as a prescription drug. The phytochemical research presented in this thesis has been possible because of the availability of these high-grade {{cannabis plant}}s. This thesis has a specific focus on the cannabinoids and on analytical problems that currently obstruct advanced study of the cannabis plant. Furthermore, it deals with much needed methods for quality control and with administration forms of medicinal cannabis. In general, it may be considered a general guidebook, covering all the basic phytochemical aspects of medicinal cannabis. Promotor: R.
