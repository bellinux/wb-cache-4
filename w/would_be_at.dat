5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert Harrington led {{a search}} to {{determine}} the real cause of the apparent irregularities. He calculated that any PlanetX <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun; its orbit would be highly eccentric, and strongly inclined to the eclipticâ€”the planet's orbit <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> roughly a 32-degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets. This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception. Noted PlanetX sceptic Brian G. Marsden of the Minor Planet Center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier, and could easily be due to observational error.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the Regional Plan Association {{considered}} a full-length Second Avenue Subway, which include 86th Street {{as one of}} its planned 31 stations.

5|$|Theoretical {{interest}} in the chemistry of unhexquadium is largely motivated by theoretical predictions that it, especially the isotope 482Uhq (with 164 protons and 318 neutrons), <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> {{the center of a}} hypothetical second island of stability (the first being centered around 306Ubb, with 122 protons and 184 neutrons).|$|E
5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (and McCain) would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E

5|$|After an {{announcement}} that profits <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> {{the lower end}} of analysts' forecasts due to falling sales and a share price fall of 20%, HMV Group indicated its intention to close a number of Waterstones branches in January 2011. These stores closures, including two in Dublin, Republic of Ireland and nine others across the United Kingdom occurred in February 2011. Further branch closures in Luton, Dorking, Lancaster University, Harrods, Gateshead and Norwich Arcade were completed by the end of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine would reflect little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic that it could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
5|$|As the US X Corps {{was pushing}} towards the reservoir, the Chinese {{formulated}} their strategy, {{based on their}} experiences in the Chinese Civil War. Working from the assumption that only a light UN presence <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the reservoir, the Chinese 9th Corps Army was first to destroy the UN garrisons at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni, then push towards Hagaru-ri. Believing {{the bulk of the}} US X Corps would move to rescue the destroyed units, the 9th Army would then block and trap the main UN forces on the road between Hagaru-ri and Hungnam. The 9th Army initially committed eight divisions for the battle, with most of the forces concentrated at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni.|$|E

50|$|In Spring 2011, it was {{announced}} that the schools would work together as one school.

5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Because of its asymmetry, the {{reaction}} between 249Cf and 50Ti was predicted {{to be the}} most favorable practical reaction for synthesizing unbinilium, although it is also somewhat cold, and is further away from the neutron shell closure at N = 184 {{than any of the other}} three reactions attempted. No unbinilium atoms were identified, implying a limiting cross-section of 200fb. Jens Volker Kratz predicted the actual maximum cross-section for producing unbinilium by any of these reactions to be around 0.1fb; in comparison, the world record for the smallest cross section of a successful reaction was 30fb for {{the reaction}} 209Bi(70Zn,n)278Nh, and Kratz predicted a maximum cross-section of 20fb for producing the neighbouring ununennium. If these predictions are accurate, then synthesizing ununennium <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the limits of current technology, and synthesizing unbinilium would require new methods.|$|E
5|$|Despite his retirement, Johnson {{was voted}} by fans {{as a starter}} for the 1992 NBA All-Star Game at Orlando Arena, {{although}} his former teammates Byron Scott and A. C. Green said that Johnson should not play, and several NBA players, including Utah Jazz forward Karl Malone, argued that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> risk of contamination if Johnson suffered an open wound while on court. Johnson led the West to a 153â€“113win and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25points, 9assists, and 5rebounds. The game ended after he made a last-minute three-pointer, and players from both teams ran onto the court to congratulate Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Election {{days for}} the Bundestag and the European Parliament are also flag days in some states, in {{addition}} to other state-specific flag days. The public display of flags to mark other events, such as the election of the president or the death of a prominent politician (whereupon flags <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> half-staff), can be declared at the discretion of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. When flags are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical flags are not lowered. A black mourning ribbon is instead attached, either atop the staff (if hung from a pole) or to each end of the flag's supporting cross-beams (if flown like a banner).|$|E
5|$|From 1254 to 1257, Edward {{was under}} the {{influence}} of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards, the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy, the queen's uncle. After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction â€“ the half-brothers of his father HenryIII â€“ led by such men as William de Valence. This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement. There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which raised questions about the royal heir's personal qualities. The next years would be formative on Edward's character.|$|E
5|$|However, on 22 June 2017, {{after more}} than a decade of playing top-class {{international}} cricket, full ICC membership was granted to Ireland (along with Afghanistan) at an ICC meeting in London, thus making them the twelfth Test cricket team.

5|$|In the {{resulting}} Cabinet meeting on naval deployments on 7 September, Thorneycroft and Mountbatten argued {{the case for}} the forcing of the Strait with the task force, acknowledging that though the carrier <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> risk of severe damage or loss, preventing Sukarno from achieving a victory of brinkmanship was worth the peril. Though Foreign Secretary R.A. Butler strongly represented Begg's argument that the Victorious was too valuable an asset to lose, Thorneycroft's arguments won out. The Cabinet concurred that the ship should not be diverted, as a blockage of the carrier would increase Sukarno's prestige to no end, and approved preparations for Operation Althorpe, a plan to wipe out the Indonesian air force in retaliation for an attack. Although no precipitous decision was made, and though the Cabinet had agreed to examine the matter further.|$|E
5|$|Jeter {{decided to}} play {{exclusively}} as the designated hitter in the final series of his career, at Fenway Park in Boston, so that his final memories of playing shortstop <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> Yankee Stadium. The Red Sox honored Jeter with a pregame ceremony including Red Sox retired stars Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Fred Lynn, Luis Tiant and Rico Petrocelli, the Boston Bruins' Bobby Orr, New England Patriots receiver Troy Brown and the Boston Celtics' Paul Pierce, while many Boston fans at Fenway Park loudly cheered for Jeter {{and gave him a}} standing ovation. In his final at-bat, he hit an RBI infield single against Clay Buchholz, before being substituted for pinch runner Brian McCann; he received an ovation from the Red Sox fans as he exited the field.|$|E
5|$|Luna {{resigned}} on 1 March, {{mainly in}} resentment for the rearmament of the Kawit Battalion as the Presidential Guard. Aguinaldo hesitantly accepted the resignation.
