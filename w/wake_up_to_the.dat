It is managed by the Gathiuru Community Forest Association. The locals in the areas have {{for a long time}} suffered human-wildlife conflict. They had to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reality that God has endowed them with a great mountain and wildlife from which they can earn a living. They came together and formed the Gathiuru Community Forest Association which was aimed at conserving the two great natural resources as they make a living. To access the route tourists will have to pass through the Mt Kenya Royal Cottages for payment and facilitation. This is a lodge situated opposite the Nanyuki airstrip and has entered into a partnership with the association to help market the route for the locals so that the community benefits. The Gathiuru Route boasts of great fauna and flora, wildlife and great scenery.|$|E
500|$|Fight Club {{examines}} Generation X angst as '"the middle {{children of}} history". [...] Norton said, Fight Club examines the value conflicts of Generation X, {{as the first}} generation raised on television [...] "having its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture", including values such as one could achieve [...] "spiritual happiness through home furnishing", later to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> emptiness of this [...] "received value system." [...] Pitt said, [...] "Fight Club {{is a metaphor for}} the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so {{for the first time we}} can experience the pain." [...] Fight Club also parallels the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people that live in the system. The characters, having undergone societal emasculation, are reduced to [...] "a generation of spectators". A culture of advertising defines society's [...] "external signifiers of happiness", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references Gucci, Calvin Klein, and the Volkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, [...] "We smash it... because it seemed like the classic example of a Baby Boomer generation marketing plan that sold culture back to us." [...] His character also walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his many IKEA possessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, [...] "It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness." [...] Pitt explained the dissonance, [...] "I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guthrie was a {{prolific}} writer, penning {{thousands of pages}} of unpublished poems and prose, many written while living in New York City. After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography. Lomax thought Guthrie's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood. During this time Guthrie met Marjorie Mazia, a dancer in New York who would become his second wife. Mazia was an instructor at the prestigious Martha Graham Dance School, where she was assisting Sophie Maslow with her piece Folksay. Based on the folklore and poetry collected by Carl Sandburg, Folksay included the adaptation of some of Guthrie's Dust Bowl Ballads for the dance. Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography. The end product, Bound for Glory, was completed with the patient editing assistance of Mazia and was first published by E.P. Dutton in 1943. It is vividly told in the artist's down-home dialect, with the flair and imagery of a true storyteller. Library Journal complained about the [...] "too careful reproduction of illiterate speech." [...] But Clifton Fadiman, reviewing the book in the New York Times, paid the author a fine tribute: [...] "Someday people are going to <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that Woody Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the strings of his music box are a national possession, like Yellowstone and Yosemite, and part of the best stuff this country has to show the world." [...] A film adaptation of Bound for Glory was released in 1976.|$|E

6000|$|... 'But, my dear father, you {{can hardly}} tell how {{difficult}} I find it to be, amidst all the multiplicity of works, a man of devotional prayerful habits; how I find {{from time to time}} that I <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that while I am doing more than I did in old times, yet that I pray less. How often I think that [...] "God gives" [...] habitually to the Bishop [...] "all that sail with him;" [...] that the work is prospering in his hands; but will it prosper in mine? I know He can use any instrument to His glory: I know that, and that He will not let my sins and shortcomings hinder His projects of love and blessing to these Melanesian islanders; but as far as purity of motive, and a spirit of prayer and self-denial do go for anything in making up the qualification on the human side for such an office--in so far, do they exist in me? You will say I am over sensitive and expect too much. That, I think, very likely may be true. It is useless to wait till one becomes really fit, for that of course I never shall be. But while I believe most entirely that grace does now supply all our deficiencies when we seek it fully, I do feel frightened when I see that I do not become more prayerful, more real in communion with God. This is what I must pray for earnestly: to become more prayerful, more constantly impressed with the necessity of seeking for everything from Him.|$|E
6000|$|There is, however, a {{thing that}} was once done in schools as a {{convenient}} accomplishment, and which has--with that increase in communication which is the salient material fact of the nineteenth century--developed in Western Europe to the dimensions of a political necessity, {{and that is the}} teaching of one or more modern foreign languages. The language-teaching of all previous periods has been done with a view to culture, artistic, {{as in the case of}} Elizabethan Italian, or intellectual as with English Latin. But the language- teaching of to-day is deliberately, almost conscientiously, not for culture. It would, I am sure, be a very painful and shocking thought indeed to an English parent to think that French was taught in school with a view to reading French books. It is taught as a vulgar necessity for purposes of vulgar communication. The stirring together of the populations that is going on, the fashion and facilities for travel, the production of the radii from the trading foci, are rapidly making a commonplace knowledge of French, German, and Italian a necessity to the merchant and tradesman, and the ever more extensive travelling class. So that so far as Europe goes, one may very well regard this modern modern-language teaching as--with the modern mathematics--an extension of the trivium, of the apparatus, that is, of thought and expression. [Footnote: In the United States there is less sense of urgency about modern languages, but sooner or later the American may <b>wake</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> need of Spanish in his educational schemes.] It is an extension and a very doubtful improvement. It is a modern necessity, a rather irksome necessity, of little or no essential educational value, an unavoidable duty the school will have to perform. [Footnote: In one way the foreign language may be made educationally very useful, and that is as an exercise in writing translations into good English.] ...|$|E
