50|$|Between 1894 and 1906 {{the village}} was {{connected}} with the world by a railroad linking Bielsk Podlaski and Siedlce with Wołkowysk. Hajnówka became a minor transport junction and in 1900 a road was built between Białowieża and Bielsk Podlaski. During World War I, in 1915, the area was captured by Kaiser Germany. Protection of the forest was ceased. The new authorities started large-scale industrial exploitation of the area's nature resources. Because of its nodal position, Hajnówka became a seat of two lumber-mills, <b>wood</b> <b>spirit</b> distillery and a major train station for 90 km of narrow gauge railways were built across the forest.|$|E

5000|$|The modern {{process of}} {{carbonizing}} wood, either in small pieces or as sawdust in cast iron retorts, is extensively practiced where wood is scarce, {{and also for}} the recovery of valuable byproducts (<b>wood</b> <b>spirit,</b> pyroligneous acid, wood tar), which the process permits. The question of {{the temperature of the}} carbonization is important; according to J. Percy, wood becomes brown at 220 °C (428 °F), a deep brown-black after some time at 280 °C (536 °F), and an easily powdered mass at 310 °C (590 °F). [...] Charcoal made at 300 °C (572 °F) is brown, soft and friable, and readily inflames at 380 °C (716 °F); made at higher temperatures it is hard and brittle, and does not fire until heated to about 700 °C (1,292 °F).|$|E
40|$|The HSE {{have issued}} {{a public health}} alert {{about the danger of}} {{consumption}} of fake or counterfeit alcohol. This follows the hospitalisation of a patient with methanol poisoning. It is understood that the patient, who is seriously ill in a Dublin hospital, drank liquid from a vodka bottle which was bought from an unrecognised vendor in the Ballymun area. It is thought that the vodka bottle had been re-filled with methanol, which is highly toxic. The Gardaí in Ballymun and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland are investigating the incident. The HSE is issuing the following advice to the public: •	Only buy alcohol from a recognised shop, off-license or licensed premises. •	If you bought alcohol from an unrecognised seller, do not drink it. Hand the bottle in to your local garda station to help in the investigation of this incident. •	If you recently drank alcohol from a bottle bought on the street and are concerned about symptoms, seek urgent medical advice. Methanol is highly toxic. Consumption of methanol can cause kidney failure, blindness and death. Methanol is contained in solvents, anti-freeze and windscreen wash. It is also called methyl alcohol, carbinol, wood alcohol or <b>wood</b> <b>spirit.</b> People who drink methanol may initially have symptoms of loss of balance, staggering, slurred speech and eye tremor. There may be a gap of 12 - 24 hours before symptoms of methanol poisoning develop. These can include headache, confusion, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and rapid breathing. In severe cases, convulsions and coma can develop...|$|E
25|$|Methanol (also {{known as}} methyl alcohol, carbinol, wood alcohol, wood naphtha or <b>wood</b> <b>spirits)</b> is a {{chemical}} compound with chemical formula CH3OH.

At room temperature, it is a polar solvent and is used as an antifreeze, solvent, fuel, and as a denaturant for ethyl alcohol.

He listened intently. There was a faint rustling of the few leaves left upon the oaks.

40|$|The Chronicles of Narnia has an {{established}} {{position in the}} canon of children’s literature. However, what on the surface is a fairy tale involving adventures and magic; with children, kings, talking beasts, and <b>wood</b> <b>spirits</b> as main protagonists; is, in fact, a set of stories deeply rooted in Christian and chivalric traditions, containing elements of beast fable and morality tale. The story, according to Madeline L’Engle, depending on the reader's cultural knowledge and experience, may be understood on various levels, from the literal one of an adventure story for children, through the moral and allegorical levels, eventually reaching the anagogical level. While reading The Chronicles, one is able to notice various references to other written works, interwoven into the text, with the Bible, chivalric romances and beast fables being the most prominent sources of intertextual allusions. In The Last Battle Lewis attempts to answer John Donne’s question, “What if this present were the world’s last night?"

5000|$|Various {{practitioners}} of the contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca have drawn upon folklore involving the Wild Hunt to inspire their own rites. In their context, {{the leader of the}} Wild Hunt is the goddess Hecate. [...] The anthropologist Susan Greenwood provided an account of one such Wild Hunt ritual performed by a modern Pagan group in Norfolk during the late 1990s, stating that they used this mythology [...] "as a means of confronting the dark of nature as a process of initiation." [...] Referred to as the [...] "Wild Hunt Challenge" [...] by those running it, it took place on Halloween and involved participants walking around a local area of woodland in the daytime, and then repeating that task as a timed competition at night, [...] "to gain mastery over an area of Gwyn ap Nudd's hunting ground". If completed successfully, it was held that the participant had gained the trust of the <b>wood's</b> <b>spirits,</b> and they would be permitted to cut timber from its trees with which to make a staff. The anthropologist Rachel Morgain reported a [...] "ritual recreation" [...] of the Wild Hunt among the Reclaiming tradition of Wicca in San Francisco.|$|R

The Kijimuna festivalin Okinawa is named after them. Another name for the kijumuna is [...] "bungaya," [...] which means roughly [...] "Large-Headed." [...] The Kijimuna are known to be very mischievous, playing pranks and tricking humans. One of their most well known tricks is to lie upon a person's chest, making them unable to move or breathe. This is known as [...] "kanashibari." [...] Even though the Kijimuna are tricksters, they have been known to make friends with humans. However, these relationships often go sour. A kijimuna may offer to carry a human on its back as it leaps through the mountains and over the seas.

60|$|Eub.--No {{one can be}} more {{convinced}} than I am of the very limited extent of our knowledge in chemical physiology, and when I say that, having been a disciple and friend of Dr. Black, I am still disposed to prefer his ancient view to your new one, I wish merely to induce you to pause and to hear my reasons; they may appear insufficient to you, but I am anxious to explain them. First, then, in all known chemical changes in which oxygen gas is absorbed and carbonic acid gas formed, heat is produced. I could mention a thousand instances, from the combustion of <b>wood</b> or <b>spirits</b> of wine to the fermentation of fruit or the putrefaction of animal matter. This general fact, which may be almost called a law, is in favour of the view of Dr. Black. Another circumstance in favour of it is, that those animals which possess the highest temperature consume the greatest quantity of air, and, under different circumstances of action and repose, the heat is in great measure proportional to the quantity of oxygen consumed. Then those animals which absorb the smallest quantity of air are cold-blooded. Another argument in favour of Dr. Black's opinion is the change of colour of blood from black to red, which seems {{to show that it}} loses carbon.|$|R

50|$|The major {{producers}} of masks are the Léla, Nunuma, and Winiama in the north, and the Nuna in the south. The Sisala also once used masks, {{but they have}} virtually disappeared. The Léla, Nunuma, Winiama and Nuna have influenced the styles, use and meaning of masks among their Bwa and Mossi neighbors. Masks carved of <b>wood</b> represent bush <b>spirits,</b> or spirits that take animal forms. These animal forms may be more naturalistic among the Nunuma and Nuna or more stylized among the Léla and Winiama. The animals that occur most frequently are the antelope, buffalo, bush pig, hornbill, hyena, and the serpent. Some masks represent spirits that have no recognizable animal form. Whatever type is represented, masks have large round eyes surrounded by concentric circles, a short snout for animal masks, or a large, protuberant mouth for supernatural spirits. They are covered with geometric patterns painted red, white, and black, repainted every year, except among the Winiama. Some masks are surmounted by a tall plank.|$|R
