5|$|Headquartered at the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma, the Storm Prediction Center is {{tasked with}} {{forecasting}} {{the risk of}} severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in the contiguous United States. It issues convective outlooks, mesoscale discussions, and watches {{as a part of}} this process. Convective outlooks are issued for the following eight days (issued separately for Day1, Day2, Day3, and Days 4–8), and detail the risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes during the given forecast period, although tornado, hail and wind details are only available for Day 1. Days 2 and 3, as well as 4–8 use a probabilistic scale, determining the probability for a severe <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> in percentage categories.|$|E
5|$|Stan was {{associated}} with a large area of loosely organized but very heavy shower activity existing over Mexico and Central America during this time. Torrential rainfall in this area caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides which were responsible for at least 1,662 deaths in six countries; 1,500 of these casualties occurred in Guatemala alone. Initially, more than a thousand deaths were attributed to Hurricane Stan, but the National Hurricane Center postulates that all but less than 100 of the deaths were more related to the larger <b>weather</b> <b>event.</b> This was not definitively confirmed in the Tropical Cyclone Report for Hurricane Stan, though it is certain that only 80-100 deaths resulted from the direct effects of the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|In the Mid-Atlantic, the <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> {{broke the}} 24-hour {{rainfall}} record for September30 at several locations: the Norfolk, Baltimore–Washington, and Ronald Reagan Washington airports recorded 7.85in (199mm), 6.02in (153mm), and 4.66in (118mm) respectively. In Maryland, two buses collided amid the stormy weather, injuring 26of their passengers. With localized estimates {{of up to}} 8in (200mm), the state of New York experienced {{some of its most}} historic rainfall; an official total 4.24in (108mm) shattered the 24-hour record for any calendar day in Binghamtom. Flash floods throughout the state resulted in one drowning death and US$10,000 in damage. Considerable flooding also occurred in Vermont and Pennsylvania, with a 24-hour rainfall maximum of 10.5in (265mm) in Moscow. Farther north, the remnant low enhanced a pressure gradient over southern New England, generating strong winds that knocked out the power in Litchfield County. Rainfall there additionally caused minor flooding. In Quebec, torrents following 3.5in (90mm) of rainfall inundated basements and caused two drownings. Despite the deaths and damage, the rains lightened prolonged drought conditions in those regions.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center(SPC) {{began to}} note the {{possibility}} that a severe <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> could develop on December30 as early as December25, 2010. Nonetheless, the predictability of the event was too low as the event was several days out. As the anticipated event grew closer, confidence in the forecast slowly increased, though uncertainties in the timing and extent of the tornado outbreak still existed. These uncertainties remained through December29 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts. However, the SPC indicated that supercells and more severe weather could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from the forecast. In contrast, forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of severe weather for New Year's Eve; the SPC issued a slight risk outlook for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ozarks as a result.|$|E
5|$|The United States Storm Prediction Center first noted a {{possible}} New Year's Eve severe <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> {{as early as}} December25, 2010. These forecasts gained confidence as the event approached, {{with a focus on}} the Ozarks and adjacent areas. Supercells developed in this area during the night of December30 and tracked across central Missouri, producing several tornadoes and large hail. However, the bulk of activity during the outbreak was a result of a long line of supercells that tracked from Oklahoma to Illinois, producing five EF3tornadoes. One of these tracked through northwestern Arkansas, killing four. Another tore through eastern sections of Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, destroying 159homes and causing US$90million in damage, making it the costliest tornado of the outbreak. A separate cluster of storms later developed in Louisiana before tracking into Mississippi, producing several tornadoes across southern and central regions of the state on January1.|$|E
40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{long-term}} effects of climate change, the frequency and severity of extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> have been increasing. Given the risks posed by climate change, particularly the changes in extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events,</b> {{the question of how to}} adapt to these changes and mitigate their negative impacts has received great attention from policy makers. The overall goals of this study are to examine whether farmers adapt to extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> through crop diversification and which factors influence farmers' decisions on crop diversification against extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> in China. To limit the scope of this study, we focus on drought and flood events only. Based on a unique large-scale household survey in nine provinces, this study finds that farmers respond to extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> by increasing crop diversification. Their decision to diversify crops is significantly influenced by their experiences of extreme <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> in the previous year. Such results are understandable because farmers' behaviors are normally based on their expectations. Moreover, household characteristics also affect farmers' decisions on crop diversification strategy, and their effects differ by farmers' age and gender. This paper concludes with several policy implications...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project was to asses if <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> in the UK {{have an impact on}} the share prices of energy companies in the stock market, in order to advise investors on when to buy and sell shares in the industry. This was done by analysing the previous share prices of energy companies before and after the announcements of <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> which took place in the past. The differences in share prices before and after the announcements were then examined in order to determine if these <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> had an impact on share prices in the past; and to identify how the effects of different types of <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> differed. Existing literature suggested that <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> did {{have an impact on the}} share prices of energy companies. However, it also revealed that energy company share prices are impacted by a number of factors, which would have made the results somewhat limited. Some of these limitations were minimalised. Comparing the behaviour of energy company share prices with those of the market in general for example, helped to show whether share price behaviour was specific to the energy industry or not. The main findings of the research project were that, in accordance with the literature, <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> do have an impact on energy company share prices. It was discovered that snowy <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> caused the most positive effects on share prices, and hot <b>weather</b> <b>events</b> caused the biggest decreases in share prices. These results allowed the researcher to provide recommendations to investors on when the best times to invest into the energy industry are, and when the best times to sell shares in the industry are, in relation to <b>weather</b> <b>events.</b> The results suggest that times of snowy weather seem to be the most beneficial times for investors to sell their shares, as this is when they increase most significantly. In contrast, times of hot weather and heavy rainfall/flooding seem to be the ideal times to invest, as prices tend to drop...|$|R

5|$|The analog {{technique}} {{is a complex}} way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous <b>weather</b> <b>event</b> {{that is expected to}} be mimicked by an upcoming event. What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future. Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar {{technique is}} used in medium range forecasting, which is known as teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime. An example of teleconnections are by using El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related phenomena.|$|E
5|$|On November14, the National Weather Service {{issued a}} slight risk of severe weather {{for the early}} hours of November15 for the Carolinas and {{northern}} Gulf coast. Although conditions were not favorable for a large-scale severe <b>weather</b> <b>event,</b> the possibility of small clusters of thunderstorms existed. Strong wind shear was forecast to persist, which would allow small bow-echo line of thunderstorms which could produce damaging winds. The result of a weak disturbance which passed through the area of slight risk lowered the chances of tornadic thunderstorms developing. At 12:25a.m. EST, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) issued a Tornado watch for most of eastern North Carolina. A broken line of thunderstorms had already developed and the risk of tornadoes greatly increased, with the chances of an EF2 or stronger touching down reaching 20%. The first tornado touched down shortly after in South Carolina. Over the following several hours, two supercell thunderstorms spawned seven more tornadoes throughout North Carolina. The final tornado dissipated around 4:36a.m. EST, just 3 hours and 46 minutes after the outbreak started. The tornado watch remained in effect until before being cancelled at 8:00a.m. EST.|$|E
