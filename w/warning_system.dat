40|$|Community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> involve {{community}} driven {{collection and}} analysis of information that enable warning messages to help a community to react to a hazard and reduce the resulting loss or harm. Most early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are designed at the national or global level. Local communities’ capacity to predict weather conditions using indigenous knowledge has been demonstrated in studies focusing on climate change and agriculture in some African countries. This review was motivated by successes made in non-disease specific community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{with a view to}} identify opportunities for developing similar systems for malaria. This article reviewed the existing community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> documented in literature. The types of disasters that are addressed by these systems and the methodologies utilised {{in the development of the}} systems were identified. The review showed that most of the documented community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> focus on natural disasters such as floods, drought, and landslides. Community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for human diseases are very few, even though such systems exist at national and regional and global levels. There is a clear gap in terms of community-based malaria early <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> The methodologies for the development of the community-based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> reviewed mainly derive from the four elements of early warning systems; namely risk knowledge, monitoring, warning communication and response capability. The review indicated the need for the development of community based early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for human diseases. Keywords: community; early warning; disaster; hazards</p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a non-exhausting overview of early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for emerging foodborne hazards that are {{operating in the}} various places in the world. Special attention is given to endpoint-focussed early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e. ECDC, ISIS and GPHIN) and hazard-focussed early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> (i. e. FVO, RASFF and OIE) and their merit to successfully identify a food safety problem in an early stage is discussed. Besides these early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{which are based on}} monitoring of either disease symptoms or hazards, also early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> and/or activities that intend to predict the occurrence of a food safety hazard in its very beginning of development or before that are described. Examples are trend analysis, horizon scanning, early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> for mycotoxins in maize and/or wheat and information exchange networks (e. g. OIE and GIEWS). Furthermore, recent initiatives that aim to develop predictive early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> based on the holistic principle are discussed. The assumption of the researchers applying this principle is that developments outside the food production chain that are either directly or indirectly related {{to the development of a}} particular food safety hazard may also provide valuable information to predict the development of this hazard...|$|R

40|$|Collision <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{work on the}} {{information}} provided by different sensors. Among many factors that can affect the performance of collision <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> the effect of sensor errors is investigated. Errors in direct measurements and derivatives are analysed based on typical sensor configurations of collision <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> which include a laser speedometer, a Radar/Lidar. Empirical sensor outputs under real traffic situations are used in deriving distributions of measurement errors. The uncertainties of collision warning criteria are then examined based on empirically derived sensor errors for three collision warning algorithms, the Honda, Mazda and NHTSA algorithm. It is found that under some problematic traffic situations and for certain algorithms, the sensor errors could significantly affect the performance of collision <b>warning</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5|$|A lack of {{knowledge}} about the capability of radar to create an effective centralized early <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> also contributed to the over-reliance on the self-defense capabilities of bombers. However Hansell also argued that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in making doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly, inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential {{to the creation of the}} United States Air Force.|$|E
40|$|Heatwaves are {{associated}} with significant health risks particularly among vulnerable groups. To minimize these risks, heat <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> have been implemented. The question therefore is how effective these systems are in saving lives and reducing heat-related harm. We systematically searched and reviewed 15 studies which examined this. Six studies asserted that fewer people died of excessive heat after the implementation of heat <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> Demand for ambulance decreased following the implementation of these systems. One study also estimated the costs of running heat <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> at US$ 210, 000 compared to the US$ 468 million benefits of saving 117 lives. The remaining eight studies investigated people?s response to heat <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> and taking appropriate actions against heat harms. Perceived threat of heat dangers emerged as the main factor related to heeding the warnings and taking proper actions. However, barriers, such as costs of running air-conditioners, were of significant concern, particularly to the poor. The weight of {{the evidence suggests that}} heat <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are effective in reducing mortality and, potentially, morbidity. However, their effectiveness may be mediated by cognitive, emotive and socio-demographic characteristics. More research is urgently required into the cost-effectiveness of heat <b>warning</b> <b>systems?</b> measures and improving the utilization of the services...|$|R

Main battery fire control radars were the British Types 284 and 285 while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by the Type 282 radar. Soviet-designed Yupiter-1 and Mars-1 gunnery radars were fitted in Molotov and Kalinin by 1944.|$|E

50|$|As of 2016, Japan and Taiwan are two {{countries}} with comprehensive nationwide earthquake early <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> Other countries and regions have limited deployment of earthquake <b>warning</b> <b>systems,</b> including Mexico (the Mexican Seismic Alert System covers areas {{of central and}} southern Mexico including Mexico City and OAxaca), limited regions of Romania (the Basarab bridge in Bucharest) {{and parts of the}} United States. The earliest automated earthquake pre-detection systems were installed in the 1990s; for instance, in California, the Calistoga fire station's system which can automatically trigger a citywide siren to alert the entire area's residents. Some California fire departments use their <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> to automatically open overhead doors of fire stations before the earthquake can disable them. While many of these efforts are governmental, several private companies also manufacture earthquake early <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> to protect infrastructure such as elevators, gas lines and fire stations.|$|R

Recently the Supernova Early <b>Warning</b> <b>System</b> (SNEWS) project has begun using a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy. Neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova, and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} use of superheating on other Drummond classes, Robert Urie experimentally fitted a superheated boiler to No.126 in December 1920, {{together with an}} extended smokebox and larger cylinders. The additional weight of the new boiler raised the centre of gravity of the locomotive, thereby adding to problems of instability on faster main line trains, whilst simultaneously preventing its use on many branch lines. As a result, no further examples were fitted, and No.126 was eventually broken up for spare parts in 1937. In 1931 No. 672 was experimentally fitted with the Strowger-Hudd Automatic <b>Warning</b> <b>System,</b> but the equipment was not adopted by the Southern Railway and the equipment later removed.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic <b>Warning</b> <b>System</b> (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} animal {{detection}} and animal <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> {{is to prevent}} or {{reduce the number of}} animal-vehicle collisions. These systems are specifi cally aimed at large animals (e. g., ungulates) that can cause human death, injury and property damage. Animal detection systems detect large animals before they enter the road and then warn drivers that a large animal is on or near the road at that time. Animal <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> detect vehicles and then warn the animals through a variety of audio and visual signals. This paper lists all animal detection and animal <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> known to the authors in September 2003. We identifi ed 27 locations where systems are or have been in place in North America and Europe. In addition, we identifi ed 20 sites for which an animal detection or animal <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> are planned. We described the main characteristics of the systems and reviewed them with respect to operation and maintenance. We conclude that animal detection and animal <b>warning</b> <b>systems</b> have the potential to be an effective mitigation tool.
