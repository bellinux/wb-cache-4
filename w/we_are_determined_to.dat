2500|$|Abigail Adams {{wrote about}} the {{troubles}} and concerns she had as an eighteenth-century woman and she was an advocate of married women's property rights, more opportunities for women, particularly {{in the field of}} education. Women, she believed, should not submit to laws not made in their interest, nor should they be content with the simple role of being companions to their husbands. They should educate themselves and thus be recognized for their intellectual capabilities, so they could guide and influence the lives of their children and husbands. She is known for her March, 1776 letter to John and the Continental Congress, requesting that they, [...] "remember the ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power {{into the hands of the}} Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could.

2500|$|Throughout the war, the Confederacy sent armies out of Virginia {{through the}} Shenandoah Valley to invade Maryland and Pennsylvania and {{threaten}} Washington, D.C. Lt. Gen. Jubal Early, {{following the same}} pattern in the Valley Campaigns of 1864, and hoping to distract Grant from the Siege of Petersburg, attacked Union forces near Washington and raided several towns in Pennsylvania. Grant, reacting to the political commotion caused by the invasion, organized the Middle Military Division, whose field troops were known as the Army of the Shenandoah. He considered various candidates for command, including George Meade, William B. Franklin, and David Hunter, with the latter two intended for the military division while Sheridan would command the army. All of these choices were rejected by either Grant or the War Department and, over the objection of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who believed him to be too young for such a high post, Sheridan took command in both roles at Harpers Ferry on August 7, 1864. His mission was not only to defeat Early's army and to close off the Northern invasion route, but to deny the Shenandoah Valley as a productive agricultural region to the Confederacy. Grant told Sheridan, [...] "The people should be informed that so long as an army can subsist among them recurrences of these raids must be expected, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> stop them at all hazards. ... Give the enemy no rest ... Do all the damage to railroads and crops you can. Carry off stock of all descriptions, and negroes, so as to prevent further planting. If the war is to last another year, we want the Shenandoah Valley to remain a barren waste." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early March 1935, talks {{intended}} {{to discuss the}} scale and extent of German rearmament in Berlin between Hitler and Simon were postponed when Hitler took offence at a British government White Paper that justified a higher defence budget under the grounds that Germany was violating the Versailles Treaty, and {{he claimed to have}} contracted a [...] "cold". In the interval between Hitler [...] "recovering" [...] and Simon's visit, the German government took the chance for formally rejecting all the clauses of Versailles relating to disarmament on the land and air. In the 1930s, the British government was obsessed {{with the idea of a}} German bombing attack destroying London and so placed a great deal of value on reaching an air pact outlawing bombing. The idea of a naval agreement was felt to be a useful stepping stone to an air pact. On 26 March 1935, during one of his meetings with Simon, and his deputy Anthony Eden, Hitler stated his intention to reject the naval disarmament section of Versailles but was prepared to discuss a treaty regulating the scale of German naval rearmament. On 21 May 1935, Hitler in a speech in Berlin formally offered to discuss a treaty offering a German Navy that was to operate forever on a 35:100 naval ratio. During his [...] "peace speech" [...] of 21 May, Hitler disavowed any intention of engaging in a pre-1914 style naval race with Britain, and he stated: [...] "The German Reich government recognises of itself the overwhelming importance for existence and thereby the justification of dominance at sea to protect the British Empire, just as, on the other hand, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> do everything necessary in protection of our own continental existence and freedom". For Hitler, his speech illustrated the quid pro quo of an Anglo-German alliance, British acceptance of German mastery of Continental Europe in exchange for German acceptance of British mastery over the seas.|$|E
