500|$|The song {{opens with}} three pick up beats as André 3000 counts [...] "one, two, three, oh" [...] and then leads {{into the first}} verse. The lyrics begin to {{describe}} the protagonist's concerns and doubts about a romantic relationship. He wonders if they are staying together just [...] "for tradition", as in the lines [...] "But does she really wanna [...] / But can't stand to see me / <b>Walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door?" [...] André 3000 commented, [...] "I think it's more important to be happy than to meet up to...the world's expectations of what a relationship should be. So this is a celebration of how men and women {{relate to each other}} in the 2000s". The song then leads into the chorus, which consists of the line [...] "Hey ya!" [...] repeated eight times, accompanied by a synthesizer performing the bassline.|$|E
500|$|Recorded in Monument's Nashville {{studios in}} early 1963, [...] "In Dreams" [...] peaked at number 7 on Billboard Hot 100 and spent 13 {{weeks on the}} charts in the U.S. During the five months the song was on the charts, Orbison {{replaced}} guitarist Duane Eddy {{on a tour of}} England. He was immensely popular in England, and shared billing with the Beatles, of whom he had never heard. English and Scottish promoters were wary of Orbison as a draw; he was not conventionally attractive or animated while performing, and they wondered if audiences would <b>walk</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> tour sold out in one afternoon, however. Orbison's first meeting with John Lennon was awkward because Orbison was overwhelmed with the amount of advertising devoted to the Beatles when it was he who was supposed to headline the show. Beatlemania, however, was taking hold and Orbison accepted that he was not quite the main draw, so he decided to go first on stage. On opening night, the audience reacted intensely toward Orbison's ballads, as he finished with [...] "In Dreams". Philip Norman, a Beatles biographer, later wrote [...] "As Orbison performed, chinless and tragic, the Beatles stood in the wings, wondering how they would dare to follow him". After demanding Orbison play for double the time he was scheduled, the audience then screamed for a fifteenth encore, which Lennon and Paul McCartney refused to allow by holding Orbison back from re-entering the stage.|$|E

2500|$|Paul's views {{went against}} the {{thoughts}} of the Greek philosophers to whom a bodily resurrection meant a new imprisonment in a corporeal body, which was {{what they wanted to}} avoid—given that for them the corporeal and the material fettered the spirit. At the same time, Paul believed that the newly resurrected body would be a heavenly body; immortal, glorified, powerful and spiritual in contrast to an earthly body, which is mortal, dishonored, weak and natural. According to theologian Peter Carnley, the resurrection of Jesus was different from the Resurrection of Lazarus as: [...] "In the case of Lazarus, the stone was rolled away so that he could <b>walk</b> <b>out...</b> <b>the</b> raised Christ didn't have to have the stone rolled away, because he is transformed and can appear anywhere, at any time".|$|E
2500|$|Her songs {{have been}} {{described}} as [...] "some of the most deeply personal and emotionally naked ... of our times". In a 2003 interview, she said: [...] "My songs aren't about me at all. They're always about love, the pain and anguish of it. But the way I've always written is from observation. They're about what I see other people going through. If the songs were about me I'd be so embarrassed I don't think I'd be able to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> front door." [...] She went on to say: [...] "the optimistic songs reveal a bit more of me because that's how I feel. I'm definitely a 'glass is half full' kind of a person." [...] Many of her lyrics do not specify the gender of their subjects and she frequently uses the word [...] "you" [...] rather than a gender pronoun.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to that, Lee {{noted that the}} song was also inspired by other events in her life, including people who she was collaborating with, [...] "holding me down and manipulating me and betraying me", eventually leading her {{to make the decision}} of [...] "put my foot down and <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door". During a 2011 interview with Spin magazine, Lee described [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] as [...] "mostly a chick anthem: 'You only want me when you're drunk. You only want me because I'm not there'" [...] and deemed it empowering for her female audience of listeners due to the response she had received from them. In retrospect, Lee mentioned in 2016, [...] "I love this song because it has this fun spirit that was new for us as a band. You can still be heavy with a smile on your face." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dale Martin {{contends that}} Paul's various {{disagreements}} with the Corinthians {{were the result}} of a fundamental conflict over the ideological construction of the human body (and hence the church as the body of Christ). According to Martin, most Corinthian Christians and Paul himself saw the body as an entity that could be permeated by different pollutions. Other members of the Corinthian church, however, viewed the body as hierarchical—as a microcosm of the universe—and were not particularly concerned about body boundaries. These differing views of the human body (and also of the church as the body of Christ) led to differing opinions on a variety of subjects—including the resurrection of the body. According to theologian Peter Carnley, the resurrection of Jesus was different from the Resurrection of Lazarus as: [...] "In the case of Lazarus, the stone was rolled away so that he could <b>walk</b> <b>out....</b> <b>the</b> raised Christ didn't have to have the stone rolled away, because he is transformed and can appear anywhere, at any time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Top-ranked LSU {{defeated}} sixth-ranked, rival Ole Miss, 14–0 {{in a game}} {{dominated by}} defense and penalties. 68,000 fans packed Tiger Stadium to watch the Tigers win their first game against the Rebels since 1950. Ole Miss was LSU's most bitter rival at the time, and fans who heard and read about the Chinese Bandits and Billy Cannon wanted to see them first-hand. [...] "It's not a rivalry because somebody says it is," [...] said Cannon, [...] "or because you've been playing against a team for a long time. It's a rivalry when two good teams meet and either one could <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> winner. This was a rivalry." [...] Banners were strung around the LSU campus with the words [...] "Go to Hell, Ole Miss." [...] Later, a plane dropped leaflets on campus that read [...] "Go to Hell, LSU." [...] Some thought Dietzel was responsible, hoping to fire up his team for the game, but he denied responsibility.|$|E

2500|$|Although it {{was later}} {{revealed}} that Butler had recommended Chris Thomas as their producer. Thomas was more experienced and had previously worked with punk rock bands The Pretenders and the Sex Pistols; however Suede's label Nude Records dismissed the idea, saying he was too expensive. Nude's owner Saul Galpern claimed that the guitarist became impossible to reason with and also made threats to him and Buller. Buller claims he received phone calls where he heard something akin to scratching knives. Butler issued the band and their management an ultimatum: either they sacked Buller, or he would <b>walk</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> rest of the band refused to comply with Butler's demands and decided to let him walk out before the record was finished. Butler insisted he was kicked out the band, as he turned up to the studio one day to find he was not allowed in. He went {{back the next day}} to pick up his guitar and was told through the intercom that his guitar would be left in the street for him. Suede's manager Charlie Charlton made a final attempt to reach consensus between the two parties, however during a tense phone conversation the final words Butler uttered to Anderson were along the lines of [...] "you're a fucking cunt." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 1904, 18,000 {{members of}} the Amalgamated Meat Cutters working in the meatpacking {{industry}} in Chicago walked off the job to win higher wages. The contract for the packinghouse drivers belonging to the Teamsters union had expired on June 1, 1904, and the ongoing strike by the butcher workmen led the drivers to fear for their own contract talks. On July 25, 1904, the packinghouse drivers asked the international Teamsters union to sanction a strike. On July 26, Shea agreed to let them <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> next day, declaring that the walkout was not a sympathy strike but [...] "It is, therefore, to protect ourselves" [...] and prevent the packers from breaking the union. The meatpackers, however, brought in several thousand African American strikebreakers. With meatpacking plants operating at about 40 percent of capacity, the strike began to falter. On August 8, Shea ordered the ice wagon and market drivers to strike {{in support of the}} butcher workmen. The hope was that, with no refrigeration and delivery slowed, the meat would spoil and the packers would be forced to come to the bargaining table. On the afternoon of August 9, riots occurred throughout the afternoon and evening in Chicago, and a number of strikers and strikebreakers were assaulted or wounded by gunfire.|$|E

60|$|Here Dennis left me, {{saying it}} was time to go and <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> children; and I think his story has matter of some {{wholesome}} reflection in it for bachelors who are about to change their condition, or may console some who are mourning their celibacy. Marry, gentlemen, if you like; leave your comfortable dinner at the club for cold-mutton and curl-papers at your home; give up your books or pleasures, and take to yourselves wives and children; but think well on what you do first, as I have no doubt you will after this advice and example. Advice is always useful in matters of love; men always take it; they always follow other people's opinions, not their own: they always profit by example. When they see a pretty woman, and feel the delicious madness of love coming over them, they always stop to calculate her temper, her money, their own money, or suitableness for the married life.... Ha, ha, ha! Let us fool in this way no more. I have been in love forty-three times with all ranks and conditions of women, and would have married every time if they would have let me. How many wives had King Solomon, the wisest of men? And is not that story a warning to us that Love is master of the wisest? It is only fools who defy him.|$|E

6000|$|We don garment after garment, {{as if we}} grew like {{exogenous}} {{plants by}} addition without.

I believe that all races at some seasons wear something equivalent to the shirt.
