25|$|Baquedano <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> out {{the troops}} situation, and moved {{dangerously close to}} the front line. Apparently, Peruvian {{soldiers}} fired upon Baquedano, and their shots were answered by the Chileans. In shot time, the cross fire became general, and the battle started unexpectedly at 14:00 hrs., catching both sides unprepared. However, the Chilean right was attacked by Cáceres' Corps. The Chilean battleships began to fire upon the Peruvians trying to ease the pressure. Cáceres saw the chance to destroy Lagos' division and sent the Guardia Chalaca and Guarnición de Marina battalions against Barceló, while a fraction of Col. Suárez' Corps engaged Urriola, who wasn't formed yet. The strength of the attack forced the Chileans to retreat. At this time, Lynch wasn't yet in position, so the cavalry and the artillery withdrew from the front line.|$|E

2500|$|Goddard and {{his team}} had already been in Annapolis a month and had tested his constant-thrust JATO engine when he {{received}} a Navy telegram, forwarded from Roswell, ordering him to Annapolis. Lt. Fischer asked for a crash effort. By August his engine was producing 800lbs of thrust for 20 seconds, and Fischer was anxious to try it on a PBY. On the sixth test run, with all bugs worked out, the PBY, piloted by Fischer, was pushed into the air from the Severn River. Fischer landed and prepared to launch again. Goddard had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> the unit, but radio contact with the PBY had been lost. On the seventh try the engine caught fire. The plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted. Because Goddard had installed a safety feature {{at the last minute}} there was no explosion and no lives were lost. The problem's cause was traced to hasty installation and rough handling. Cheaper, safer solid fuel JATO engines were eventually selected by the armed forces. An engineer later said, [...] "Putting [...] rocket on a seaplane was like hitching an eagle to a plow." ...|$|E
