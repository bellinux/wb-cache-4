5|$|When the {{reconstruction}} of Denmark's capital was begun a number of changes were introduced. A commission was appointed to regulate the streets. After surveyings among the ruins this commission submitted a suggestion to create 12 to 15-metre wide main streets with 10-metre <b>wide</b> <b>side</b> streets {{with none of the}} surrounding houses being half-timbered.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Islander {{was designed}} {{with an emphasis}} upon providing ease of access within the short haul sector to remote locations as a safe, efficient, and profitable transport aircraft. It has been regularly used by such operators, including the frequent use of unprepared rough airstrips and from challenging terrain; the Islander being capable of short takeoff and landing (STOL) operations. The low load height and <b>wide</b> <b>side</b> doors provide for easy access for passenger and cargo operations, while the aircraft's ability to maintain a high takeoff frequency {{has led to the}} type's use for parachuting. For operating within noise-sensitive environments, silencers can be equipped on both the aircraft's engine and propellers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to passenger cars, interurban companies acquired freight locomotives and line maintenance equipment. [...] A [...] "box motor" [...] was a powered car exclusive for freight {{that looked like}} a passenger interurban without windows and had <b>wide</b> <b>side</b> doors for loading freight. A freight motor was geared for power rather than speed and could pull up to six freight cars depending upon the load and grades. Freight cars for interurbans tended to be smaller than those for steam railroads, and they had to have special extended couplers to prevent car corner contact at the very tight grinding turns at city street corners. Maintenance equipment included [...] "line cars" [...] with roof platforms for the trolley wire repair crew, snow plows and snow sweepers with rotating brushes, a car for weed control and to maintain track and ballast. In order to save money, many companies constructed these in their shops using retired or semi-wrecked passenger cars for the frame and the traction motor mounted trucks.|$|E

2500|$|The design {{evolved from}} earlier straight-stemmed, long-keel boats into a beamy shallow hull with a {{pronounced}} reverse {{curve in the}} midship section and a cut away forefoot. The square tuck stern changed into an immersed elliptical counter, either by evolution or adoption of the Southport form, the change being complete before 1880. All of the boats had <b>wide</b> <b>side</b> decks and a long cockpit, {{about a third of}} the beam in width, with low freeboard and a low rail to facilitate lifting the gear on board. These shrimp boats, about , were fast and handy in the shallow waters of Morecambe Bay. The larger boats were called “prawners”, though they were actually used to catch pink shrimps (Pandalus montagui). In addition to the larger prawner (called [...] "sprawner" [...] at Morecambe) a subtype called [...] "bay boat" [...] developed for the holiday trade. The bay boat had a shallow draft so it could operate around Grange-over-Sands at the head of Morecambe Bay.|$|E
2500|$|The V-280 is {{reported}} to be designed for a cruising speed of [...] (hence the name V-280), a top speed of , a range of , and an effective combat range of [...] Expected maximum takeoff weight is around 30,000 lb. In one major difference from the earlier V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, the engines remain in place while the rotors and drive shafts tilt. A driveshaft runs through the straight wing, allowing both prop rotors to be driven by a single engine in the event of engine loss. The V-280 will have retractable landing gear, a triple-redundant fly by wire control system, and a V-tail configuration. The wings are made of a single section of Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite, reducing weight and production costs. The V-280 will have a crew of 4 and be capable of transporting up to 14 troops. Dual cargo hooks will give it a lift capacity to carry a [...] M777A2 Howitzer while flying at a speed of [...] The fuselage is visually {{similar to that of the}} UH-60 Black Hawk medium lift helicopter. When landed, the wing is in excess of seven feet from the ground, allowing soldiers to egress easily out of two [...] <b>wide</b> <b>side</b> doors and door gunners to have wide fields of fire. Although the initial design is a utility configuration, Bell is also working on an attack configuration. Whether different variants of the V-280 would fill utility and attack roles or a single airframe could interchange payloads for either mission, Bell is confident the Valor tiltrotor platform can fulfill both duties; the U.S. Marine Corps is interested in having one aircraft to replace utility and attack helicopters, but the Army, which leads the program, is not committed to the idea and wants distinct platforms for each mission. [...] Bell and Lockheed claim an AV-280 variant can launch rockets, missiles, and even small unmanned aerial vehicles forward or aft with no rotor interference, even in forward flight and cruise modes with the rotors forward.|$|E
6000|$|Passing from a short cañon, {{the boats}} emerged into a valley with flat shores for some {{distance}} from the river. On the right was a <b>wide</b> <b>side</b> cañon, which might afford a passage up into the hills. Half a mile lower down there were trees and signs of cultivation; and a light smoke rose among them. At this, the first sign of human life they had seen since they took to the boats, all hands paddled rapidly. They were approaching the shore, when Leaping Horse said to Harry: [...] "No go close. Stop in river and see, perhaps bad Indians. Leaping Horse not like smoke." ...|$|E
50|$|Hesperoceras has a {{straight}}, orthoconic, shell with a subrectangular cross section. The sutures {{are straight}} and transverse {{on the narrow}} sides but form broad rounded lobes on the <b>wide</b> <b>sides,</b> and the siphuncle is small and central.|$|R
50|$|Aquesbi {{mentioned}} two synapomorphies, shared derived {{characteristics of}} Gravisauria: the vertebrae are <b>wider</b> <b>side</b> to side than {{front to rear}} and possession of asymmetrical condyles femoris {{at the bottom of}} the femur. Those were previously not thought to be Eusauropoda synapomorphies but Allian found these properties also on Tazoudasaurus.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{sheltered}} area, usually a clay hut or a cave, {{the foundation is}} dug in the ground filled and compacted. The shell is placed, <b>wider</b> <b>side</b> down, on top. A layer of clean smooth lime stone pebbles about 1" [...] in diameter is spread on top of foundation inside the shell to form a clean baking surface.|$|R

The monument is placed on a three-tiered, square stepped pedestal.|$|R
50|$|The top of {{the balloon}} usually has a vent of some sort, {{enabling}} the pilot to release hot air to slow an ascent, start a descent, or increase the rate of descent, usually for landing. Some hot air balloons have turning vents, which are side vents that, when opened, cause the balloon to rotate. Such vents are particularly useful for balloons with rectangular baskets, to facilitate aligning the <b>wider</b> <b>side</b> of the basket for landing.|$|R
50|$|The {{state flag}} of Chitral was {{triangular}} {{in shape and}} pale green in colour. The <b>wider</b> <b>side</b> of the pennant depicted a mountain, most likely the Terich Mir peak. In the later Katoor period, this flag served {{as a symbol of}} the Mehtar’s presence and flew above the Chitral fort. It was hoisted every morning, accompanied by a salute from the State Bodyguard Force, and taken down each evening after another salutation.|$|R

50|$|The {{joint venture}} {{manufactures}} mainly DA40 Diamond Aircraft with a yearly production scale of 500 aircraft. DA40 Aircraft {{is made of}} composite material, {{and can be used}} for a very long time; its fuel consumption is low (27 liter per 100 km); its take-off distance is short(it can take off after taxiing for about 360 meters); it provides high safety performance with <b>wider</b> <b>side</b> surfaces of the wing, and it has good gliding performance, too.|$|R
50|$|Suits of {{this type}} are named for the {{coverage}} that they provide to the upper thighs due to a square seam opening for the leg. Square leg suits range in appearance from those similar to swim briefs with a slightly straighter front and <b>wider</b> <b>side</b> panelling (eliminating the arc appearance on the leg), to those resembling boxer briefs by providing an inch or more of fabric coverage over the upper section of the leg.|$|R
5000|$|Developed by Sir Henry Fowler for the LMS and {{introduced}} in 1924 the new locomotives had a Belpaire firebox from new, <b>wider</b> <b>side</b> tanks, larger bunker and an extended smokebox. A ventilator was also fitted {{in the cab}} roof. This class became the LMS [...] "standard" [...] shunting locomotive. With {{the exception of a}} batch of 15 locomotives which were built by the former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway workshops at Horwich, Lancashire, all were built by outside contractors.|$|R

50|$|All Solution hulls are of foam {{sandwich}} epoxy vacuum bagged construction, with a fully draining {{cockpit and}} <b>wide</b> <b>side</b> decks for comfortable hiking. The hull, sails, rig and foils are a strict one design to control costs. However, considerable freedom is {{allowed in the}} placement of fittings to allow boats to be tailored to personal preference.|$|E
50|$|The ST {{features}} a new, more aggressive exterior design, including a redesigned front bumper with larger air intakes and grille, larger rear wing, <b>wider</b> <b>side</b> sills, center exit exhaust, and alloy wheels. Inside, the car receives {{a trio of}} additional gauges mounted in the dashboard, faux-carbon fiber trim, and sport seats with body colored inserts and stitching. The car will be offered three trim options: ST1, ST2 and ST3; the same three options that were available with the MkII ST.|$|R
5000|$|The Sunflower model {{features}} yellow ABS cladding {{as well as}} a covered foredeck (or [...] "splash deck"). As of 1974, Sunflower had been revised with its hull two inches <b>wider,</b> <b>sides</b> two inches higher, and 23% more sail area (mast 15 inches taller but same boom length) than the currently marketed Super Snark. Sunflowers were North American Yacht Racing Union (NAYRU) class certified and a Sunflower was displayed along with other American recreational equipment in a 1974 U.S. Information Agency exhibit touring Russia.|$|R
