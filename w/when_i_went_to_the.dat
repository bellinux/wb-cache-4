By April 1951, McCormick and his niece developed differences of opinions over both the newspaper and her relationship with Garvin Tankersley. She later said, [...] "I understood <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Times-Herald I was to have full control. That control was not given me... There is some difference in our political beliefs. I have broader Republican views than [...] has. I am for the same people as the colonel, but I am for some more people." [...] McCormick also told her to decide between Garvin Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she resigned from the Times-Herald. McCormick tried to run the paper himself, but lost money on the venture, and sold the Times-Herald to The Washington Post in 1954. When he announced the sale, one of the paper's board members insisted that Bazy Tankersley be {{given a chance to}} purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise the money to do so. Upon the purchase of the Times-Herald, the Post consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper. Though estranged for many years, Bazy and McCormick reconciled prior to his death.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the context}} of the 2008 Democratic Primary campaign, Morrison stated to Time magazine: [...] "People {{misunderstood}} that phrase. I was deploring the way in which President Clinton was being treated, vis-à-vis the sex scandal that was surrounding him. I said he was being treated like a black on the street, already guilty, already a perp. I have no idea what his real instincts are, in terms of race." [...] In the Democratic primary contest for the 2008 presidential race, Morrison endorsed Senator Barack Obama over Senator Hillary Clinton, though expressing admiration and respect for the latter. When he won, Morrison said she felt like an American for the first time. She said, [...] "I felt very powerfully patriotic <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inauguration of Barack Obama. I felt like a kid." ...|$|E

2500|$|Conwell first {{appeared}} in the role of Leslie Michaelson on December 2, 2010, introduced by the soap opera's former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell on a recurring status. Conwell auditioned for the role because her [...] "entire family watches the show", she explained [...] "the character was one that I really wanted to play. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> audition, I just really felt it and I think it came off in the audition. I really enjoy working with the cast. They are such great actors which I don’t {{think a lot of people}} realize. The whole experience has been just great". Conwell prepared for the role by researching characteristics of lawyers. Additionally, she said, [...] "I also watched a lot of movies where actors or actresses I admire played lawyers. I then added my own spin on it which I think is very important. I had been a fan of the show, so I had an idea of the role. But thank goodness for the internet." [...] Conwell said that she enjoys playing Leslie, a role which signifies [...] "growth" [...] for her career. In December 2012, after two years on recurring, Conwell was placed on contract by Bell's successor, Jill Farren Phelps however, was dropped back to recurring in August 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{critics have}} accused MEMRI of selectivity. They state that MEMRI {{consistently}} picks for translation and dissemination {{the most extreme}} views, which portray the Arab and Muslim world in a negative light, while ignoring moderate views that are often found in the same media outlets. Juan Cole, a professor of Modern Middle East History at the University of Michigan, argues MEMRI {{has a tendency to}} [...] "cleverly cherry-pick the vast Arabic press, which serves 300 million people, for the most extreme and objectionable articles and editorials... On more than one occasion I have seen, say, a bigoted Arabic article translated by MEMRI and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> source on the web, found that it was on the same op-ed page with other, moderate articles arguing for tolerance. These latter were not translated." [...] Former head of the CIA's counterintelligence unit, Vincent Cannistraro, said that MEMRI [...] "are selective and act as propagandists for their political point of view, which is the extreme-right of Likud. They simply don't present the whole picture." [...] Laila Lalami, writing in The Nation, states that MEMRI [...] "consistently picks the most violent, hateful rubbish it can find, translates it and distributes it in email newsletters to media and members of Congress in Washington". As a result, critics such as UK Labour politician Ken Livingstone state, MEMRI's analyses are [...] "distortion".|$|E
