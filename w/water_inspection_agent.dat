In contrast, security-first {{architecture}} is immune to most {{if not all}} side-channel attacks thanks to its physical isolation. Different from the logic isolation designs in Trustzone and SGX, physical isolation significantly reduces side-channel information leakage. Numerous security mechanisms, such as ASLR at OS level, and CFI and buffer overflow protection at chip level, can be directly integrated into ASP (and the security tasks running on the ASP). Moreover, the security <b>inspection</b> <b>agent</b> running on the ASP can be thoroughly verified as the execution environment of ASP is fairly enclosed.

After {{a review of the}} literature, five strategies {{of advanced}} metering that could be implemented for increasing the use of advanced metering were identified, considering Brazil as a case study: transfer of the ownership of metering instruments from utilities to other users, establishment of a metering service provider, development of a metering systems <b>inspection</b> <b>agent,</b> use of prepaid systems operated by condominiums and methods for data transmission for on-site remote meter reading. To assess the feasibility of each strategy, fourteen experts from utility companies and companies involved in the implementation of remote and individual metering systems were interviewed.

40|$|Labor {{outsourcing}} {{has been}} an element widely discussed among scholars and social actors involved in the regulation of social relations. The phenomenon arrived in Brazil more consistently {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century and is a reality in the country's productive system. Given the absence of specific legislation regulating the matter, the greatest difficulty nowadays is to establish the limits of permissibility of outsourcing. The regulatory gap is creating a series of conflicts between companies, <b>inspection</b> <b>agents</b> and the Judiciary.  This study aims to evaluate the concept of intermediate and final activity in construction and effective boundaries to be observed preventively by law enforcers. It uses the deductive method to conclude that the resolute focus should not stick to the definition of what activities are part of the industry chain, to be volatile and determined by the productive dynamics, but inspection of the economic conditions of the service providers...|$|R
40|$|In Portugal, the organisations {{responsible}} for the internal control of the State 2 ̆ 7 s financial administration need to progressively optimise their human resources in order to maximise their effectiveness. Part of this important responsibility relates to competence management and the assignment of their most suitable human resources to the tasks that insure their mission accomplishment. Such endeavour can benefit from a central concept of the Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) field: the application of computer technology to support group work. This paper outlines a recommender system, the 2 HRT that aims to facilitate a more proficient human resources 2 ̆ 7 task assignment, helping the human resources department to respond more efficiently to the demands for personnel of other departments. This research uses a Delphi study, with semi-structured interviews to collect the views of <b>inspection</b> <b>agents</b> in Portugal.

40|$|SummaryThis article {{aimed to}} review the concept of social indices by {{focusing}} on their practical use and need in the health setting. For this purpose, the initial consideration was how these indices are defined, their possible use, and the importance they have {{as a means of}} depicting the real world. Thus, a wide concept of health, consistent with the current view, was adopted. Health was further described within international and national settings, emphasizing indicators that can be employed to estimate health problems in the population were highlighted. Finally, as no specific social index describing health in a Brazilian setting has been developed, the need to rely on the Health Development Index was indicated. This index will serve as a tool for managers, <b>inspection</b> <b>agents,</b> and the general population to follow-up the developments reached and the shortcomings that should be addressed to ensure a better health status {{for the majority of the}} population...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The Traffic Engineering Company of the City of Sao Paulo (Brazil) {{observed}} {{a decrease in}} productivity, {{and an increase in}} sick leave, accidents and psychological distress among their parking <b>inspection</b> <b>agents.</b> To document this situation, qualitative research was undertaken to obtain an in-depth comprehension of work activity. Participants: Workers, managers and health and safety professionals contributed to the documentation of the problem and to the proposal of possible solutions. Methods: Ergonomic work analysis focusing on real work activity, as well as interviews with individual or groups of stakeholders, were conducted. Results: This research revealed that political-economic factors gradually contributed to: 1) an increasing work load; 2) growing fatigue throughout the day, increasing the workers` vulnerability to incidents and accidents and their tendency to react inappropriately to violence experienced on the street; and 3) excessive individual responsibility to manage dangerous situations. Conclusions: Recommendations to ameliorate the situation are proposed. These suggestions are discussed in terms of feasibility given the impact of macro social factors upon micro work activity, and the associated potential expansion of the ergonomist`s role...|$|R

30|$|The {{incidence}} of endometriosis in the infertile female {{is estimated to}} be between 20 and 50  %. Although the causal relationship between endometriosis and infertility has not been proven, it is generally accepted that the disease impairs reproductive outcome. Indirect imaging techniques and transvaginal laparoscopy now offer the possibility of an early stage diagnosis. Although it remains debated whether the disease is progressive, treatment in an early stage is recommendable as it carries less risk for ovarian damage, hence premature ovarian failure. Under <b>water,</b> <b>inspection</b> with the technique of transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) accurately shows the invagination of the ovarian cortex as minimal superficial lesions but with the presence of well-differentiated endometrial like tissue at the base, the lateral walls and especially the inner edges of the small endometrioma. An inflammatory environment is responsible for the formation of connecting adhesions with the broad ligament and lateral wall with invasion of endometrial-like tissue and formation of adenomyotic lesions. In around 50  % of the small endometriomas, adhesiolysis is necessary at the site of invagination with opening of the cyst, to free the chocolate content and hereby recognize the underlying endometrioma. The detailed inspection of these early-stage endometriotic lesions at THL reunites the hypothesis of Sampson with the observation of Hughesdon.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{intelligent}} navigation system for an unmanned underwater vehicle powered by renewable energy and designed for shadow <b>water</b> <b>inspection</b> in missions {{of a long}} duration is proposed. The system is composed of an underwater vehicle, which tows a surface vehicle. The surface vehicle is a small boat with photovoltaic panels, a methanol fuel cell and communication equipment, which provides energy and communication to the underwater vehicle. The underwater vehicle has sensors to monitor the underwater environment such as sidescan sonar and a video camera in a flexible configuration and sensors to measure the physical and chemical parameters of water quality on predefined paths for long distances. The underwater vehicle implements a biologically inspired neural architecture for autonomous intelligent navigation. Navigation is carried out by integrating a kinematic adaptive neuro-controller for trajectory tracking and an obstacle avoidance adaptive neuro- controller. The autonomous underwater vehicle is capable of operating during long periods of observation and monitoring. This autonomous vehicle is a good tool for observing large areas of sea, since it operates {{for long periods of}} time due to the contribution of renewable energy. It correlates all sensor data for time and geodetic position. This vehicle has been used for monitoring the Mar Menor lagoon...|$|R
