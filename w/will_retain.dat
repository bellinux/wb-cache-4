5|$|Despite Lyoto Machida's {{knockout}} of Thiago Silva, Dana White {{indicated that}} he was not the number one contender for a title shot. Instead, a scheduled fight between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Quinton Jackson and Keith Jardine would determine Machida's title fate.

Jackson won the fight via unanimous decision, but torn ligaments in his jaw forced the former champion out of the bout. Instead, Machida will challenge Evans for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship at UFC 98. Jackson <b>will</b> <b>retain</b> his title shot against the winner of that match upon returning from injury.

5|$|On July 28, 2007, UN {{officials}} announced the complex would undergo a $1 billion renovation {{starting in the}} fall. Swedish firm Skanska AB won a bid to overhaul the buildings which including the Conference, General Assembly and Secretariat buildings. The renovations, {{which will be the}} first since the complex opened in 1950, are expected to take about 7 years to complete.

5|$|The games {{introduce}} Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, {{some new}} types of legendary Pokémon that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently. They can be tracked by the Pokédex once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but <b>will</b> <b>retain</b> HP loss. In addition {{there is the possibility}} of encountering a shiny Pokémon, which have a different coloration than normal Pokémon of their species, and appear very rarely. Two new Pokémon types were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type. Steel-type Pokémon are immune to Poison-type moves, and they have very high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type Pokémon are immune to Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type Pokémon, as well as having few weaknesses. In Gold and Silver, new moves were added, but Pokémon knowing these moves are not allowed to be traded to the first generation games. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the Pokémon. Another major change was the splitting of the Special stat into Special Attack and Special Defense, which increased aspects of strategy.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Mega Man {{series on}} the NES has generally consisted of 2D platform games that focus on run-and-gun gameplay. Mega Man X uses the same basic principles as its precursors but with many added options. The player takes control of the protagonist X, and, after completing an introductory stage, is presented with a stage selection screen that depicts eight boss characters. Each stage is littered with various enemies and hazards and ends with a boss battle against its respective Maverick. Completing a stage rewards the player with a new weapon. The player may attempt these eight levels in any order, using weapons gained in one level to overcome challenges in the others. The player can return to the game at a later point using a password system; the password <b>will</b> <b>retain</b> any number of the eight stages cleared and most power-ups. Completing some stages will subtly affect the landscape of others. For example, clearing Storm Eagle's aircraft carrier stage will cause electrical outages in Spark Mandrill's power plant stage.
