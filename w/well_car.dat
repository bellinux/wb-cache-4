25|$|When {{carried by}} rail, {{containers}} can be loaded on flatcars or in container <b>well</b> <b>cars.</b> In Europe, stricter railway height restrictions (smaller loading gauge and structure gauge) and overhead electrification prevent containers from being stacked two high, and containers are hauled one high either on standard flatcars or other railroad cars. Taller containers are often carried in <b>well</b> <b>cars</b> (not stacked) on older European railway routes where the loading gauge (especially with the reduced gauge for UK lines) is particularly small.|$|R

2500|$|When {{carried by}} rail, {{containers}} may {{be carried on}} flatcars or <b>well</b> <b>cars.</b> The latter are specially designed for container transport, and can accommodate double-stacked containers. However, the loading gauge of a rail system may restrict the modes and types of container shipment. The smaller loading gauges often found in European railroads will only accommodate single-stacked containers. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, there are sections of the rail network through which high-cube containers cannot pass, or can pass through only on <b>well</b> <b>cars.</b> On the other hand, Indian Railways runs double-stacked containers on flatcars under 25 kV overhead electrical wires. The wires {{must be at least}} [...] above the track.

Bare-table (empty <b>well</b> <b>car)</b> trains uses the Gateway Subdivision in a somewhat regular manner(as many as 3 per day). There is no Amtrak intercity service on the Gateway Subdivision.

5000|$|Southern Pacific Railroad (SP), {{along with}} Malcom McLean, {{came up with}} the idea of the first double-stack {{intermodal}} car in 1977. SP then designed the first car with ACF Industries that same year. At first it was slow to become an industry standard, then in 1984 American President Lines started working with the Thrall Company to develop a refined <b>well</b> <b>car</b> and with the Union Pacific to operate a train service using the new well cars. That same year, the first all [...] "double stack" [...] train left Los Angeles for South Kearny, New Jersey, under the name of [...] "Stacktrain" [...] rail service. Along the way the train transferred from the UP to CNW and then to Conrail.|$|E
50|$|Double-stack rail {{transport}} {{is a form}} of intermodal freight transport where intermodal containers are stacked two high on railroad cars. Introduced in North America in 1984, double stack has become increasingly common there, being used for nearly 70% of United States intermodal shipments. Using double stack technology, a freight train of a given length can carry roughly twice as many containers, sharply reducing costs per container. On most North American railroads, special well cars are used for double-stack to reduce the needed vertical clearance and to lower the center of gravity of a loaded car. In addition, the <b>well</b> <b>car</b> design significantly reduces damage in transit and provides greater cargo security by cradling the lower containers so their doors cannot be opened. A succession of larger container sizes have been introduced to further increase shipping productivity on shipments within North America.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>well</b> <b>car,</b> {{also known}} as a double-stack car or stack car (also well wagon), is a type of {{railroad}} car specially designed to carry intermodal containers (shipping containers) used in intermodal freight transport. The [...] "well" [...] is a depressed section which sits close to the rails between the wheel trucks of the car, allowing a container to be carried lower than on a traditional flatcar. This makes it possible to carry a stack of two containers per unit on railway lines (double-stack rail transport) wherever the loading gauge assures sufficient clearance. The top container is secured to the bottom container either by a bulkhead built into the car (e.g., bottom and top containers are the same dimensions of 40 ft.), or through the use of inter-box connectors (IBC). Four IBCs are needed per wellcar. In the process of an inbound train becoming an outbound train, there are four processes: unlock to unload the top container of inbound train, remove then unload bottom container, insert after loading bottom container of outbound train, lock after top container loaded.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, riders {{will go to}} a rail yard {{where the}} trains [...] "crew change" [...] (switch out crew). They will either know from other riders of a spot to hide and wait, or they will find one themselves. Depending on the size and layout of the yard, riders may have to get on the train while it is moving; doing this is known as [...] "catching on the fly". Furthermore, riders must figure out which way trains are going, either by calling the company's {{internal}} tracking number or by knowing which tracks go where. Riders will occasionally wait at [...] "side outs", places where there are two parallel tracks and trains pull aside for others to pass. Cars and trains are divided several ways with regards to riding. There are [...] "IMs" [...] (intermodal containers, also called [...] "hotshots" [...] or [...] "double stack"), [...] "junk" [...] (mixed cars) and coal. Within these three groups some cars are [...] "rideable" [...] and some not: boxcars, grainers and gondolas are some of the rideable [...] "junk" [...] cars. On IMs, riders usually stay in the metal beds in front of or behind the shipping containers, [...] "48/53 wells" [...] or under tractor trailers [...] "pig in a bucket" [...] (when trailer is on a metal platform with large holes cut in the bottom. On coal, riders often get into [...] "DPUs" [...] or [...] "rear units", which are the engines put on the back or middle of the train on long coal loads. Riding in the empty or full coal containers is also possible. Riding cars on the small exposed porch of a tanker, on a truss-bottom <b>well</b> <b>car</b> or any other position which exposes the rider to a great risk of falling off or getting caught is called [...] "riding suicide".|$|E
2500|$|In North America, {{containers}} {{are often}} shipped by rail in container <b>well</b> <b>cars.</b> These cars resemble flatcars but the newer ones have a container-sized depression, or well, {{in the middle}} (between the bogies or [...] "trucks") of the car. This depression allows for sufficient clearance to allow two containers to be loaded in the car in a [...] "double stack" [...] arrangement. The newer container cars also are specifically built as a small articulated [...] "unit", most commonly in components of three or five, whereby two components are connected by a single bogie as opposed to two bogies, one on each car. Double stacking is also used in parts of Australia. On some older railways, particularly in the United Kingdom, the use of <b>well</b> <b>cars</b> is necessary to carry single stacked large containers within the loading gauge.|$|R
