40|$|Certain aneurysms of the {{anterior}} circulation {{continue to offer}} a technical challenge for safe exposure and clipping. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to describe the cranio-orbital approach for surgical clipping of complex aneurysms and to evaluate prospectively the associated complications of this approach. Prospective audit of all patients undergoing cranio-orbital approach for aneurysm surgery from 1997 to 2004 by the senior author. Twenty-five patients, eight male and 17 female, median age of 52 years, range 28 - 73. All patients had a standard pterional approach supplemented by an orbital osteotomy. In the 7 -year period 367 patients underwent treatment for their aneurysms (169 clipped and 198 coiled). Of the 169 patients who were operated on, 29 had a skull base approach, of which 25 were cranio-orbital. The aneurysm location was as follows: 16 middle cerebral artery (MCA), three carotid bifurcation, four anterior communicating artery (ACOMM), one ophthalmic and one basilar. There were no approach-related complications. The cranio-orbital craniotomy can be a useful adjunct in the surgical treatment of giant or complex aneurysms. It offers the following advantages over a standard pterional approach: reduces operative distance; allows easy splitting of the sylvian fissure; and provides a wide arc of exposure with multiple <b>working</b> <b>corridors...</b>|$|R

The suite {{to the southeast}} consists of two offices and a strong room <b>working</b> off a <b>corridor</b> accessed from the dedicated stair from Mary Street. This strong room is also notable for its heavy metal door and concrete floor. The office suite to the northwest comprises two rooms to Mary Street and three rooms along the northwest side <b>working</b> off the <b>corridor</b> arrived at from the stair from Mary Street. This corridor runs to the boardroom extending across the rear with a small room opening off to the west corner. On the first floor, internal masonry walls are plastered and room partitions are timber framed and lined, some also have panels of opaque textured glazing. Ceilings are lined with tongue and groove timber boards, have moulded timber cornices and decorative ceiling roses. Original cedar door and window joinery, skirtings and architraves survive throughout. The boardroom is notable for its joinery including the painted French windows with fanlight to the balcony flanked by large full pane varnished cedar sash windows and full pane sash windows to the former light well to the southwest. This room now has a lower plain plaster ceiling and a three-quarter height partition to the southeast. The hopper windows to the Mary Street side offices do not have internal sills, reflecting the removal of earlier French windows to these openings.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This is {{a summary}} of the Public Safety Canada {{commissioned}} report to inventory current and predict future trends in avalanche threats and mitigation programs in Canada. By the winter of 2007, avalanches were responsible for at least 702 fatalities in Canada since the earliest recorded incident in 1782. Avalanches can affect people travelling and <b>working</b> on transportation <b>corridors,</b> ski area recreationists and workers, backcountry recreationists and guides, resource industry workers, energy generation facilities and transmission lines, and people in or near public and residential buildings. In addition to hazard assessments, mitigation programs include forecasting and control programs for roads, railroads, ski areas, commercial backcountry recreation operations, resource industry worksites and roads, energy generation facilities and transmission lines, as well as public and residential land use areas. Public programs provide avalanche safety education and avalanche conditions reports, forecasts, and warnings to self-directed backcountry recreationists. However, non-mitigated avalanche threats exist to all activity types in Canada. With the exception of residential and public land use, the various types of activity in avalanche terrain are expected to either maintain current levels or increase...|$|R
50|$|SR 532 first {{appeared}} on a map in 1911, which showed a road extending from Camano past East Stanwood (present-day Stanwood). The state began maintaining the highway in 1945, when Secondary State Highway 1Y (SSH 1Y) was established, running along the current route of SR 532. The Mark Clark Bridge, which is located on SR 532 between Camano Island and Stanwood, was constructed in 1949 and dedicated on July 23, 1950, to World War II general Mark Wayne Clark, who served out of Fort Lewis. During the 1964 highway renumbering, SSH 1Y became SR 532; since the 1964 renumbering, no major renumberings or route changes have been made. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) arranged a minor project in 2007 and is currently <b>working</b> on a <b>corridor</b> improvement, a project designed to improve the highway from Camano to Interstate 5 (I-5). During floods in January 2009, residents in Stanwood constructed a barrier to prevent water damage to the highway. WSDOT is improving the whole corridor in a project divided into four miniature projects, {{all of which are}} expected to be complete by 2011. The improvements include installing left-turn lanes and replacing the Mark Clark Bridge with a wider, four-lane bridge. In 2001, when the project plans were underway, it was suggested that the roadway become five lanes wide and that a ferry from Everett to Camano Island be added; WSDOT began seeking contractors in August 2008 and hired four by September.|$|R
40|$|A Complete Street is a {{corridor}} that is accessible by all users {{and modes of}} transportation; it promotes livability and economic vitality in the surrounding community, and is {{a new approach to}} improving transportation networks. Prior to the implementation of Complete Streets projects, cities conduct corridor ranking studies to determine potential project locations. The City of North Las Vegas Planning Department (CNLV) is currently <b>working</b> on a <b>corridor</b> ranking study in partnership with the Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) and an external consulting group, Atkins International (Atkins). This is the first Complete Streets planning study for the City of North Las Vegas, and they are currently in need of an external evaluation of their approach. DiamoCorp is a consulting group in charge of evaluating the approach the City of North Las Vegas has taken to complete its Complete Streets Corridor Ranking Study. DiamoCorp aims to answer the following question: Was the City of North Las Vegas effective at executing their ranking study? To answer this question, DiamoCorp took a four [...] ‐tiered approach. The four methods used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the study were 1) an internal assessment, 2) benchmark comparisons, 3) workshop analyses, and 4) a stakeholder survey. Internal Assessment: DiamoCorp members met with key stakeholders (CNLV, RTC, Atkins) on a monthly basis in order to discuss the division of roles and responsibilities amongst stakeholders as well as current or potential setbacks. Benchmark Comparisons: Researching similar Complete Streets corridor [...] ‐ranking studies around the United States allowed DiamoCorp to compare and contrast strengths and weaknesses from this study to others like it across the country. Workshop Analyses: Workshop activities and discussions formed the indicators and ranking criteria for the study; DiamoCorp attended and analyzed the workshops to determine if Atkins was meeting its objectives and progressing in accordance with the study’s timeline. Stakeholder Survey: Stakeholders were very involved in the first half of the study, and through a survey DiamoCorp aimed to find out what stakeholders were involved or missing as well as how to maximize the use of stakeholder expertise and time. DiamoCorp used the information and data they collected to form recommendations for the current study as well as future Complete Streets Corridor Ranking Studies. Together, these recommendations create a toolbox. Recommendations for the study in progress include providing materials from Atkins to stakeholders prior to workshops, discussing workshop materials with CNLV and RTC prior to workshops, looking into best practices of similar ranking studies, and assessing what stakeholders group and data were missing during this study. Below are the recommendations for future studies. City of North Las Vegas Complete Streets Corridor Ranking Study Toolbox Lessons Learned about Planning Approach: In future studies the key players (CNLV and RTC) will remain the same. DiamoCorp recommends that CNLV hire an external consultant unless there is an increase in CNLV staff available to work on projects. The role of the consultant will not be the same in future studies; rather than conducting workshops during the first half of the project, the consultant will spend that time collecting, organizing, and preparing data that was previously missing or outdated from the first study. Successful Complete Streets studies in cities such as Henderson, Nevada; Oakland, California; and Chicago, Illinois have elements that CNLV can consider when conducting future studies. These elements include: 1) clearly defined leadership roles, 2) public engagement via online or in workshop form, 3) utilization of higher education institutions for research assistance, and 4) information sharing with local stakeholder groups. Workshops 2 ̆ 6 Stakeholder Engagement: For future studies, DiamoCorp recommends using the information collected from the pilot study’s workshop series to select and rank corridors without moving through the same workshop activities again. After selecting and ranking potential corridors, DiamoCorp recommends that 1) CNLV and the consultant share their findings with stakeholders and ask for feedback. Survey results showed that stakeholders would spend 2 [...] ‐ 3 hours per week reviewing materials for this study. Hosting one meeting for stakeholders, CNLV, RTC, and the consultant to discuss findings would be sufficient. After receiving stakeholder feedback, 2) the consultant can carry on with the study and compose their final recommendations for the city...|$|R
40|$|WILLIAMSBURG [...] Three {{weeks ago}} nearly 500 {{students}} at the Marshall-Wythe School of Law at the College of William and Mary began the fall term in a nearly 6 million building, that was formally dedicated yesterday. The elaborate facility, which some persons have jokingly called a library attached to a law school, became a reality primarily because of a threat in the mid- 1970 s by the American Bar Association to remove the law school 2 ̆ 7 s accreditation unless its library facilities and several other items were improved. There were persons at those times who felt strongly that William and Mary officials were using the accreditation threat as a straw man to be knocked down by the construction dollars then almost routinely provided by the General Assembly. Money for the William and Mary law school, however, was never {{easy to come by}} and an examination of documents, letters and communications between William and Mary and ABA officials between 1973 and 1978 reveals that the accreditation threat to the law school was not a veiled one; it was very real. In 1967 the law school and its library moved into renovated quarters at the old William and Mary library building. It was three years after the move that college officials first began discussing the possibility of constructing a new building, especially designed for the law school. In the meantime, there was a move among state legal personalities and state government officials to secure for Williamsburg the headquarters of the National Center for State Courts, then temporarily located in Denver. Gov. Linwood Holton was very instrumental in getting the National Center to finally select Williamsburg as headquarters site in 1973. It was also Holton who first had a great vision of a large legal center with the National Center Building and an adjacent new facility for William and Mary 2 ̆ 7 s Marshall-Wythe School of Law. Although the public has never been told, the law school accreditation problem began as early as Aug. 4 - 5, 1973, when the American bar association 2 ̆ 7 s council on legal education and its accreditation committee reviewed a re-inspection of Marshall-Wythe. A resolution adopted at the meeting noted that the William ad Mary law school appeared to have deficiencies in its physical facilities, library and operating budget and that study space in the library failed to demonstrate compliance with ABA standards. In his State-of-The-Commonwealth address in January 1974, out-going Gov. Holton included the request for a new law school building at William and Mary in his remarks and in his budget, calling upon the General Assembly to fund the project. The construction, along with dozens of other such projects across the state, {{was not included in the}} 1974 - 1976 biennium budget that was adopted and the college continued to grapple with the growing ABA specter. The first public indication of any accreditation problem at the law school came on Dec. 3, 1974 when the State Council of Higher Education, in a report released in Richmond said the American Bar Association and the Association of American Law Schools feel that state support of the William and Mary law school was 2 ̆ 2 submarginal 2 ̆ 2 and that accreditation of the law school is, therefore, in jeopardy until deficiencies are corrected. James P. Whyte, then dean of Marshall-Wythe said in response that 2 ̆ 2 To say our accreditation is in jeopardy is a bit of an overstatement. We 2 ̆ 7 re not on the verge of going out of existence. Frankly, we need to sit more people in our library... we need more space for the number of students enrolled. Wythe and the college were putting up a good front, because they did know that accreditation was in jeopardy, if not then, within the next several months. In January, 1975, William and Mary officials decided that the best political course to obtain a new building, would be to delay a fund plea until the 1976 meeting of the General Assembly when the college would make the law school its No. 1 priority item. In July, 1975, the accreditation picture came into sharper focus. During the 1973 - 75 timespan, college officials had been submitting progress reports to the ABA section on legal education. On July 10 - 13, 1975, the section 2 ̆ 7 s council adopted a strongly worded resolution highly critical of the law school and noting 2 ̆ 2 very grave concern 2 ̆ 2 about the following matters: (1) Continued inadequacy of the law school building... and the fact that portions of the law school are housed in four (additional) buildings. (2) Continued inadequacy of faculty salaries... which are below the national median and below those schools in the geographic area where William and Mary is located. (3) Continued inadequacy of professional staffing for the law library. (4) Continued need for additional strengthening of law library. (5) Need for a clarification of autonomy of the law school admissions office and (6) The law school 2 ̆ 7 s problems in the promotional pattern for faculty members. For reasons known only to William and Mary officials, it was not, however, until Sept. 24, 1975 that Dr. Thomas A. Graves Jr., president of William and Mary, called a press conference, announcing the accreditation problem. At that time the press was told of only the first four points, cited by the ABA. On Oct. 14, the remaining two points, involving internal relationships between the law school and the college administration, were publicized. The entire accreditation picture, however, seemed to revolve around the building. College officials contended all along that the other deficiencies could be handled, but the facility problem could not be corrected without the construction of a new law school building. In December, 1975, the ABA was aware of the intense effort to be made at the 1976 General Assembly to secure the Funding for the new facility. By that time former U. S. Sen. William B. Spong Jr. of Portsmouth had been named dean-designate of Marshall-Wythe, succeeding Whyte. Spong began a personal effort to help secure legislative support for the school, <b>working</b> the <b>corridors</b> of the state capitol and talking to friends in the legislature. On the last day of the 1976 General Assembly 486, 150 was authorized to fund site preparation work and the construction of a parking lot at the law building site. The building had not been funded, but a major step forward had been accomplished. The ABA, however, would not back off. On May 13, 1976, Spong and acting law school Dean Emeric Fischer traveled to Chicago to appear before a meeting of the council of the section of legal education of the ABA to explain William and Mary 2 ̆ 7 s position vis a vis the accreditation problem. The session lasted about four hours and Spong recalled last week that he was able 2 ̆ 2 to tell the ABA council that we had obtained money for site clearance and a parking lot. I told them that if they knew anything about the commonwealth of Virginia, they would realize they would never give money for a parking lot without building something next to it, 2 ̆ 2 Spong explained. 2 ̆ 2 That seemed to convince the ABA of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s commitment 2 ̆ 2 to build a new law school building at William and Mary. Spong and Fischer also described to the council, in detail, the corrective means that had been taken at the law school since July 1975 to eliminate the other deficiencies listed in the ABA resolution. Autonomy for the admissions problem had been reaffirmed, Spong and Fischer reported and the General Assembly had taken major steps in improving faculty salaries. The 1973 visitation inspection team found that William and Mary 2 ̆ 7 s median law school faculty salary ranked 134 th among the 148 accredited law schools. By 1975 - 76, the college had moved the school to a position of 83 rd among 156 law schools. Law library staffing had been significantly improved by the hiring of a full-time, fully qualified law librarian and two other qualified librarians and interim moves had been made to improve the physical facilities at the law school. The 1977 General Assembly approved the law school construction project as part of the 125 bond referendum issue to be voted on by Virginians in November. Then Gov. Mills E. Godwin Jr., who spearheaded approval of the referendum, is credited by Spong as giving the project its final push. The referendum was approved and the ABA was off the law school 2 ̆ 7 s back. Within two days of the referendum 2 ̆ 7 s passage, college officials were initiating steps to get the construction underway...|$|R
