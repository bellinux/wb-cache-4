5|$|Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA {{could carry}} out conversations {{that were so}} {{realistic}} that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with {{a human being and}} not a program. But in fact, ELIZA had no idea what she <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about. She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E

5|$|The primary feud {{leading up}} to Royal Rumble 1993 was between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart and {{challenger}} Razor Ramon (a replacement for The Ultimate Warrior, who had left the previous November). Ramon formed an alliance in late 1992 with Ric Flair, who Hart defeated to win the title belt. During an interview in which Hart <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about the upcoming match, Ramon and Flair came to the ring and attacked Hart. Ramon later escalated the feud by attacking Owen Hart, Bret's brother.|$|E
5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, {{he went there}} himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} {{that he thought he}} saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he <b>was</b> <b>talking,</b> Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E

5|$|As of August 1, 2012, Fox was {{pursuing}} a sequel with Scott, Rapace, and Fassbender involved, and <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> to new writers in case Lindelof did not return. The film would be {{scheduled for a}} release no earlier than 2014. In December 2012, Lindelof {{had decided not to}} work on a sequel, citing other commitments. In June 2013, Jack Paglen was in negotiations to write the sequel. In October 2013, Scott confirmed that the script was complete, but in March 2014, Michael Green was hired to rewrite Paglen's script. In August 2015, it was announced that production for the film would begin in January 2016 with Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace reprising their roles, and Scott directing. While at the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his film The Martian, Scott stated that production on the film will begin in February 2016. In September 2015, Scott said that the title of the sequel will be Alien: Paradise Lost, an allusion to John Milton's epic poem which may also suggest a deeper connection with the Alien franchise. In an interview with Empire, Scott said that the title change did not affect the film's story and the film will have a connection to the character of Ellen Ripley.|$|E
5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned {{two lines of}} genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about a second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases {{also said that the}} potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E
5|$|He {{made the}} Tigers team in spring {{training}} 1945 before finishing high school and without having played in the minor leagues, but {{sat on the bench}} before making his major league debut in June 1945, just a few weeks after his 18th birthday. He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team's victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had a remarkably unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally going to his neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him at practice and asked why Richards never talked to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn't know what Pierce <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family's, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk behind the counter each time he went in.|$|E

60|$|Yet this {{universal}} language has not succeeded, {{at a moment}} of crisis, in imposing itself on the whole world. Nay, it has not, at the moment of crisis, succeeded in imposing itself on its own principal champions. Herve <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> French. Bebel <b>is</b> not <b>talking</b> Economic Esperanto; he <b>is</b> <b>talking</b> German.

I do not know whether French or Flemish was Vandervelde's nursery speech, but I am quite certain he will know more of it after this struggle than he knew before. In short, whether or no there be a new union of hearts, there has really and truly been a new division of tongues.|$|R

Raghavan realises that Radha, whom he intends to marry, is the same girl Sundaram is in love with. Raghavan, believing that Radha loves Sundaram, decides to help Sundaram attain his love and {{get a chance to}} act in films, which he does successfully. Sundaram becomes a star after his debut film Appavi Kanavan ("Innocent Husband") becomes a success and believes that his stardom and popularity will help him in attaining his love. When Radha comes to Sundaram's house to congratulate him, he introduces her to Raghavan, who is present at that time. As Sundaram goes to prepare snacks for the two, Radha asks Raghavan why he did not show up for the marriage proposal. Raghavan states that he thought Radha loved Sundaram. Shocked, Radha informs Raghavan that she likes Sundaram for his innocence, although she does not love him. Raghavan is pleasantly surprised, but to ensure that Sundaram's film career does not suffer from discovering the truth, he asks Radha to keep it a secret.|$|E
