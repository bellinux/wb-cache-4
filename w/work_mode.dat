The drive mode is activated automatically when the vehicle is in motion, and modern tachograph heads usually default to the other <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> upon coming to rest. The rest and availability modes can be manually selected by the driver whilst stationary.|$|E

40|$|Received-signal-strength-based (RSS-based) device-free {{localization}} (DFL) is {{a promising}} technique {{since it is}} able to localize the person without attaching any electronic device. This technology requires measuring the RSS of all links in the network constituted by several radio frequency (RF) sensors. It is an energy-intensive task, especially when the RF sensors work in traditional <b>work</b> <b>mode,</b> in which the sensors directly send raw RSS measurements of all links to a base station (BS). The traditional <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> is unfavorable for the power constrained RF sensors because the amount of data delivery increases dramatically as the number of sensors grows. In this paper, we propose a binary <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> in which RF sensors send the link states instead of raw RSS measurements to the BS, which remarkably reduces the amount of data delivery. Moreover, we develop two localization methods for the binary <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> which corresponds to stationary and moving target, respectively. The first localization method is formulated based on grid-based maximum likelihood (GML), which is able to achieve global optimum with low online computational complexity. The second localization method, however, uses particle filter (PF) to track the target when constant snapshots of link stats are available. Real experiments in two different kinds of environments were conducted to evaluate the proposed methods. Experimental results show that the localization and tracking performance under the binary <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> is comparable to the those in traditional <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> while the energy efficiency improves considerably...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{methodology}} for agent-oriented software analysis and design is proposed, which starts from a system’s organizational structure and its <b>work</b> <b>mode.</b> The main tasks of analysis are {{to build the}} models for a system’s organization structure and its <b>work</b> <b>mode.</b> to capture how roles construct the system, which problems the system is desired to solve, and which relationships are among those problems. The main tasks of design are to model agents who will play the roles and to model interactions to show how agents realize the existing <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> and solve problems. To ensure the consistency between the analysis and the design, this paper also discusses the logic relationships between varied models built at different phases, which {{makes it possible to}} check the consistency automatically. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} how an employee 2 ̆ 7 s <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> (i. e. full-time telecommuter, full-time office worker, or mobile worker) affects manager ratings of job performance, salary increases, and job promotions. The study involves a longitudinal investigation of 16, 436 employees over a four-year span at a large high-tech company. Results indicate that while <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> has no main effect on job performance ratings, full-time office workers receive more pay increases and job promotions than mobile workers. Additionally, employees who reported to the same office as their manager received higher performance ratings than those who were managed remotely. Finally, employees who had a telecommuting manager received lower pay increases and fewer promotions than employees who had a traditional office manager. While these main effects of manager work modes were found, no interactions of employee <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> and manager <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> on employee job performance outcomes were found. This study has implications for both employees and organizations considering telework as a viable alternative to the traditional working arrangement. The results of this study can be applied towards the creation of a comprehensive telework policy that increases flexibility for both employee and organization without hindering job performance...|$|E

In order {{to overcome these}} disadvantages, {{on the basis of}} two-variable control theory, the natural non circulating current <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> is brought forward and analyzed. Two controlled variables trigger angle α and pulse width b, need control in this mode. How to assign the moment of trigger and how to assign trigger pulse width are the key problems. And then these problems are discussed. The principle of this mode is analyzed in a third of all frequency value as an example. The essence and excellence of natural non circulating current <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> and the feasibility are pointed out...|$|E

40|$|The {{vibration}} characteristic {{analysis method}} for a quartz microgyroscope {{based on the}} admittance circle is reported in this paper. Admittance theory is introduced and the admittance circle principle is analysed to study the vibration characteristics of the quartz microgyroscope. The prototype gyroscope was fabricated by micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology. The admittance and phase diagram of the <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> were obtained by vibration mode test systems. Then the admittance circle of the <b>work</b> <b>mode</b> was drawn, and the parameter identification of the transfer function between the voltage and current was completed to analyse the vibration characteristics. Therefore, the vibration characteristic analysis method based on the admittance circle {{can be used to}} build the transfer function of the quartz microgyroscope, which is helpful for the design of a high performance quartz microgyroscope...|$|E
