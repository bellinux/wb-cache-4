5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E

25|$|Andrew {{was also}} on-air during the 2007 summer floods {{and found himself}} {{presenting}} a news programme from 7pm until midnight instead of his new music programme, receiving top praise from Mark Thompson, director-general of the BBC at the time, who said: “The feedback you’ve received from your audience has offered ample testimony of just how essential that service has been to so many people’s lives. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> hope to keep them informed and connected {{were it not for}} the kind of efforts you've made, and the professionalism and creativity that you've demonstrated”. This resulted in the station receiving gold in the Sony Radio Academy Awards.|$|E
25|$|Everything {{that has}} {{happened}} since has therefore been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The world has been intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed Jonah: {{it was only in}} the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as evils, but without them <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> come to know God.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them {{in the sphere of}} {{spontaneous}} apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.|$|E

500|$|Somewhat surprisingly, Clinton {{faced an}} erosion of support from women voters during her campaign, with her numbers declining {{throughout}} 1999. [...] This was partly a typical pattern seen with women candidates where they have an early surge of female support, which then wears off, and it was partly due to her early campaign stumbles. [...] But it also reflected the particular set of mixed feelings that women had towards Clinton's marriage and the ambition and the power she derived from it. [...] The problem was especially acute among some female demographics; one of her longtime advisers later said, [...] "Women in the educated professional class? They fucking couldn't stand her. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> figure out why. We had psychologists come in." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Matt Groening, the lone episode (discounting the Tracey Ullman shorts) in which he {{received}} an individual writing credit, though he has co-written for the episodes [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", [...] "The Telltale Head", and [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield". [...] "Colonel Homer" [...] was partly based on the 1980 film Coal Miner's Daughter, which {{tells the story of}} country music singer Loretta Lynn. Groening said he had always wanted to write an episode in which Homer is offered a chance at being rich and famous, other than being with his family, but then chooses his family over glamour at the end. He pitched the idea to the writers of the show, who suggested the parody of Coal Miner's Daughter and also that Homer should become a manager for a country singer. Show runner Mike Reiss was originally skeptical about the episode, as he did not think Homer could get a new job when he already had a full-time job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Reiss eventually gave in, but in future episodes the writers tried to develop the explanation that he got fired from the plant and then rehired at the end. Groening said that during the episode production, he received comments from the production team that Homer was acting like a [...] "jerk" [...] in it, but his explanation was that Homer's behavior was due to his desire to make Lurleen a star and he was oblivious to her attempts to seduce him until the end. Mike Reiss stated that [...] "Whenever we want to write stories about characters getting divorced or actually having an affair, rather than with Homer and Marge, which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> do, we use secondary characters for that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Nationalists, led by Francisco Franco, {{received}} important {{support from}} {{some elements of}} American business. The American-owned Vacuum Oil Company in Tangier, for example, refused to sell to Republican ships and at {{the outbreak of the}} war, the Texas Oil Company rerouted oil tankers headed for the Republic to the Nationalist-controlled port of Tenerife, and supplied tons of gasoline on credit to Franco until the war's end. American automakers Ford, Studebaker, and General Motors provided a total of 12,000 trucks to the Nationalists. After the war was over, José Maria Doussinague, who was at the time undersecretary at the Spanish Foreign Ministry, said, [...] "without American petroleum and American trucks, and American credit, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> have won the Civil War." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2009, it was {{reported}} that All Time Low had signed to major label Interscope Records. However, the following month, vocalist/guitarist Alex Gaskarth denied this. The band released their third album, Nothing Personal in July of that year through independent label Hopeless Records, which sold 63,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number four on the Billboard 200. The band later confirmed they signed to Interscope Records in November. Guitarist Jack Barakat said signing to the label gave the band [...] "a bunch of new resources", such as being able to [...] "write with people that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> write with before, recording with people, getting certain mixers/producers and everything." [...] Gaskarth found the transition [...] " [...] too difficult", but noting that it [...] "definitely different though".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{attributed}} this to its sonic {{difference with}} its predecessors, however, Mike Patton credits it to being [...] "better at playing what [...] hear in [...] heads" [...] {{and went on}} to say that [...] "before, we used to kinda cheat around, and play around what it was. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> translate it into the band, and we're getting better at doing that. Like, we wanted to do a real lazy, sappy kinda ballad, so we covered the theme from Midnight Cowboy! And there's even a song that sounds like The Carpenters!" [...] In a trend that started when then-vocalist Chuck Mosley lived in Los Angeles while the rest of the band resided in the Bay Area, the band would record demo tapes of the songs and exchange them between each other in Los Angeles before sending them to Jim Martin so that he could work on his guitar arrangements after which he would send them back for approval.|$|E

'No, my Tina,' {{answered}} Maynard slowly, {{waiting a}} little between each sentence; 'we {{mean to do}} wicked things that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>could</b> do, just as we mean to do good or clever things that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>could</b> do. Our thoughts are often worse than we are, {{just as they are}} often better than we are. And God sees us as we are altogether, not in separate feelings or actions, as our fellow-men see us.

2500|$|A {{combination}} of bad weather, {{the arguments of}} his generals, and a breach of security when {{the details of the}} original plan fell into Allied hands, eventually led Hitler to agree to postpone the attack until early 1940, when it was again delayed by the invasion of Denmark and Norway. In February, Hitler finally accepted the Manstein Plan. General Günther von Kluge's 4th Army and General Maximilian Reichsfreiherr von Weichs's 2nd Army were transferred from Army Group B to Rundstedt's command. General Ewald von Kleist was now to command Panzer (Armoured) Group Kleist, consisting of three armoured corps, led by Heinz Guderian, Georg-Hans Reinhardt and Hermann Hoth. These armoured corps were to be the spearhead of the German thrust into France. Although Manstein is often credited for the change of plans, he himself acknowledged Rundstedt's decisive role. [...] "I would stress that my commander, Colonel-General von Rundstedt, agreed with my view throughout, and backed our recommendations to the full. Without his sanction <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> have kept up our attempts to change OKW's mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Demetriade {{continued}} to play the unconventional poet, well-integrated in {{the atmosphere of the}} era's literary cafes. He embraced the peculiar lifestyle of literary bohemia. Writing in 1902, Macedonski described him as a [...] "jester" [...] who could prove himself [...] "bitter", also noting that Demetriade's day started [...] "at 3 o'clock in the afternoon". Such depictions were puzzling for the reading public, who wondered whether Macedonski was not in fact mocking his disciple. However, Demetriade remained among the most loyal Macedonskians, to 1904 and beyond. The younger Symbolist Mihail Cruceanu, who met Demetriade in Macedonski's salon in 1905, recalls him as a [...] "Mefisto", who readily imparted his erotic escapades with the Literatorul crowd. He notes: [...] "We the young ones we were looking up to him with much curiosity and sympathy, as he appeared to us as an elegant and fortunate satyr whose astuteness <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> match. But seeing as we were fatigued by the stories' emotionalism, we left for home at midnight, leaving him alone with his complete menu, to consume till dawn. Or so they tell me, since I, the aspiring poet, always went to bed before that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second {{approach}} is to embed the higher-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space, using methods analogous {{to the ways in}} which three-dimensional objects are drawn on the plane. For example, the fold out nets mentioned in the previous section have higher-dimensional equivalents. Some of these may be viewed at [...] One might even imagine building a model of this fold-out net, as one draws a polyhedron's fold-out net on a piece of paper. Sadly, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> do the necessary folding of the 3-dimensional structure to obtain the 4-dimensional polytope because of the constraints of the physical universe. Another way to [...] "draw" [...] the higher-dimensional shapes in 3 dimensions is via some kind of projection, for example, the analogue of either orthographic or perspective projection. Coxeter's famous book on polytopes (Coxeter, 1948) has some examples of such orthographic projections. Other examples may be found on the web (see for example [...] ). Note that immersing even 4-dimensional polychora directly into two dimensions is quite confusing. Easier to understand are 3-d models of the projections. Such models are occasionally found in science museums or mathematics departments of universities (such as that of the Université Libre de Bruxelles).|$|E

But she wasn't there--she had gone, nobody knew where. I got a letter from her the next week.

5000|$|Reliance Steel {{also wanted}} to {{strengthen}} its position in Texas, and, after attempting to acquire a Houston business, temporarily abandoned its acquisition philosophy and opened a new metals service center in Houston in 1975.
