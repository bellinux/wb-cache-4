A former {{antagonist}} of Mega-City One's, behind multiple acts of aggression, it {{was destroyed}} by Judge Dredd during the Apocalypse War. Megagrad was built on its ruins. Survivors from the city have attempted numerous retributive actions against Mega-City One, and a New Kremlin was set up at the Mediterranean Free State. [...] Eventually the city was renamed and abandoned by everyone but it its few remaining Judges who have gone totally insane executing people for such crimes as stepping on cracks, not eating greens and not helping with the <b>washup.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the applications of surface energy measurements in predicting the ink adhesion of four different Fasson plastic substrates using the flexographic printing process and water -based inks. These four plastic substrates are as follows: Clear P. E. T., Clear Acetate, Polystyrene, Vinyl. These films were identified by Fasson as substrates they believe to have poor adhesion. The aim was to develop a method to predict ink adhesion of these plastic surfaces by correlating a surface energy test on the substrate before printing begins to ink adhesion tests of the finished print. Water -based inks offer many advantages over traditional solventbased inks. They are as follows: 1. They are physiologically safer. 2. They don 2 ̆ 7 t burn. 3. They don 2 ̆ 7 t cause air pollution. 4. They are tasteless and odor less. 5. Water -based inks are less expensive to store, to transport, and to produce. 6. Water is available in large quantities. The use of water -based inks is becoming more popular not only because of increased government regulations and insurance problems IV for solvent ink users, but because water -based inks produce cleaner prints, more consistent colors and faster <b>washups.</b> Water -based inks unfortunately don 2 ̆ 7 t wet a surface as good as solvent-based inks. This was the basis for this type of research...|$|R

I played with him on debut, I captained him, but he's never been my kind of person. I don't know that he's anybody's kind of person for that matter. But, {{when it came to}} playing the game, he could play - he's dedicated, talented and he got the job done. The selectors took a huge gamble in making him captain, a gamblethat unequivocally didn't pay off...I thought on the field he'd be a very astute tactical leader. He proved me very wrong in that regard. I know him as well as anybody. I went for him in the final <b>washup</b> and it was a huge error.|$|E
