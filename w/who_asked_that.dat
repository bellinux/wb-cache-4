25|$|The Aleppo {{community}} {{guarded the}} Codex zealously for some 600 years: it was kept, together {{with three other}} Biblical manuscripts, in a special cupboard (later, an iron safe) in a basement chapel of the Central Synagogue of Aleppo, {{supposed to have been}} the Cave of Elijah. It was regarded as the community's most sacred possession: Those in trouble would pray before it, and oaths were taken by it. The community received queries from Jews around the world, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> various textual details be checked, correspondence which is preserved in the responsa literature, and which allows for the reconstruction of certain details in the parts that are missing today. Most importantly, in the 1850s, Shalom Shachne Yellin sent his son in law, Moses Joshua Kimchi, to Aleppo, to copy information about the Codex; Kimchi sat for weeks, and copied thousands of details about the codex into the margins of a small handwritten Bible. The existence of this Bible was known to 20th-century scholars from the book ‘Ammudé Shesh by Shemuel Shelomo Boyarski, and then the actual Bible itself was discovered by Yosef Ofer in 1989.|$|E

2500|$|Selected to tour Australia in 1954–55, Statham's superb bowling, {{generally}} {{into the}} wind, helped the fiery Frank [...] "Typhoon" [...] Tyson win England the Ashes series by three Tests to one. Whilst he never achieved anything sensational, his {{back up to}} Tyson made sure the pressure Tyson's pace put on the Australians was maintained at both ends. With Tyson unavailable due to a blistered heel, Statham paired up with Trueman to open the bowling against South Africa at Lord's in 1955. Statham produced best bowling figures in Test matches in South Africa's second innings in the match; his 7/39 as England won by 79runs. He bowled unchanged for two hours on a good pitch in England's unexpected victory. Had injury not intervened and kept his appearances down to only half of Lancashire's County Championship matches, Statham would have had remarkable figures. The highest first-class score of his career came against Leicestershire in 1955; however, his innings was cut short on the orders of his captain, Cyril Washbrook, <b>who</b> <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> Statham get himself out {{so that he would}} be fresh to bowl. In 1956, with pitches consistently favouring spinners, Statham did so little that he failed to reach 100 wickets. Still, his 6 for 27 against the Australians was enough to show his greatness was not in doubt.|$|E

The dominant image in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem The Lady of Shalott, which is at least partly based upon Malory's story, is depicted in a painting by the Pre-Raphaelite painter John William Waterhouse, and is one that gives expression to a mythical idea that is far older than Sir Thomas Malory.|$|R
