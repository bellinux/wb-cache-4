25|$|The Model of Poesy is a Renaissance English {{treatise}} {{about the}} art of poetry written by William Scott in about 1599. It contains a theoretical description of what poetry is, and practical guidelines about how to <b>write</b> <b>well.</b> Scott, following on from Philip Sidney's An Apology for Poetry, develops his poetics in the classical and continental tradition, and includes examples from many English writers, including Geoffrey Chaucer, Edmund Spenser and William Shakespeare. Scott also quotes from his partial translation of Guillaume de Saluste Du Bartas' La Sepmaine that is found directly after the Model in the sole surviving manuscript copy of both texts. The Model was re-discovered in the early 2000s and printed in a modern critical edition, edited by Gavin Alexander, in 2013.|$|E
500|$|In {{several of}} García Márquez's works, {{including}} No One Writes to the Colonel, In Evil Hour, and Leaf Storm, he referenced La Violencia (the violence), [...] "a brutal {{civil war between}} conservatives and liberals that lasted into the 1960s, causing the deaths of several hundred thousand Colombians". Throughout all of his novels there are subtle references to la violencia. For example, characters live under various unjust situations like curfew, press censorship, and underground newspapers. In Evil Hour, while not one of García Márquez's most famous novels, is notable for its portrayal of la violencia with its [...] "fragmented portrayal of social disintegration provoked by la violencia". Although García Márquez did portray the corrupt nature and the injustices of times like la violencia, he refused to use {{his work as a}} platform for political propaganda. [...] "For him, the duty of the revolutionary writer is to <b>write</b> <b>well,</b> and the ideal novel is one that moves its reader by its political and social content, and, at the same time, by its power to penetrate reality and expose its other side.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{also contributed}} {{significantly}} to children's literature. His publication of Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79) spawned {{a revolution in the}} newly emerging genre. Its plain style, mother-child dialogues, and conversational tone inspired a generation of authors, such as Sarah Trimmer. Johnson encouraged other women to write in this genre, such as Charlotte Smith, but his recommendation always came with a caveat of how difficult it was to <b>write</b> <b>well</b> for children. For example, he wrote to Smith, [...] "perhaps you cannot employ your time and extraordinary talents more usefully for the public & your self , than in composing books for children and young people, but I am very sensible it is extreamly [...] difficult to acquire that simplicity of style which is their great recommendation". He also advised William Godwin and his second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, on the publication of their Juvenile Library (started in 1805). Not only did Johnson encourage the writing of British children's literature, but he also helped sponsor the translation and publication of popular French works such as Arnaud Berquin's [...] (1782–83).|$|E
500|$|Locke {{does not}} {{dedicate}} much space in Some Thoughts Concerning Education to outlining a specific curriculum; {{he is more}} concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills. Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children how to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor [...] "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [...] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him in the right way of knowing and improving himself." [...] But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning Latin and argues that children should first be taught to speak and <b>write</b> <b>well</b> in their native language, particularly recommending Aesop's Fables. [...] Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility. So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because {{it would be useful to}} them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also at the forefront of the scientific revolution and advocated the teaching of geography, astronomy, and anatomy. Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from scholastic humanism and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade. Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new bourgeois ethos that would come to define Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E

2500|$|Reaction to {{the novel}} was mixed among reviewers.

Finding the story unpleasant and its characters [...] "generally unlikable," [...] it yet declared it [...] "a book distinctly well written, if to <b>write</b> <b>well,</b> in making fiction, is to so write as to hold the attention of even an unwilling reader and compel him to note with something like admiration the skillful development of the traits of personages for whom he feels no liking whatever." [...] In spite of this dislike, the reviewer noted that Wright [...] "knows her trade as novelist. As novelists go she is one among ten thousand. … [...] has a keen sense of humor, good descriptive powers, a good working knowledge of human nature, an effective style. She can tell a story well." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much as Dmitry disliked his tight upper-lipped, stone-faced dad, {{later he}} had to give him credit for being the first one to have noticed and, in his emotionless way, {{appreciate}} his first poetic exercises. In July 1879, in Alupka, Crimea, Sergey Ivanovich introduced Dmitry to the legendary Princess Yekaterina [...] Vorontzova, once Pushkin's sweetheart. The grand dame admired the boy's verses: she (according to a biographer) [...] "spotted in them a must-have poetic quality: the metaphysical sensitivity of a young soul" [...] and encouraged him to soldier on. Somewhat different was young Merezhkovsky's encounter with another luminary, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, staged by his well-connected father again. As the boy started reciting his work, nervous to the point of stuttering, the famous novelist listened rather impatiently, then said: [...] "Poor, very poor. To <b>write</b> <b>well,</b> one has to suffer. Suffer!" [...] – [...] "Oh no, I'd rather he won't – either suffer, or write well!", the appalled father exclaimed. The boy left Dostoyevsky's house much frustrated by the great man's verdict. Merezhkovsky's debut publication followed the same year: Saint Petersburg magazine Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye published two of his poems, [...] "Little Cloud" [...] and [...] "The Autumn Melody". A year later another poem [...] "Narcissus" [...] was included in a charity compilation benefiting destitute students, edited by Pyotr Yakubovich.|$|E

2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to <b>write</b> <b>well,</b> don't you?
