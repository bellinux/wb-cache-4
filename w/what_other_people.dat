5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care <b>What</b> <b>Other</b> <b>People</b> Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E

25|$|Many {{explanations}} for the optimistic bias come from the goals that people want and outcomes they wish to see. People tend to view their risks as less than others {{because they believe that}} this is <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> want to see. These explanations include self-enhancement, self-presentation, and perceived control.|$|E

25|$|After {{reviewing}} the secret footage, the nominee {{was brought to}} New York City for a week of evaluation, shopping, and hair and make-up styling. Throughout the week, the nominee frequently declared {{she was unable to}} find properly fitting clothes, she disliked her body, or she didn't care <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> thought.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} shyness is a largely ego-driven fear of <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> will think of a person's behavior. This results in a person becoming scared of doing or saying {{what they want to}} out of fear of negative reactions, being laughed at, humiliated or patronised, criticism or rejection. A shy person may simply opt to avoid social situations instead.|$|E
25|$|Several of Ayckbourn's {{observations}} about celebrity culture have obvious influences in the play. One notable quote was his opinion that a dangerous mistake celebrities can make is to believe {{all the good}} things said about them, both in publicity and <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> (particularly agents) say. He also suggested that in an age of increasing anonymity, some are increasingly desperate to be noticed. The play also follows the theory that when one quickly rises to the top, one can fall just as quickly and mercilessly.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to focusing on Lorrain's story, the film explores <b>what</b> <b>other</b> obese <b>people</b> {{are doing to}} lose weight, and hears from medical authorities on misconceptions and practices in the weight loss industry. A Matter of Fat also motivated the film's director to lose weight.|$|R

I don't believe your loving me could shut up your heart--it's only adding to what you've been before, not taking away from it. For {{it seems to me}} it's the same with love and {{happiness}} as with sorrow--the more we know of it the better we can feel <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people's</b> lives are or might be, and so we shall only be more tender to 'em, and wishful to help 'em. The more knowledge a man has, the better he'll do's work; and feeling's a sort o' knowledge." ...|$|R
25|$|After making {{camp for}} the night, Prompto struggles with the {{knowledge}} that he is a clone who was intended to become a weapon. He admits to Aranea his fear of being rejected by Noctis if Noctis learns his secret and divulges his plan to run away. Aranea chastises him for being too concerned about <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> think as she was enlisted by Noctis to find him. She reveals that Verstael created a new model of magitek weapon called Immortalis that she intends to destroy, but refuses Prompto's help so long as he doubts himself. Prompto is visited by the spirit of Lunafreya who reminds him of the bonds he shared with his friends, and Prompto resolves to rejoin them.|$|E
25|$|The Qur'an cannot {{deal with}} the State of Israel {{as we know it}} today, since that State came into {{existing}} in 1948 only, i.e. many centuries after the Qur'an itself was revealed. However, the Qur'an specifies that the Land of Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people, that God Himself gave that Land to them as heritage and ordered them to live therein. It also announces that – {{before the end of the}} time – the Jewish people will come from many different countries to retake possession of that heritage of theirs. Whoever denies this actually denies the Qur'an itself. If he is not a scholar, and in good faith believes <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> say about this issue, he is an ignorant Muslim. If, on the contrary, he is informed about what the Qur'an and openly opposes it, he ceases to be a Muslim.|$|E
25|$|Dan Byrd as Travis Cobb – Jules' and Bobby's son, who is {{a senior}} in high school at the start of the series, then later attends a local college. He loves both of his parents {{although}} he is frequently embarrassed by both of them. In high school, he dealt with humiliation from his friends and classmates but has made friends at college. He is generally supportive of his mother, but finds her parenting style a bit too smothering. After dealing with his mom's real estate ads around town and his dad's new job as his former high school's grass cutter, his father helps him realize not to worry about <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> think. Spending a lot of time with his parents and their friends, he often flirts with Laurie and is shown to have a crush on her. At the end of season 4 he gets together with Laurie. During season 5 their relationship is shown to be in constant competition with Jules and Grayson's, and he and Laurie have a son named Bobby at the beginning of Season 6. He has a passion for photography and attends art college. Finding few career prospects after graduating college, he starts a mobile wine delivery business.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} fourth victory {{of the season in}} front of 110,000 people who attended the race. Johnson also earned $276,076 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I woke up (on Sunday) morning very optimistic. By about lap two or three I knew we had a very balanced car and we'd be competitive all day long, get a solid finish.", he continued, [...] "I see guys get so worried about <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> think, <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> say and {{spend a lot of time}} in those areas. That's not what works for me. (I) don't watch television; don't watch or read any of the trade papers or magazines.

500|$|In Infinite Love is the Only Truth (2005), Icke {{introduces}} {{his three}} categories of people. The Brotherhood are [...] "interactive software programs", or [...] "Red Dresses". They lack consciousness and free will, and their human bodies are holographic veils. A second group, the [...] "sheeple" [...] (the vast majority of humanity), are conscious, but do as they are told and are the Brotherhood's main energy source. They include the [...] "repeaters", people in positions of influence who repeat <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> tell them; he cites doctors, teachers and journalists as examples.|$|E
5000|$|To us, science, art, ideology, law, religion, technology, mathematics, even {{nowadays}} {{ethics and}} epistemology, seem genuine enough genres of cultural expression {{to lead us}} to ask (and ask, and ask) to <b>what</b> degree <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> possess them, and {{to the degree that}} they do possess them what from do they take, and given the form they take what light has that to shed on our own version of them.”(92) ...|$|R
5000|$|First {{reactions}} to the Song of the Bell were without exception positive. Its success was attributed to each person’s being able to find meaning in it. At a solemn meeting of the Royal Academy in Schiller Year 1859, Jacob Grimm praised “this incomparable poem, far superior to <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> can offer,” and declared {{it to be a}} national symbol of unity [...] ). But despite great enthusiasm for Schiller’s longest poem there was also considerable criticism. It was too emotional, too lofty, too garrulous; people criticized technical details, and over 100 parodies were written. Those of the 19th century were not critical of the original, which was greatly admired, but instead strived to make use of this very well known poem for their own ends. Many Bell parodies shifted the observations about the production process to the production of food and drinks like bread, beer and coffee.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Decies came {{every day}} to inquire, but I could not bear a strange eye, and Hester might have been looking on. I was {{steeling}} myself against him. Was I right?--oh! was I right? I have wondered and grieved! For I knew well enough {{what he had been}} thinking of for months before; only I did not want it to come to a point. How was I to leave little Alured to Jaquetta? or disturb my father by breaking up his home? I liked him on the whole, and had come the length of thinking that if I ever married at all, it would be-- But that's all nonsense; and mine could not have been <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people's</b> love was, or I should not have shrunk from the sight and look of him. If it had been only poverty that was coming, {{it would have been a}} different thing; but to be nameless impostors! ...|$|R
500|$|During {{the late}} 1860s and early 1870s, from within his father's firm in Charing Cross and, by late 1874, {{from a nearby}} address in Craig's Court, Carte began to build an operatic, concert and lecture {{management}} agency. His two hundred clients eventually included Charles Gounod, Jacques Offenbach, Adelina Patti, Mario, Clara Schumann, Antoinette Sterling, Edward Lloyd, Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, George Grossmith, Matthew Arnold, James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. Hesketh Pearson said of Carte: [...] "His acute business sense was aided by a frank and agreeable manner.... He took <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> thought were risks, but he felt were certainties. He knew everyone worth knowing... and his practical judgement was as sure as his sense of artistry." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover artwork was {{designed}} by Los Angeles-based Smog Design, following a concept sent by Roth. Smog co-owner John Heiden picked the image, featuring a New York Central Railroad J-3A Dreyfuss Hudson [...] steam locomotive, photographed by Robert Yarnall Richie, from the Southern Methodist University's photo library, stating he chose it because [...] "Richie's angle on the photo makes it look like the locomotive is in motion and coming off the page". Aside from the reversed angle of the train, the artwork is shares similarities to the 1975 Commodores album Movin' On. The booklet includes Roth's hand-written lyrics for the songs. Regarding the title, Eddie stated that he liked it because [...] "there's always their reality of <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> think, and there's just the different kind of truth, which is the real truth." ...|$|E
500|$|In interviews, Gane and Sadier have {{discussed}} their musical philosophy. According to Gane [...] "to be unique {{was more important}} than to be good." [...] On the subject of being too obscure, he said in a 1996 interview that [...] "maybe the area where we're on dodgy ground, is this idea that you need great knowledge [...] esoteric music to understand what we're doing." [...] Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she [...] "think we have achieved a music that will make sense {{to a lot of people}} whether they know about Steve Reich or not." [...] The duo were up-front about their desire to grow the group's sound: for Gane, [...] "otherwise it just sounds like <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> are doing," [...] and for Sadier, [...] "you trust that there is more and that it can be done more interesting." ...|$|E
50|$|He did {{address the}} point that as British {{subjects}} in the King of Belgium's service, he and Stairs might come into armed conflict with competing British interests (the British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes). He wrote that in this eventuality they would discharge their duties to their employer, {{but he did not}} consider <b>what</b> <b>other</b> British <b>people</b> might think of this. Moloney did not think of Belgium as a serious rival to the British Empire, unlike France, Germany or Portugal.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the mid-nineteenth}} century the role of {{accountants}} in England and Wales was restricted to that of bookkeepers in that accountants merely maintained records of <b>what</b> <b>other</b> business <b>people</b> had purchased and sold.

40|$|Three studies tested {{whether people}} use cues {{about the way}} <b>other</b> <b>people</b> think [...] -for example, whether others respond fast vs. slow [...] -to infer <b>what</b> {{responses}} <b>other</b> <b>people</b> might give to reasoning problems. People who solve reasoning problems using deliberative thinking have better insight than intuitive problem-solvers into the responses that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> might give to the same problems. Presumably because deliberative responders think of intuitive responses before they think of deliberative responses, they are aware that others might respond intuitively, particularly in circumstances that hinder deliberative thinking (e. g., fast responding). Intuitive responders, on the other hand, are less aware of alternative responses to theirs, so they infer that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> respond as they do, regardless of the way others respond...|$|R
500|$|Feynman devoted {{the latter}} half of his book What Do You Care <b>What</b> <b>Other</b> <b>People</b> Think? to his {{experience}} on the Rogers Commission, straying from his usual convention of brief, light-hearted anecdotes to deliver an extended and sober narrative. Feynman's account reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that NASA management's estimate of the reliability of the space shuttle was unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used it to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), [...] "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled." ...|$|E
500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Hunt as [...] "confident", [...] "innovative", [...] "intelligent", {{while he}} {{also can be}} [...] "aggressive", [...] "brazen", [...] "presumptuous", [...] "hasty and rash". McKidd said of his character: [...] " [...] He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him that I think is really interesting and exciting to play. [...] " [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: [...] "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|... "En La Disco" [...] (""), {{originally}} from Escorpiones (2004), features an Arabic-influenced beat infused with reggaetón. Lyrically, Queen assures her lover {{that if she}} finds him in the club, she promises to dance with him disregarding <b>what</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> {{have to say about}} it. She assures him {{that there will be no}} other like her. [...] "Miles De Voces" [...] (""), a hip hop track from Buddha's Family (2001), contains simple harmonic progressions, synthesizers, affronted lyrics and a sociopolitical theme while alternating between major and minor key. [...] "La Abusadora" [...] ("The Abuser") originates from Iván Joy's Diamond Hits (2004). While reviewing the compilation Reggaeton Diamond Hits (2006), Steve Leggett, from Allmusic, named the song the highlight of the album. [...] "Aunque La Distancia" [...] ("") was originally included on the compilation release Romances Del Ruido 2 (2003) by Baby Rasta & Gringo as [...] "Llora Mi Corazón" [...] (""). Queen's rap contributes to a hip hop beat accompanied by Gran Omar. It is also known by the name of [...] "Eres Mi Hombre" [...] (""). [...] "Yo Lamento" [...] (Salsa Version), also from Contra La Corriente, is essentially the same track only re-recorded and mixed into salsa with a duration of four minutes and sixteen seconds; the longest on the album and only salsa track. In the song, Queen sings to her friend about loving her friend's man. She tells her that she had never intended to hurt her. Queen assures that she loves her friend, but acknowledges the fact that their friendship was lost. [...] "He looked at me and we started dancing while the music took us away. Dancing, he touched me. My mind wasn't thinking, passion was leading. My friend don't think that I don't love you", she sings.|$|E

50|$|Psychologists Elaine Hatfield and John Cacioppo, {{along with}} Richard Rapson, have {{extensively}} researched emotional contagion and {{have found that}} people's conscious assessments of others' feelings were heavily influenced by <b>what</b> <b>others</b> said. <b>People's</b> own emotions, however, were more influenced by others' nonverbal cues {{as opposed to what}} they were really feeling. Recognizing emotions and acknowledging their origin can be one way to avoid emotional contagion. Transference of emotions has been studied in a variety of situations and settings, with social and physiological causes being two of the largest areas of research.|$|R
