5|$|She {{was also}} a believer and a {{practitioner}} of magic, performing curses against those who she felt deserved it: in one case she cursed a fellow academic, Jaroslav Černý, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that his promotion {{to the position of}} Professor of Egyptology over her friend Walter Bryan Emery was unworthy. Her curse entailed mixing up ingredients in a frying pan, and was undertaken in the presence of two colleagues. In another instance, she was claimed to have created a wax image of Kaiser Wilhelm II and then melted it during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in April, {{while on}} NXT Redemption, Natalya became allied with former Hart Dynasty partner Tyson Kidd again, and started feuding with former protégé Kaitlyn <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> Kaitlyn was paying Kidd too much attention. The pair faced off in both singles and tag team {{competition}} throughout mid-2012, including being {{on opposite sides}} of a six-Diva tag team match at Money in the Bank, which Natalya's team lost. Their feud ended on August 31, when Natalya lost to Kaitlyn in a singles match on SmackDown. In November, Natalya began an on-screen relationship with The Great Khali. The following month, Natalya saved Hornswoggle from an attack by Rosa Mendes, thus turning face in the process. This led to a feud with Natalya, Khali, and Hornswoggle facing off against Mendes and her allies, Primo and Epico in mixed tag team matches in early 2013. On the March 27 episode of NXT, Natalya lost a Divas Championship match to champion Kaitlyn.|$|E
5|$|That month, Lovato also {{announced}} her departure from Sonny with a Chance, putting her acting career on hiatus and ending the series; she later {{said that she}} would return to acting <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> confident doing so. Her departure led to the spin-off series So Random! with the Sonny cast, featuring sketches from the former show-within-a-show. The series was cancelled after one season. Lovato released her third album, Unbroken, on September 20, 2011. Begun in July 2010, the album experimented with R and featured less pop rock. The album and the stylistic change received mixed reviews from critics, who saw a growth in musicianship because of her struggles and have praised Lovato's vocals but found the music more generic than her previous efforts. The record was a commercial success, peaking at number four on the Billboard 200, with sales exceeding 97,000 copies in its first week of release, and going on to sell over 500,000 copies in the United States, being certified Gold.|$|E

25|$|Wagner was {{acknowledged}} by the Guinness Book of Records {{for having the}} longest run in a single role on television, a position she held until 2010. She did not play the role without interruption - she was temporarily dropped from the series after {{the first six months}} due to conflicts with creator Irna Phillips. Wagner also left the series in 1981, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that writers were not interested in the veteran players and returned as a regular character in 1985.|$|E
25|$|Particularly strong links {{have been}} {{identified}} between creativity and mood disorders, particularly manic-depressive disorder (a.k.a. bipolar disorder) and depressive disorder (a.k.a. unipolar disorder). In Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament, Kay Redfield Jamison summarizes studies of mood-disorder rates in writers, poets, and artists. She also explores research that identifies mood disorders in such famous writers and artists as Ernest Hemingway (who shot himself after electroconvulsive treatment), Virginia Woolf (who drowned herself <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> a depressive episode coming on), composer Robert Schumann (who died in a mental institution), and even the famed visual artist Michelangelo.|$|E
25|$|While {{she enjoyed}} primary school, Manson was bullied while {{in her first}} year at {{secondary}} school, causing her to suffer from depression and body dysmorphic disorder and engage in self-injury: she carried sharp objects in the laces of her boots and would cut herself <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> low self-esteem, stress, or anxiety. The bullying stopped when Manson associated herself with a rebel crowd, which resulted in her rebelling herself. She was absent {{for most of her}} final year at school and began smoking cannabis, sniffing glue, drinking alcohol, shoplifting, and on one occasion breaking into Edinburgh Zoo. Manson had teenage ambitions to become an actress, but was rejected by the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD). Her first job was volunteer work in a local hospital's cafeteria, then as a breakfast waitress at a local hotel, before spending five years as a shop assistant for Miss Selfridge. She started on the shop's makeup counters, but was eventually moved into stockrooms because of her attitude toward customers. She became well known throughout Edinburgh's clubbing scene; making use of free samples from Miss Selfridge, she styled hair for a number of local bands. Manson also briefly modelled clothing for Jackie magazine.|$|E

But she hardened herself once more, though the effort cost her a year of her life. She had never collapsed, she had never fallen into hysteria.|$|R
500|$|Leech's regimen {{differed}} from most swimmers because Froelich {{was not an}} advocate of distance training, and designed shorter workouts for his students. She trained once a day, swimming no more than [...] Froelich did not push her to continue swimming laps <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> tired, but emphasised an efficient stroke mechanism, which Leech implemented with a long and graceful arm action. Leech stood 180 centimetres (5'11"), but weighed only , with broad shoulders, slim hips and large hands and feet. Her long streamlined action prompted observers to call her a [...] "flying fish". Spinal problems caused by a back misalignment prevented her from using the optimal flip turn preferred by freestyle swimmers. Instead, {{she was forced to}} utilise the touch turn, which was slower.|$|E
500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by the American rapper Eminem, featuring the Barbadian singer Rihanna, from Eminem's seventh studio album Recovery (2010). The singer and songwriter Skylar Grey wrote and recorded a demo of the song alongside the producer Alex da Kid <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> she was in an abusive romantic relationship with the music industry. Eminem wrote the verses and chose Rihanna to sing the chorus, resulting in a collaboration influenced by their past experiences in difficult relationships. Recording sessions were held in Ferndale, Michigan, and Dublin, Ireland. Backed by guitar, piano and violin, the track is a midtempo hip hop ballad with a pop refrain, sung by Rihanna, and describes two lovers who refuse to separate despite being in a dangerous love–hate relationship.|$|E
500|$|Boyack {{said that}} she would be a [...] "listening leader" [...] who would tackle funding {{shortfalls}} in the National Health Service (NHS) and local government. She also {{said that she}} would publish 100 new ideas aimed at improving lives after meeting people during her campaign. Positioning herself as a unifying candidate who would make the party [...] "fit for purpose", she called for [...] "bold and radical" [...] new approaches to policy, which would require Labour to be honest about funding crises in local government and health. She pledged that, if elected, she would work with the SNP government <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it was {{in the best interest of}} Scotland to do so, but said Labour would also be an effective opposition, holding the government to account when necessary.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Alex Borstein, under the pen name of [...] "a.bo", and {{directed}} by Zac Moncrief. The story {{is based on a}} one-woman show Borstein worked on, entitled Women and Jews: Why We'll Never Be President. The storyline came out <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that a woman [...] "will never be president," [...] stating, [...] "I had these fantasies about a woman president that would be fair and there'd be no corruption. That's a bunch of bullshit fantasy." [...] Borstein called the episode [...] "kind of my homage to Hillary Clinton." [...] The staff enjoyed the episode's storyline so much, that Borstein and fellow writer Cherry Chevapravatdumrong wrote a novelization of the episode. Borstein called the book a [...] "companion piece poking fun" [...] at Clinton's book It Takes a Village.|$|E
500|$|In her memoir, Stanton {{credits the}} Cadys' neighbor, Rev. Simon Hosack, with {{strongly}} encouraging her intellectual development and academic abilities {{at a time}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> these were undervalued by her father. Writing of her brother Eleazar's death in 1826, Stanton remembers trying to comfort her father, saying that she would try to be all her brother had been. At the time, her father's response devastated Stanton: [...] "Oh, my daughter, I wish you were a boy!" [...] Understanding from this that her father valued boys above girls, Stanton tearfully took her disappointment to Hosack, whose firm belief in her abilities counteracted her father's perceived disparagement. Hosack went on to teach Stanton Greek, encouraged her to read widely, and ultimately bequeathed to her his own Greek lexicon along with other books. His confirmation of her intellectual abilities strengthened Stanton's confidence and self-esteem.|$|E
500|$|After a {{short time}} living with Ehnni's family, the couple {{relocated}} to Algiers. Eberhardt became disappointed with Ehnni, whose only ambition after leaving the army appeared to be finding an unskilled job {{that would allow him}} to live relatively comfortably. She increased her own efforts as a writer, and several of her short stories were printed in the local press. She accepted a job offer from Al-Akhbar (...) newspaper publisher Victor Barrucand in March 1902. Ebrhardt became a regular contributor to the newspaper; Trimardeur began appearing as a serial in August 1903. Barrucand and Eberhardt formed a friendship, though Barrucand was frequently frustrated with his new employee's work ethic. Eberhardt's articles arrived irregularly, as she would only write <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> like doing so. Her job paid poorly, but had many benefits. Through Barrucand's contacts, Eberhardt was able to access the famous zawiya of Lalla Zaynab. Eberhardt spoke highly of her time with Zaynab, though never disclosed what the two discussed; their meeting, however, caused concern among the French authorities.|$|E

500|$|Hindley lodged an {{unsuccessful}} appeal against her conviction {{immediately after the}} trial. Brady and Hindley corresponded by letter until 1971, when she ended their relationship. The two remained in sporadic contact for several months, but Hindley {{had fallen in love}} with one of her prison officers, Patricia Cairns. A former assistant governor claimed that such relationships were not unusual in Holloway at that time, as [...] "many of the officers were gay, and involved in relationships either with one another or with inmates". Hindley successfully petitioned to have her status as a category A prisoner changed to category B, which enabled Governor Dorothy Wing to take her on a walk round Hampstead Heath, part of her unofficial policy of reintroducing her charges to the outside world <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> they were ready. The excursion caused a furore in the national press and earned Wing an official rebuke from the then Home Secretary Robert Carr. With Cairns's assistance and the outside contacts of another prisoner, Maxine Croft, Hindley planned a prison escape, but it was thwarted when impressions of the prison keys were intercepted by an off-duty policeman. Cairns was sentenced to six years in jail for her part in the plot.|$|E
500|$|According to Carey, writing [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{helped her}} get through rough {{emotional}} moments with her label's management, and even times <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> overwhelmed by others. During {{the early stages}} of the album, Carey said she felt pressured to complete the Rainbow album as quickly as possible, due to the fact that it was the last album under her contract with Columbia. During troubled times for the singer, as well as her divorce from record executive Tommy Mottola, she claimed writing and singing the song helped her get through troubled times and hoped her listeners would get the same message out of it. Carey thought it would become an anthem for fans and listeners who were going through difficult times in their life and could relate to the song. Additionally, during the taping of the Mariah Carey Homecoming Special, Carey told audience members that after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, she felt the song would help family members and friends of the victims during the tragedy, and hoped it would give them strength to get by the tragic event. For that reason, Carey included the song on the album, and campaigned for its radio release in mid-2000.|$|E
2500|$|Because of Julianna Soong's {{inability}} to conceive children, Data {{has at least}} five robotic siblings (two of which are Lore and B-4). Later on, his [...] "mother" [...] is revealed also to be his positronic sister as the real Julianna Soong died and was replaced with an identical Soong-type android, the most advanced one that Dr. Soong was known to have built. Data constructed a daughter, which he named [...] "Lal" [...] in the episode [...] "". This particular android exceeded her father in basic human emotion <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> fear toward Starfleet's scientific interests in her.

50|$|Born in Algiers, Bensemra {{has worked}} as a photojournalist since 1990. Zohra Bensemra stated in her Reuters profile that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> first became a {{photographer}} in 1995. There was a car bombing in the Algerian capital, close to the newspaper where she was working.

She first worked for Reuters as a stringer during the Algerian Civil War in 1997. She went on in 2000 to cover the conflict between the Albanians and the Serbs in Macedonia. She was also assigned to Iraq in 2003. While working in Najaf, she became a staff photographer for Reuters. She has since covered the referendum in Sudan, the Tunisian uprising and the revolution in Libya.|$|R

She {{spent most of her}} time with her family, trying [...] "to unwind", and visiting different places around the world which provides some inspiration to her song writing. She returned to work in 1993 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it was the right time to start writing and recording a new studio album with her longtime recording partners, arranger and producer Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. Enya received further soundtrack offers during the recording of The Memory of Trees, but turned them down as she wished to concentrate solely on the album.|$|E
2500|$|On June 4, 1947, seven-year-old Angela Volpini was grazing cattle {{near her}} {{hometown}} of Casanova Staffora, near Oltrepò Pavese in northwest Italy, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> someone embrace her from behind and lift her up. Assuming it was her aunt, {{she turned around and}} saw [...] "a woman's face – beautiful, sweet and unknown." [...] The apparitions occurred on the fourth day of every month for ten years, and many were filmed. Volpini's father supported her, but her mother, while believing in the apparitions, feared for the girl's life. The local priest, Gianni Baget Bozzo, believed the child and formed a lifelong friendship with her. He often compared the apparitions to those of Our Lady of Lourdes. On his death May 8, 2009, he left one-sixth of his fortune to Volpini. People who believe in Volpini's experiences formed a devotional organization called Nova Cana—the name invented by Volpini herself—to commemorate the events.|$|E

And <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it so frequently, she was tempted to touch it with her finger. And when she wanted to do so, that little skin went down her throat on its own.
