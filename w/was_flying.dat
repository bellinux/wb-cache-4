5|$|Subsequent {{analyses}} {{called the}} original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional {{data from a}} variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who <b>was</b> <b>flying</b> four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.|$|E
