As a distinguished physician (he is professor emeritus of Neurology at the University of London) and a long-time researcher in natural family planning (NFP), Dr. Marshall's opinion is likely to carry much weight, especially as he bases his arguments on correspondence with 10, 000 couples he has taught NFP during the past 40 years. In this paper I {{do not intend to}} give a detailed critique of the book or its author. Suffice to say that Dr. Marshall, as one of the original six members of the Birth Control Commission of 1964, called by Pope Paul VI to examine the legitimacy of the anovulant Pill, voted with the majority report to change the Church's teaching. Marshall's Thesis <b>What</b> <b>concerns</b> <b>me</b> in this paper is Dr. Marshall's contention that the experience of married couples shows that "the basic problem on which the teaching on contraception was based was flawed. " He charges that "the nature of intercourse can only be discovered by the experience of couples and by scientific observation. So the appeal to authority is not convincing in this field. " 1 In the final chapter in which Dr. Marshall makes these statements, he is specifically referring to the fact that in his view, couples do not experience every act of intercourse as open to life. But, throughout, he is citing the negative experiences of some couples he has instructed in NFP as the primary argument for changing official Church teaching, since, he believes, they face an unacceptable moral dilemma. 2 In other words Dr. Marshall believes that the documentation concerning negative experiences of couples he has amassed is irrefutable evidence of the Church's mistaken view on responsible parenthood.

This is dangerous for both methodological and policy reasons. To be fair to our field, an enormous amount of work at the intersection of macroeconomics and corporate finance has been chasing many of the issues that played a central role during the current crisis, including liquidity evaporation, collateral shortages, bubbles, crises, panics, fire sales, risk-shifting, contagion, and the like. However, much of this literature belongs to the periphery of macroeconomics rather than to its core. I will discuss the distinction between the core and the periphery of macroeconomics as well as the futile nature of the integrationist movement—that is, the process of gradually bringing the insights of the periphery into the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium structure. I argue that the complexity of macroeconomic interactions limits the knowledge we can ever attain, and that we need to place this fact at the center of our analysis. We should consider what this complexity does to the actions and reactions of the economic agent, and seek analytical tools and macroeconomic policies that are robust to the enormous uncertainty to which we are confined. ...|$|R

To be honest, this inability to predict does not <b>concern</b> <b>me</b> much. It is almost tautological that severe crises are essentially unpredictable, for otherwise they would not cause such {{a high degree of}} distress. Of course, it is well-known that certain elements can increase the fragility of a financial system, such as high levels of leverage or mismatches between short-term liabilities and long-term assets, and that these issues may justify policy intervention. But knowing these mechanisms is quite different from arguing that a severe crisis can be predicted. Modern Cassandras will always claim to have seen the crisis coming. What they will not say is how many times they saw things coming that never materialized, or how the specific mechanisms behind the crisis are different from those on which their predictions were based. In my view, the conviction that one can foretell a severe crisis in advance is mostly a manifestation of pareidolia—the psychological phenomenon that makes people see faces and animals in clouds and the like. <b>What</b> does <b>concern</b> <b>me</b> about my discipline, however, is that its current core —by which I mainly mean the so-called dynamic stochastic general equilibrium approach—has become so mesmerized with its own internal logic that it has begun to confuse the precision it has achieved about its own world with the precision that it has about the real one.
