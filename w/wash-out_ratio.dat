40|$|Many {{researchers}} have established {{the utility of}} the dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in the differential diagnosis {{in the head and neck}} region, especially in the salivary gland tumors. The subjective assessment of the pattern of the time-intensity curve (TIC) or the simple quantification of the TIC, such as the time to peak enhancement () and the <b>wash-out</b> <b>ratio</b> (WR), is commonly used. Although the semiquantitative evaluations described above have been widely applied, they do not provide information on the underlying pharmacokinetic analysis in tissue. The quantification of DCE-MRI is preferable; therefore, many compartment model analyses have been proposed. The Toft and Kermode (TK) model is one of the most popular compartment models, which provide information about the influx forward volume transfer constant from plasma into the extravascular-extracellular space (EES) and the fractional volume of EES per unit volume of tissue is used in many clinical studies. This paper will introduce the method of pharmacokinetic analysis and also describe the clinical application of this technique in the head and neck region...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the development of a risk assessment system for new chemical substances, estimation methods concerning exposure of man and environment through air have been investigated. The pathways through which exposure through air takes place in this risk assessment system are exposure of human beings by inhalation and exposure of soils by deposition. Previous research (Noordijk & De Leeuw, 1991) has shown that for new chemical substances the existing Operational Priority Substances (OPS) atmospheric transport model (Van Jaarsveld, 1990) is an appropriate tool for the estimation of atmospheric concentrations and deposition fluxes, if some additional parameter estimation procedures are added. This concerns the estimation of the partitioning between gas phase and aerosol, the <b>wash-out</b> <b>ratio,</b> the dry deposition velocity and the atmospheric reaction rate. This report focusses on the implementation of the reported estimation methods within the risk assessment system, using the OPS-model. For this purpose, a simple table has been constructed reflecting simulated concentrations and deposition fluxes as a function of substance characteristics. In order to obtain information on variance in the results, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out for the main parameters and some source characteristics. Ranges of uncertainty are obtained through this analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the last}} few years new {{potential}} applications have been developed for contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and the management of breast diseases, but there is still some debate concerning the optimal dose to evaluate breast lesions, especially as a diagnostic tool. Purpose: To compare different CEUS doses of injected contrast agent in order to establish an optimal dose for the diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. Material and Methods: In Group A we compared the bolus dose of 1. 2 mL vs. 2. 4 mL and in Group B we compared the bolus dose of 2. 4 mL vs. 4. 8 mL (26 and 25 invasive carcinomas, respectively). CEUS was performed in real-time contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) using a L 9 - 3 MHz probe. All examinations were recorded in a contrast side/side imaging mode loop for 120 s. Wash-in and wash-out patterns of the contrast agent were analyzed with advanced US quantification software and kinetic curves were used for statistical analysis. Results: In Group B (2. 4 mL vs. 4. 8 mL), more and stronger correlation was found among kinetic parameters (area under the curve, P< 0. 00001; lognormal model parameters, mu, P = 0. 0007 and sigma, P< 0. 0001; mean transit time, P< 0. 0001; model-based <b>wash-out</b> <b>ratios,</b> W- 21 m, P = 0. 0002; W- 50 m, P = 0. 0001; time-to-peak, P = 0. 005) as compared to Group A (1. 2 mL vs. 2. 4 mL). Conclusion: The optimal way to evaluate kinetic features of invasive breast tumors using real-time CEUS is with an injection of contrast agent of either 2. 4 mL or 4. 8 mL...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of three Lactobacillus plantarum strains on in-vivo small intestinal barrier function and gene transcription in human subjects. The strains were selected for their differential effects on TLR signalling and tight junction protein rearrangement, which may lead to beneficial effects in a stressed human gut mucosa. Ten healthy volunteers participated in four different intervention periods: 7 -day oral intake of either L. plantarum WCFS 1, CIP 48 (CIP 104448), TIFN 101 (CIP 104450) or placebo, proceeded by a 4 weeks <b>wash-out</b> period. Lactulose-rhamnose <b>ratio</b> (an indicator of small intestinal permeability) increased after intake of indomethacin, which was given as an artificial stressor of the gut mucosal barrier (mean ratio 0. 06 ± 0. 04 to 0. 10 ± 0. 06, p= 0. 001), but was not significantly affected by the bacterial interventions. However, gene transcription pathway analysis in small intestinal biopsies, obtained by gastroduodenoscopy, demonstrated that particularly L. plantarum TIFN 101 modulated cell-cell adhesion with high turnover of genes involved in tight- and adhesion junction protein synthesis and degradation (e. g. actinin alpha- 4, metalloproteinase- 2). These effects were less pronounced for L. plantarum WCFS 1 and CIP 104448. In conclusion, L. plantarum TIFN 101 induced the most pronounced probiotic properties with specific effects on repair processes in the compromised intestine of healthy subjects...|$|R

The analysis included patient data, such as age, gender, BMI (body mass index); tumor characteristics such as tumor size, pT stage, side, polarity, RENAL score, which categorizes renal masses by complexity for surgical decision making, Leibovich score, which predicts metastases free survival after surgical therapy, tumor posteriorly located (yes/no), histology, lymphovascular invasion, necrosis on imaging, necrosis in histology; and procedural and injection techniques characteristics such as volume of the isotope, number of injections, spillage on imaging, defined by a spillage of the tracer >[*] 25 % outside of the tumor seen on SPECT/CT images, depot properly injected, defined as having a depot of the tracer >[*] 75 % inside the tumor (yes/no), depot located anteriorly (yes/no), whereas kidney was divided anterior and posterior on coronal plane {{at the level of}} hilar vessels, to determine the complexity of injection because injection anteriorly is more challenging, actual time between injection and early scintigraphic imaging, time between injection and late scintigraphic imaging, kidney/liver activity ratio (calculated by drawing a region of interest (ROI) over the depot in the kidney, then dividing the maximum number of counts in this ROI by the maximum number of counts in a second ROI over the liver) at both early and late planar scintigraphy as a potential indicator of wash-out of the tracer; and outcome parameters such as any distant metastases (yes/no), death (yes/no) (Table  1). Additional logistic regression was performed with age categories split at median age of the patients to test whether this cut-off can be used to define a group of patients with a non-visualization. For testing wash-out association with non-visualization, we calculated the ratio (activity in the kidney) / (activity in the liver), whereas higher grades of radiotracer <b>wash-out</b> decrease this <b>ratio.</b> P value ≤[*] 0.05 was considered statistically significant and all tests were two-sided. Odds ratios are presented with their 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Factors for which p value reached <[*] 0.1 in a univariable analysis were included in a multivariable model.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{correlate}} contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) kinetic parameters {{with traditional}} and molecular prognostic factors in invasive breast cancer. METHODS: Seventy-five invasive breast cancers were evaluated with contrast harmonic imaging after the injection of a bolus dose of 2. 4 ml sulphur hexafluoride microbubble contrast agent. The lognormal function {{was used for}} quantitative analysis of kinetic data. These parameters correlated with traditional prognostic factors (tumour size, histological type, tumour grade, axillary lymph node status) and immunohistochemical biomarkers (ER, PR and HER 2 status). RESULTS: Statistically significant correlation was found between time-to-peak and tumour grade (P value = 0. 023), PR status (P value = 0. 042) and axillary node status (P value = 0. 025). <b>Wash-out</b> <b>ratio,</b> measured at 21 s {{was significantly associated with}} ER status (P value = 0. 042) and PR status (P value = 0. 026). CONCLUSIONS: Invasive breast carcinomas exhibiting earlier peak enhancement and faster elimination of microbubble contrast agent at CEUS are found to be associated with established predictors of poor prognosis. KEY POINTS: * Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) can potentially determine the aggressiveness of invasive breast cancers. * Early peak enhancement and accelerated wash-out at CEUS suggest poor prognosis. * CEUS kinetics are similar to that of DCE-MRI in assessing tumour aggressiveness...|$|E
40|$|The BSC-DREAM 8 b {{model and}} its {{predecessor}} are analysed {{in terms of}} aerosol optical depth (AOD) for 2004 over Northern Africa, the Mediterranean and the Middle East. We discuss the model performance and we test and analyse its behaviour with new components. The results are evaluated using hourly data from 44 AERONET stations and seasonally averaged satellite observations. The operational versions strongly underestimate the winter AOD over the Sahel and overestimate the AOD over the Middle East and the Mediterranean achieving a low average annual correlation (~ 0. 35). The use of a more detailed size distribution and a corrected <b>wash-out</b> <b>ratio,</b> together with a new dry deposition scheme, improves the transport over the Mediterranean, although underestimations remain over the Sahel and overestimations over the Middle East. The inclusion of a &#x 2018;preferential source&#x 2019; mask improves the localisation of the main North African sources and consequently the dust transport towards Europe and the Atlantic. The use of a more physically based dust emission scheme and a new soil texture database leads to significant improvements in the representation of emissions and the transport over the Sahel, achieving an average annual correlation of 0. 53. In this case, {{the use of a}} preferential source mask does not introduce significant improvements...|$|E
40|$|At the German Antarctic {{research}} station (709, 8 "W), long-term {{observations of the}} chemical and radio-chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter were started in spring 1983. Based on the analysis of high-volume aerosol filters sampled continuously for nearly 5 years, concentration records of the following aerosol components are presented here: (a) major ions (sea-salt, sulfate, nitrate); (b) cosmogenic 7 Be and terrigeneous 210 Pb; (c) trace elements (crustal Mn, heavy metal Pb). All species mentioned, {{with the exception of}} stable and radioactive Pb, show annual cycles. The maximum occurs in austral summer for 7 Be, sulfate, and crustal Mn. For sea-salt, however, the maximum is found in local autumn, and for nitrate in local spring. In local summer, the enhanced 'Be to 210 Pb ratio is attributed to intenser large scale vertical mixing. The pattern of total sulfate seems to be controlled by the nss-sulfate production from marine organo-sulfur species during local summer, whereas in polar night, nss-sulfate shows very low or even negative concentration. Crustal aerosol (indicated by Mn) shows a mean summer contribution of 16 ng/SCM which exceeds the mean winter level by more than a factor of two. Based on a mean <b>wash-out</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 27. 106 observed for 210 Pb bearing aerosol particles, a Pb snow concentration of 3. 0 pg/g is deduced from the mean air concentration of 11 pg/SCM. 1...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{computed}} tomography (CT) {{is widely used}} in humans to determine tumor perfusion via time-attenuation curves. Five types of time-attenuation curves have been identified and shown to have prognostic relevance in humans. The goal of our study {{was to assess the}} feasibility of this technology in spontaneous canine tumors and to determine time-attenuation curves and perfusion patterns in different tumor types. Thirty-one dogs with tumors accessible for biopsy were evaluated (15 carcinomas, 16 sarcomas). Dynamic CT was performed {{at the level of the}} largest tumor cross-section. Time-attenuation curves were calculated and ratios from the tumor to a contralateral artery were derived for wash-in, peak attenuation, time to peak attenuation, wash-out, and perfusion. Median perfusion was significantly higher and median time to peak ratio was significantly shorter in carcinomas and bone sarcomas compared with soft tissue sarcomas (P = 0. 03 and 0. 01). There was a trend of lower median upslope and <b>wash-out</b> <b>ratio</b> in soft tissue sarcomas in comparison with carcinomas (P = 0. 06 and 0. 09). Although peak ratio was lowest in soft tissue sarcomas, differences were not significant (P = 0. 3). The most common type of time-attenuation curve for all tumors had a slow to moderately rapid wash-in with a low to moderate attenuation peak followed by a plateau phase. In conclusion, dynamic CT is feasible and time-activity curve-derived measurements differed between spontaneous canine tumors. More data has to be collected in a larger number of patients and correlated with response to treatment and outcome...|$|E
40|$|Contrast-enhanced {{ultrasound}} or CEUS is {{a combination}} of the pharmacokinetics of contrast agents (or microbubbles-based ultrasound contrast agents), the signal processing of these agents and the contrast-specific imaging modality. One of the main objectives of this method is to gather vascular information (from large vessels to capillaries) in different organs or tumors by increasing the signal intensity from blood. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the kinetic value of real-time harmonic imaging contrast- enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in breast tumors as a differential diagnostic tool and correlate it with prognostic factors in invasive breast carcinomas. Successful introduction of a new imaging method always requires studies evaluating the technical parameters for optimal diagnostic performance. Concerning CEUS for imaging breast tumors, the mode of injection and dose of injected agent can be identified among these parameters. Therefore two methodology studies are included in this work (Studies I and III). In Study I we evaluated which method is to prefer between bolus and continuous infusion of equal doses of contrast agent, in order to achieve the best technique to gather vascular information of breast tumors. We observed that the qualitative assessment of the curves after bolus administration of contrast agent provided sharply demarcated tumors with clear visible wash-in and wash-out patterns in all cases. The continuous infusion with the same doses of contrast agent was not able to show a clear wash-in/wash-out in any case. In Study II we investigated whether kinetic parameters of real time harmonic CEUS imaging could be used to differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumors. The study showed that real time harmonic contrast enhanced ultrasound as a kinetic tool in the breast can detect significant differences between benign and malignant tumors, when evaluating two main parameters: time-to-peak and <b>wash-out</b> <b>ratio.</b> Both parameters have been observed to be earlier/faster in malignancies when compared with benign tumors. We observed the fact that after 21 seconds the malignant tumors tends to eliminate more than 50 % of the total amount of contrast, while the benign tumors tends to eliminates less than 50 % (mean values are 69 % respective 36 % elimination of contrast at 21 seconds). In Study III we compared different doses of injected contrast agent in order to establish an optimal dose for the diagnosis of invasive breast cancer using real-time harmonic CEUS. The results were, in terms of diagnostic features, that the optimal way to evaluate kinetic features of invasive breast tumors using real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound harmonic imaging was with a bolus injection of contrast agent of either 2. 4 mL or 4. 8 mL. In Study IV we correlated real time harmonic CEUS kinetic parameters with traditional and molecular prognostic factors in invasive breast cancer. The results were that invasive breast carcinomas exhibiting earlier peak enhancement and fast elimination of microbubbles contrast agent at contrast-enhanced ultrasound are associated with established predictors of poor prognosis. In conclusion this thesis demonstrates that kinetic parameters of real-time harmonic CEUS with a bolus injection of either 2. 4 or 4. 8 mL contrast agent have potential for diagnosis, differential diagnosis and prognosis of invasive breast cancer tumors...|$|E
