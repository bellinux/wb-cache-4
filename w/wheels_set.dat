40|$|An {{omnidirectional}} mobility apparatus. The current invention is an omnidirectional, remote-controlled mobility apparatus, {{similar to}} a wheelchair, which allows the transport of an individual or object(s). The device includes a cubic-shaped base with wheel wells on each vertical side of said base. Within each wheel well is a <b>wheel</b> <b>set,</b> such that {{the front and rear}} <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> face each other and the left and right <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> face each other. The circumference of each <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> includes a plurality of transverse-facing, smaller wheels disposed incrementally within each <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> along the circumference of each <b>wheel</b> <b>set,</b> such that a portion of the smaller wheels protrude outside the circumference of each <b>wheel</b> <b>set.</b> This allows the mobility apparatus to propel in any direction.

2500|$|To achieve spin, {{the machine}} should be tilted to one side, and the <b>wheels</b> <b>set</b> to {{different}} speeds as per swing bowling.

2500|$|Later, {{and equally}} unverified, is the {{contention}} that a certain [...] "Comte de Sivrac" [...] developed a célérifère in 1792, demonstrating it at the Palais-Royal in France. The célérifère supposedly had two <b>wheels</b> <b>set</b> on a rigid wooden frame and no steering, directional control being limited to that attainable by leaning. A rider {{was said to have}} sat astride the machine and pushed it along using alternate feet. [...] It is now thought that the two-wheeled célérifère never existed (though there were four-wheelers) and it was instead a misinterpretation by the well-known French journalist Louis Baudry de Saunier in 1891.|$|E
2500|$|In {{all of the}} dated chariot graves, {{the heads}} and hooves {{of a pair of}} horses were placed in a grave that once {{contained}} a chariot. Evidence of chariots in these graves was inferred from the impressions of two spoked <b>wheels</b> <b>set</b> in grave floors 1.2–1.6m apart; in most cases the rest of the vehicle left no trace. In addition a pair of disk-shaped antler [...] "cheekpieces," [...] an ancient predecessor to a modern bit shank or bit ring, were placed in pairs beside each horse head-and-hoof sacrifice. The inner faces of the disks had protruding prongs or studs that would have pressed against the horse's lips when the reins were pulled on the opposite side. Studded cheekpieces were a new and fairly severe kind of control device that appeared simultaneously with chariots.|$|E

40|$|Train <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> must be {{periodically}} inspected {{for possible}} or actual premature failures {{and it is}} very significant to record the wear history for the full life of utilization of <b>wheel</b> <b>sets.</b> This means that an online measuring system could be of great benefit to overall process control. An online non-contact method for measuring a <b>wheel</b> <b>set’s</b> geometric parameters based on the opto-electronic measuring technique is presented in this paper. A charge coupled device (CCD) camera with a selected optical lens and a frame grabber was used to capture the image of the light profile of the <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> illuminated by a linear laser. The analogue signals of the image were transformed into corresponding digital grey level values. The ‘mapping function method’ is used to transform an image pixel coordinate to a space coordinate. The images of <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> were captured when the train passed through the measuring system. The rim inside thickness and flange thickness were measured and analyzed. The spatial resolution of the whole image capturing system is about 0. 33 mm. Theoretic and experimental results show that the online measurement system based on computer vision can meet <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> measurement requirements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Measurement of <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> wear was an {{important}} step {{for the safety of}} train running. High-speed acquisition and processing method for high resolution image of <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> based on the hardware platform of DSP (digital signal processor) and PC was proposed. High-speed acquisition and processing was completed by PC and DSP unit separately. PC and DSP unit worked in parallel operational mode. Ethernet transport program based on TCP was designed for data exchange. Asynchronous reset pulse generation circuits were designed. High resolution images of <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> were captured in 500 fps and asynchronous reset mode. Resolution of images was 1280 * 1024. The experimental results showed that this method improved image processing speed effectively...|$|R

40|$|As a {{means of}} transport, the railway is gaining in importance, and this has {{inspired}} {{a large number of}} innovations. International rail traffic, for example, and logistics solutions need to be improved, but technical safety must also be guaranteed, especially for high-speed trains. Reliability and availability of high-speed trains depends significantly on the quality of <b>wheels,</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> and <b>wheel</b> <b>set</b> axles. There are, indeed, already a large number of national and international rules and regulations, for example on the inspection of <b>wheels,</b> <b>wheel</b> <b>sets</b> and tracks, which take this into account. European and – not least – Fraunhofer research together with industrial partners have assumed a leading role in this process, resulting in international demand for inspection systems developed in Europe.
