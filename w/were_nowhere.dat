The Ohio Country, the land that the British and Indians had successfully defended, had been signed away by Great Britain to the United States. The British had not consulted the Indians in the peace process, and the Indians <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> mentioned in the treaty's terms. For the Indians, the struggle with American settlers would resume in the Northwest Indian War, though this time without the assistance of their British allies.|$|E

The Seathwaite mine was situated on the southern slopes above Seathwaite Tarn while the Cockley Beck mine stood on the fell's lower north western slopes.

5000|$|A nowhere dense set {{need not}} be closed (for instance, the set [...] <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> dense in the reals), but is {{properly}} contained in a nowhere dense closed set, namely its closure (which would add 0 to the set).

50|$|Every {{subset of}} a <b>nowhere</b> dense set <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> dense, {{and the union}} of finitely many <b>nowhere</b> dense sets <b>is</b> <b>nowhere</b> dense.

The union of countably many nowhere dense sets, however, need not <b>be</b> <b>nowhere</b> dense. (Thus, the nowhere dense sets need not form a sigma-ideal.) Instead, such a union is called a meagre set or a set of first category. The concept is important to formulate the Baire category theorem.|$|R
25|$|The {{police in}} Ski outside Oslo {{were given the}} task of {{initiating}} a more comprehensive investigation of the itinerant serial criminal in 2003. They began a cumbersome re-evaluation of the 70 registered cases from other police districts. The Ski police discovered that the evidence was basically quite flimsy, there was for instance a lack of such essentials as interrogations. In May 2004 the police <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> near {{a solution to the}} case, and the investigation was at that time closed down.|$|E
25|$|In September Lorraine Heggessey, the Controller of BBC One, {{managed to}} persuade BBC Worldwide that as {{their plans for}} a Doctor Who film <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> near fruition, BBC {{television}} {{should be allowed to}} make a new series. A deal with Russell T Davies to produce the new series was quickly struck, and on 26 September, the BBC announced that Doctor Who would be returning to BBC One in 2005, produced by BBC Wales. As a result, the status of the Shalka webcast was in doubt from even before it was released.|$|E
25|$|Although, {{as noted}} above, the women {{staffing}} comfort facilities {{were intended to}} be those already involved in the sex trade, in practice there <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> near enough prostitutes available, especially in the Tokyo area. The government had cracked down on prostitution late in the war and many women had fled or been evacuated to the countryside following heavy Allied bombing. Tokyo's most famous red light district, Yoshiwara, had been reduced from a prewar population of 2,000 prostitutes to only a few dozen {{by the end of}} the war. Therefore, it was inevitable that efforts were made to recruit from the general population, a tactic that was authorized by the police.|$|E

25|$|Protestant missionary {{efforts in}} Asia <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> more {{successful}} than in Korea. American Presbyterians and Methodists arrived in the 1880s and were well received. In the days Korea was under Japanese control, Christianity became in part an expression of nationalism in opposition to Japan's efforts to promote the Japanese language and the Shinto religion. In 1914, out of 16 million people, there were 86,000 Protestants and 79,000 Catholics; by 1934 the numbers were 168,000 and 147,000. Presbyterian missionaries were especially successful. Harmonizing with traditional practices became an issue. The Catholics tolerated Shinto rites. The Protestants developed a substitute for Confucian ancestral rites by merging Confucian-based and Christian death and funerary rituals.|$|E
25|$|Both {{director}} McTiernan and Schwarzenegger lost 25 pounds {{during the}} film. Schwarzenegger's weight loss {{was a professional}} choice. McTiernan lost the weight because he avoided the food in Mexico due to health concerns. Unlike McTiernan, most of {{the cast and crew}} suffered from traveler's diarrhea since the Mexican hotel in which they were living was having problems with the water purification. In an interview, Carl Weathers said the actors would secretly wake up as early as 3:00a.m. to work out before the day's shooting. Weathers also stated that he would act as if his physique was naturally given to him, and would work out only after the other actors <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> to be seen.|$|E

For Hampshire Hawks, Shane Warne showed somewhat poor captaincy when Zimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine was the eighth man to come on to bowl – and then took two for 13 from two overs. New Zealander Craig McMillan, meanwhile, conceded twenty-eight runs from his only over. Despite Nic Pothas scoring 59 off 39 balls, the Hawks <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> near keeping up with the required pace, and Middlesex bowler Irfan Pathan was a main cause of that – he took three for 16 from four overs, as Hampshire finished on 192 for 7.|$|E

25|$|Fitzpatrick rode to Benalla {{where he}} {{reported}} that he had been attacked by Kelly as well as his brother Dan, his mother, a neighbour Bricky Williamson and Kelly's brother-in-law, Bill Skillion. Fitzpatrick claimed that all except Kelly's mother had been armed with revolvers and that Kelly had shot him in the left wrist and that Ellen Kelly had hit him on the helmet with a coal shovel. Williamson and Skillion were arrested for their part in the affair. Kelly and Dan <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> to be found, but Ellen was taken into custody along with her baby, Alice. Mrs Kelly, Skillian, and Williamson were tried and convicted of attempted murder against Fitzpatrick. When Kelly was executed his mother was still in prison.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{women were}} scarce in every place where Chinese indentured laborers were brought, the {{migration}} {{was dominated by}} Chinese men. Up to the 1940s men made up {{the vast majority of}} the Costa Rican Chinese community. Males made up the majority of the original Chinese community in Mexico and they married Mexican women. One stark difference between Indian and Chinese Coolies was the treatment of women, despite both groups having a severe shortage. Though there were crimes against women and women being murdered, these incidents <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> near as frequent as with Indian Coolies. Though this was because there were so few Chinese, it became common for people to believe that Indians murder their women while Chinese women stay alive because, unlike their Indian counterparts, they are chaste.|$|E

Bangladesh's spinners, Mohammad Rafique and Enamul Haque jnr were ineffective as Dilshan and Samaraweera passed milestones with ease. The 100 partnership came up shortly after lunch, and then fifty for each individual, and Dilshan reached 133 not out {{by the end of}} the session, the partnership having added 220 for the fifth wicket - needing 14 in the evening session to overcome the previous Sri Lankan Test record for the fifth wicket, set against Bangladesh at the very same ground three years earlier.|$|E

25|$|The KLA {{seized the}} mine on 22 June, taking nine Serb mineworkers hostage, {{converting}} the mine into {{a base of}} operations and taunting the Yugoslav authorities by sending daylight patrols {{within sight of the}} provincial capital, Pristina. Over the next seven days, Yugoslav authorities and the KLA negotiated over the fate of the mineworkers. Once negotiations broke down, the VJ and MUP attacked the mine and forced the KLA out. Ten militants were killed in the clashes. The VJ and MUP reported suffering no casualties. Though the mine was recaptured, the hostages <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> to be found, and it is assumed they were killed by the militants. As of June 2014, the location of the mineworkers' remains is unknown. No one has ever been convicted of their deaths.|$|E
25|$|In {{head-to-head}} terms, Leinster dominate Irish provincial rivals Ulster with a 27–7 win-loss record. Similarly Leinster enjoy a 22–7 win:loss ratio against western province Connacht.

Munster are the closest Pro12 team to having a positive record against Leinster - all of the league's other sides have substantial losing records against Leinster. The Welsh side Celtic Warriors existed in the league for its first couple of seasons and have a positive record against Leinster of two wins and zero defeats, but the sides only ever played a couple of matches head-to-head before Celtic Warriors and a number of other Welsh clubs went out of business or merged.

On 19 July he went to Paris for talks with Adolphe Messimy (French War Minister) and General Dubail (French Chief of Staff). The Wilson-Dubail memorandum, {{although}} making explicit that neither government was committed to action, promised that in the event of war the Royal Navy would transport six infantry and one cavalry divisions (totaling 150,000 men) to Rouen, Le Havre and Boulogne, and that the BEF would concentrate between Arras, Cambrai and St Quentin by the thirteenth day of mobilisation. In reality, the transport plans <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> near ready, although it is unclear that the French knew this.

In reply, the students made 228 for 9 declared, after two bursts from New Zealand international Nathan Astle. Astle took three for 20, the best bowling figures, making up for his 11 in the first innings. Durham then scored reasonably quick runs, but the game were still heading towards a draw, as Durham were leading by 180 runs at stumps on day two with 8 wickets in hand. Durham made a good go at winning the match, though, making 258 for 7 declared to set the students 308 in 74 overs. With Gareth Breese (3-86) and Graeme Bridge (4-54) taking student wickets at regular intervals, it wasn't enough, as they finished 261 for 9 - 47 runs and one wicket short of a result.|$|E
25|$|Parker {{immediately}} {{went to work}} {{to find a new}} label for Presley. Both Mercury Records and Columbia Records showed interest, although their initial offers <b>were</b> <b>nowhere</b> near the $40,000 requirement. RCA Victor, Hank Snow's current label, was also showing an interest, but they were also put off by the cost of the contract. However, RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes was convinced that Presley's style of music would be a huge hit with the right label, and he began talks with Parker. RCA made it very clear they were unwilling to go above $25,000 for a practically unknown singer, but Parker persuaded them that Presley was no ordinary unknown singer. Around the same time, realizing the deal for Presley might fall through due to the cost of the contract, Parker attempted once again to sell Tommy Sands to RCA. He suggested to Sholes that Sands could record material similar to Presley's style. Sholes, remembering his previous experience with Sands, dismissed him as a viable replacement for Presley.|$|E
