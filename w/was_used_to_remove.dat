5|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{stated in}} 2003 {{that the film}} would use {{traditional}} stunt work {{so as to be}} consistent with the previous films. CGI <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts (such as when Indy swings on a lamp with his whip). Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana drives a truck through crates. During the take, an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford. It did not go off and he was not injured.|$|E
5|$|The guest cast {{required}} {{a variety of}} levels of make-up to portray their alien characters. Combs' make-up took around {{three and a half}} hours each day, as did the Tellarite prosthetics. The Andorian female cast members took around four and a half hour each day to get into make-up and costume, but on the first day Brink required further make-up time as that day's shoot required her to appear in-character in her underwear. This meant that after the normal make-up schedule, she was sprayed blue from head to toe. At the end of that day's filming, the shower facilities at the studio's executive gym <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the paint. Meanwhile, the Romulan make-up took three hours to apply, with all the relevant scenes completed in a single day.|$|E

25|$|Uranium {{and some}} other {{elements}} can {{be removed from the}} salt by a process called fluorine volatility: A sparge of fluorine removes volatile high-valence fluorides as a gas. This is mainly uranium hexafluoride, containing the uranium-233 fuel, but also neptunium hexafluoride, technetium hexafluoride and selenium hexafluoride, as well as fluorides of some other fission products (e.g. iodine, molybdenum and tellurium). The volatile fluorides can be further separated by adsorption and distillation. Handling uranium hexafluoride is well established in enrichment. The higher valence fluorides are quite corrosive at high temperatures and require more resistant materials than Hastelloy. One suggestion in the MSBR program at ORNL was using solidified salt as a protective layer. At the MSRE reactor fluorine volatility <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> uranium from the fuel salt. Also for use with solid fuel elements fluorine volatility is quite well developed and tested.|$|E
25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking. These cans were placed into a cooled water bath {{to remove heat}} and keep them cool until {{they were able to}} be transported to a collection facility. As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk milk cooler. 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk milk cooler. This was a double wall vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|E

500|$|At Hanford, the Americans {{had used}} a bismuth {{phosphate}} process to separate the plutonium [...] from the uranium. This was wasteful; the plutonium was retrieved, but the uranium was left in a state from which it could not easily be recovered. A team at the Montreal Laboratory investigated this problem, and had devised a new process {{similar to that used}} with uranium. They had tried out the process, which they believed could be employed on an industrial scale, to extract 20mg of plutonium from a spent Hanford fuel rod. The cartridges were dissolved in nitric acid and dibutyl carbitol <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the plutonium.|$|E
500|$|... 1862 {{was also}} {{the year in which}} the Wiggenhall sluice {{collapsed}} and around [...] of the levels were flooded. Sir John Hawkshaw constructed a new sluice, consisting of a large cofferdam, with 16 tubes, each [...] in diameter, which passed over the top of it. The tops of these pipes were [...] above the inlet and outlet, and an air pump <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the air from them, so that the water would syphon over the cofferdam. It was the only time that such a solution was tried in the Fens, and it was supplemented in 1880 by a more conventional gravity sluice, also constructed by Hawkshaw, as it was unable to discharge sufficient water.|$|E
500|$|There {{had been}} drift mines in Westleigh since the 12th century {{but during the}} second half of the 19th century it became {{possible}} to mine the deeper seams and coal began to be an important industry and coal mining became the largest user of labour after the textile industry in Leigh. Parsonage Colliery, the last pit to be sunk in Leigh, was one of the deepest in the country, going down to over [...] The extent of mining at Parsonage Colliery increased in the 1960s with the driving of the Horizon Tunnel, which accessed previously inaccessible seams around 6ft (2m) high that were easy to work. The seams were wet, and a series of pumps <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the water into underground canals before it was pumped into the canal at Leigh. The winding engine at Parsonage was a steam engine, fuelled by methane extracted from the workings, while the neighbouring Bickershaw Colliery had a superior electric system. In 1974, the two pits were linked underground, and all coal was wound at Bickershaw, which had better facilities, while Parsonage was used for supplies. The entire Lancashire Coalfield is closed to deep mining, although several open-cast mines are still in operation elsewhere in the county.|$|E

500|$|In 1984, {{the statue}} {{was closed to}} the public for the {{duration}} of the renovation. Workers erected the world's largest free-standing scaffold, which obscured the statue from view. Liquid nitrogen <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> layers of paint that had been applied to the interior of the copper skin over decades, leaving two layers of coal tar, originally applied to plug leaks and prevent corrosion. Blasting with baking soda powder removed the tar without further damaging the copper. The restorers' work was hampered by the asbestos-based substance that Bartholdi had used—ineffectively, as inspections showed—to prevent galvanic corrosion. Workers within the statue had to wear protective gear, dubbed [...] "moon suits", with self-contained breathing circuits. Larger holes in the copper skin were repaired, and new copper was added where necessary. The replacement skin was taken from a copper rooftop at Bell Labs, which had a patina that closely resembled the statue's; in exchange, the laboratory was provided some of the old copper skin for testing. The torch, found to have been leaking water since the 1916 alterations, was replaced with an exact replica of Bartholdi's unaltered torch. Consideration was given to replacing the arm and shoulder; the National Park Service insisted that they be repaired instead. The original torch was removed and replaced in 1986 with the current one, whose flame is covered in 24-carat gold. The torch reflects the sun's rays in daytime and is lighted by floodlights at night.|$|E
500|$|In several interviews, {{producer}} Guido Henkel {{stated that}} he was increasingly frustrated by the pressure the management of Interplay put on the development team after Interplay's initial public offering. Although only a few additional subplots and characters had to be discarded to meet the planned release date, he accused the Interplay management of disregarding the development team regarding things like package design and marketing. Henkel {{said that it was}} his main goal to prevent the game from being [...] "crippled" [...] before leaving Interplay when the game reached beta status. He also made the claim that his overall influence on the game was greater than that of Chris Avellone, Eric Campanella, or Dave Maldonaldo, but since a producer often has to make unpopular decisions his role was later downplayed. In 2011 Henkel also revealed that The Nameless One's face on game box art is based on his real face, {{due to the fact that}} the day before the cover photo shoot was scheduled to take place, the model contracted to appear on the box backed out over a scheduling conflict, so Guido Henkel was proposed to use his face. Make up lasted for about two hours, and photography took 45 minutes, Henkel said: [...] "My face was red as a beet and burned for the rest of the day, because of the solvent that <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the appliances. Nonetheless, it was all well worth it".|$|E
500|$|... "Running to Stand Still" [...] was {{not played}} on the PopMart Tour or Elevation Tour, but it {{returned}} to U2 concerts on the 2005 Vertigo Tour, with the original combination of the Edge on keyboards and Bono on guitar. During most of its performance on the Vertigo Tour, it once again followed [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] and culminated with a video clip of several articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights being read. (After July 2005, it was replaced in that role and in the set list by [...] "Miss Sarajevo".) [...] During the 19 June 2005 show on Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's birthday, [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] included snippets of [...] "Walk On", a song originally written for her. [...] Author Steve Stockman felt that in this tour's uses, [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] {{was one of the}} band's songs from the 1980s that had lost its original meaning and was no longer about drug-dealing in the Ballymun towers. [...] Rather, it was now being used to develop the show's theme that a belief in faith and in human potential could overcome the bleakest and most desperate situations; in this, it fit within the Vertigo Tour's emphasis on coexistence and the ONE Campaign. This assessment agreed to by an eFestivals review, and author John Jobling has called the new interpretation an [...] "anti-persecution paean" [...] that <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the sting of [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] being used to criticize American behavior during the Iraq War. In contrast, USA Todays veteran rock writer Edna Gundersen found the song's performance still established a [...] "devastating" [...] mood and the New York Daily News said that the group [...] "thinned 'Running To Stand Still' to give it a new mourning". [...] Two other U.S. reviewers remarked that the song was lesser known to audiences, with Variety saying its inclusion helped the band connect with the past while avoiding cliché. [...] One tour performance of [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was included on the [...] DVD, during which Bono dedicated the Hallelujah coda to members of the American and British militaries fighting overseas. The song was not performed during the U2 360° Tour, with The Vancouver Sun bemoaning the absence of this [...] "stone-cold classic of the U2 canon".|$|E

2500|$|Surgery was {{important}} in treating patients with eye complications, such as trachoma and cataracts. [...] A common complication of trachoma patients is the vascularization of the tissue that invades the cornea of the eye, which {{was thought to be}} the cause of the disease, by ancient Islamic physicians. The technique used to correct this complication was done surgically and known today as peritomy. This procedure was done by [...] "employing an instrument for keeping the eye open during surgery, a number of very small hooks for lifting, and a very thin scalpel for excision." [...] A similar technique in treating complications of trachoma, called pterygium, <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the triangular-shaped part of the bulbar conjunctiva onto the cornea. This was done by lifting the growth with small hooks and then cut with a small lancet. Both of these surgical techniques were extremely painful for the patient and intricate for the physician or his assistants to perform.|$|E

2500|$|The usual form of font cover {{during the}} hundred {{years before the}} Reformation was pyramidal, the ribs of the salient angles being Fo {{straight}} and cusped (Frindsbury, Kent) or of curved outline and cusped (St Mildred, Canterbury). There is a very charming one of this form at Colebrook, Devon. It is quite plain but for a little angel kneeling on the top, with its hands clasped in prayer. But the most beautiful form is the massed collection of pinnacles and canopy work, of which {{there is such a}} fine example at Sudbury, Suffolk. It was not uncommon to carve a dove on the topmost pinnacle (Castleacre, Norfolk), in allusion to the descent of the Holy Spirit. The finest font in England is undoubtedly that of Ijiford, Suffolk. It rises some [...] in height, arid when the panels were painted with saints and the exquisite tabernacle work colored and gilded, must have been a masterpiece of Gothic craftsmanship.

2500|$|The {{magnetometer}} (MAG) {{used two}} sets of three sensors. The three sensors allowed the three orthogonal components of the magnetic field section to be measured. One set was located {{at the end of}} the magnetometer boom and, in that position, was about [...] from the spin axis of the spacecraft. The second set, designed to detect stronger fields, was [...] from the spin axis. The boom <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> the MAG from the immediate vicinity of Galileo to minimize magnetic effects from the spacecraft. However, not all these effects could be eliminated by distancing the instrument. The rotation of the spacecraft was used to separate natural magnetic fields from engineering-induced fields. Another source of potential error in measurement came from the bending and twisting of the long magnetometer boom. To account for these motions, a calibration coil was mounted rigidly on the spacecraft to generate a reference magnetic field during calibrations. The magnetic field at the surface of the Earth has a strength of about 50,000nT. At Jupiter, the outboard (11 m) set of sensors could measure magnetic field strengths in the range from ±32 to ±512nT, while the inboard (6.7 m) set was active in the range from ±512 to ±16,384nT. The MAG experiment weighed [...] and used 3.9 watts of power.|$|E
2500|$|By 1904 {{the canal}} company {{had decided to}} abandon the arm as a navigation. The top [...] were again repuddled, the water level was lowered, {{and all of the}} water flowing along it was fed into Wilstone {{reservoir}}. This put an extra load on the pumps at Tringford, as the Wilstone reservoir is at a lower level than the Tringford one. A pipeline was therefore laid from a sump at Drayton Beauchamp to the Tring pumping station, along the bed of the disused canal, so that water arrived at the pumps at a higher level. The new system was still not satisfactory, due to the large variations in flow along the feeder, and it was redesigned in 1912. After reconstruction, the water was pumped directly into the main line, with surplus water flowing into Tringford reservoir. The section of canal between Wendover and Drayton Beauchamp remained in water, resembling a chalk stream. In 1917, German prisoners of war built a railway bridge over it near Wendover. The standard gauge railway line <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> timber from Wendover Woods, and also supplied Halton Camp, a base for the Royal Flying Corps, which subsequently became RAF Halton. The line was in use until 1963, and the bridge was demolished as a training exercise by sappers in 1965. A footbridge was subsequently erected in the same location.|$|E
