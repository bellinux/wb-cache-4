These typical containers are rectangular, closed box models, with doors fitted at one end, and made of corrugated <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> (commonly known as CorTen) with a plywood floor. Although corrugating the sheet metal used for the sides and roof contributes significantly to the container's rigidity and stacking strength, just like in corrugated iron or in cardboard boxes, the corrugated sides cause aerodynamic drag, and up to 10% fuel economy loss in road or rail transport, compared to smooth-sided vans.|$|E

The steel pieces are fabricated in Germany and installed by Long Island rigging company Budco Enterprises, with whom he has worked for most of his career. The <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> he uses takes about 8-10 years to develop its characteristic dark, even patina of rust.

40|$|The {{effect of}} nickel on the {{corrosion}} resistance of <b>weathering</b> <b>steels</b> in acidic atmospheres was investigated by exposure test and electrochemical technique. The {{results showed that}} 3. 5 wt. % is the optimum nickel content in <b>weathering</b> <b>steels</b> to enhance their atmospheric corrosion resistance. The reason is discussed as follows: once the nickel content exceeds 3. 5 wt. %, the nickel content in the rust increases slightly even with a considerable increase of that in weathering steels; the mass ratio of alpha-FeOOH to gamma-FeOOH in the rust almost remains stable; additional nickel has no {{significant effect on the}} corrosion current density of the steels.

2500|$|The museum inaugurated {{an outdoor}} {{sculpture}} garden in 1993. The first piece {{to be placed}} in the garden was Robert Harrison's 1993 [...] "Gibson Gateway". The piece was submitted as part of a statewide competition held by PGSMA, which Harrison won. The brick and masonry work depicts an archway (painted blue) framed by a series of freestand brick walls. The second piece in the sculpture garden was Richard Swanson's [...] "Prairie Tops", added in 2001. The fluted, dreidel-like piece of aluminum (painted yellow) stands near the southeast corner of the building. In 2002, PGSMA commissioned a new work, titled [...] "Two Sisters", from Great Falls High School art teacher Lisa Easton. Funding for the piece came from PGSMA and the Meadowlark Foundation. The sculpture incorporates [...] of shonkinite (both as gravel and as carved stones of various size on top of the gravel) held by a steel basin flush in the ground. A curving fan of steel pushes through the gravel. Two more pieces were added in 2012. [...] The first is Theodore Waddell's untitled, undated piece which stands near the building's west entrance. The rectangular piece has an undulating upper surface, and is made of <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> (which gives it a brown patina). The other piece was local artist Mike Hollern's untitled, undated piece near the north entrance. This metal work is reminiscent of an upright chipped flint arrowhead with a fish's tail.|$|E
50|$|<b>Weathering</b> <b>steel</b> {{was used}} in 1971 for the Highliner {{electric}} cars built by the St. Louis Car Company for Illinois Central Railroad. The use of <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> {{was seen as a}} cost-cutting move in comparison with the contemporary railcar standard of stainless steel. A subsequent order in 1979 was built to similar specs, including <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> bodies, by Bombardier. The cars were painted, a standard practice for <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> railcars. The durability of <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> did not live up to expectations, with rust holes appearing in the railcars. Painting {{may have contributed to the}} problem, as painted <b>weathering</b> <b>steel</b> is no more corrosion-resistant than conventional steel, because the protective patina will not form in time to prevent corrosion over a localized area of attack such as a small paint failure. These cars have been retired by 2016.|$|E

5|$|Some {{more modern}} steels include tool steels, which are alloyed with {{large amounts of}} {{tungsten}} and cobalt or other elements to maximize solution hardening. This also allows the use of precipitation hardening and improves the alloy's temperature resistance. Tool steel is generally used in axes, drills, and other devices that need a sharp, long-lasting cutting edge. Other special-purpose alloys include <b>weathering</b> <b>steels</b> such as Cor-ten, which weather by acquiring a stable, rusted surface, and so can be used un-painted. Maraging steel is alloyed with nickel and other elements, but unlike most steel contains little carbon (0.01%). This creates a very strong but still malleable steel.|$|R

40|$|Oxidation and {{atmospheric}} corrosion {{data suggest that}} addition of Cr provides the greatest improvement in oxidation resistance. Cr-bearing cast irons are resistant to chloride environments and solutions containing strongly oxidizing constituents. <b>Weathering</b> <b>steels,</b> including high content and at least 0. 04 % Cu, appear to provide adequate resistance to oxidation under temperate conditions. However, data from long-term, high-temperature oxidation studies on <b>weathering</b> <b>steels</b> were not available. From the literature, {{it appears that the}} low alloy steels, plain carbon steels, cast steels, and cast irons con-ode at similar rates in an aqueous environment. Alloys containing more than 12 % Cr or 36 % Ni corrode at a lower rate than plain carbon steels, but pitting may be worse. Short term tests indicate that an alloy of 9 Cr- 1 Mo may result in increased corrosion resistance, however long term data are not available. Austenitic cast irons show the best corrosion resistance. A ranking of total corrosion performance of the materials from most corrosion resistant to least corrosion resistant is: Austenitic Cast Iron; 12 % Cr = 36 % Ni = 9 Cr- 1 Mo; Carbon Steel = Low Alloy Steels; and Cast Iron. Since the materials to be employed in the Advanced Conceptual Design (ACD) waste package are considered to be corrosion allowance materials, the austenitic cast irons, high Cr steels, high Ni steels and the high Cr-Mo steels should not be considered as candidates for the outer containment barrier. Based upon the oxidation and corrosion data available for carbon steels, low alloy steels, and cast irons, a suitable list of candidate materials for a corrosion allowance outer barrier for an ACD waste package could include, A 516, 2. 25 %Cr [...] 1 %Mo Steel, and A 27...|$|R
