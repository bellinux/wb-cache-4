Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E

Although cast as the female lead, when the film was delayed, Qureshi left the project to honour other work commitments. When asked whether she had any regrets, she said: [...] "I have no regrets. I wish it had worked out, but it didn't. I am not someone who sits and laments over things. I was approached for several other south films too, but the roles weren't <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for".|$|E

He had been looking for a restaurant with rooms to purchase, having originally thought to look for one in the Chiltern Hills where they could be added. Harrod said that [...] "I went and had a look and was amazed to find that the Crown at Whitebrook ticked all the boxes for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for.

[...] The Crown at Whitebrook reopened the following October, and gained a new Michelin star under the new team in the 2014 list. In February 2015, the restaurant was renamed to The Whitebrook.|$|E

500|$|Ramirez {{was seen}} by ABC executives, in her Broadway {{performance}} of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, and she chose Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", explaining that it is rare. Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "I {{was looking for a}} girlfriend for George, but it was in the infancy stages, so I had no idea <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for."

500|$|Moondance was {{recorded}} from August to September 1969 at the Studio A penthouse of A & R Studios in New York City. It {{was the first}} album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said [...] "no one knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for except me, so I just did it." [...] Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. {{that he would be}} lead production duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison's creative vision. Lewis Merenstein—Moondances executive producer—had brought in Astral Weeks session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first recording session at A & R Studios, but Morrison—according to Platania—"sort of manipulated the situation" [...] and [...] "got rid of them all. For some reason he didn't want those musicians." [...] While not an overbearing presence among the record's personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: [...] "When I go into the studio, I'm a magician. I make things happen. Whatever is working in that particular space at that particular time, I use, I take advantage of." ...|$|E

Penn State has great academics as well as a great basketball team and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for."

He received offers from various other schools across the country, including Bradley, Colorado State, New Mexico State, Santa Clara, Stanford, Stephen F. Austin, and UTEP. Frazier was also visited by San Diego, TCU, and Penn State, spanning from September to October 2008. After the move was made official, head coach Ed DeChellis said, [...] "We are very excited to have Tim join our program. He is a very fast, quick player with tremendous speed in the backcourt and a good shooter. He possesses the kind of athleticism that Stanley Pringle does. He can get in the lane and find open guys and is a great drive and kick passer and he can score. He is a very good on-the-ball defender and a tremendous athlete and we think he really solidifies our backcourt for the future." ...|$|E

In Faggots, the primary character was modeled on himself, {{a man who is}} unable to find love while encountering the drugs and emotionless sex in the trendy bars and discos. He stated his inspiration for the novel: [...] "I wanted to be in love. Almost everybody I knew felt the same way. I think most people, at some level, wanted <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for, whether they pooh-poohed it or said that we can't live like the straight people or whatever excuses they gave." [...] Kramer researched the book, talking to many men, and visiting various establishments. As he interviewed people, he heard a common question: [...] "Are you writing a negative book? Are you going to make it positive? ... I began to think, 'My God, people must really be conflicted about the lives they're leading.' And that was true. I think people were guilty about all the promiscuity and all the partying." ...|$|E

[...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL.

So I went in and did a couple more records, put a couple skits and just really themed it, and I'm like I'ma give them the mixtape first just to excite the streets again and remind people what the sound is, give 'em an idea of what the album might sound like.

This paper shows how existing question answering systems—which aim at finding precise answers to questions—can be improved by exploiting summarization techniques to extract more than just the answer from the document in which the answer resides.
