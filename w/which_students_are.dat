25|$|Medical {{education}} is normally a five-year Bachelor degree, including one-year internship (or clinical rotation, during <b>which</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> {{actively involved in}} patient care) before the final degree is awarded.

There are a few colleges that teach in English and accept foreign medical students. Some of those universities have increased their course duration to 6 years.|$|E
25|$|With the {{adoption}} of standards-based education, most states have created examinations in <b>which</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> compared to a standard of what educators, businesspeople, parents, and other stakeholders have determined to be what every student {{should know and be}} able to do. Students are graded as exceeding, meeting, or falling below the standard. The advantage is that students are not compared against each other, and all have the opportunity to pass the standard. However, the standard is typically set at a level that is substantially higher than previous achievement, so that a relatively high percentage of students fail at least some part of the standards in the first year, including an especially high percentage non-college bound students.|$|E
25|$|The Step Up {{campaign}} {{is a program}} that helps students prevent crimes, sexual assault, and excessive drinking by teaching students how to intervene and prevent in a positive way.

Similarly, there are different resources <b>which</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> able to get help while getting home. 624-WALK, an escort to walk to adjacent campuses and neighborhoods, and Gopher Chauffeur, a van service that offers rides near and on campus. Both of these are free and open to all students, staff, and faculty.|$|E

25|$|Examples of {{possible}} programs include summer undergraduate research, in <b>which</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> supported each summer by the College on independent projects with a sponsoring faculty member; the National Conference on Undergraduate Research, to which Union sends {{one of the}} largest contingents to its national conference each year where the students present their work and interact with peers from colleges and universities across the country; general internships at such nearby sites as General Electric's Global Research Center; and the Steinmetz Symposium day. On a Friday in May, over 300 students, previously carrying out research within the past year, present their research and projects to their fellow students, teachers, staff, and visitors. Students also have the school day off, and presentations take form in slideshows, performances, lectures, and many other creative forms.|$|E
25|$|One early {{application}} of knapsack algorithms {{was in the}} construction and scoring of tests in which the test-takers have a choice as to which questions they answer. For small examples it is a fairly simple process to provide the test-takers with such a choice. For example, if an exam contains 12 questions each worth 10 points, the test-taker need only answer 10 questions to achieve a maximum possible score of 100 points. However, on tests with a heterogeneous distribution of point valuesi.e. different questions are worth different point values {{it is more difficult}} to provide choices. Feuerman and Weiss proposed a system in <b>which</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> given a heterogeneous test with a total of 125 possible points. The students are asked to answer all of the questions {{to the best of their}} abilities. Of the possible subsets of problems whose total point values add up to 100, a knapsack algorithm would determine which subset gives each student the highest possible score.|$|E

The teacher reassures them that this is [...] "fine, it's absolutely fine, it's your choice" [...] and there is [...] "no pressure", but then shifts the papers on her desk to reveal a red-buttoned detonator, which she presses. The two children {{who did not want to}} participate explode, covering their screaming classmates with blood and body parts. The blood-spattered teacher then goes on casually to explain the night's homework to her horrified charges.|$|E

[...] In 2007, Timberlake said he saw the community service course as [...] "an excellent opportunity to bring along the next generation" [...] to address problems of neighborhood blight, poverty, family disorganization, failure in school, and incarceration for African-American males. [...] He described the problems facing the poor as [...] "a colossal, colossal waste of human life." [...] Timberlake has been a volunteer for several years with Milwaukee's Habitat for Humanity chapter, and one of the courses he teaches at Marquette is called [...] "Decent and Affordable Housing," [...] in <b>which</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> instructed in construction methods (and use of power tools), investigate the causes of hyper-segregation, study substandard housing as a social injustice issue, and spend part of the semester at a Habitat for Humanity work site helping to build a house.
