5|$|Harry Connick, Jr. as Dean McCoppin, a beatnik {{artist and}} junkyard owner. Bird felt it {{appropriate}} {{to make the}} character {{a member of the}} beat generation, as they <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> mildly threatening to small-town values during that time. An outsider himself, he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat.|$|E
5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the NSDAP and the Nazi regime. Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on their belief {{in the existence of}} a superior master race. The Nazis postulated the existence of a racial conflict between the Aryan master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and repression of the Aryan race.|$|E
5|$|The Abbasids were {{followed}} by the Saffarids. Zoroastrians lived {{under the leadership of}} their High Priest, since they had no king. In Iraq, the political center of the Sassanian state, Zoroastrian institutions <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> appendages of the royal government and family, and suffered much destruction and confiscation. Closely associated with the power structures of the Persian Empire, Zoroastrian clergy quickly declined after it was deprived of the state support.|$|E

5|$|The {{ideology}} of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics, and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism {{with the goal}} of obtaining more Lebensraum (living space) for the Germanic people. Nazi Germany attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill the Jews and Slavs living there, who <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> being inferior to the Aryan master race.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment of martial law, and the propaganda efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, {{while many of the}} city's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> being associated with French interests.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} aged, the avionics <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> lacking suitable components for the ground attack mission, such as terrain-following radar, GPS navigation or modern night-flight systems; consequently, several upgrades {{were carried out}} in the mid-1990s, including the addition of the Litening targeting pod. India placed an order for 17 additional upgraded Jaguar aircraft from Hindustan Aeronautics in 1999 and a further 20 in 2001–2002. The Indian Air Force plans to upgrade up to 125 Jaguars starting in 2013 by upgrading the avionics (including multi mode radar, auto-pilot and other changes) as part of the DARIN III programme and is considering fitting more powerful engines, Honeywell F125IN to improve performance, particularly at medium altitudes.|$|E

50|$|Robert D. Putnam (2000) {{suggested}} a social capital concepts of bonding and bridging. Bonding <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> relations {{among members of}} the same community. Bridging <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> relationships between members among different communities.|$|R
50|$|The {{hierarchy}} of sources of law can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the Constitution, legislation, regulations, and then custom. Alternatively, the hierarchy can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the Constitution, treaties, statutes, codes, doctrine, custom, and then general principles of law.|$|R
5|$|Legalized {{discrimination}} against Jews in Germany began {{immediately after the}} Nazi seizure of power in January 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism {{with the goal of}} obtaining more Lebensraum (living space) for the Germanic people. Nazi Germany attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or exterminate the Jews and Slavs living there, who <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> being inferior to the Aryan master race.|$|E
5|$|Leicester <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the}} favourites for {{promotion}} in the 2011–12 season, but on 24 October 2011, following an inconsistent start with the Foxes winning just 5 out of their first 13 matches, Eriksson left the club by mutual consent. Three weeks later, Nigel Pearson returned to the club as Eriksson's successor. Pearson {{would go on to}} lead the Foxes to a sixth-place finish in the 2012–13 season, ensuring Leicester were in the Championship play-offs. However, Leicester lost the playoff semi-final 3–2 on aggregate to Watford after Anthony Knockaert missed a late penalty and Troy Deeney scored right at the end after a swift counterattack from a Manuel Almunia double save.|$|E
5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's hatred of Christians was {{compounded}} by fears that as they shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, the Christians <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a potential fifth column {{in the event of}} a British attack. To this, he adds that Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against him, even though he knew it wasn't true.|$|E

50|$|Although {{chapters}} 13 to 17 of John may <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a larger, monolithic unit, most of chapter 13 may <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a {{preparation for}} the farewell, and the farewell prayer in chapter 17 as its conclusion.|$|R
50|$|Federation Council <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a {{more formal}} chamber of the Federal Assembly. Because of its federalist design, {{as well as its}} voting {{franchise}} strictly limited to provincial elites, the Council <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> less volatile to radical changes.|$|R
5|$|The Song navy was {{of great}} {{importance}} during the consolidation of the empire in the 10th century; during {{the war against the}} Southern Tang state the Song navy employed tactics such as defending large floating pontoon bridges across the Yangtze River in order to secure movements of troops and supplies. There were large ships in the Song navy that could carry 1,000 soldiers aboard their decks, while the swift-moving paddle-wheel craft <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> essential fighting ships in any successful naval battle.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial crises, {{and unemployment}} in the United States, which <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of African Americans were seen as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used {{as a form of}} rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S. policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} predates 300 BC, {{based on}} {{the style of the}} hieroglyphic text, and is thought to be an Early Maya monument that was intended to represent an Early Maya ruler (at the base) who carried the underworld (i.e. the bat) and his ancestors (the main figure above carrying a smaller figure on its back). The Maya sculptor used half-remembered Olmec stylistic elements upon the ancestor figure in a form of Maya-Olmec syncretism, producing a hybrid sculpture. As such it represents the transition from one cultural phase to the next, at a point where the earlier Olmec inhabitants had not yet been forgotten and <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> powerful ancestors.|$|E
50|$|Among Palestinians, Mughrabi <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{a martyr}} in the {{struggle}} for the liberation of Palestine. Among Israelis, she <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a terrorist who was responsible for the deadliest terrorist attack {{in the history of the}} State of Israel.|$|R
50|$|Procurement is one {{component}} of the broader concept of sourcing and acquisition. Typically procurement <b>is</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> more tactical in nature (the process of physically buying a product or service) and sourcing and acquisition <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> more strategic and encompassing.|$|R
30|$|For the {{state-dependent}} relay channel with orthogonal components {{considered in}} this paper, the channel states SR and SD <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the signals of corresponding primary communication; {{the source and}} the relay <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the secondary users which are capable of acquiring the channel state information. Thus, the model studied in this paper can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a secondary relay communication with cognitive source and cognitive relay. We are interested in studying the capacity of this model.|$|R
5|$|Against Third Division Luton Town in the quarter-final, Everton won comfortably. The match {{remained}} scoreless {{for half}} an hour, but after Stein opened the scoring for Everton the match became one-sided, and ended 6–0. Stein and Johnson both scored twice, along with a goal each for Dunn and Dean, the latter maintaining his record of scoring in every round. By this time Everton <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> favourites to win the competition. In the semi-final they played West Ham at Molineux, Wolverhampton. Everton {{took the lead in}} the sixth minute. A corner kick by Stein was headed on by Johnson, and then headed into the net by Dunn. Everton had the better of the play in the first half, but Vic Watson scored for West Ham just before half-time. In the second half West Ham's Woods missed an open goal from six yards (5.5m). Everton then capitalised on their reprieve. With seven minutes remaining, a mistake by Jim Barrett allowed Edward Critchley to go clear on goal and score the winner.|$|E
5|$|As modern {{communities}} continued {{growing in}} and around Miami, developers looked to southern Dade County for new projects. The undeveloped keys south of Key Biscayne <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> prime development territory. Beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted {{the construction of a}} causeway to the mainland. One proposal included building a highway linking the Biscayne Bay keys to the Overseas Highway at Key Largo and to the developed barrier islands to the north. At the same time, pressure built to accommodate industrial development in South Florida. This led to competing priorities between those who wished to develop for residential and leisure use and those in favor of industrial and infrastructure development. On December 6, 1960, 12 of the 18 area landowners who favored development voted to create the City of Islandia on Elliott Key. The town was incorporated to encourage Dade County to improve access to Elliott Key in particular, which landowners viewed as a potential rival to Miami Beach. The new city lobbied for causeway access and formed a negotiating bloc to attract potential developers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war the AIF {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} as a well-trained and highly effective military force, enduring more than two years of costly fighting on the Western Front before playing a significant role in the final Allied victory in 1918, albeit as a smaller part of the wider British Empire war effort. Like the other Dominion divisions from Canada and New Zealand, the Australians <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> being among the best of the British forces in France, and were often used to spearhead operations. 63 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross. This reputation came at a heavy cost, with the AIF sustaining approximately 210,000 casualties, of which 61,519 were killed or died of wounds. This represented a total casualty rate of 64.8 percent, which was among the highest of any belligerent for the war. About another 4,000 men were captured. The majority of casualties occurred among the infantry (which sustained a casualty rate of 79 percent); however, the artillery (58 percent) and light horse (32 percent) also incurred significant losses.|$|E

50|$|In {{digital signal}} processing, linear {{prediction}} {{is often called}} linear predictive coding (LPC) and can thus <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a subset of filter theory. In system analysis (a subfield of mathematics), linear prediction can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a part of mathematical modelling or optimization.|$|R
50|$|Stealth taxes can <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> regressive, as more {{affluent}} people are less affected by VAT, for example. State lotteries may also <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{a form of}} taxation, and {{there is evidence that}} they are played more by poor people than by the affluent.|$|R
5|$|Everton had contested {{the final}} on four {{previous}} occasions. They beat Newcastle United 1–0 {{to win the}} Cup in 1906, but were defeated in the 1893, 1897 and 1907 finals. The 1933 final was Manchester City's third. Both their previous finals were against Bolton Wanderers. Manchester City won by a goal to nil in 1904, and lost by the same scoreline in 1926. Both teams had performed well in the previous season. Manchester City reached the semi-finals of the 1932 FA Cup; Everton were reigning league champions. The clubs had never previously met in cup competition. The league matches between the two {{earlier in the season}} each finished as a win for the home team. At the time of the final, Everton's league position was tenth, and Manchester City's sixteenth. Newspapers did not declare a clear favourite for the win. Everton <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> having the more skilful players, particularly their forwards, whereas Manchester City were seen as having greater strength and determination.|$|E
5|$|In a Hindu {{caste system}} that was conspicuously present, Brahmins enjoyed a privileged {{position}} as providers of knowledge and local justice. These Brahmins were normally involved in careers that revolved around religion and learning {{with the exception of}} a few who achieved success in martial affairs. They were patronised by kings, nobles and wealthy aristocrats who persuaded learned Brahmins to settle in specific towns and villages by making them grants of land and houses. The relocation of Brahmin scholars was calculated to be in the interest of the kingdom as they <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> persons detached from wealth and power and their knowledge was a useful tool to educate and teach ethical conduct and discipline in local communities. Brahmins were also actively involved in solving local problems by functioning as neutral arbiters (Panchayat).|$|E
5|$|In ancient Mesopotamia, Sirius, named KAK.SI.DI by the Babylonians, {{was seen}} as an arrow aiming towards Orion, while the {{southern}} stars of Canis Major and a part of Puppis <b>were</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a bow, named BAN in the Three Stars Each tablets, dating to around 1100 BC. In the later compendium of Babylonian astronomy and astrology titled MUL.APIN, the arrow, Sirius, was also linked with the warrior Ninurta, and the bow with Ishtar, daughter of Enlil. Ninurta was linked to the later deity Marduk, who was said to have slain the ocean goddess Tiamat with a great bow, and worshipped as the principal deity in Babylon. The Ancient Greeks replaced the bow and arrow depiction with that of a dog.|$|E
