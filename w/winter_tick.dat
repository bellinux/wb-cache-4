40|$|ABSTRACT: Occurence {{and rate}} of {{shivering}} were measured to assess thermoregulatory responses of captive moose (Alces alces) infested with <b>winter</b> <b>ticks</b> (Dermacentor albipictus). Shivering was observed on 47 occasions in 5 of 8 infested moose calves from October to April; in contrast, 4 moose calves not infested with <b>winter</b> <b>ticks</b> did not shiver under identical weather conditions. Only 5 shiver-ing bouts occurred from October to March, all on a single day. The other 42 shivering bouts occurred in April with bouts lasting 1 – 103 min. During the April bouts, ambient temperature was 1 – 4 °C (42 of 42), maximum wind speed was ≤ 12 km/h (38 of 42), and it was raining (30 of 42). Shivering was asso-ciated with 23 – 44 % hair loss in April, but not during cold weather in mid-winter despite 5 – 10 % hair loss in March. Maintaining stable core body temperature during late winter-early spring could compro-mise the energetic balance of wild free-ranging moose with extensive hair loss and abundant ticks, in conditions equivalent to or worse than measured in this study.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Biological data {{collected}} from harvested moose (Alces alces) were analyzed to assess whether temporal change {{has occurred in the}} physical and reproductive condition of moose from 1988 – 2009 in New Hampshire. Measurements included age and field-dressed body weight of both sexes, number of corpora lutea (CL) and ovulation rate of females, and antler beam diameter (ABD) and antler spread of males. Similar data were obtained from Maine and Vermont for comparative analysis. The only significant changes (P < 0. 05) occurred in the yearling age class: mean body weight of both sexes, number of CL, and ABD all declined in New Hampshire. The current ovulation rate (∼ 20 %) and mean body weight (< 200 kg) of yearling females in New Hampshire and Vermont were considered low. The declines measured in yearlings, yet relative stability in adults, are consistent with the presumption that <b>winter</b> <b>ticks</b> (Dermacentor albipictus) impact the productivity of moose populations through reduced calf survival and growth and fecundity of yearlings. Density-dependent factors related to habitat change are also discussed given the recent, rapid expansion of moose in the 3 states. Continued monitoring of physical parameters and productivity of harvested moose, parti-cularly the yearling cohort, is warranted to better assess the relationships among <b>winter</b> <b>ticks,</b> habitat quality, and moose populations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: High infestations {{of winter}} ticks (Dermacentor albipictus) can exact high {{physiological}} costs on moose and {{are associated with}} high rates of juvenile mortality. Quantifying tick abundance on moose may help managers calculate overall mortality rates for moose and make harvest recommenda-tions. We compared <b>winter</b> <b>tick</b> counts along hair transects on samples of moose hides to tick counts obtained from chemical digestion of those same samples. <b>Winter</b> <b>tick</b> counts from the two methods were strongly correlated (P < 0. 001, r 2 = 0. 88, n = 31). We field-tested the hair transect count method to determine its practicality at moose check stations.

40|$|A dynamic {{population}} model of Hyalomma marginatum, the vector of several pathogens {{in the western}} Palearctic, was developed to simulate effects of temperature and water vapour deficit (VD) on tick survival, development rates and seasonality. Base tick survival and development rates were obtained from laboratory-controlled experiments or calculated from reported data. These rates were modelled as temperature-dependant time delays or accumulated mortality by temperature and water VD stress. Using daily data derived from a gridded data set at 10 -min resolution, the model reached stable and cyclical equilibria {{in an area that}} corresponds largely with the reported distribution of the tick in western Palearctic. The model did not identify a potential range of suitable climate for the tick out of the known distribution area, implying that under current climate conditions, there is no potential to spread at the spatial scale of the model. Tick die-out at northern latitudes was attributed to a steady increase in duration of the development rates of engorged nymphs to adults and hence increased mortality in this stage. Low developmental rates in northern latitudes produced the accumulation of most of the nymphal stock in late summer and early autumn, which cannot moult to adults because of the low temperatures of late autumn and <b>winter.</b> The <b>tick</b> did not produced selfsustained populations in areas where yearly accumulated temperatures were below 3000 – 4000 C, a limit roughly found at latitudes north of 47 ºN. Tick die-out in sites southern to 34 ºN was attributed to the mortality rates of engorged nymphs, which moult in late spring and summer, in the season where temperatures and water vapour stresses were highest. These findings and future applications of the model in investigating the dynamics of pathogens potentially transmitted by H. marginatum are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Rhipicephalus sanguineus, {{the brown}} dog tick, has a {{worldwide}} distribution {{in areas with}} a relatively warm climate, including mild <b>winters.</b> This <b>tick</b> {{plays an important role}} as vector for various animal and human pathogens, including bacteria and protozoa. Based on precise daily meteorological data from the past 40 years, combined with mathematical modelling designed to predict tick activity, two modelling approaches were developed. The first examined the evolution of the number of weeks with favourable biological conditions for ticks in four French cities located at various latitudes of the country: Nîmes in the south, Paris in the north, Lyon in the east and Nantes in the west. The second analysed the extension of the geographical surface area in km 2 where the biological conditions favour tick activity for at least 12 weeks per year. Both analyses revealed clear evidence of increased temperatures coupled with an augmented tick activity index in three of the four cities. However, the change was not significant in Nîmes, where the climate is Mediterranean and the tick is already endemic. For Paris, Lyon and Nantes, the activity index values have increased significantly, i. e. by 4. 4 %, 4. 0 % and 3. 4 %, respectively. The distribution of the activity index values is evolving strongly with significantly fewer values below 50 % since the 1960 s and a clear decrease of values between 20 % and 50 % during the latest decade. Between 1960 and 2000, the theoretical extension of the surface area where the climatic index is suitable for R. sanguineus has increased by 66 %. Even though several other important factors, such as changes in biotopes or human activity, are not included in this study, the resulting patterns and trends are noticeable. Our models constitute the first demonstration of the impact of climate change on the activity and distribution of ticks and confirm the observed northward migration trend for this Mediterranean domestic tick...|$|R
40|$|In the {{experiments}} {{it has been}} proved: (1) That brown tick imagines which as larvae had become infected with East Coast fever and which had transmitted the disease in their nymphal stage were no longer infective for susceptible cattle. Four batches of ticks proved their infectivity in the nymphal stage on eight animals, but in their adult stage failed to transmit the disease to two susceptible animals. (2) Ticks belonging to the same batches which were feeding on two animals rendered immune to East Coast fever by inoculation in the nymphal stage did not transmit the disease in their adult stage to six animals, thus proving that the brown tick which has become infected in one stage cleans itself in the following stage by feeding on an immune or susceptible animal. (3) Ticks which became infected with East Coast fever in their larval stage and which passed their nymphal stage on a rabbit did not prove to be infective in their adult stage for susceptible cattle. This conclusion bears out that given above (2) : showing that a tick loses its infectivity {{the first time it}} feeds on an animal susceptible or immune to East Coast fever. (4) Clean or infective ticks feeding on an animal which has recovered from an attack of East Coast fever do not transmit the disease in their next stage. This conclusion is in support of experiments undertaken eight years ago (vide Annual Report of the Government Veterinary Bacteriologist, 1904 - 05). (5) It has been demonstrated that certain batches of ticks collected {{at the same time and}} which fed under similar conditions do not transmit the disease in their next stage, even when infested in great numbers and on numerous animals. Other batches of ticks reared in exactly the same way and under similar conditions only infected a few animals, whilst again other ticks proved infective in almost every instance even when a minimum number were used. It is difficult to give an explanation of this fact, but it is quite likely that outside conditions have some influence. The ticks which did not transmit the disease were bred during the coldest time of the year. This may perhaps explain the fact that during the winter months the infection in the field is not so active as during the summer months, remembering at the same time that during the <b>winter</b> months <b>tick</b> life is generally weaker than in the summer.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of feral swine (Sus scrofa) populations into new geographic regions {{is of concern}} not only due to increased range {{but also because they}} carry diseases and parasites that pose a threat to humans, livestock, and wildlife into new areas. Recently, emerging feral swine populations {{have been reported in the}} northeastern US and due to their adaptive nature will likely continue to spread. During 2009 – 2012, 49 feral swine were removed from three counties in New Hampshire. Of these, serum samples were submitted from 34 for disease surveillance testing.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to map {{vaccination}} rate against tick-borne encephalitis in adults {{in the town of}} České Budějovice, the town in the focus of infection. Tick-borne encephalitis is a very malign and dangerous neurodegenerative disease. At the beginning there appear only inconspicuous flu-like symptoms. It is transmitted either by infected ticks or by eating products made from non-pasteurized milk of infected animals (goats, sheep). People living in areas with higher occurrence of ticks infected by one of the diseases (tick-borne encephalitis, borreliosis, ehrlichiois) should pay attention to prevention. In case of tick-borne encephalitis vaccination is possible. It is recommended during <b>winter</b> months, when <b>ticks</b> are not active. This precaution is done in cold weather so that in spring when ticks are active, the body has sufficient amount of antibodies against tick-borne encephalitis. During warm months it is possible to apply accelerated scheme of vaccination so that the body produces antibodies quicker, however, their survival is rather shorter. My research was carried out by means of questionnaires which were filled in by the group of randomly chosen inhabitants of České Budějovice. The form of processing was the method of quantitative research. The questionnaires were processed by the form of descriptive study. Total number of returned questionnaires was 541 (77 %). The generation until 29 (68 %) had the highest distribution; this age category has the highest vaccination rate (56 %). The total proportion of vaccinated against non-vaccinated is 49 % to 51 %. On the contrary, the lowest vaccination rate is in generations of 70 years old and older people, where 1 of 18 is vaccinated (5. 5 %). In women, who created 76 % of examined sample, the vaccination rate makes up 53 % and in men, who took 24 %, there were 35 % vaccinated. The next aim of my thesis was to monitor attitudes of inhabitants to vaccination. We found out that in non-vaccinated inhabitants the main reason was opinion that vaccination is not necessary (43 %), the next was finance (20 %) and further some other reasons, for example laziness.

40|$|Significant {{mortality}} of moose (Alces alces) occurred throughout broad regions of northern and western Alberta in early 1999. Occurrences involving moose were recorded at local Alberta Natural Resources Service (NRS) district offices. A total of 1130 occurrence reports involving moose throughout Alberta between January 1 and April 30, 1999 were {{submitted to the}} author for review. Although there was considerable inherent bias in the sample, some general patterns emerged. Most moose (92 %) had evidence of hairloss and 28 % of them were dead.

Before this study there have been no reports of winter ticks in the Deline area...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Moose (Alces alces) {{populations have}} recolonized {{much of their}} {{historic}} range in the northeastern United States in the past 30 years, with their southern range edge extending to southern New England and northern New York. This southerly expansion occurred when certain other populations in the United States were in decline along the southern range edge, with climate change often cited as a probable cause. The areas that moose have recently occupied in the northeastern United States {{are some of the}} most densely human populated in moose range, which has raised concern about human safety and moose-vehicle collisions (MVC). We conducted a literature search about moose in the northeastern United States, and distributed a questionnaire and conducted phone interviews with regional biolo-gists responsible for moose management to determine the status of moose, management activity, and research deficiencies and needs. Moose numbers appear stable throughout much of the region, with slow population growth in northern New York. Management activity ranges from regulated harvest of moose in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, to no active management in southern New England and New York. The combined annual harvest in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont is> 3, 000. MVCs are a widespread regional concern with> 1, 000 occurring annually involving several human fatalities. Research should address impacts of parasitism by <b>winter</b> <b>tick</b> (Dermacentor albipictus) and brain-wor...|$|E

Winter ticks occur throughout moose range south of 60 º N, but {{little is known}} about how habitat influences tick density in Minnesota. Adult female winter ticks drop off moose in the spring to lay eggs and larvae attach to moose in the fall. The habitat that a tick drops off into could increase or decrease either survival or reproduction. Moose select different cover types for foraging and for bedding. We used locations of moose wearing GPS collars to identify tick sampling locations. Moose GPS locations could be identified as either movement or bedding. Targeted sampling at moose GPS locations allowed us to evaluate flag and walking surveys for <b>winter</b> <b>tick</b> collection. Bed sites and movement paths were identified from the 2013 and 2014 spring tracks to assess the effect of moose behavior and habitat characteristics on tick density. Moose GPS locations had more ticks than random sites (p = 0. 001). Tick densities at moose sites were higher in 2013 (10. 8 ± 2. 9 ticks/m 2) than in 2014 (2. 8 ± 1. 2 ticks/m 2; p= 0. 0003). Ticks were found at 52 % of 2013 sites and at 27 % of 2014 sites. More movement paths than bed sites had ticks in 2013 (p = 0. 01), but tick densities were similar in bed sites (11. 2 ± 6. 3 ticks/m 2) and movement paths (10. 7 ± 7. 5 ticks/m 2). In both years, tick density was higher in areas with litter depths < 3 cm (p < 0. 06) and with canopy closures < 50 % (p < 0. 008). A high percentage of sites in lowland conifer, mixedwood, and regenerating forests had ticks present, but no upland conifer sites had ticks present (p = 0. 0001). Spring locations from GPS collared moose were converted to paths. These paths were areas where ticks would have dropped off of moose. We created paths of moose in the fall by connecting GPS locations. Fall paths were overlaid with spring movement paths to identify areas where moose could acquire ticks. Overlaps of the 2011 - 2012 spring and fall path accounted for 6 and 13 % (3. 1 ± 0. 4 ha and 2. 2 ± 0. 5 ha) of the paths. All moose overlapped with their own path in the fall for about 4 % of their spring paths (1. 1 ha). The greatest areas of overlap occurred in mixedwood and wet cover types (p = 0. 0002). Mixedwood and wet cover types, especially with open canopies and shallow litter depths, have the highest potential to produce high larval tick densities. Mixedwood and wet cover types also have the greatest area of overlap between spring and fall paths and could be the areas with the highest tick transfer. Tick densities estimated from walking surveys and tick densities estimated from flag surveys were similar (p= 0. 9). Walking surveys with chaps allowed us to identify the height of winter ticks on the vegetation. The largest clumps of ticks were found at 38. 2 ± 3. 4 cm, but ticks were found from 0 - 100 cm. When more ticks were collected with walking surveys, ticks were generally found below 66 cm. When more ticks were collected with flag surveys, ticks were found above 66 cm and were likely higher than chap height...|$|E
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the {{physiology}} and diseases of the North American elk (Cervus canadensis) were investigated, toward the goal of uncovering influences responsible for declining productivity among some elk herds in Oregon. A newly developed drug, Etorphine, together with its antagonistic companion, Dip renorphine, was used to immobilize elk. Substantial {{differences were found in}} the amounts required and animal responses dependent upon age, physical condition and life history. Whole blood samples were obtained from 60 living elk for hematological studies. The parameters examined included hemoglobin levels, packed cell volume, erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, and the percentage distribution of neutrophils, band cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Respiration rate, heart rate, and body temperature were measured for nine drugged elk. Sickling of erythrocytes was found in the blood of two female elk. Serum was separated from the blood of 72 living elk and 22 recently shot elk of mixed ages and sexes. Serum proteins were differentiated by electrophoretic analysis. Values obtained for total protein, albumin, total globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, and for the alpha 1, alpha 2, beta and gamma globulins, were grouped and summarized to facilitate comparisons based on age and sex, as well as between living and dead, and captive and free-living elk. Total serum protein concentrations were markedly higher in the older age groups of both captive and freeliving elk. An apparent tendency to higher albumin levels was found among males of this species. Values for serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, Chlorides, Cholesterol, glucose, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, creatinine, and uric acid, as well as activity levels of alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase, and serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase were obtained. Sodium/ potassium and calCium/phosphorus ratios were calculated. Urine speciments were obtained from seven elk and analyzed for the presence of glucose. Young elk, both captive and free-living, had higher serum values for sodium, calcium, inorganic phosphorus, glucose and alkaline phosphatase than did the older age group. Mature elk, both captive and free-living, had higher serum values for calcium/phosphorus ratio, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid and serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase than did those under two years of age. Differences in serum Chemistry were also found between captive and free-living elk. Serological tests on sera from 67 elk tested were negative for brucellosis and bluetongue virus. Tests for leptospirosis on sera from 29 elk by the macroscopic agglutination method were all negative. Of 38 free-living elk tested for leptospirosis by the microscopic agglutination test, 16 showed positive reactions to one or more serotypes at a significant titer of 1 : 100 or greater. Another eight showed positive reactions at the 1 : 50 level. This is believed to the first report of serological reactivity to leptospirosis reported for elk. Internal organs from 39 elk were examined for the presence of adult helminths, and fecal pellets from 82 elk were examined for the presence of parasite eggs. Lethal numbers of Dictyocaulus viviparus were recovered from the respiratory organs of two yearling male elk. Two nematodes of the Trichostrongylus axei and Ostertagia circumcincta, were found that have not been previously reported from Roosevelt elk. Fascioloides magna and Oesophagostomum venulosum were also found. The common <b>winter</b> <b>tick,</b> Dermacentor albipictus and Ixodes pacificus were collected from Roosevelt elk. This latter species has not been previously reported in elk. Increased gannna globulin values and concomitant decreases in albumin were observed in tick-infested elk...|$|E
