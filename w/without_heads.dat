All villages in the surrounding district {{with two or three}} exceptions have been plundered and burnt; twenty thousand Christians have been slaughtered in Armenia and its environs. In Haftewan, a village of Salmas, 750 corpses <b>without</b> <b>heads</b> have been recovered from the wells and cisterns alone. Why? Because the commanding officer had put a price on every Christian head... In Dilman crowds of Christians were thrown into prison and driven to accept Islam.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that depth can be {{perceived}} from motion parallax. To produce motion parallax, observers (with head movement) or objects (<b>without</b> <b>head</b> movement) need to move. In previous studies, the magnitude of perceived depth with head movement was compared with that <b>without</b> <b>head</b> movement using several corrugated surfaces. It was found that perceived depth with head movement was larger than that <b>without</b> <b>head</b> movement. The purpose of the present research was to investigate the influence of discontinuities on the perceived surface. We used stair-like (square-wave) stimuli, and investigated the magnitude of perceived depth with or <b>without</b> <b>head</b> movement. We found that: (1) the magnitude of perceived depth increased as the number of square-waves increased. (2) There was a tendency to perceive larger depth with <b>head</b> movement than <b>without</b> <b>head</b> movement, but the difference between magnitudes of depth with and <b>without</b> <b>head</b> movements decreased as the number of square-waves increased. (3) Observers tended to perceive 4 - and 6 -step square-wave stimuli as continuous. (4) For the 2 -step square-wave stimulus, observers tended to grossly underestimate the magnitude of depth or could not perceive depth at all. These findings suggest the possibility that perception of increased depth is caused by the perception of surfaces as continuous...|$|R

60|$|This, however, {{sprang up}} later on. Meantime {{in common with}} the rest of the {{shipping}} in that Eastern port, I was left in no doubt as to Hermann's notions of hygienic clothing. Evidently he believed in wearing good stout flannel next his skin. On most days little frocks and pinafores could be seen drying in the mizzen rigging of his ship, or a tiny row of socks fluttering on the signal halyards; but once a fortnight the family washing was exhibited in force. It covered the poop entirely. The afternoon breeze would incite to a weird and flabby activity all that crowded mass of clothing, with its vague suggestions of drowned, mutilated and flattened humanity. Trunks <b>without</b> <b>heads</b> waved at you arms without hands; legs without feet kicked fantastically with collapsible flourishes; and there were long white garments that, taking the wind fairly through their neck openings edged with lace, became for a moment violently distended as by the passage of obese and invisible bodies. On these days you could make out that ship at a great distance by the multi-coloured grotesque riot going on abaft her mizzen mast.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{the same}} anarchic mystery that clings round the phrase, [...] "il pleut," [...] clings round the phrase, [...] "il faut." [...] In English it is {{generally}} represented by the passive mood in grammar, and the Eugenists and their like deal especially in it; they are as passive in their statements as they are active in their experiments. Their sentences always enter tail first, and have no subject, like animals <b>without</b> <b>heads.</b> It is never [...] "the doctor should cut off this leg" [...] or [...] "the policeman should collar that man." [...] It is always [...] "Such limbs should be amputated," [...] or [...] "Such men should be under restraint." [...] Hamlet said, [...] "I should have fatted all the region kites with this slave's offal." [...] The Eugenist would say, [...] "The region kites should, if possible, be fattened; and the offal of this slave is available for the dietetic experiment." [...] Lady Macbeth said, [...] "Give me the daggers; I'll let his bowels out." [...] The Eugenist would say, [...] "In such cases the bowels should, etc." [...] Do not blame me for the repulsiveness of the comparisons. I have searched English literature for the most decent parallels to Eugenist language.|$|E

The young folks would crowd around the hearth, listening with breathless attention to some old crone of a negro, who was the oracle of the family, and who, perched like a raven in the corner of a chimney, would croak forth for a long winter afternoon a string of incredible stories about New England witches, grisly ghosts, horses <b>without</b> <b>heads,</b> and hair-breadth escapes and bloody encounters among the Indians.|$|E

6000|$|The {{minister}} very naturally then {{falls back}} upon good authority, and asks Saunderson {{to take the}} word of Newton, Clarke, and Leibnitz.

If I have no objection to make to what you say about the present condition of things, I may at least question you as to their past condition. I may at least ask of you, for example, who told you--you and Leibnitz and Clarke and Newton--that in the first instances of the formation of animals, some were not <b>without</b> <b>heads</b> and others without feet? I may maintain that these had no stomachs, and those no intestines; that some to whom a stomach, a palate, and teeth seemed to promise permanence, came to an end through some fault of heart or lungs; that the monsters annihilated one another in succession, that all the faulty (vicieuses) combinations of matter disappeared, and that those only survived whose mechanism implied no important mis-adaptation (contradiction), and who had the power of supporting and perpetuating themselves.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Hyperglycemia {{following}} major {{trauma is}} a well know phenomenon related to stress-induced systemic reaction. Reports on glucose level management in patients with head trauma have been published, but the development of insulin resistance in trauma patients <b>without</b> <b>head</b> injury has not been extensively studied. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to investigate the prognostic role of acute insulin-resistance, assessed by the HOMA model, in patients with severe trauma <b>without</b> <b>head</b> injury. Methods All patients consecutively admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a tertiary referral center (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, IT) for major trauma <b>without</b> <b>head</b> injury (Jan-Dec 2010) were enrolled. Patients with a previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus requiring insulin therapy or metabolism alteration were excluded from the analysis. Patients were divided into “insulin resistant” and “non-insulin resistant” based on the Homeostasis Model Assessment index (HOMA IR). Results are expressed as medians. Results Out of 175 trauma patients admitted to the ICU during the study period, a total of 54 patients <b>without</b> <b>head</b> trauma were considered for the study, 37 of whom met the inclusion criteria. In total, 23 patients (62. 2 %) resulted insulin resistant, whereas 14 patients (37. 8 %) were non-insulin resistant. Groups were comparable in demographic, clinical/laboratory characteristics, and severity of injury. Insulin resistant patients had a significantly higher BMI (P= 0. 0416), C-reactive protein (P= 0. 0265), and leukocytes count (0. 0301), compared to non-insulin resistant patients. Also ICU length of stay was longer in insulin resistant patients (P= 0. 0381). Conclusions Our data suggest that admission insulin resistance might be used as an early outcome predictor. </p...|$|R

They are printed, not painted; and what the public wants is the real thing, the work of the brush; and that is what I give them. The pictures you see here, and an immense stock besides, are all copies of valuable paintings, many of them in the finest galleries of Europe. I sell no originals. I guarantee everything to be a copy. Honesty is at the bottom of all I do. But my copies are exactly like the originals; that is all I claim. I would like, sir, to show you through my establishment, and let you see how I am carrying on the great work of art education. There are picture-dealers in this city, sir, plenty of them, who try to make the public believe that the vile daubs they sell are originals, and the works of well-known painters; and when they do admit that the picture is a copy, they say it is the work of some distinguished student; that there is no other copy in the country; or they make some other misstatement about it. These people conceal their processes, but their tricks are beginning to be well known to the public. Now, sir, I conceal nothing. The day for that sort of thing is past. I want men of influence to know the facilities I have for the production of art-work upon a grand scale. We will first go into the basement. Sir," [...] said he, as I followed him down-stairs, [...] "you know how the watch-making business has been revolutionized by the great companies which manufacture watches by machinery. The slow, uncertain, and expensive work of the poor toilers who made watches by hand has been superseded by the swift, unerring, and beautiful operations of machinery and steam. Now, sir, the great purpose of my life is to introduce machinery into art, and, ultimately, steam. And yet I will have no shams, no chromos. Everything shall be real--the work of the brush. Here, sir," [...] he continued, showing me into a long room filled with workmen, [...] "you see the men engaged in putting together the frames on which to stretch my canvases. Every stick is cut, planed, and jointed at a mill in Vermont, and sent on here by the car-load. Beyond are the workmen cutting up, stretching, and preparing the canvas, bales upon bales of which are used in a day. At the far end are the mills for grinding and mixing colors. And now we will go to the upper floors, and see the true art-work. Here, sir," [...] he said, continuing to talk as we walked through the rooms on the various floors, [...] "is the landscape and marine department. That row of men are putting in skies; they do nothing else. Each has his copy before him, and, day after day, month after month, paints nothing but that sky; and of course he does it with great rapidity and fidelity. Above, on those shelves, are sky-pots of every variety; blue-serene pots, tempest pots, sunset pots in compartments, morning-gray pots, and many others. Then the work passes to the middle-ground painters, who have their half-tone pots within easy reach. After that the foreground men take it up, and the figurists put in the men and animals. That man there has been painting that foreground cow ever since the first of August. He can now put her in three and a half times in fifteen minutes, and will probably rise to sixteen cows an hour {{by the end of this}} month. These girls do nothing but put white-caps to waves. There's a great demand at present for the windy marine. This next room is devoted to portraits to order. You see that row of old ladies <b>without</b> <b>heads,</b> each holding a pair of spectacles, and with one finger in the Bible to keep the place; that's very popular, and we put in a head when the photograph is sent. There is a great rage at present for portraits of babies without any clothes on. Here is a lot of undraped infants with bodies all finished, but with no heads. We can finish them to order at very short notice. I have one girl who puts in all the dimples. You would be surprised to see what a charming dimple she can make with one twist of her brush. Long practice at one thing, sir, is the foundation of the success of this great establishment. Take that girl away from her dimple-pot, and she is nothing. She is now upstairs, putting dimples into a large Correggio order from the West. This next room is our figure department, battle-pieces, groups, single figures, everything. As you have seen before, each man only copies from the original that part which is his specialty. In addition to its other advantages, this system is a great protection to us. None of my men can work at home at nights and Sundays, and forge pictures. Not one of them can do a whole one. And now, sir, you have seen the greater part of my establishment. The varnishing, packing, and storage rooms are in another building. I am now perfecting plans for the erection of an immense edifice with steam-engines in the cellar, in which my paintings shall be done by machinery. No chromos, mind you, but real oil-paintings, done by brushes revolving on cylinders. I shall have rolls of canvas a mile long, like the paper on which our great dailies are printed, and the machines shall do everything; cut off the picture, when it has passed among the cylinders, whereupon fresh canvas will be rolled in for a new one; another machine will stretch them; and they will pass through a varnish bath in the twinkling of an eye. But this is in the future. What I want of you, sir, and of other men of influence in society, is to let our people know of the great good that is ready for them now, and of the greater benefit that is coming. And, more than that, you can do incalculable good to our artists. Those poor toilers on the solitary canvas should know how to become prosperous, great, and happy; tell them to go into some other business. And now, sir, I must see what I can do for you. We will return to my gallery, and I will show you exactly what you want." ...|$|E
