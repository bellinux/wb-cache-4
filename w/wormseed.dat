6000|$|But that I may not {{be accused}} to argue from the {{thoughts}} of infants, which are unknown to us, and to conclude from what passes in their understandings before they express it; I say next, that these two general propositions are not the truths that first possess the minds of children, nor are antecedent to all acquired and adventitious notions: which, if they were innate, they must needs be. Whether we can determine it or no, it matters not, {{there is certainly a}} time when children begin to think, and their words and actions do assure us that they do so. When therefore they are capable of thought, of knowledge, of assent, can it rationally be supposed they can be ignorant of those notions that nature has imprinted, were there any such? Can it be imagined, with any appearance of reason, that they perceive the impressions from things without, and be at the same time ignorant of those characters which nature itself has taken care to stamp within? Can they receive and assent to adventitious notions, and be ignorant of those which are supposed woven into the very principles of their being, and imprinted there in indelible characters, to be the foundation and guide of all their acquired knowledge and future reasonings? This would be to make nature take pains to no purpose; or at least to write very ill; since its characters could not be read by those eyes which saw other things very well: and those are very ill supposed the clearest parts of truth, and the foundations of all our knowledge, which are not first known, and without which the undoubted knowledge of several other things may be had. The child certainly knows, that the nurse that feeds it is neither the cat it plays with, nor the blackmoor it is afraid of: that the <b>wormseed</b> or mustard it refuses, is not the apple or sugar it cries for: this it is certainly and undoubtedly assured of: but will any one say, it is by virtue of this principle, [...] "That it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be," [...] that it so firmly assents to these and other parts of its knowledge? Or that the child has any notion or apprehension of that proposition at an age, wherein yet, it is plain, it knows a great many other truths? He that will say, children join in these general abstract speculations with their sucking-bottles and their rattles, may perhaps, with justice, be thought to have more passion and zeal for his opinion, but less sincerity and truth, than one of that age.|$|E

50|$|The {{usage of}} <b>wormseed</b> oil on humans {{is limited by}} the {{toxicity}} of ascaridole and has therefore been discouraged. In high doses, <b>wormseed</b> oil causes irritation of skin and mucous membranes, nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, vertigo, tinnitus, temporary deafness and blindness. Prolonged action induces depression of the central nervous system and delirium which transits into convulsions and coma. Long-term effects include pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs), hematuria, and albuminuria (presence of red blood cells and proteins in the urine, respectively) and jaundice (yellowish pigmentation of the skin). Fatal doses of <b>wormseed</b> oil were reported as one teaspoon for a 14-month-old baby (at once) and daily administration of 1 mL over three weeks to a 2-year-old child.

40|$|American <b>wormseed</b> oil, {{also known}} as Chenopodium ambrosioides oil, is {{obtained}} from the herbs of the genus Chenopodium which comprises more than 200 species and belongs to the geographical region of Asia, Europe, China, India, America and other countries. Chenopodium has been traditionally used for digestive, respiratory, diabetes, uro-genital, nervous and vascular disorders and has antihelminthic, vermifuge, emmenagogue sedative, antipyretic, antirheumatic and abortifacient activities. Ascaridole is a bicyclic monoterpene commonly known as ascarisin or 1, 4 -epidioxy-p-menth- 2 -ene which have sedative, antifungal and painrelieving properties. It is a potent inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium falciparum, and Leishmania amazonensis and {{is well known for}} its worm-expelling potential. Ascaridole was firstly isolated by a German pharmacist in the 1900 ’s and at that time {{it was one of the}} best antihelmintics for the treatment of ascarids and hookworms in humans and other species like cats, dogs, horses and pigs. Ascaridole could be extracted by using a non-polar solvent hexane due to its very poor solubility in water. From the literature support, it has been proved that ascaridole have very high potential in the modern and other system of medicine for the treatment of various disorders. So on the basic of its uses, here we have collected and compiled all the data regarding its medicinal uses, pharmacological activities and analytical techniques of the ascaridole in the present review and expected that this review will be beneficial for the researcher in the field of medicine and other allied science...|$|E
40|$|Infusions and decoctions of the leaves, {{roots and}} inflorescences of the {{herbaceous}} shrub Chenopodium ambrosioides (American <b>wormseed,</b> goosefoot, epazote, paico) and related species indigenous to the New World {{have been used}} for centuries as dietary condiments and as traditional anthelmintics by native peoples for the treatment of intestinal worms. Commercial preparations of oil of chenopodium and its active constituent, ascaridol, obtained by steam distillation, have been and continue to be, used with considerable success in mass treatment campaigns. Ethnopharmacological studies in a community of Mayan subsistence farmers in Chiapas, Mexico, confirmed that decoctions containing up to 300 mg of dry plant material per kg body weight (MGKGW) were widely used and traditionally highly regarded in the treatment of ascariasis. However, therapeutic doses of up to 6000 MGKGW of powdered, dried plant had no significant anthelmintic effect on the adults of Necator, Trichuris of Ascaris. Gas-liquid chromatographic analyses of plant samples used consistently demonstrated the presence of ascaridol in the expected amounts. Possible origins of subjective belief in the efficacy of C. ambrosioides as used, {{may be related to the}} positive association of spontaneous, or peristalsis-induced passage of senescent worms immediately following a therapeutic episode. It is also possible that in the past varieties of the plant containing much more ascaridol were used. The results of these controlled field studies did not sustain widely held traditional beliefs, nor the value of therapeutic practices regarding this plant. It is, therefore, essential that all indigenous ethnomedical practices be objectively evaluated for efficacy and safety using appropriate protocols before being considered for adoptation or promotion in health care programs. Although this herbal drug was not efficacious as currently used, its essential oil, which is highly effective, could be extracted using technology and materials available at the village level. The plant already is known, accepted, and widely grown by rural peoples. Intestinal helminths are a constant and serious health problem in most such communities. Commercially available pharmaceuticals are effective but too expensive for periodic treatment and prophylaxis. Reinfection immediately following treatment is inevitable given the socioeconomic, climatic and hygienic conditions in such communities. The local production and application of an effective and inexpensive anthelmintic, therefore, would be of considerable public health and economic importance. ...|$|E
