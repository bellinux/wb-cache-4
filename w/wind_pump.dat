50|$|The cooling {{technology}} {{under development}} by Kronos and Thorn Micro Technologies employs a device called an ionic <b>wind</b> <b>pump</b> (also {{known as an}} electrostatic fluid accelerator).

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to evaluate the possible influence of <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> on snow metamorphism, and hence snow stability. <b>Wind</b> <b>pumping</b> refers to a pulsile forced flow of air in a snow pack due to surface pressure fluctuations. An extensive review of atmospheric turbulence from related disciplines was carried out in order to identify the characteristics of turbulence in mountain terrain. This was followed by an experimental programme to characterise and measure the pressure fluctuations on the snow surface in the mountain terrain of Arthur's Pass National Park. Frequencies between 0. 0005 and 1 Hz were studied and power spectral/correlation function analysis was made. Gust exceedance statistics were also calculated. The turbulence intensities and rms pressure fluctuations were found to be significantly larger than those reported in the literature. The spectral analysis showed similar form to other documented spectra, but was shifted substantially toward lower frequencies. The same low frequency components, and a semi-periodic component was evident in the autocorrelation analysis. It was suggested that these features arise from turbulent structures shedding off large upstream structures and/or gravity wave activity. Following this, laboratory tests on beds packed with granular materials were carried out to study <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> airflow dynamics and the influence of <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> airflow on diffusive mass transfer. A mathematical basis for the dissipation of the surface pressure fluctuations in a permeable bed has been experimentally verified in the laboratory. Three one-dimensional models proposed were then applied {{to a wide variety of}} snow pack conditions. One model (finite-sealed) was found to be widely applicable to <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> modelling in the seasonal snow pack. A linear approximation to this model is applicable to most seasonal snow packs. Sublimating naphthalene was used as a tracer in a set of laboratory experiments to measure the enhanced diffusive mass transfer rates in a packed column due to <b>wind</b> <b>pumping.</b> Compared to stagnant air diffusion rate, an enhancement of one to two orders of magnitude was measured in mass loss rates. The mass loss rate enhancement depended strongly on both the period and magnitude of the applied <b>wind</b> <b>pumping.</b> The mass loss per cycle showed a large, linear dependence on cyclic displacement. This showed that the naphthalene mass loss process was 1 -D planar convective/diffusion controlled. A slight dependence on peak velocity was also found. This indicated that the naphthalene mass loss process had a small dependence on boundary layer diffusion. Finally, cold laboratory experiments were carried out to directly study the effects of <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> in snow in a controlled environment. A number of strength tests were applied. The cone penetrometer is recommended as the most useful strength testing tool in this type of analysis. Pressure fluctuations associated with gale force winds (60 to 90 km/hr) were used to provide strong <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> conditions. Two types of experiments were run, both in high density snow (= 350 kg/m 3) : Initially bonded grains had moderate to high temperature gradients imposed on them to evaluate any enhancements in the faceting process. Grains without any initial bonding had low temperature gradients imposed upon them to evaluate any enhancements in the rounding process. It was found that <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> enhanced the rate of the process in both cases. There was a significant <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> enhancement of strength loss at high temperature gradients. The influence of <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> on the growth rates of depth hoar appears to be almost as significant as the influence of the temperature gradient magnitude. This <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> enhancement is most likely to occur when there is a large temperature difference near the surface of the snow pack between the air and snow or between two layers of snow. There was a significant <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> enhancement of strength increase at low temperature gradients. The effect of <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> on the development of snow strength appears to be more important than the effect of elapsed time. The differences in enhancement with and without <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> appear to be larger at the beginning of the bonding process. It is conceivable that the <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> could play a major role in the initial bonding. It is therefore concluded that <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> is possibly a major contributing mechanism in the development of wind slabs. Hence it can be concluded that <b>wind</b> <b>pumping</b> significantly enhances dry snow metamorphism...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse the {{operation}} of a wind-electric pumping system (WEPS) as an alternative to conventional mechanical <b>wind</b> <b>pumps</b> for application in stand-alone water-pumping schemes. The steady-state as well as the dynamic operation of such a system is analysed. Through these analyses, practical guidelines are given in the design and sizing of the different system components to ensure efficient and reliable operation. Theoretical analyses are supported by measured results conducted on a small scale wind-electric pump system. The limitations involved in the design and implementation of a large scale wind-electric pump system are presented through a case study. It is firstly concluded that small-scale wind-electric pump systems have the potential of offering superior performance and flexibility to conventional mechanical <b>wind</b> <b>pumps.</b> It is secondly concluded that large-scale wind-electric pump systems are best suited, in terms of economic and practical feasibility, to pumping applications with low pressures and medium to high wind regimes at the turbine installation site...|$|R
40|$|The {{imminent}} exhaustion {{of fossil}} energy {{resources and the}} increasing demand for energy were the motives for those reasonable in Sudan to put into practice an energy policy based on rational use of energy; and on exploitation of new, and renewable energy sources. After 1980, as the supply of conventional energy {{has not been able}} to follow the tremendous increase of the production demand in rural areas of Sudan, a renewed interest for the application of wind energy has shown in many places. Therefore, the Sudanese government began to pay more attention to wind energy utilisation in rural areas. Because the wind energy resource in many rural areas is sufficient for attractive application of <b>wind</b> <b>pumps,</b> and as fuel is insufficient, the <b>wind</b> <b>pumps</b> will be spread on a rather large scale in the near future. Wind is a form of renewable energy, which is always in a non-steady state due to the wide temporal and spatial variations of wind velocity. A number of years worth of data concerning wind speed in Sudan have been compiled, evaluated and presented in this article. The need for the provision of new data stations in order to enable a complete and reliable assessment of the overall wind power potential of the country is identified and specific locations suggested. This paper presents the background and ideas of the development of the concept as well as the main results, and experience gained during ongoing project up to now. In Sudan, various designs of wind machines for water pumping have been developed and some designs are presently manufactured commercially. Results suggest that wind power would be more profitably used for local-and small-scale applications especially for remote rural areas. It is concluded that Sudan is blessed with abundant wind energy. Sudan Wind energy resources Wind power potential and assessment <b>Wind</b> <b>pumps</b> application Water pumping...|$|R
