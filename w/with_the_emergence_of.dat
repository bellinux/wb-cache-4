5|$|A second {{expedition}} in 1102 saw incursions into Ireland but in August 1103 he {{was killed}} fighting in Ulster. The next king of the isles was Lagmann Godredsson and there followed a succession of Godred Crovan's descendants who, (as vassals of the kings of Norway) ruled the Hebrides north of Ardnamurchan for the next 160 years. However, their control of the southern Inner Hebrides was lost <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> Somerled, the self-styled Lord of Argyle.|$|E
5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century. However, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> the feminist movement {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E

5|$|Georgian {{architecture}} {{followed in}} a more refined style, evoking a simple Palladian form; the Royal Crescent at Bath {{is one of the}} best examples of this. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> romanticism during Victorian period, a Gothic Revival was launched—in addition to this around the same time the Industrial Revolution paved the way for buildings such as The Crystal Palace.

5|$|Hamhuis' {{role with}} the Predators was diminished {{in his final}} few seasons in Nashville <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> younger defencemen Shea Weber and Ryan Suter as the club's top two defencemen.

5|$|Invasion by Magnus Barefoot in {{the late}} 11th century {{resulted}} in {{a brief period of}} direct Norwegian rule over the kingdom, but soon the descendants of Godred Crovan re-asserted a further period of largely independent overlordship.

5|$|Beginning roughly in 1992, {{three years}} after the RJR Nabisco buyout, and {{continuing}} {{through the end of the}} decade the private equity industry once again experienced a tremendous boom, both in venture capital (as will be discussed below) and leveraged buyouts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> brand name firms managing multibillion-dollar sized funds. After declining from 1990 through 1992, the private equity industry began to increase in size raising approximately $20.8 billion of investor commitments in 1992 and reaching a high-water mark in 2000 of $305.7 billion, outpacing the growth of almost every other asset class.|$|E
5|$|Bell: Clapper-bells made {{of pottery}} {{have been found}} in several archaeological sites. The {{earliest}} metal bells, with one found in the Taosi site, and four in the Erlitou site, dated to about 2000 BC, may have been derived from the earlier pottery prototype. Early bells not only have an important role in generating metal sound, but arguably played a prominent cultural role. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> other kinds of bells during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BC), they were relegated to subservient functions; at Shang and Zhou sites, they are also found as part of the horse-and-chariot gear and as collar-bells of dogs.|$|E

5|$|From this {{changing}} society emerged a common, unifying musical language, {{in particular}} the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. Demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated {{in the second half}} of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and William Byrd.|$|E
5|$|Heskey's {{place in}} the England squad had been placed under {{scrutiny}} in 2003 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> Wayne Rooney into the England squad. However, despite being criticised for his lack of international goals, he continued to {{be an integral part}} of the international squad and took over the captaincy from Michael Owen after he was substituted when England beat Serbia and Montenegro 2–1 in his hometown of Leicester in June 2003. Heskey was named in the England squad for UEFA Euro 2004, but failed to perform well, and was the subject of much criticism. He came on as a substitute while England were leading 1–0 against France and fouled Claude Makélélé on the edge of the penalty area, giving away a direct free kick from which France equalised. England eventually lost 2–1.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 a {{political}} crisis emerged in Poland <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> the Solidarity mass movement. By {{the end of}} October, Solidarity had 3 million members, and by December, had 9 million. In a public opinion poll organised by the Polish government, 89% of the respondents supported Solidarity. With the Polish leadership split on what to do, the majority {{did not want to}} impose martial law, as suggested by Wojciech Jaruzelski. The Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc was unsure how to handle the situation, but Erich Honecker of East Germany pressed for military action. In a formal letter to Brezhnev, Honecker proposed a joint military measure to control the escalating problems in Poland. A CIA report suggested the Soviet military were mobilising for an invasion.|$|E

5|$|In {{parallel}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary also persuaded {{an active}} expansionist {{policy in the}} Balkan Peninsula {{from the end of}} the 12th century. To that end, Oltenia was put under the control of a Hungarian governor, who received the title of ban. The centre of the new province (the Banate of Severin) was Fort Severin (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Romania), on the Danube, in the vicinity of the Iron Gates. Its first ban, Luke, was mentioned in 1233.|$|E
5|$|Kelly, {{naturally}} a first baseman, saw regular time as {{a second}} baseman in 1925 when Frisch injured his hand, while backup Bill Terry began playing first base. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> Terry, who requested a trade {{so that he could}} receive more playing time, and Giants manager John McGraw desiring an improvement in the outfield, Kelly was traded to the Cincinnati Reds prior to the 1927 season for Edd Roush.

The Reds released Pipp before the 1929 season, and Kelly returned to first base.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{beliefs in}} the Eastern Empire and Iran were in flux during the late sixth and early seventh centuries. Judaism was an active {{proselytising}} faith, {{and at least one}} Arab political leader converted to it. Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians' Zoroastrianism in seeking converts, especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula. All these strands came together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad (d. 632). After his death, Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia, starting with Syria in 634–635 and reaching Egypt in 640–641, Persia between 637 and 642, North Africa in the later seventh century, and the Iberian Peninsula in 711. By 714, Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called Al-Andalus.|$|E

5|$|The {{intermittent}} Roman {{presence in}} Scotland coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> the Picts, a confederation of tribes who lived {{to the north}} of the Forth and Clyde from Roman times until the 10th century.

They are often said to have tattooed themselves, but evidence for this is limited. Naturalistic depictions of Pictish nobles, hunters and warriors, male and female, without obvious tattoos, are found on their monumental stones. The Gaels of Dalriada called the Picts Cruithne, and Irish poets portrayed their Pictish counterparts as very much like themselves.|$|E
