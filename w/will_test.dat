5|$|After {{experimentation}} on the Brighton experimental ensemble, Ofcom advertised {{for small}} scale DAB multiplexes to broadcast across the United Kingdom on ten localised multiplexes for a nine-month trial period, then extended {{for an extra}} two years. The trials <b>will</b> <b>test</b> the viability of using free and open source software (FOSS) with low cost equipment to broadcast from a single transmitter, a single frequency network or channel repeaters to allow smaller radio stations to broadcast more cost effectively than is currently possible on local multiplexes.|$|E
5|$|In December 2011, the FAA awarded $7.7 {{million to}} eight {{companies}} {{to advance the}} development of commercial aviation biofuels, with a special focus on alcohol to jet fuel. The FAA is assisting {{in the development of}} a sustainable fuel (from alcohols, sugars, biomass, and organic matter such as pyrolysis oils) that can be “dropped in” to aircraft without changing current practices and infrastructure. The research <b>will</b> <b>test</b> how the new fuels affect engine durability and quality control standards.|$|E

25|$|A doctor <b>will</b> <b>test</b> for {{prolactin}} {{blood levels}} {{in women with}} unexplained milk secretion (galactorrhea) or irregular menses or infertility, and in men with impaired sexual function and, in rare cases, milk secretion. If prolactin is high, a doctor <b>will</b> <b>test</b> thyroid function and ask first about other conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion. The doctor will also request a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), {{which is the most}} sensitive test for detecting pituitary tumors and determining their size. MRI scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. Computed Tomography (CT scan) also gives an image of the pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI.|$|E

25|$|None of {{the rapid}} tests are {{currently}} as sensitive as a thick blood film, nor as cheap. A major drawback {{in the use of}} all current dipstick methods is that the result is essentially qualitative.

25|$|An orienteering map, and a compass, are {{the primary}} aids for the {{competitor}} to complete an orienteering course of control points as quickly as possible. A map that is reliable and accurate is essential so that a course can be provided which <b>will</b> <b>test</b> the navigational skills of the competitor.

25|$|If {{the myth}} lacks any {{specific}} scenarios, the MythBusters <b>will</b> <b>test</b> every reasonable scenario, {{and just one}} scenario is {{enough for them to}} confirm the myth. For example, when testing to see whether shooting fish in a barrel was in fact very easy, in most tests, they could not hit the fish with a bullet, but the energy transfer to the water by the bullet was lethal to the fish; therefore, the myth was confirmed.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the late}} {{inspection}} of Endeavours heat shield, the Mission Management Team officially cleared the orbiter for re-entry. The crew {{spent the day}} preparing for landing, performing inspections and checkout of the shuttle's flight control surfaces and reaction control system thrusters. Near {{the end of the}} crew's day, a Department of Defense satellite, Picosat, was deployed. The satellite <b>will</b> <b>test</b> two new types of photovoltaic solar cells, to determine their effectiveness for generating power.|$|E
25|$|Guidons {{are also}} used in recruit {{training}} to identify individual platoons. First and second phase platoons have a gold background with their four-digit platoon number in scarlet, while third phase platoons have a scarlet background with gold lettering and trim. The guidon is used {{as an aid to}} instilling unit identity and pride, representing the platoon. Some drill instructors <b>will</b> <b>test</b> that pride by attempting to dishonor the guidon and expecting the recruits to intervene. Also, the recruit assigned to carry it, the guide, is treated as the most senior recruit of the platoon, and uses the guidon to marks the line of advance in close-quarters drill.|$|E

25|$|Coccidioidomycosis* is a {{fungal disease}} caused by Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii that affects {{a variety of}} species, {{including}} dogs. In dogs signs of primary pulmonary disease include a cough, fever, weight loss, anorexia, and lethargy. Disseminated disease occurs when the fungus has spread outside of the lungs and may include clinical signs such as lameness, pain, seizures, anterior uveitis, and localized swelling. Diagnosis of Valley Fever may include multiple tests, including serology and radiology. According to a study performed in the Tucson and Phoenix area, 28% of dogs <b>will</b> <b>test</b> positive for exposure to the fungus by two years of age, but only 6% of the dogs will be ill with clinical disease. There is {{an increased risk of}} infection associated with amount of time spent outdoors, a larger roaming space accessed by the dog, and increasing age.|$|E
25|$|After {{veraison}} has begun, viticulturists <b>will</b> <b>test</b> {{several hundred}} individual berries picked from clusters throughout the vineyard in increasing intervals as the harvest draws closers. The berries will usually {{be taken from}} the middle of the cluster bunch, avoiding vines on the end of rows that tend to be exposed to the most unusual elements. The must weight is then plotted on a chart to see the increasing ripeness and sugar levels of the grape. What must weight reading is most desirable will depend on the winemaker's personal goal for ripeness. A wine with the intended potential alcohol level of 12% will need to be harvested at around 21.7°Bx/12 degree Baumé/93°Oe. A wine with the intended potential alcohol level of 15% will need to be harvested at around 27.1°Bx/15 degree Baumé/119°Oe. The desired ripeness for most table wines tend to fall somewhere between those two must weight measurements.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{that use}} {{passwords}} for authentication {{must have some}} way to check any password entered to gain access. If the valid passwords are simply stored in a system file or database, an attacker who gains sufficient access to the system will obtain all user passwords, giving the attacker access to all accounts on the attacked system, and possibly other systems where users employ the same or similar passwords. One way to reduce this risk is to store only a cryptographic hash of each password instead of the password itself. Standard cryptographic hashes, such as the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) series, are very hard to reverse, so an attacker who gets hold of the hash value cannot directly recover the password. However, knowledge of the hash value lets the attacker quickly test guesses offline. Password cracking programs are widely available that <b>will</b> <b>test</b> {{a large number of}} trial passwords against a purloined cryptographic hash.|$|E
