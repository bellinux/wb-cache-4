The car operates primarily as a rear <b>wheel</b> drive vehicle. <b>Clutches</b> in the front transaxle engage when the rear wheels slip. Drive to the front wheels is transmitted through two infinitely-variable clutch packs which are allowed to 'slip' to give the required road wheel speeds. The front transaxle has three gears, two forward, and reverse. The two forward gears of the front transmission match the lower four forward gears of the rear transmission. It is not used in higher gears. The connection between this gearbox and each front wheel is via independent haldex-type clutches, without a differential.

In this thesis, there will be information about the problem with landmines today and how a landmine work, along with the development process for the product, including concept evaluation, calculations and simulations. The basic idea of the concept is that a load is to be dropped at the landmines location. The load will create a ground pressure that will trigger any pressure sensitive landmines. The load is a 25 kg heavy bag of sand and it will be dropped from a height of 1 meter. A winch lifts the load up and keeps it in the air. A clutch disconnects the drum {{from the rest of the}} winch system and the load drops to the ground. A scaffold is placed on the robot, with a pulley wheel at the top. The scaffold and the pulley wheel are designed and placed so that the pulley wheel is directly above the landmines, which are located in the middle and at the rear of the robot. A steel wire connects the load and the winch via the pulley <b>wheel.</b> The <b>clutch</b> is custom designed from scratch to fit the winch system. A linear actuator connects and disconnects the clutch. The winch is driven by a brushless direct current motor, along with a gearbox.

40|$|Piecewise affine (PWA) systems {{provide good}} {{flexibility}} and traceability for modeling {{a variety of}} nonlinear systems. The stability of PWA systems is an important but challenging problem since {{the stability of the}} sub-systems does not directly imply the stability of the global system. Meanwhile, time delays and uncertainty exist in many practical systems in engineering and introduce various complex behaviors such as oscillation, instability and poor performance. To ensure the stability of the practical control systems developed via the PWA system framework, the stability of uncertain PWA time-delay systems is investigated. In addition, a quantitative description of asymptotic behavior for time-delay systems is also studied. First, the stability problem for uncertain piecewise affine time-delay systems is investigated. It is assumed that there exists a constant time delay in the system and the uncertainly is norm-bounded. Sufficient conditions for the stability of nominal systems and the stability of systems subject to uncertainty are derived using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with a triple integration term. This approach handles switching based on the delayed states (in addition to the states) for a PWA time-delay system, considers structured as well as unstructured uncertainty, and reduces the conservativeness of previous approaches. Second, an application of the PWA system framework to the modeling and control of an automotive all <b>wheel</b> drive <b>clutch</b> system is presented. The open-loop system is modeled as a PWA system, followed by the design of a piecewise linear feedback controller. The stability of the closed-loop system is examined using the proposed stability method. Finally, a new Lambert W function based approach for estimation of the decay function for time-delay systems is presented. Using this solution form, a decay function estimate, which is less conservative than existing methods, is obtained...|$|R
5000|$|In all cases, the {{computer}} continues {{to adjust the}} throttle to match the ever-changing target speed of the <b>wheels</b> when the <b>clutch</b> is partially engaged, as the vehicle speed may often change while shifting (for example due to shifting while going up or down a hill). In actual execution, {{the computer}} is able to [...] "blip" [...] the throttle due {{to the presence of}} an electronic throttle, in which the computer has direct control over both the fuel and air inputs to the engine. As the accelerator pedal in such a system has no direct mechanical connection to the throttle valve, the engagement of the system to change engine speeds is apparent to the driver via sound and tachometer cues only, and the feel or weight of the accelerator pedal remains constant. Regardless of the previous operation, the involvement of the system is ended when the clutch pedal reaches a certain point of re-engagement to ensure the system does not interfere with the driver's intended power output to the wheels. In any case, Nissan has provided a switch to disengage the system, for example {{in the case of the}} driver preferring to perform their own rev matching.|$|R

40|$|Traditional chassis {{technologies}} {{still play}} an important role in the racing and sports car market. The design of such a specialist vehicle is a matter of finding a compromise between performance, safety and manufacturing costs. Performance mainly means a high torsional stiffness which directly affects the cornering behaviour of the vehicle. Safety issues regard the impact absorbing capability of the structure. On the cost side it should be underlined that racing cars are usually hand-made in very small numbers. The production of low power, low cost racing cars in particular is heavily affected by workmanship costs. The paper aims to present a project currently under development at the University of Brescia with the co-operation of Metra, one of the leading European companies in the field of aluminium alloy extrusion. A single-seater chassis has been designed with the main target of matching reduced manufacturing costs with high safety and structural performance levels. The chassis sidewalls are one-piece, closed section light alloy extrusions which provide bending and torsion stiffness as well as energy absorption properties for either front and side impacts. The two beams directly support the front suspension and engine. A casting and traditional steel tube rollbars connect the beams, together with a few honeycomb panels bonded into rails designed in the section. Purposely designed extrusions also replace traditional castings for components like <b>wheel</b> uprights and <b>clutch</b> bell allowing for relevant scale economy...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSafety {{while driving}} ensured by the {{automotive}} to its passengers {{or to the}} merchandises transported is an increasingly important feature, both in the acquisition process as well as while driving it. Thus the automotive builders equip their new models of automotives with increasingly more complex electronic equipments, that provide multiple functions concerning safety and comfort while driving, These electronic equipments have names that are already part of everyday language such as: ASR, ABS, ESP, more and more performing and often used in mass production Often buyers look for or are even surprised by the multitude of facilities provided by the electronic equipments the automotives have, with impact in the comfort and the safety while driving Although these equipments {{have a significant impact}} on the acquisition price of the automotive, they also improve significantly the comfort by reducing the physical effort of the driver when handling the steering <b>wheel,</b> the <b>clutch,</b> the gear box or the break pedal. Safety while driving is improved by creating specific forces on the surface that makes the contact between the wheels and the road, leading to a permanent grip between the wheel and the road regardless to the driving conditions. More often than not the electronic control systems of the automotive act in the sense of improving the commands given the driver, or in a danger situation, they override the commands of the driver in order to prevent the accident from happening This paper analyses the most frequent used equipments that can be found on the automotives nowadays and their functioning principles. We analyze the systems that ensure safety while driving when accelerating (ASR) or braking (ABS) as well as in transitory situations (ESP). We present detailed schemes for every system described and the way it influences the dynamic behaviour of the automotive. Furthermore there are presented the safety performances while driving of the automotives equipped with such systems concerning the manoeuvrability and the stability while straight forward driving or on corners This paper makes recommendations concerning the teaching methods of the safety systems of electronic control while driving the automotive in such manner that they are easily understood and assimilated by the students.
