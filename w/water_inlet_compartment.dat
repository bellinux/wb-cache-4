40|$|The {{development}} of a new diffusion cell for in vitro transdermal permeation is described. The so-called Kelder cells were used in combination with the ASPEC system (Automatic Sample Preparation with Extraction Columns), which is designed for the automation of solid-phase extractions (SPE). Instead of SPE columns, 20 Kelder cells were placed in the racks. This allowed automatic sampling of up to 20 cells for 24 h in a dynamic mode. The cells consist of an <b>inlet</b> <b>compartment,</b> a donor compartment and a receptor compartment. The size and the depth of the <b>inlet</b> <b>compartment</b> were important to avoid entrapment of air bubbles in the receptor compartment. The Kelder cells mimic blood flow beneath the skin by replacement of the permeating drug every 2 min. Hence sink conditions are more easily maintained than with the static Franz diffusion cell. The performance of the cells was tested with permeation experiments using atropine as a model drug permeating through an artificial membrane (Silastic). The use of this skin model minimized the variability in permeation of atropine as compared with human skin...|$|R

Using the theoretical model, the effect of different parameters on the collector’s energy and exergy efficiency has been investigated. It is concluded that <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> temperature, <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> mass flow rate, the transmittance of tubes and absorptance of the absorber surface have a direct effect on the energy and exergy efficiency of the heat pipe evacuated tube solar collector.

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} treated and {{untreated}} <b>water</b> <b>inlets</b> with macrophytes on {{the improvement of}} water quality and zooplankton community were evaluated in a fish pond with continuous water flow. Water and zooplankton samples were retrieved at four sites during nine months. There were differences (p< 0. 01) between <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> from fish pond and <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> from canal with macrophytes, featuring higher concentrations of nutrient load, mainly TAN and TP in the former. The <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> from fish pond contained a higher number of abundant species (9 species), whilst the water supply from the canal with macrophytes had a greater richness (31 species) of zooplankton species. Results showed that <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> without macrophytes directly affected {{the characteristics of the}} water column and the dominance of zooplankton species such as Thermocyclops decipiens, and greater abundance of Rotifera species. Since aquatic plants in the <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> of fish pond analyzed showed lower allochthonous material loads from the previous fish pond, the management adopted with macrophytes may be applied to avoid eutrophication risks, common in farm ponds...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{global warming}} and energy {{shortage}} have {{become more and more}} serious as economies develop rapidly all over the world. Adsorption cooling systems powered by solar energy or waste heat have drawn increasing attention, as such systems need neither CFCs nor HCFCs as the working fluid and neither fossil fuel nor electricity to drive them. Composite adsorbents were synthesized from activated carbon, silica-gel and CaCl 2. The optimized condition for adsorption cooling systems was obtained when raw activated carbon was impregnated by soaking in 10 wt. % sodium silicate solution for 48 hours and then in 30 wt. % CaCl 2 solution for 48 hours. A 0. 805 kg kg- 1 of difference in equilibrium water uptake between 25 °C and 115 °C was recorded at atmospheric pressure. Besides, an adsorption rate test unit was built to study the adsorption isotherms and adsorption rates in which 0. 23 kg kg- 1 of adsorption capacity was recorded at 27 °C with a water vapor pressure of 900 Pa. The performance of a waste heat driven adsorption chiller by applying the novel composite adsorbent (silica activated carbon/CaCl 2) was also studied.
