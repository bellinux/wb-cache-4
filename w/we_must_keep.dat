500|$|East Coker gives {{a message}} of hope that the English {{communities}} would survive through World War II. In a letter dated 9 February 1940, Eliot stated, [...] "We can have very little hope of contributing to any immediate social change; and we are more disposed to see our hope in modest and local beginnings, than in transforming the whole world at once... <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> alive aspirations which can remain valid throughout the longest and darkest period of universal calamity and degradation." [...] The poem also relied on the war {{as a way to}} connect to Eliot's idea that there was a united humanity. In particular, Stephen Spender claimed that [...] "the war modified [...] attitude by convincing him that there was a Western cause to be positively defended. And after the war there was a Germany to be brought back within the Western tradition".|$|E

Before {{he was taken}} he gave this statement: [...] "In Heaven it appears that they deem us to be righteous because our bodies have been chosen to atone for the Jewish people. Therefore, we must repent now, immediately. There is not much time. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> in mind {{that we will be}} better offerings if we repent. In this way we will save the lives of our brethren overseas. Let no thought enter our minds, God forbid, which is abominable and which renders an offering unfit. We are now fulfilling the greatest mitzvah. With fire she (Jerusalem) was destroyed and with fire she will be rebuilt. The very fire which consumes our bodies will one day rebuild the Jewish people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{wrote to}} a friend: [...] "I have never heard such a squalid {{confession}} from a public man as Baldwin offered us yesterday". In 1935 Baldwin wrote to J. C. C. Davidson (in a letter now lost) saying of Churchill: [...] "If {{there is going to}} be a war – and no one can say that there is not – <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> him fresh to be our war Prime Minister". Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: [...] "If we do have a war, Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [...] now we shan't be able to engage in that war as a united nation". The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: [...] "Baldwin thought his [...] political recovery was marvellous. He, personally, had always thought that if war came Winston would be the right man for the job".|$|E

2500|$|As McKelway explains, {{the sources}} of {{theology}} contribute {{to the formation of}} the norm, which then becomes the criterion through which the sources and experience are judged. [...] The relationship is circular, as it is the present situation which conditions the norm in the interaction between church and biblical message. [...] The norm is then subject to change, but Tillich insists that its basic content remains the same: that of the biblical message. [...] It is tempting to conflate revelation with the norm, but <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> in mind that revelation (whether original or dependent) is not an element of the structure of systematic theology per se, but an event. [...] For Tillich, the present-day norm is the “New Being in Jesus as the Christ as our Ultimate Concern”. [...] This is because the present question is one of estrangement, and the overcoming of this estrangement is what Tillich calls the “New Being”. But since Christianity answers the question of estrangement with “Jesus as the Christ”, the norm tells us that we find the New Being in Jesus as the Christ.|$|E

'I {{only know}} this much,' said Ferdinand, 'that {{he has given}} the Department with which I have the honour to be associated;' this {{sparkling}} young Barnacle threw off the phrase sportively, as who should say, We know all about these forms of speech, but <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> it up, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>keep</b> the game alive; 'no end of trouble, and has put us into innumerable fixes.' ...|$|E
