5000|$|The {{success of}} the Astor House invited competition. The St Nicholas Hotel on Broadway at Broome Street was built for $1 million and offered the {{innovation}} of central heating that circulated <b>warmed</b> <b>air</b> through <b>registers</b> to every room. It {{was said to have}} ended the Astor House's preeminence in New York hostelry. [...] The Metropolitan Hotel opened in 1852 just north of Astor House, at Prince Street, was equally luxurious. But the new hotel to put all others in the shade was the Fifth Avenue Hotel facing Madison Square.|$|R
60|$|Tantalized by an {{occasional}} feeble and vacillating current of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> from the <b>register,</b> I was forced {{at times to}} wear my overcoat as I read, and at night I spread it over my cot. I {{did not see the}} sun for a month. The wind was always filled with rain or sleet, and as the lights in Bates' Hall were almost always blazing, I could hardly tell when day left off and night began. It seemed as if I had been plunged into another and darker world, a world of storm, of gray clouds, of endless cold.|$|R

50|$|Expel <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> as {{directly}} as possible. Examples are: Conventional PC (ATX) {{power supplies}} blow the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> {{out the back}} of the case. Many dual-slot graphics card designs blow the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> through the cover of the adjacent slot. There are also some aftermarket coolers that do this. Some CPU cooling designs blow the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> directly towards the back of the case, where it can be ejected by a case fan.|$|R
50|$|An {{inversion}} {{occurs when}} the normal temperature (<b>warm</b> <b>air</b> below, cold air above) profile is reversed, creating a stable configuration of dense, cold air sitting below lighter, <b>warm</b> <b>air.</b> An elevated inversion layer is thus a region of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> above a region of cold air, but higher in the atmosphere (generally not touching the surface).|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} {{describes the}} basic information about <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating and general recommendations for using {{this type of}} heating. The next chapter contents {{a summary of the}} advantages and disadvantages of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating. The following chapters deal with the main elements of the whole system. There is also pointed out the difference between radiant and convective heat transfer. At the end of this thesis there is shown an overview of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating systems used for last years. Last part tells about prospects of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating according author’s opinion...|$|R
5000|$|These {{winds are}} {{opposite}} from each other. While valley breezes {{occur when the}} <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rises up the sides, <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> in a mountain breeze will rise up the middle.|$|R
50|$|The trowal (short for TROugh of <b>Warm</b> <b>air</b> ALoft) is the {{projection}} on the Earth's {{surface of the}} trough of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|R
50|$|Warm fronts occur {{where the}} <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> pushes out a {{previously}} lodged cold <b>air</b> mass. The <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> overrides the cooler air and moves upward. Warm fronts {{are followed by}} extended periods of light rain and drizzle, because, after the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rises above the cooler air (which remains on the ground), it gradually cools due to the air's expansion while being lifted, which forms clouds and leads to precipitation.|$|R
5000|$|Thermals {{are caused}} by local {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, or impurity concentration in the vertical. Temperature differences can cause <b>air</b> currents because <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> is less dense than cooler <b>air,</b> causing the <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> to appear [...] "lighter." [...] Thus, if the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is under the cool air, air currents will form as they exchange places. Air currents are caused because of the uneven heating of Earth's surface.|$|R
50|$|Air {{convection}} {{heating systems}} have been in use for over a century. Older systems rely on a passive air circulation system where the greater density of cooler air causes it to sink into the furnace area below, through <b>air</b> return <b>registers</b> in the floor, and the lesser density of <b>warmed</b> <b>air</b> causes it to rise in the ductwork; the two forces acting together to drive air circulation in a system termed 'gravity-fed'. The layout of these 'octopus’ furnaces and their duct systems is optimized with various diameters of large dampered ducts.|$|R
50|$|The {{boundary}} layer {{is the part}} of the atmosphere which is closest to the ground. Normally, the sun heats the ground, which in turn heats the air just above it. Thermals form when this <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rises into the cold <b>air</b> (<b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is less dense than cold air), a process described by convection. A convective layer such as this has the potential for cloud formation, since condensation occurs as the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> rises and cools.|$|R

There is designed <b>warmed</b> <b>air</b> heating, <b>warmed</b> <b>airing</b> and circulation of air for office spaces, relax room and industrial hall in the polyfunctional building. Project part includes realization of airconditioning devices...|$|R
50|$|Cold fronts {{occur when}} {{a mass of}} cooler air dislodges a mass of <b>warm</b> <b>air.</b> This type of {{transition}} is sharper, since cold air is more dense than <b>warm</b> <b>air.</b> The rain duration is shorter, and generally more intense, than that which occurs ahead of warm fronts.|$|R
50|$|This term {{describes}} device cooling by the convection {{currents of}} the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> {{being allowed to}} escape {{the confines of the}} component to be replaced by cooler <b>air.</b> Since <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> normally rises, this method usually requires venting at the top or sides of the casing to be effective.|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime <b>air.</b> These <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the <b>warmest</b> <b>air</b> masses, leading to the warmest temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in <b>warm</b> and tropical <b>air</b> from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|R

50|$|A {{warm front}} is also {{defined as the}} {{transition}} zone where a <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> mass is replacing a cooler <b>air</b> mass. <b>Warm</b> fronts generally move from southwest to northeast. If the <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> originates over the ocean, {{it is not only}} warmer but also more moist than the air ahead of it.|$|R

However, warmth can decrease germination rates of the seeds and degrade the visual aspect and the protein content of the seeds, which would be problematic for the seed market.|$|R
50|$|Burning {{wood fuel}} {{in an open}} fire is both {{extremely}} inefficient (0-20%) and polluting due to low temperature partial combustion. In {{the same way that}} a drafty building loses heat through loss of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> through poor sealing, an open fire is responsible for large heat losses by drawing very large volumes of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> out of the building.|$|R
50|$|During {{the winter}} {{it is the}} {{relatively}} high elevation of the Short Hills Bench which allows it to benefit from rising <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> currents blowing south off Lake Ontario, {{in much the same}} way as the lower lying coastal sub-appellations do. This <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> has a moderating effect on the mesoclimate, protecting the tender buds from potentially damaging frosts.|$|R
50|$|Combustion (e.g., fireplace, gas heater, candle, oil lamp, etc.) consumes oxygen while {{producing}} {{carbon dioxide}} and other unhealthy gases and smoke, requiring ventilation air. An open chimney promotes infiltration (i.e. natural ventilation) because of the negative pressure change induced by the buoyant, <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> leaving through the chimney. The <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is typically replaced by heavier, cold air.|$|R
50|$|Stack {{ventilation}} - Cross ventilation is {{an effective}} cooling strategy, however, wind is an unreliable resource. Stack ventilation is an alternative design strategy that relies on the buoyancy of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> to rise and exit through openings located at ceiling height. Cooler outside air replaces the rising <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> through carefully designed inlets placed near the floor.|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} design of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating and {{ventilating}} system for low energy house. Introduction of this thesis {{is focused on}} dividing residential buildings by their heat requirement. Then problems of residential building ventilation and possibilities of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating systems including heat recovery are presented. In the next chapter summary of ventilating units with heat recovery and <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating units for residential low energy buildings and pasive family houses is presented. Calculation of low energy house heat losses, which is solved, is based on CSN 06 0210, CSN 73 0540 and CSN EN 12831 standards. Design and calculation of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> heating and ventilation system and ground heat exchangers is also described. Floor heating system, fireplace insert and solar heating system are designed as supplementary systems. At {{the end of this}} thesis the control system is presented. Project documentation is enclosed in appendix...|$|R
5000|$|Cold fronts {{form when}} a cooler air mass moves {{into an area}} of <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> {{in the wake of}} a {{developing}} extratropical cyclone. The <b>warmer</b> <b>air</b> interacts with the cooler air mass along the boundary, and usually produces precipitation. Cold fronts often follow a warm front or squall line. Very commonly, cold fronts have a warm front ahead but with a perpendicular orientation. In areas where cold fronts catch up to the warm front, the occluded front develops. Occluded fronts have an area of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> aloft. When such a feature forms poleward of an extratropical cyclone, it is known as a trowal, which is short for TRough Of <b>Warm</b> <b>Air</b> aLoft. [...] A cold front is considered a warm front if it begins to retreat ahead of the next extratropical cyclone along the frontal boundary, and called a stationary front if it stalls.|$|R

50|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. When this occurs, the <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> is separated (occluded) from the cyclone center at the Earth's surface. The point where the warm front and the {{occluded front}} meet (and consequently the nearest location of <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> {{to the center of the}} cyclone) is called the triple point.|$|R
2500|$|If a {{component}} of the geostrophic wind is parallel to the temperature gradient, the thermal wind will cause the geostrophic wind to rotate with height. If geostrophic wind blows from cold <b>air</b> to <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> (cold advection) the geostrophic wind will turn counterclockwise with height (for the northern hemisphere), a phenomenon known as wind backing. Otherwise, if geostrophic wind blows from <b>warm</b> <b>air</b> to cold <b>air</b> (<b>warm</b> advection) the wind will turn clockwise with height, also known as wind veering.|$|R
50|$|The {{radiators}} {{are designed}} to heat {{the air in the}} room using convection to transfer heat from the radiators to the surrounding air. They do this by drawing cool air in at the bottom, <b>warming</b> the <b>air</b> as it passes over the radiator fins, and discharging the heated air at the top. This sets up convective loops of air movement within a room. If the register is blocked either from above or below, this air movement is prevented, and the heater will not work. Baseboard heating systems are sometimes fitted with moveable covers to allow the resident to fine-tune heating by room, much like <b>air</b> <b>registers</b> in a central air system.|$|R
