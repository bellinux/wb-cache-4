5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction after Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright) goes missing and her son Jeffrey (Chris Owens) angrily attempts to push his <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the FBI. The Syndicate, meanwhile, quicken their tests for the black oil vaccine, sacrificing their own to do so.|$|E
5|$|Later, as a rebel alien race {{secretly}} attacks {{several groups}} of former alien abductees, the agents meet Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), {{a woman who}} {{claims to be a}} multiple abductee and wants to deliver a positive message about aliens. Eventually, Mulder has Scully put under hypnosis to learn the truth about her abduction after Cassandra goes missing and her son, Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens), angrily attempts to push his <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the FBI. The Syndicate, meanwhile, quicken their tests for the black oil vaccine, sacrificing their own to do so. Later, the assassination of a chess grandmaster leads Mulder and Scully into an investigation that they soon discover strikes {{at the heart of the}} X-Files; they learn that the real target was a telepathic boy named Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka).|$|E
5|$|The recipes {{were often}} brief {{and did not}} give precise quantities. Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as {{the time it took}} to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, working their <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the MÃ©nagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E

25|$|James Lyons {{was born}} in Manhattan's old Ninth Ward. His {{father was in the}} Produce {{business}} and the family decided to move to the Bronx when Lyons was 3.

When he graduated from Public School 11 at age 13, he went to go work as an office boy in the office of the Surpass Leather Company. He would later regret not staying in school and graduating from High School. He eventually moved his <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the ranks of the company and became a Salesman.

500|$|From June to August of 1880, Mahler {{took his}} first {{professional}} conducting job, in a small wooden theatre in the spa town of Bad Hall, south of Linz.

Here, Mahler conducted his first full-scale opera, Verdi's Il trovatore, one of 10 operas and a number of operattas that he presented during his time in Laibach. After completing this engagement, Mahler returned to Vienna and worked part-time as chorus-master at the Vienna Carltheater.|$|E

500|$|The Elba {{group of}} mines was between 1 and 1.5 {{miles west of}} McKinley, and was usually classed with the McKinley {{district}} mines, which included the the Elba and Corsica mines, and the La Belle mine, operated by the Pitt Iron Mining Company. The Minnesota Iron Company operated the Elba mine from 1898 to 1900 {{under the direction of}} M. E. McCarthy. Immediately after the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, Pickands Mather and Company leased the Elba and Corsica mines, operating both after that date. Owners James Pickands, Samuel Mather and Jay Morse had been interested in the Corsica iron-ore properties for some time, and the mines remained on the firm's shipping roll for many years. William Philip Chinn was appointed superintendent of the Elba and adjacent Corsica mine under the new management of Pickands Mather and Company, succeeding McCarthy. Chinn was then on his <b>way</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> mining circles, becoming general manager of all Pickands Mather mining properties in the Lake Superior region in 1918. He was succeeded as superintendent of the Elba and Corsica mines by L. C. David. The Oliver Iron Mining Company also owned what they designated the [...] "Elba No. 1 and No. 2 Reserve" [...] ore bodies, but these were entirely different from the Elba and Corsica mines and remained undeveloped.|$|E
