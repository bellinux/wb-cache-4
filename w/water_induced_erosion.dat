50|$|Glacial erosion {{proceeds}} by abrasion as ice and entrained debris {{moves across}} the underlying bedrock, by <b>water</b> <b>induced</b> <b>erosion</b> and transport of sediment, and by freeze-thaw cycles which weather the bedrock. All processes are most effective {{at the bottom of}} glacial ice - hence the glacier erodes at the bottom. The presence of ice in the gap reduces {{the rate at which the}} side walls weather, yielding steep side walls. When the course of glacial ice flow is constrained by surrounding topography, the narrowest regions of flow will abrade most rapidly and cut most deeply, even to depths over 1000 meters below sea level. The resulting profile, when observed through the ice with radar or when evident after the ice had melted, is referred to as overdeepened. Although research remains in fully understanding the processes involved, significant progress has been evident in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This section details major elements in the emerging understanding of the processes which produce overdeepening.|$|E

However, our understanding of this phenomenon at field scale is still limited. This study aimed, therefore, at assessing the spatial variability in crop response under contour hedgerow systems. Data were collected from an erosion control experiment in the Loei province of Northeast Thailand established in 2003. The trial was set up on a clayey, kaolinitic, typic Haplustalf in a split plot design with five maize cropping systems as main plots and two fertiliser levels (no fertiliser and 60 and 14 kg ha- 1 of N and P, repectively) as sub-plots. Slope gradients ranged from 21 - 28 %. From these treatments, the control without hedgerows, grass hedgerows, and leucaena hedgerows, each at both fertiliser levels, were selected to conduct this study. Maize grain yields and aboveground vegetative biomass were determined per row and related to their transect position in each plot. A simple index was used to assess the effect of contour hedgerows on crop response, indicating that contour hedgerow systems cannot always be evaluated a...|$|E

Intensive land {{management}} such as removing vegetation (e.g. final cuttings) exposes terrains to <b>water</b> and wind <b>induced</b> <b>erosion.</b> Particularly erosion is a critical ecological problem in areas with steep slopes. Erosion risks are much dependent on site specific factors; however, current methods for assessing such risk are somewhat limited (Pawelzik et al. 2013). In Finland, operations such as ditching of peatland and maintenance of ditches as well as preparation of soil for reforestation can cause erosion, which could be prevented by water protection methods (Haahti et al. 2014). In general, soil erosion is not regarded as a significant problem in Finnish forests.|$|R

Inter alia, water tends to bring fines from the soil/rock matrix leaking into the tunnel, which will cause erosion in the surrounding geo-materials. Depending on the geological structure and geotechnical properties of the geo-materials surrounding the tunnel, the erosion may {{take the form of}} voids or suffosion which will weaken the stiffness of geo-materials around the tunnel lining. Consequently it will affect the stress distributions on the tunnel lining. In this paper, the geo-material erosion mechanisms were reviewed, and the stress redistributions affected by the erosion in the tunnel lining was analyzed. For this purpose, finite element modeling techniques was used for the analysis of additional stresses and bending moment on the lining as results of the erosion effects. The analytical results from finite element modeling showed that the <b>water</b> leaking <b>induced</b> <b>erosion</b> will have significant effects on the stress distribution and bending movement in the tunnel lining and hence impact on the stability of the tunnel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Large part of slope sediments (pediment) {{which are}} the effect of <b>water</b> <b>induced</b> soil <b>erosion</b> in the loess areas of Polish Uplands, has a close {{relationship}} with pre-historical, historical and “pre-sent ” agricultural activity. The sediments accumulated in different periods are often separated by fos-sil soils. These soils are correlated with the periods of relinquishment of agricultural land use in a given area. A precise dating of the cycles of fossil soil formation is practically impossible. There-fore it is important to gain a possibility to establish the age of sediments between old fossil soils cor-responding with the phases of soil erosion. The organic material in the floor or roof of deposits per-mitting a 14 C dating is very seldom. This is why attempts were made to use the OSL method to date mineral parts of slope sediments. In connection with pedological and sedimentological methods, the OSL method makes it possible to give some information about the age of pre-historical and historical phases of intensive soil erosion. In order to date sediments accumulated during the last 50 years, the method based on measurement of 137 Cs isotope in products of soil erosion is used. This paper shows some examples of the application of 14 C, OSL and 137 Cs methods in some selected research sites. In each case there is a discussion of limitations of the methods used...|$|R

This paper provides an overview of advances made in Queensland, Australia, to mitigate the erosion problems of railway formation batters. Our research effort has been focused on strategies to aid quick establishment of grasses on the batters. The strategies include defining the topsoil quality of the batters, modification of batter topsoils to provide a conducive growth medium for the grasses, and seed treatment including pre-germination to accelerate the germination process. Provision of a cheap mulch to protect grass seeds/ seedlings and ameliorants from washout by high intensity and short duration rainfall events is another strategy. Development of a cost-effective drip irrigation system that sources water from either an existing pressurised water main or a temporary excavated pond/ dam (with solar pump) to supplement the unpredictable natural rainfall ia a major strategy. It has been established that the target of 60 % grass cover reduces erosion by over 90 % compared with the bare scenario. The plot-scale verification work and experiences have already been successfully incorporated into large scale railway projects such as the 110 km Bauhinia Regional Railway Project spur line construction...|$|E
40|$|Biological Soil Crusts (BSCs), {{composed}} of lichens, mosses, green algae, microfungi and cyanobacteria are an ecological {{important part of}} the perennial landcover of many arid and semiarid regions (Belnap et al. 2001 a), (Büdel 2002). In many arid and hyperarid areas BSCs form the only perennial "vegetation cover" largely due to their extensive resistance to drought (Lange et al. 1975). For the Central Namib Desert (Namibia), BSCs consisting of extraordinary vast lichen communities were recently mapped and classified into six morphological classes for a coastal area of 350 km x 60 km. Embedded into the project "BIOTA" (www. biota-africa. org) financed by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research the study was undertaken in the framework of the PhD thesis by Christoph Schultz. Some of these lichen communities grouped together in so called "lichen fields" have already been studied concerning their ecology and diversity in the past (Lange et al. 1994), (Loris & Schieferstein 1992), (Loris et al. 2004), (Ullmann & Büdel 2001 a), (Wessels 1989). Multispectral LANDSAT 7 ETM+ and LANDSAT 5 TM satellite imagery was utilized for an unitemporal supervised classification {{as well as for the}} establishment of a monitoring based on a combined retrospective supervised classification and change detection approach (Bock 2003), (Weiers et al. 2003). Results comprise the analysis of the mapped distribution of lichen communities for the Central Namib Desert as of 2003 as well as reconstructed distributions for the years 2000, 1999, 1992 and 1991 derived from retrospective supervised classification. This allows a first monitoring of the disturbance, destruction and recovery of the lichen communities in these arid environments including the analysis of the major abiotic processes involved. Further analysis of these abiotic processes is key for understanding the influence of Namib lichen communities on overall aeolian and <b>water</b> <b>induced</b> <b>erosion</b> rates, nutrient cycles, water balance and pedogenic processes (Belnap & Gillette 1998), (Belnap et al. 2001 b), (Belnap 2001 c), (Evans & Lange 2001), (McKenna Neumann & Maxwell 1999). In order to aid the understanding of these processes SRTM digital elevation model data as well as climate data sets were used as reference. Good correlation between geomorphological form elements as well as hydrological drainage system and the disturbance patterns derived from individual post classification change comparisons between the timeframes could be observed. Conjoined with the climate data sets sporadic foehn-like windstorms as well as extraordinary precipitation events were identified to largely affect the distribution patterns of lichen communities. Therefore the analysis and monitoring of the diversity, distribution and spatiotemporal change of Central Namib BSCs with the means of Remote Sensing and GIS applications proof to be important tools to create further understanding of desertification and degradation processes in these arid regions.

High molecular weight and highly crystalline as-polymerized poly(L-lactide) was obtained in high yields through melt polymerization. Poly(L-lactide) fiber with a draw ratio of 5. 6 {{was obtained by}} hot-drawing solution-spun fiber. During the bulk degradation of as-polymerized poly(L-lactide), a rapid decrease of molecular weight and tensile properties was observed.

The lamellar crystallites in as-polymerized poly(L-lactide) appeared to be very stable towards hydrolysis.

The extent of land degradation depends largely on the severity of erosion, which modifies the soil’s physical and chemical properties. A detailed understanding of eroded soil properties is essential for assessment of future land management and soil-water conservation. The aim {{of this research is}} to evaluate the changes in physico-chemical and mineralogical properties of ultisols associated with gully erosion in East Tennessee. The study area is located in the southern Appalachian Valley and Ridge province, where a thick sequence of red colored clay rich soil (soil series is the Collegedale-Etowah complex) is found on dolomite and limestone bedrock. Four one-meter long soil cores and fifty-two bulk samples were collected from sites of active gully erosion (two cores) and from adjacent non-gullied soil (two cores). The physico-chemical properties assessed for each sample included clay mineralogy using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) methods, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus, particle size distribution (PSD), Atterburg limits, bulk density, moisture content, porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), soil erodibility factor, and swelling potential. According to the USDA, soil texture was classified as silty clay loam and silty clay. Significant differences (p< 0. 05) existed between eroding and non-eroding soils for the following factors: clay and silt content; porosity Ks, K; Atterberg limits, and swelling potential. Statistically significant correlations were established between clay content and Atterberg limits, bulk density, Ks, and swelling potential. Furthermore, results of X-ray diffraction indicated the presence of quartz, chlorite, illite, kaolinite, kaolinite - smectite expansive clay, hematite and ferrihydrite. Relic crystals of calcite were found in the saprolite horizon. Overall result indicated that selected physico-chemical properties can be used as an indicator of gully erosion in southern Appalachian Ultisols. </p...|$|R

These sediment mass movements also have the potential to significantly impact on a broad network of ecosystems health, functionality and the services they provide. To support the integrated assessment of these processes it is necessary to develop reliable modelling architectures. This paper proposes a semi-quantitative integrated methodology for a robust assessment of soil erosion rates in data poor regions affected by landslide activity. It combines heuristic, empirical and probabilistic approaches. This proposed methodology is based on the geospatial semantic array programming paradigm and has been implemented on a catchment scale methodology using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial analysis tools and GNU Octave. The integrated data-transformation model relies on a modular architecture, where the information flow among modules is constrained by semantic checks. In order to improve computational reproducibility, the geospatial data transformations implemented in ESRI ArcGis are made available in the free software GRASS GIS. The proposed modelling architecture is flexible enough for future transdisciplinary scenario analysis to be more easily designed. In particular, the architecture might contribute as a novel component to simplify future integrated analyses of the potential impact of wildfires or vegetation types and distributions, on sediment transport from <b>water</b> <b>induced</b> landslides and <b>erosion.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, published in IEEE Earthzine 2014 Vol. 7 Issue 2, 910137 + 2 nd quarter theme.

40|$|Soil erosion is {{a global}} problem because of its {{environmental}} consequences, including sedimentation and pollution {{in many areas of}} the world. An estimated 400 million hectares of land have been abandoned due to soil erosion over the past 50 years. The main biophysical factor influencing the quantity of overland flow is the infiltration rate. Infiltration during a runoff-generating rainfall event is regulated by the hydraulic properties of the Critical Zone and the antecedent soil moisture conditions. The process of <b>water</b> <b>induced</b> soil <b>erosion</b> is described by the detachment of individual soil particles and their transport by overland flow. Detachment of soil particles is mainly caused by rain splash and the erosive force of overland flow. The major control of the quantity of overland flow is the infiltration rate. Most rainwater falls, directly or indirectly through stem flow or leaf drainage, on the soil. A small part remains on the leaves (interception) and eventually evaporates. The water that reaches the soil surface will be stored in micro-depressions, infiltrates in the soil profile or will move downhill as overland flow. The amount of infiltration and the infiltration rate depend on the characteristics of the soil. Physical processes in the soil occurring at cm 3 and m 3 scale near the surface are important controls of the flow of water and can also affect the hydrology at a catchment scale (e. g., the response time). With prolonged rainfall, infiltrating wetting fronts in water repellent soils may become unstable, leading to the formation of high velocity flow paths, the so-called fingers. Finger formation is generally regarded as a potential cause of the rapid transport of water and contaminants through the Critical Zone. A specific situation is the cold-climate hydrology. Frozen soil, freezing-thawing cycles and snowfall/melt are dominated processes influencing the water flow through the Critical Zone and at catchment scale. Infiltration during snowmelt often occurs as focused recharge in local depressions on the surface. This may cause higher velocities (the fingers) through the unsaturated zone than during evenly distributed infiltration on the surface, hence causing less than optimal conditions for degradation of pollutants. The redistribution of melt water can also cause extreme runoff in areas where there is normally high infiltration capacity. Hence it is important to take the dynamics of infiltration capacity into account in estimates of produced runoff and soil loss from catchment areas to predict flooding-event time and size and sedimentation in downstream areas. This presentation shows results of studies on preferential flow-paths (fingers) and the effects on water quantity and quality and soil erosion on catchment scale with emphasize on the cold-climate region...|$|R

The model was applied for the period between 1950 and 2007 covering 30 years of conventional tillage (1950 - 1979) followed by 28 years of conservation tillage (1980 - 2007). In general, modelled and measured SOC stocks are in good agreement for three observed soil layers. The overall balance (1950 - 2007) of <b>erosion</b> <b>induced</b> lateral and vertical C fluxes results in a C loss of - 4 · 4 gCm - 2 a - 1 at our test site.

Overall, the application of the soil conservation practices, with enhanced C inputs by cover crops and decreased erosion, significantly reduced the modelled <b>erosion</b> <b>induced</b> C loss of the test site. Increasing C inputs alone, without a reduction of erosion rates, did not result in a reduction of <b>erosion</b> <b>induced</b> C losses.

One hypothesis claim that the early uplift of the Scandinavian Mountains could be indebted to changes in the density of the lithosphere and asthenosphere caused by the Iceland plume when Greenland and Scandinavia rifted apart about 53 million years ago.|$|R
40|$|Aceclofenac is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug used {{to relieve}} inflammation and associated pain {{in various forms}} of arthritis and has become popular due to its stimulatory effects on cartilage matrix synthesis {{even though it is}} known to <b>induce</b> <b>erosion</b> and ulcers in the gastro-intestinal tract. In the present work we synthesized a mutual prodrug of aceclofenac by exploring D-phenylalanine as a gastro-protective carrier system to lower the ulcerogenic potential and enhance effectiveness of aceclofenac as anti-arthritic agent. The study showed that D-phenylalanine enhanced the overall pharmacological and ulcerogenic profile of aceclofenac thus proving its utility as an effective gastro-sparing chemical delivery system in mutual prodrug design.
