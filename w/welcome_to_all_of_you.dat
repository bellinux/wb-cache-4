Learoyd raises a subscription from the troops to have it cancelled, which is spent on suborning a ekka driver to take Trigg to Padsahi jhil, a large swampy tract of flooded land, about two miles off.

40|$|This study {{argues that}} the growing {{autonomy}} of international commercial arbitration constitutes the leitmotiv <b>of</b> virtually <b>all</b> recent legislative and doctrinal developments in this field. On {{the basis of an}} interest-analysis, the book first establishes the legitimacy of this trend. It then examines the various levels and dimensions of the increasing autonomy of international commercial arbitration. In this context, particular emphasis is laid on the doctrine of lex mercatoria, the internationalization of court review of arbitral awards, and the decreasing significance of the concept of the arbitral seat. First published in 1987, Professor O'Sullivan's work provides an in depth philosophical examination of the foundations of method in Economics and other human sciences. The argument is unabashedly dialectical in the great Socratic-Platonic tradition, and the reissue will be very <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>all</b> students <b>of</b> methodology, in particular those students of economic methodology seeking a refreshing alternative to yet more mathematical game playing. In an age dominated and perhaps to an extent perplexed by an ultimately non-committal postmodernism the book provides a root and branch critique of the epistemological relativism which must lie {{at the root of the}} whole post-modernist approach; and in reasserting the fundamental importance not only for the methods of science but also for European civilisation of the pursuit of truth it takes a stance which is very much against the tide of the times. A heterodox perspective is also provided and defended in detail regarding the real nature of economic methodology whereby it is shown that Economics epitomises a teleological mode of explanation which is significantly different from the efficient causal modes of explanation of the natural sciences. In fact Economics is the ultimate subjectivist/interpretative discipline in the methodological sense of Max Weber and Alfred Schutz, a fact which has only been recognised (and welcomed) in the Austrian school of Economics.

The constantly growing number of participants who come from more than 27 countries shows that the meeting is well-received throughout the globe (Fig. 1). The conference provides an important opportunity to share and exchange knowledge in {{a vast number of}} fields in the area of cachexia and body wasting in many different illnesses.

Given the presence of several eminent academics and policymakers, I am sure {{that it will be}} a very fruitful event. Although the topic of globalisation has received considerable attention in many circles, it remains a phenomenon that we are still striving to understand. Not only can globalisation not be captured in a single measure or index, but its economic impacts are also difficult to isolate given the complexities in disentangling globalisation from other important structural changes that have occurred in parallel in recent years. Not least because of this, disagreements have persisted on both the characterisation of globalisation and its key macroeconomic implications. Against this background, the conference is a valuable opportunity to contribute towards sharpening our understanding of the mechanics of globalisation, on the one hand, and its macroeconomic consequences, on the other. To set the scene for the conference, I would like <b>to</b> structure this <b>welcome</b> address in three parts. First, I will define what I see as the salient features of globalisation. Second, I will outline what, to my mind, constitute the key macroeconomic impacts of globalisation in advanced economies...|$|R

40|$|The 4 "t"h International Seminar on Radioactive Waste Products was {{organised}} by the Forschungszentrum Juelich in co-operation {{with the}} Bundesamt fuer Strahlenschutz and the European Commission. On {{behalf of the}} Bundesamt, I would like <b>to</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>all</b> participants <b>of</b> this scientific-technical meeting. I very much appreciate the participation not only of numerous German scientists, engineers and technicians as well as governmental and industrial representatives, but would particularly express my gratitude for the participation of many colleagues from abroad. Radioactive waste management and disposal is a worldwide issue and international co-operation to support national programmes is therefore much appreciated. The international organisations provide, among other things, guidance to member countries on safe, economic and environmentally acceptable solutions for radioactive waste disposal. On a national basis respective programmes are developed, modified or successfully realized. Nevertheless, the challenge of radioactive waste management and disposal {{is no longer a}} scientific and technical exclusivity. The importance of ethical and social aspects, the dialogue with the public and transparency in decision-making processes increase more and more. Thus, when addressing safety-related key questions one needs to be as open as possible on scientific-technical aspects and to consider the involvement of the public requiring a clear, open-minded and transparent communication.
