One of the challenges that I posed to the production team was ... if we decided to play something different, if we decided to extend a part, whatever we decide to do, I want the artwork to change with the performance. So it needs to be malleable ... It's as much a piece of art as the music is, so <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compelling and fit with the overall kind of aesthetic of what the band is up to right at this moment." ...|$|E
500|$|The title {{sequence}} of SpongeBob {{for the special}} was made exclusively for the series' tenth anniversary. It was animated in stop motion animation, with Cee Lo Green performing the theme. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh and Chris Finnegan of Screen Novelties animated its opening titles. Finnegan claimed that the crew were [...] "thrill" [...] to do the title sequence because [...] "the original title sequence is so recognizable and everyone seen {{it over and over}} and it's so great in its own way." [...] Executive producer and the episode's writer Paul Tibbitt said [...] "We don't just want to redraw it , <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> something special and different So we thought we would do it in three dimensions" [...] Nickelodeon animation president Brown Johnson lauded the new title sequence and said it is [...] "SO great!" [...] Some traditional animation on scraps of brown paper are intermixed into the stop motion.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready. He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics, since the ideas come faster to him, but Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle." [...] For recording [...] "Miles Away", Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked [...] "How do we want to do this? What do <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about? What do we want to say?" [...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our stuff out there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E

It was the longest we’d spent on anything ever we’ve done. We knew how <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> sound and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get <b>it</b> perfect, so yeah, we {{spent a long time}} on it.

500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} the sequel will be shot in real time, Reeves stated, [...] "You see, that's a {{difficult}} part: <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shot like the first {{but how can you}} continue that idea successfully for a second time?... We have a lot of affection for the original and the sequel can't just be the same thing. But that is tricky when {{you need to have a}} monster destroying stuff once again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Raikes, ex-president of the Microsoft Business Division, stated: [...] "If they're {{going to}} pirate {{somebody}}, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> us rather than somebody else". An analogous argument {{was made in}} an early paper by Kathleen Conner and Richard Rummelt. A subsequent study of digital rights management for e-books by Gal Oestreicher-Singer and Arun Sundararajan showed that relaxing some forms of DRM can be beneficial to digital rights holders because the losses from piracy are outweighed by the increases in value to legal buyers.|$|E

2500|$|Bruce Gyngell, {{the former}} {{chairman}} of breakfast station TV-am, [...] became YTT's managing director on 15 May 1995. On 16 March 1996, the presentation department in Newcastle was closed, and continuity was centralised in Leeds. (Transmission for the station had already been handled by Yorkshire since 1993). To halting [...] "a slide in viewing figures and reflecting confidence in the region", in September that year, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc rebranded its stations as Channel 3. The Broadcasting Act 1990 had made Channel 3 the 'official' name for ITV, and [...] "3" [...] was the preset used by most television sets and videocassette recorders (VCRs) for ITV. However, the attempt in 1989 to create a generic identity across the ITV network [...] was decommissioned within three years. Promoting the new brand, Gygnell said, [...] "Everyone refers to this region as 'the North-East' and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known that we are part of this great region and moving with it." [...] Tyne Tees acquired the brand [...] "Channel 3 North East", with 'Tyne Tees Television' still being retained as the company name.|$|E

My old friends meet with me and whenever I visit the States I'm still invited to speak to some Jewish groups about the problems with Israel. Privately many of them agree that Israel isn't everything <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be.

It's world-renowned. We thought it was an ideal choice. We filmed both nights but we ended up using the second night only for this DVD. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be as live and as real as possible, and when you start taking from different shows there isn't continuity. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be one show and that's exactly what it is." ...|$|R

60|$|When one is {{discussing}} this possible formation of cults and brotherhoods, {{it may be}} well to consider {{a few of the}} conditions that rule such human re-groupings. We live in {{the world as it is}} and not in the world as <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> that is the practical rule by which we steer, and in directing our lives we must constantly consider the forces and practicabilities of the social medium in which we move.|$|E
60|$|And {{first in}} this present time he must {{see to it}} that he does live, that is to say he must get food, clothing, covering, and {{adequate}} leisure for the finer aspects of living. Socialism plans an organized civilization in which these things will be a collective solicitude, and the gaining of a subsistence an easy preliminary to the fine drama of existence, but in the world as we have it we are forced to engage much of our energy in scrambling for these preliminary necessities. Our problems of conduct lie in {{the world as it is}} and not in the world as <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> First then a man must get a living, a fair civilized living for himself. It is a fundamental duty. It must be a fair living, not pinched nor mean nor strained. A man can do nothing higher, he can be no service to any cause, until he himself is fed and clothed and equipped and free. He must earn this living or equip himself to earn it in some way not socially disadvantageous, he must contrive as far as possible that the work he does shall be constructive and contributory to the general well-being.|$|E

60|$|In {{these days}} we {{are accused of}} attacking science because <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> scientific. Surely there is not any undue disrespect to our doctor in saying that he is our doctor, not our priest, or our wife, or ourself. It is not the {{business}} of the doctor to say that we must go to a watering-place; it is his affair to say that certain results of health will follow if we do go to a watering-place. After that, obviously, it is for us to judge. Physical science is like simple addition: it is either infallible or it is false. To mix science up with philosophy is only to produce a philosophy that has lost all its ideal value and a science that has lost all its practical value. I want my private physician to tell me whether this or that food will kill me. It is for my private philosopher to tell me whether I ought to be killed. I apologise for stating all these truisms. But the truth is, that I have just been reading a thick pamphlet written by a mass of highly intelligent men who seem never to have heard of any of these truisms in their lives.|$|E
60|$|I {{have only}} one word more to say, and it is {{rendered}} necessary by the observations which fell from Lord Lansdowne last night, when, according to the Scottish papers, he informed a gathering at which he was the principal speaker that the House of Lords was not obliged to swallow the Budget whole or without mincing.[18] I ask you to mark that word. It is a characteristic expression. The House of Lords means to assert its right to mince. Now let us for our part be quite frank and plain. We want this Budget Bill to be fairly and fully discussed; we do not grudge the weeks that have been spent already; {{we are prepared to}} make every sacrifice--I speak for my honourable friends who are sitting on this platform--of personal convenience in order to secure a thorough, patient, searching examination of proposals the importance of which we do not seek to conceal. The Government has shown itself ready and willing to meet reasonable argument, not merely by reasonable answer, but when a case is shown, by concessions, and generally in a spirit of goodwill. We have dealt with this subject throughout with a desire to mitigate hardships in special cases, and to gain as large a measure of agreement as possible for the proposals we are placing before the country. We want the Budget not merely to be the work of the Cabinet and of the Chancellor of the Exchequer; <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the shaped and moulded plan deliberately considered by the House of Commons. That will be a long and painful process to those who are forced from day to day to take part in it. We shall not shrink from it. But when that process is over, when the Finance Bill leaves the House of Commons, I think you will agree with me that it ought to leave the House of Commons in its final form. No amendments, no excision, no modifying or mutilating will be agreed to by us. We will stand no mincing, and unless Lord Lansdowne and his landlordly friends choose to eat their own mince, Parliament will be dissolved, and we shall come to you in a moment of high consequence for every cause for which Liberalism has ever fought. See that you do not fail us in that hour.|$|E
