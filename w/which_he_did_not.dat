5|$|A {{native of}} Chiprovtsi {{and one of}} Bulgaria's most educated people of the 17th century, Parchevich was among {{the leaders of the}} Bulgarian Roman Catholics. His {{numerous}} diplomatic visits to the royal courts of Europe were mostly in an attempt to garner support for an anti-Ottoman uprising in Bulgaria, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> live to witness. Nevertheless, his efforts in defending Christianity earned him a noble title from the Austrian emperors, and he took up several important positions within the Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the war, McClellan and his family went to Europe (not returning until 1868), during <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> participate in politics. When he returned, the Democratic Party expressed some interest in nominating him for president again, but {{when it became clear that}} Ulysses S. Grant would be the Republican candidate, this interest died. McClellan worked on engineering projects in New York City and was offered the position of president of the newly formed University of California.|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{conducted}} the RPO {{in his last}} concert, given at Portsmouth Guildhall on 7 May 1960.

He played for Exeter in the 2007 Conference National play-off Final on 20 May 2007, the first Conference play-off final to be played at the newly rebuilt Wembley Stadium.

5|$|Edward {{was kept}} under the strict tutorship of Hansell until almost {{thirteen}} years old. Private tutors taught him German and French. Edward took the examination to enter Osborne Naval College, and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but the prince's father had disagreed. Following {{two years at}} Osborne College, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> enjoy, Edward {{moved on to the}} Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. A course of two years, followed by entry into the Royal Navy, was planned. A bout of mumps may have made him infertile.|$|E
5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast {{areas where}} the seabed was being {{elevated}} were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge {{areas where the}} ocean floor was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate tectonics, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> anticipate.|$|E

The war drama biopic American Sniper (2014) set box office records for the largest January release ever and was also the largest opening ever for an Eastwood film.|$|E

5|$|Kane's {{talent was}} {{identified}} whilst skiing at Smiggin Holes, New South Wales, {{and he was}} invited to join the Australian Winter Paralympic Development team when he was 11. At the age of 19, Kane was the youngest member of the Australian team at 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino. Classified as LW2, he won a bronze medal in the men's super G. He also competed in the downhill, coming 9th; slalom, coming 16th; and the giant slalom, in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> finish.|$|E
5|$|Keynes was {{ultimately}} a successful investor, {{building up a}} private fortune. His assets were nearly wiped out following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> foresee, but he soon recouped. At Keynes's death, in 1946, his net worth stood just short of £500,000 – equivalent to about £11 million ($16.5 million) in 2009. The sum had been amassed despite lavish support for various good causes and his personal ethic which made him reluctant to sell on a falling market, in cases where he saw such behaviour as likely to deepen a slump.|$|E
5|$|Ryder {{had hoped}} to be a fashion designer, {{undertaking}} a course at Central Saint Martins <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> complete; from there he worked in retail, first for Prowler and then for the designer Vivienne Westwood. Subsequently, appearing in gay pornography as a twink bottom for production companies like Eurocreme and UK Naked Men, he starred in such films as Drunk on Spunk and Stretch that Hole, winning numerous awards for his work. By the time he made Uncle David, he was also running his own weekly gay wrestling night in London.|$|E

5|$|Although Marshall had {{recommended}} that MacArthur appoint as many Australian and Dutch officers to senior positions as possible, {{most of his}} staff {{was made up of}} US Army officers who had served under him in the Philippines. The rest, including Whitlock, Fitch and Chamberlain, had been on the staff of USAFIA. MacArthur reported to Marshall that there were no qualified Dutch officers in Australia, and that the Australian Army had a critical shortage of staff officers, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> wish to exacerbate. Nevertheless, several Dutch and Australian army officers, as well as some American naval officers, served in junior positions on the staff.|$|E

5|$|Establishing {{an early}} {{reputation}} {{playing for the}} Shannon Club in Trinidad, St Hill was selected for Trinidad in 1912 and played in every Inter-Colonial Tournament until 1930. Although he missed selection for the 1923 tour of England, he played for representative West Indian sides in 1926 against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and scored a century against the tourists for Trinidad. Success in trial matches led to his selection for the 1928 tour of England where he failed badly. In 1930, he hit another century for Trinidad against MCC and was chosen for one final Test, after <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> play any further first-class cricket.|$|E
5|$|Hamels was {{selected}} the Phillies starter for Game 1 of the World Series; the Phillies won 3–2, and Hamels earned his fourth win of the postseason. Hamels also started Game 5, which was suspended due to rain after {{the top of}} the sixth inning tied at 2-2, and receiving a no-decision; when Game 5 resumed the Phillies won 4-3 to clinch the World Series. Overall, Hamels made five postseason starts in 2008, going 4–0 with a 1.80 ERA. Hamels threw a total of 35 innings during the postseason, and held opponents scoreless in 28 of them; he never allowed more than one run in any of the seven innings in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> hold opponents scoreless. Hamels was named the 2008 World Series MVP.|$|E
