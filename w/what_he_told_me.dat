2500|$|Jill Lawler: “I felt so disgusting, but I {{just did}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to do, which was basically, like, {{manually}} jerk him off. [...] I hated doing it. [...] But I felt like I owed him, you know? I felt like I owed him for, like, my life.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Dallas Deputy Sheriff Al Maddox claimed: [...] "Ruby told me, he said, 'Well, they {{injected}} {{me for a}} cold.' He said it was cancer cells. That's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> Ruby did. I {{said you}} don't believe that bullshit. He said, 'I damn sure do!' [...] one day when I started to leave, Ruby shook hands with me and I could feel {{a piece of paper}} in his palm… [...] {{he said it was a}} conspiracy and he said … if you will keep your eyes open and your mouth shut, you're gonna learn a lot. And that was the last letter I ever got from him." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{amazed me}} beyond {{anything}} that I had ever heard, even from himself, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> he illustrated, flinging {{himself into the}} poises taught by Marozzo that I might appreciate the marvellous science of the thing.|$|E
60|$|Still I {{could not}} take him seriously. I did not for a moment believe <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> But <b>he</b> was in very real distress.|$|R
60|$|I {{never had}} any reason to doubt the exact truth of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thus <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard.|$|R
60|$|I {{ought to}} have remembered this, after <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had already <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> My {{intelligence}} brightened a little as I went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "'But, Mr. Twitty,' said she, 'I {{really thought}} that Cap'n Budlong--and from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about his house and his things--' ...|$|E
6000|$|Some {{time later}} Blake said to Millicent, [...] "You heard <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> dear? The secret {{must still be}} kept; I can't speak." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A journalist, an {{old friend}} of mine. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> though, I looked upon as simply a little more malice from my friend Carraby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't {{know exactly}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> says. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> would {{introduce}} me to you, {{and that you}} would, he was sure, do your best to put me through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not believe}} that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> is true. Some of it cannot, I think, be true. Much of it is not so,--unless I am more deceived in you than I ever was in any man. At any rate sit down." [...] Then the {{schoolmaster}} did sit down. [...] "He has made you out to be a perjured, wilful, cruel bigamist." ...|$|R
60|$|There is {{something}} excessively provoking--at least to me--in {{being told to}} my face that I have said something which is not worthy of belief. It {{was not a very}} becoming act on my part (after <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in his letter about his brother's infatuation) to mention his brother. I ought not to have done it. I did it, for all that.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{inspector}} thinks by {{this time}} that I lied to him, and---- By gracious, why can't I follow those fellows? That's jest <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to do!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I met Jackson yesterday, {{and after}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of his {{interview}} with you, I thought I'd better run up and see you at once," [...] he explained.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{reporter}} {{came and}} beset us," [...] said Anna, in a displeased voice. [...] "I {{did not hear}} all that passed, but of course Adrian told him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> only those people make things sound ridiculous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} going to say pretty girl," [...] said Miss Cringle, with calm self-abnegation, [...] "don’t mind me, say it. The captain knows <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> about. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> you were a milksop; he said you were a good young man and a teetotaller." ...|$|R
60|$|In <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{said there}} seemed so much sincerity of repentance, that it painfully {{affected}} me. I could not but reflect that I, too, had shortened {{the life of}} a good, tender father by my bad conduct and obstinate self-will. I was, indeed, so surprised with <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> that I thought, instead of my going about to teach and instruct him, the man was made a teacher and instructor to me in a most unexpected manner.|$|R
60|$|I {{thanked him}} for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> and, as {{there was nothing more}} to be learned, dropped the subject which was never {{mentioned}} between us again, at least not for a long while. But in my heart I determined that I would reach that mountain even though to do so I must risk my life. Something seemed to call me to the place; it was as though I were being drawn by a magnet.|$|R
6000|$|... "He told it me. That is why I esteemed him--for {{the calm}} fortitude {{with which he}} bore adversity. Since then, {{considering}} what he has done, I have almost come to doubt if <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of himself was true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> We {{had quite}} a talk on the train. I'll {{tell you about it}} later. And I've got a lot more to tell," [...] Dave went on. [...] "All about a lost gold mine that belongs to Mrs. Morr, Roger's mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> then; but I know that I told him that I was engaged; and I felt when I told him so that my {{engagement}} was a sorrow to me. And {{it has been a}} sorrow from that day to this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lawyer Lightwood, take care, you, what I say; for I judge you'll be {{answerable}} for follering it up!' Then, {{slowly and}} emphatically beating {{it all out}} with his open right hand on {{the palm of his}} left; 'I, Roger Riderhood, Lime'us Hole, Waterside character, tell you, Lawyer Lightwood, that the man Jesse Hexam, commonly called upon the river and along-shore Gaffer, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> done the deed. <b>What's</b> more, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> with his own lips that he done the deed. <b>What's</b> more, <b>he</b> said that he done the deed. And I'll swear it!' ...|$|R
60|$|This {{point of}} {{etiquette}} settled, Kambula bade me repeat <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had already <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> {{that we were}} prisoners whom he was instructed by Dingaan to convey to his Great Place, and that if we {{made no attempt to}} escape we should not be hurt upon the journey.|$|R
5000|$|You {{could tell}} he really {{believed}} that {{but there was something}} wrong about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was saying. Something that didn't jell. And I thought of Lallie's warning to Danny. She had told him not to let the dark flame of the past consume the future."Lallie and the Chain? That's about right winning out over wrong." [...] Danny grinned at me, an engaging urchin's and in spite of being horrified over <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I found myself smiling back. [...] "Yeah well, I'm an idealist."- (page 123) ...|$|R
60|$|I dressed myself quickly, {{and then}} went out with Hannah and the major, {{and walked to the}} barracks. On the way the major related at length to me all the occurrences of the night, and from <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I could nearly guess how it had all come about.|$|E
6000|$|... "Help me out. Mr. Thurston, I {{am sorry}} to say, has met with a bad accident, and you and I have got to finish this work without him," [...] {{he said to the}} anxious foreman. [...] "From <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I can count upon your doing the best that's in you, Tom." ...|$|E
6000|$|We were {{sleeping}} {{that night in}} a double-bedded room. As soon as Mr. Dark had secured the door and disposed himself comfortably in his bed, he entered on a detailed narrative of the particulars communicated {{to him in the}} tap-room. The substance of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> may be related as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. When Ernest and I were engaged, {{he swore}} to me {{positively}} {{on his knees}} {{that he had never}} loved any one before in the whole course of his life. I was very young at the time, so I didn't believe him, I needn't tell you. Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any kind till after I had been actually married four or five months. I found out then that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> was perfectly true. And that sort of thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.|$|R
5000|$|... "From the {{bathroom}} I heard Raine playing something on an acoustic guitar. When I came out I asked him <b>what</b> it was. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that it was}} just something he was toying around with. I really liked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing so for the next day or so the band and I worked on developing what became [...] "Superman's Dead." [...] ~Arnold Lanni ...|$|R
60|$|Now this reprehensible {{youth who}} left me, a little hurt and put back, might for aught he or I knew {{have been one}} of the crew of the Argo--had been {{certainly}} slave or comrade to Thorfin Karlsefne. Therefore he was deeply interested in guinea competitions. Remembering what Grish Chunder had said I laughed aloud. The Lords of Life and Death would never allow Charlie Mears to speak with full knowledge of his pasts, and I must even piece out <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> with my own poor inventions while Charlie wrote of the ways of bank clerks.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{did not say}} so. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of you, {{as far as it}} went, {{is exactly}} {{confirmed}} by what you have said yourself. But I happened to ask him to what class men of your calling usually belonged; and he said that they were laborers, butchers, and so forth. Do you resent that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{you are in}} Mr. Johnstone's confidence, you may remain. He won't mind my saying that, so far as {{strictly}} nautical matters go, he's well {{qualified to}} deal with them, but there are touches about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that seem to show he has had your help. Now you must exactly follow these directions--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Something like this, then, {{my guide}} had to tell, Perched on a saint cracked across when he fell; [...] 10 But since I might chance give his meaning a wrench, He talking his patois and I English-French, I'll put <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> {{preserving}} the tone, In a rhymed prose {{that makes it}} half his, half my own.|$|E
5000|$|Levin {{was born}} in Tel Aviv to Pavel and Lena Levin. Pavel is {{originally}} from Latvia and was a professional soccer player who played in Latvia before signing with Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C. in 1990 and moving to Israel. He retired soon after due to a leg injury, and married Lena, who was from Moscow and moved to Netanya. Levin {{was eight years old}} when he first discovered North American ice hockey, as his father was watching an NHL game on TV. [...] "I asked him <b>what</b> <b>he’s</b> watching. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that’s the best league in the world, so I told him that’s my dream now," [...] Levin told The Jerusalem Post. At home Levin spoke Russian, while in school he used Hebrew; prior to moving to Canada he did not speak any English, and in order to develop this he decided to not attend a Hebrew-language school.|$|R
60|$|I {{found him}} seated outside the hut when I returned, and he greeted {{me as if}} he had been expecting me just at that moment and not before. <b>He</b> guessed just <b>what</b> had happened, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> and had not been alarmed. During the day I found him {{watching}} me, and in the evening, as we sat in his favourite place outside the hut, he turned to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't try {{to thank}} me, my lads, but live {{so that you}} will merit the {{confidence}} I now have in you. The money which I have paid out to buy these goods is but {{a small part of}} what I would have been willing to give to have known that I should find my son alive and well. From <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of you, I believe that you deserve this start in life; and if you continue as honest and kindly-hearted as I think you are, you will repay me for this in almost as great a proportion as you already have done." ...|$|R
