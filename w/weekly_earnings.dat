30|$|Information on <b>weekly</b> wage <b>earnings</b> {{and days}} worked per week is {{available}} for regular and casual workers. In the case of those who perform multiple jobs in the week, we calculate average daily wages by dividing weekly wage income from all sources by total number of days worked. To compute real wages, we use the state-level Consumer Price Index for Agriculture (CPI-AL) and Industrial Workers (CPI-IW). Originally, the CPI-AL was available with base year 1986 – 1987 and CPI-IW with base year 1982. We converted these indices to have a uniform base year 2004 – 2005. CPI-AL is used to deflate wages in rural areas and CPI-IW in urban India. Because these deflators are not available {{for some of the}} small states, we used available information for larger states either adjacent to them or from which they had been split (see Table  5 in Appendix for details on the CPI calculation for the smaller states).|$|R

40|$|Andhra Pradesh {{is one of}} {{the largest}} states of India with more than 60 percent of the {{population}} earning their livelihood in agriculture. The paper studies regional disparities in employment, unemployment and income in Andhra Pradesh. The empirical results are based on unit level data of rural households based on employment and unemployment surveys conducted by National Sample Survey Organisation. The analysis shows that the share of agricultural workers is less in the agriculturally developed Coastal region compared with the less developed Telangana region and drought prone Rayalaseema region. The work participation rate is low and unemployment and wage rates are high in Coastal compared with Telangana and Rayalaseema due to high reservation wage rate, high per capita income and capital intensive agricultural sector in Coastal region. With the development of agriculture, there has been a simultaneous increase in demand for nonagricultural goods and services resulting in increased share of nonagricultural workers in total work force in the Coastal region. The share of self-employed is higher in both Telangana and Rayalaseema regions. <b>Weekly</b> wage <b>earnings</b> are higher for males, higher educated, and upper caste worker...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Qualitative {{research}} on the perceptions of industrial relations stakeholders of the persistence of gender wage inequality during the period 1990 to 2003 is reported. During this period {{the gap between the}} average <b>weekly</b> ordinary time <b>earnings</b> of women and men working full time in Australia decreased by only one and a half percentage points, from 17 percent in 1990, to 15. 5 percent in 2003 and the gap in Western Australia widened by 5 percentage points. Interviewees and the literature indicated that gender wage inequality was greatest within occupations whilst also occurring between occupations. Stakeholders interviewed felt that gender-related social/cultural values pervade the formal system of industrial relations as well as the wider society. These social/cultural values, changing slower than economic and industrial relations factors, result in persistent gender wage inequality as these values affect occupational choice before the market, the availability of jobs and training in the market and thus wages. Stakeholders showed that they believed that their gender-related values affected actions taken to, and decisions made in, industrial tribunals. Remedies for gende...|$|R

The average wage of re-employed displaced workers was 12 percent lower 0 – 1 years after displacement, 11 percent lower 1 – 2 years after and 7 percent lower 2 – 3 years after.
