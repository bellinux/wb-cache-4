25|$|According to Altekar, it is {{the period}} c. 700–1100 CE that sees sati {{becoming}} really widespread in India, in particular in Kashmir. As the centuries wore on, Altekar provides a few statistics on {{the spread of the}} custom. In Rajputana, a later stronghold for sati there are two, possibly three reliably attested cases before 1000 CE. For the period from 1200 to 1600 CE, there are at least 20 such cases. For the Carnatic, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> 11 inscriptions relative to sati from 1000 to 1400 CE; for 1400-1600 CE we have 41.|$|E
25|$|The most {{reliable}} information <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> ancient poets is largely drawn {{from their own}} works. Unfortunately, Apollonius of Rhodes reveals nothing about himself. Most of the biographical material comes from four sources: two are texts entitled Life of Apollonius found in the scholia on his work (Vitae A and B); a third is an entry in the 10th-century encyclopaedia the Suda; and fourthly a 2nd-century BCE papyrus, P.Oxy. 1241, which provides names of several heads of the Library of Alexandria. Other scraps can be gleaned from miscellaneous texts. The reports from all the above sources however are scanty and often self-contradictory.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of Newton's law of gravity has enabled {{the acquisition of}} much of the detailed information <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of quasars; even the existence of dark matter is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit galactic centers, galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in superclusters. The force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.|$|E

25|$|In {{a speech}} at the General Assembly Hall at Flushing Meadow, New York, on Friday, 28 November 1947, Iraq’s Foreign Minister, Fadel Jamall, {{included}} the following statement: Partition imposed against the will {{of the majority of the}} people will jeopardize peace and harmony in the Middle East. Not only the uprising of the Arabs of Palestine is to be expected, but the masses in the Arab world cannot be restrained. The Arab-Jewish relationship in the Arab world will greatly deteriorate. There are more Jews in the Arab world outside of Palestine than there are in Palestine. In Iraq alone, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> one hundred and fifty thousand Jews who share with Moslems and Christians all the advantages of political and economic rights. Harmony prevails among Moslems, Christians and Jews. But any injustice imposed upon the Arabs of Palestine will disturb the harmony among Jews and non-Jews in Iraq; it will breed inter-religious prejudice and hatred.|$|E

Personally we cannot wait to see how long this game of cat-and-mouse goes on with the unknown serial killer and Dexter.

2500|$|Epicharmus of Kos or Epicharmus Comicus or Epicharmus Comicus Syracusanus (...) , {{thought to}} have lived between c. 540 and c. 450 BC, was a Greek dramatist and philosopher often {{credited}} with {{being one of the}} first comic writers, having originated the Doric or Sicilian comedic form. Aristotle (Poetics 5.1449b5) writes that he and Phormis invented comic plots (μῦθοι, muthoi). Most of the information <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> Epicharmus comes from the writings of Athenaeus, Suda and Diogenes Laertius, but fragments and comments come up in a host of other ancient authors as well. [...] There have also been some papyrus finds of longer sections of text, but these are often so full of holes {{that it is difficult to}} make sense of them. Plato mentions Epicharmus in his dialogue Gorgias and in Theaetetus.

Most of the knowledge and information that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> {{the traditions of the}} Taínos came about the personal observations and historical documentations of Fray Bartolomé de las Casas. Fray Bartolomé de las Casas described an [...] "Areyto" [...] in the following manner: [...] "And on this island what I could understand was that their songs which they call 'areytos,' were their history passed from person to person, fathers to sons from the present to the future, as here uniting many Indians... passing three or four hours or more until the teacher or guide of the dance finished the history, and sometimes they went from one day to the next." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 Dr John Jackson of the Turin Shroud Center of Colorado {{proposed}} a new hypothesis – namely {{the possibility of}} more recent enrichment if carbon monoxide were to slowly interact with a fabric so as to deposit its enriched carbon into the fabric, interpenetrating into the fibrils {{that make up the}} cloth. Jackson proposed to test if this were actually possible. Professor Christopher Ramsey, the director of the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, took the theory seriously and agreed to collaborate with Jackson in testing a series of linen samples that could determine if the case for the Shroud's authenticity should be re-opened. He told the BBC that [...] "With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> the Shroud, {{there does seem to be}} a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence." [...] Professor Ramsey stressed that he would be surprised if the results of the 1988 tests were shown to be far out – especially [...] "a thousand years wrong" [...] – but he insisted that he was keeping an open mind.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{indicative}} of Basil's intentions for this church that he endowed it with its own administration and estates, {{on the model of}} the Hagia Sophia. During his and his immediate successors’ reign, the Nea {{played an important role in}} palace ceremonies, and at least until the reign of Constantine VII, the anniversary of its consecration was a major dynastic feast. At some point in the late 11th century it was turned into a monastery, and was known as the [...] "New Monastery" [...] (Νέα Μονή). Emperor Isaac II Angelos stripped it of much of its decoration, its furniture and liturgical vessels, and used them to restore the church of St Michael at Anaplous. The building continued to be used by the Latins and survived the Palaiologan period until after the Ottoman conquest of the city. The Ottomans however used it for gunpowder storage. Thus in 1490, when the building was struck by a lightning, it was destroyed and subsequently torn down. As a result, the only information <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> the church comes from literary evidence, especially the mid-10th century Vita Basilii, as well a few crude depictions in maps.|$|E

2500|$|Roxy Miéville appears {{with the}} couple, {{as well as}} with the unseen Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville at the end of the film. Godard and his {{long-term}} professional and romantic partner Miéville co-own Roxy, but no longer live together. During the film's production Godard would often talk about Miéville. Olivier Séguret of Libération observed that most of the film was shot in places Godard shared with Miéville in their personal life and that the dialogue between the two couples could be based on conversations between them. When interviewed by NPR, Bordwell interpreted the shots of Roxy as Godard [...] "trying to get people to look at the world in a kind of an unspoiled way... There are hints throughout the film that animal consciousness is kind of closer to the world than we are, that language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there. And although the film is full of language, talk, printed text and so on, nevertheless I think there's a sense he wants the viewer to scrape away a lot of the ordinary conceptions <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>about</b> how we communicate and look at the world afresh." [...] Godard said that it was partially true that he sees the world through Roxy's eyes and that Roxy [...] "restores balance" [...] to the couple when they are in conflict and represent [...] "the commoners" [...] while the couple represents [...] "nobility" [...] or [...] "the clergy." [...] MacCabe wrote that Roxy [...] "offer an image of acceptable sociality" [...] in the film. In a scene with Roxy, a narrator talks about the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, which Brody calls [...] "Godard's one rare glimmer of historical optimism. It's as if Roxy were the agent of reconciliation—not of one merely lover to another but of Godard to the present day, to the rising generation." ...|$|E
