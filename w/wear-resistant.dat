5|$|Cobalt is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} preparation of magnetic, <b>wear-resistant</b> and high-strength alloys. The compounds, cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) aluminate (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high energy gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and <b>wear-resistant,</b> making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of <b>wear-resistant</b> cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ru and atomic number 44. It {{is a rare}} transition metal belonging to the platinum group of the periodic table. Like the other metals of the platinum group, ruthenium is inert to most other chemicals. The Baltic German scientist Karl Ernst Claus discovered the element in 1844 and named it after his homeland, Ruthenia. Ruthenium is usually found as a minor component of platinum ores; the annual production is about 20 tonnes. Most ruthenium produced is used in <b>wear-resistant</b> electrical contacts and thick-film resistors. A minor application for ruthenium is in platinum alloys and as a chemistry catalyst.|$|E
5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less <b>wear-resistant</b> and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC machining or by using electrical discharge machining processes.|$|E
25|$|Offered in 1/10 oz, 1/4 oz, 1/2 oz, and 1 oz denominations, these coins are {{guaranteed}} by the U.S. government to contain the stated amount of actual gold weight in troy ounces. By law, the gold must come from sources in America, alloyed with silver and copper to produce a more <b>wear-resistant</b> coin.|$|E
25|$|Frictional heat is {{generated}} between the <b>wear-resistant</b> tool {{and the work}} pieces. This heat, along with that generated by the mechanical mixing process and the adiabatic heat within the material, cause the stirred materials to soften without melting. As the tool is moved forward, a special profile on the probe forces plasticised material from the leading face to the rear, where the high forces assist in a forged consolidation of the weld.|$|E
25|$|The {{deposition}} rate {{in this process}} can be as low as 1nm per minute to as high as few micrometers per minute. The material utilization efficiency is high relative to other methods, and the process offers structural and morphological control of films. Due to the very high {{deposition rate}}, this process has potential industrial application for <b>wear-resistant</b> and thermal barrier coatings in aerospace industries, hard coatings for cutting and tool industries, and electronic and optical films for semiconductor industries and thin-film solar applications.|$|E
25|$|A {{cone crusher}} {{is similar in}} {{operation}} to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber {{and more of a}} parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a <b>wear-resistant</b> mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a manganese concave or a bowl liner. As rock enters the top of the cone crusher, it becomes wedged and squeezed between the mantle and the bowl liner or concave. Large pieces of ore are broken once, and then fall to a lower position (because they are now smaller) where they are broken again. This process continues until the pieces are small enough to fall through the narrow opening {{at the bottom of the}} crusher.|$|E
500|$|The {{relative}} high hardness and {{corrosion resistance}} of unalloyed chromium {{makes it a}} good surface coating, being still the most [...] "popular" [...] metal coating with unparalleled combined durability. A thin layer of chromium is deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by electroplating techniques. There are two deposition methods: Thin, below 1µm thickness, layers are deposited by chrome plating, and are used for decorative surfaces. If <b>wear-resistant</b> surfaces are needed then thicker chromium layers are deposited. Both methods normally use acidic chromate or dichromate solutions. To prevent the energy-consuming change in oxidation state, the use of chromium(III) sulfate is under development, but for most applications, the established process is used.|$|E
500|$|Columbian mammoths {{had four}} {{functional}} molar teeth at a time, {{two in the}} upper jaw and two in the lower. About [...] of the crown was within the jaw, and [...] was above. The crown was pushed forward and up as it wore down, comparable to a conveyor belt. The teeth had separated ridges of enamel, which were covered in [...] "prisms" [...] directed towards the chewing surface. <b>Wear-resistant,</b> they were held together with cementum and dentin. A mammoth's molars were replaced five times over the animal's lifetime. The first molars were {{about the size of}} those of a human, the third were [...] long, and the sixth were about [...] long and weighed [...] With each replacement, the molars grew larger and gained more ridges; the number of plates varied between individuals. Growing [...] of ridge took about 10.6 years.|$|E
500|$|The molars {{were adapted}} to their diet of coarse tundra grasses, with more enamel plates {{and a higher}} crown than their earlier, {{southern}} relatives. The woolly mammoth chewed its food by using its powerful jaw muscles to move the mandible forwards and close the mouth, then backwards while opening; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other, grinding the food. The ridges were <b>wear-resistant</b> to enable the animal to chew large quantities of food, which often contained grit. Woolly mammoths may have used their tusks as shovels to clear snow {{from the ground and}} reach the vegetation buried below, and to break ice to drink. This is indicated on many preserved tusks by flat, polished sections up to [...] long {{on the part of the}} surface that would have reached the ground. The tusks were also used for obtaining food in other ways, such as digging up plants and stripping off bark.|$|E
500|$|An adult Columbian mammoth {{would have}} needed more than [...] of food per day, and may have foraged for twenty hours a day. Mammoths chewed their food by using their {{powerful}} jaw muscles to move the mandible forward and close the mouth, then backward while opening; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other, grinding the food. The ridges were <b>wear-resistant,</b> enabling the animal to chew large quantities of food which contained grit. The trunk {{could be used for}} pulling up large tufts of grass, picking buds and flowers or tearing leaves and branches from trees and shrubs, and the tusks were used to dig up plants and strip bark from trees. Digging is indicated on preserved tusks by flat, polished sections of the surface that would have reached the ground. Isotope studies of Columbian mammoths from Mexico and the United States have shown that their diet varied by location, consisting of a mix of C3 (most plants) and C4 plants (such as grasses), and they were not restricted to grazing or browsing.|$|E
