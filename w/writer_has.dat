5|$|The poem, {{following}} the traditional Kalevala metre, has survived as several 17th and 18th century literations from {{various parts of}} Finland. Some of its elements appear in earlier works, but it hardly dates older than the vita. There is debate on whether the original poem was constructed {{by one or more}} individuals. The <b>writer</b> <b>has</b> however had superficial understanding of the church legends.|$|E
5|$|The arms of Maud Green, Lady Parr, {{mother of}} Catherine Parr (the {{last of the}} six wives of Henry VIII and {{stepmother}} to Elizabeth I), were of three stags on an azure background, and this {{became one of the}} elements of the arms of Catherine Parr on her marriage. Her sister, Anne Parr, married William, 1st Earl of Pembroke, whose grandson (the 3rd Earl, also called William) became the first Visitor of the college in 1622. Maud Green's arms are depicted in plasterwork from about 1592 at Powis Castle, owned by a kinsman of the earls. One <b>writer</b> <b>has</b> suggested that the college may have adopted the arms in order to be associated with one of the leading Welsh families of the day.|$|E

25|$|The {{protagonist of}} the first of Bishop's {{unpublished}} novels is a woman who, as a child, attempted to frighten a friend after an argument but accidentally killed the friend's brother. One <b>writer</b> <b>has</b> speculated, after reviewing the evidence, that Bishop had meant to frighten or shoot her father with the shotgun after an argument and mistook her brother for him.|$|E

25|$|During the 18th century Bunyan's unpolished style {{fell out}} of favour, but his {{popularity}} returned with Romanticism, poet Robert Southey writing an appreciative biography in 1830. Bunyan's reputation was further enhanced by the evangelical revival and he became a favourite author of the Victorians. The tercentenary of Bunyan's birth, celebrated in 1928, elicited praise from his former adversary, the Church of England. Although popular interest in Bunyan waned {{during the second half}} of the twentieth century, academic interest in the <b>writer</b> <b>has</b> increased and Oxford University Press brought out a new edition of his works, beginning in 1976. Authors who have been influenced by Bunyan include Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, Louisa May Alcott and George Bernard Shaw.|$|E
25|$|Another account, which {{concluded}} that Ananda Mahidol's death {{was the result}} of suicide, was explored by journalist Rayne Kruger in his book, The Devil's Discus. The book is banned in Thailand. However, a website by a Thai <b>writer</b> <b>has</b> provided a summary of Kruger's arguments, and it links to other material about the death. Kruger, who had unprecedented access to members of the inner circle of the Thai royal family (although these contacts had to remain unidentified), drew the conclusion that Ananda's death was most probably an 'accidental suicide'. Thus, said Kruger, it appears the sad, most likely accidental, death of the young king was exploited for the purposes of a political vendetta, and that three innocent victims were executed to maintain the façade.|$|E
25|$|Although {{originally}} developed in England in 1748 {{in order to}} compete with imported porcelain, bone china is now made worldwide. The English had read the letters of Jesuit missionary Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles, which described Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets in detail. One <b>writer</b> <b>has</b> speculated that a misunderstanding of the text could possibly {{have been responsible for}} the first attempts to use bone-ash as an ingredient of English porcelain, although this is not supported by researchers and historians. In China, kaolin was sometimes described as forming the 'bones' of the paste, while the 'flesh' was provided by the refined rocks suitable for the porcelain body. Traditionally, English bone china was made from two parts of bone-ash, one part of kaolin and one part china stone, although this has largely been replaced by feldspars from non-UK sources.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these and many more names, we must mention the numerous religious who seek in the archives fresh material for general ecclesiastical history, or {{the history of their}} order, e. g. the Benedictines and the Bollandists. The <b>writer</b> <b>has</b> observed at work in the archives during the last twenty-one years Dominicans, Jesuits, Franciscans, Minor Conventuals, Capuchins, Trinitarians, Cistercians, Benedictines, Basilians, Christian Brothers, Lateran Canons Regular, Vallombrosans, Camaldolese, Olivetans, Silvestrines, Carthusians, Augustinians, Mercedarians, Barnabites, and others. Women have at times secured temporary admittance, though for intelligible reasons this privilege is now restricted. Since 1879 the archives have welcomed Catholics, Protestants, Hebrews, believers and infidels, Christians and heathens, priests and laymen, men and women, rich and poor, persons of high social standing and plain citizens, of every nation and language. The writer is acquainted with nearly all the great archives of Europe, and knows that none of them afford similar facilities to the historical student or extend him more courtesy. The number of visitors is at all times higher than to other archives, while the freedom allowed {{in the use of the}} material is the most far-reaching known; practically nothing is kept hidden.|$|E
500|$|The {{focus on}} George Willard's {{development}} {{as a young man}} and a <b>writer</b> <b>has</b> also led some critics to put Winesburg, Ohio within the tradition of [...] "the American boy book, the Bildungsroman, and the Künstlerroman".|$|E

500|$|From [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] to [...] "Treehouse of Horror XIII", {{all three}} {{segments}} {{were written by}} different writers.
