5|$|In 2010, Greenpeace International {{added the}} tiger shark to its seafood red list, {{which is a}} list of fish {{commonly}} sold around the world, and <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very high risk of being sourced from unsustainable fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Matrices <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{single row}} are called row vectors, and those <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> single column are called column vectors. A matrix {{which has the}} same number of rows and columns is called a square matrix. A matrix with an {{infinite}} number of rows or columns (or both) is called an infinite matrix. In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an empty matrix.|$|E
5|$|The lungs work as {{a filter}} and trap the bubbles in the {{capillaries}} <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> smaller diameter. Gas transfer into the alveoli eliminates the bubbles.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} Phallus species known with a pinkish-colored cap is P.rubicundus; its conical cap <b>has</b> <b>a</b> surface that is wrinkled, not reticulate. Other similar species include P.hadriani, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> purple volva, P.macrosporus, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> reddish volva, and P.formanosus, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> pale pink stipe and volva.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{versions}} of this model, the PX5000G, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> fan-assisted heatsink, and the PX5000EG, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> fanless heatsink.|$|R
50|$|The {{only other}} Phallus species known with a pinkish-colored cap is P. rubicundus; its conical cap <b>has</b> <b>a</b> surface that is wrinkled, not reticulate.

5|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} test on a blood sample from affected animals will confirm a suspected case by identifying the viral DNA, though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case. Prior {{to the development of}} the test, or in circumstances where it is not available, the disease may be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> quick onset leading to rapid death, including encephalomyocarditis and salmonellosis.|$|E
5|$|A third {{approach}} achieves some of {{the output}} benefits of tracking, with a lesser penalty in terms of land area, capital and operating cost. This involves tracking the sun in one dimension – in its daily journey across the sky – but not adjusting for the seasons. The angle of the axis is normally horizontal, though some, such as the solar park at Nellis Airforce Base, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 20° tilt, incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation – effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt.|$|E
5|$|As {{a highly}} {{radioactive}} element, americium {{and its compounds}} must be handled only in an appropriate laboratory under special arrangements. Although most americium isotopes predominantly emit alpha particles which can be blocked by thin layers of common materials, many of the daughter products emit gamma-rays and neutrons <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> long penetration depth.|$|E
50|$|The family {{consists}} of: the Zefiro 250, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> top {{operating speed}} of 250 km/h {{and which is}} for the moment wholly manufactured in China; the Zefiro 300, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> top operating speed of 300 km/h; and the Zefiro 380, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> top operating speed of 380 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Asterohedbergella, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> stellate outline, is {{from the}} Upper Cretaceous (M. to U. Cenomanian) of Israel. Costellagerina, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> lobate outline, {{is from the}} Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian to Campanian) and is cosmopolitan. Whiteinella, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> pustulate surface, is from the U. Cretaceous (M. Cenomanian to M. Turonian), is also cosmopolitan.|$|R
5000|$|Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) is {{the major}} oil {{exploration}} and production company in the Sultanate of Oman. It accounts for about 70% of the country's crude oil production and nearly all of its natural gas supply. The Company {{is owned by the}} Government of Oman (<b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> 60% interest), the Shell Group (<b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> 34% interest), Total (<b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> 4% interest) and Partex (<b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> 2% interest). Gas fields and processing plants are operated by PDO exclusively on behalf of the Government.|$|R
5|$|Cave 2 {{is similar}} to cave 1 in design. The veranda has two pillars and two {{pilaster}}s, a bench between each pillar and pilaster with curtains in the back, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rail pattern. Over the pillars rests the rail-patterned rock beam, above which is the ceiling. Parts of the pillars and pilasters are broken. In front over the beam project rock imitations of rafters. A doorway with grooves for a wooden frame, leads into a middle room, with a bench along the left wall. The position of the hall-cell and cell are exchanged with respect to cave 1 design. Each has a bench.|$|E
5|$|Cerium-doped {{lanthanum}} bromide and {{lanthanum chloride}} are the recent inorganic scintillators, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> combination of high light yield, best energy resolution, and fast response. Their high yield converts into superior energy resolution; moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over {{a very wide}} range of temperatures, making it particularly attractive for high-temperature applications. These scintillators are already widely used commercially in detectors of neutrons or gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Chalukyan temples {{fall into}} two {{categories}} – the first being temples with a common mantapa (a colonnaded hall) and two shrines (known as dvikuta), and the second being temples with one mantapa and a single shrine (ekakuta). Both kinds of temples have two or more entrances giving access to the main hall. This format differs from both the designs of the northern Indian temples, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> small closed mantapa leading to the shrine and the southern Indian temples which generally have a large, open, columned mantapa.|$|E
50|$|The worst first roll is 11236 <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{value of}} 249.83. After the second roll the worst {{position}} is 12356 <b>which</b> then <b>has</b> <b>a</b> value of 244.91. The worst third roll is 23446 <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> value of 238.96 when {{put in the}} Chance box.|$|R
50|$|The ligule {{is pointed}} and silvery. Compared this to Common Meadowgrass Poa pratensis, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> squared ligule, and Poa trivialis, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> pointed, but less silvery ligule.|$|R
50|$|Lactones {{contribute}} significantly to the flavor of fruit, and of unfermented and fermented dairy products, and are therefore used as flavors and fragrances. Some examples are γ-decalactone (4-decanolide), <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> characteristic peach flavor; δ-decalactone (5-decanolide), <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> creamy coconut/peach flavour; γ-dodecalactone (4-dodecanolide), <b>which</b> also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> coconut/fruity flavor, a description which also fits γ-octalactone (4-octanolide), although it also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> herbaceous character; γ-nonalactone, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> intense coconut flavor of this series, despite not occurring in coconut, and γ-undecalactone.|$|R
5|$|Collybia cirrhata is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E
5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} occur in many breeds, {{which have been}} {{developed}} since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common varieties found in pet stores are the English shorthair (also known as the American), <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair. Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily grooming.|$|E
5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, viscous liquid. Typically, this viscous liquid will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E
50|$|Although the SD Gundam {{franchise}} initially {{started out}} featuring characters and mecha {{from the mainstream}} Gundam series, by the 1990s SD Gundam spawned numerous spin-off series, SD Gundam Sengokuden (Musha Gundam) <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> Sengoku setting, SD Gundam Gaiden (Knight Gundam) <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> fantasy medieval setting and SD Command Chronicles <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> modern military style to name a few.|$|R
50|$|Similar {{species are}} the plains harvest mouse, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> more {{distinct}} but narrower stripe on its spine, and the fulvous harvest mouse, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> longer tail. Also similar is the salt marsh harvest mouse, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>an</b> underbelly fur {{that is more}} pinkish cinnamon to tawny. Finally, the house mouse has incisors without grooves, unlike those of the western harvest mouse.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{football}} {{clubs in}} Propriá. América and Propriá. América owns José Neto Stadium, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> maximum capacity of 3,000 people, and Propriá owns Constantino Tavares Stadium, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> maximum capacity of 5,000 people. Also, both clubs plays at João Alves Filho Stadium, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> maximum capacity of 3,000 people and {{is owned by}} Sergipe's state government.|$|R
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> low proportion of elements other than {{hydrogen and helium}} when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where they enter {{the next generation of}} stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be an indication of the age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E
5|$|However, in non-technical {{contexts}} and in {{software for the}} World Wide Web, the term URL remains widely used. Additionally, the term web address (which has no formal definition) often occurs in non-technical publications as a synonym for a URI that uses the scheme http or https. Such assumptions can lead to confusion, for example {{in the case of}} XML namespaces, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> visual similarity to resolvable URIs.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Juniper {{released}} the EX9200 switch, which isn't {{part of the}} MX Series, but uses the same software and Trio chipset. A virtualized MX series 3D router, the vMX 3D, was introduced in November 2014. A suite of updates were announced in late 2015. New MPC line cards were introduced, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> throughput of up to 1.6 Tbit/s. Simultaneously the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) was announced. JET is a programming interface for integrating third-party applications that automate provisioning, maintenance and other tasks. The Junos Telemetry Interface was also announced at the same time. It reports data to applications and other equipment to automate changes to the network in response to faults or in order optimize performance.|$|E
25|$|The {{hexagonal}} crystal family is also {{split into two}} crystal systems – the trigonal, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> three-fold axis of symmetry, and the hexagonal, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> six-fold axis of symmetry.|$|R
50|$|Also in 2011, Jeremiah Weed {{launched}} two Brews {{into the}} UK: Jeremiah Weed Sour Mash Brew <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> bourbon taste and Jeremiah Weed Root Brew <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> ginger taste.|$|R
50|$|Since December 2016, Home {{ground is}} the Şenol Güneş Stadium, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{capacity}} of 41,461. Former home ground is the Hüseyin Avni Aker Stadium, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> capacity of 24,169.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} (the lowered {{area at the}} nose) is relatively broad in comparison to M.manavi. The frontal bones (part of the skull roof) bear a well-developed sagittal crest (a crest that provides support for muscles of the head). Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid crest (another such crest) is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, as in M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis, but unlike in M.aelleni and M.manavi, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> flat palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, robust posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that 3GB of RAM would be reserved for the operating system and utility software, leaving 5GB for games. With DirectX 11.2 as the console's API, the graphics processing unit (GPU) {{is based on an}} AMD GCN architecture with 12 compute units, <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> total of 768 cores, running at 853MHz providing an estimated peak theoretical power of 1.31 TFLOPS. For networking, Xbox One supports Gigabit Ethernet, 802.11n wireless, and Wi-Fi Direct.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid taste is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected <b>which</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E
