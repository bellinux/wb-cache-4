5|$|On 3 June, the destroyers Wildfang and Csikós, {{along with}} 93F and 96F, briefly {{encountered}} three Italian MAS boats off {{the mouth of}} the Tagliamento river in the far north of the Adriatic. On 23 September, 77T and 78T were laying a minefield off Grado in the northern Adriatic <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> brief encounter with an Italian MAS boat. The following night, 94F and three other torpedo boats again had a short and inconclusive engagement with Italian torpedo boats in the northern Adriatic. On 29 September, 90F, 94F and 98M were accompanying a squadron of four destroyers supporting an air attack on the Italian airfield at Ferrara by flying boats. After destroying an Italian airship, the squadron withdrew at high speed in the darkness, but was intercepted by an Italian squadron of eight destroyers that had been sent to support an Italian air raid on Pola. In the resultant 45 minute chase towards Parenzo, two Italian destroyers and three Austro-Hungarian destroyers were damaged, and 94F was hit by splinters. As the squadron retreated through the minefields off Parenzo, 98M was also hit by Italian fire, resulting in one casualty.|$|E

25|$|The Warriors had {{a disappointing}} 2008–2009 season, {{finishing}} 29–53. Ellis {{was injured in}} a moped accident, and suspended for 30 games for riding the vehicle against the terms of his contract, depriving the Warriors of their top player. They traded disenchanted forward Al Harrington to the New York Knicks for guard Jamal Crawford, and were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as Anthony Morrow and Brandan Wright. Coach Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups {{since many of the}} original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors were hard to beat <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> healthy lineup and a strong bench. With leadership and improvement in their young players, they were sometimes able to defeat powerhouse teams such as the Boston Celtics, 99-89.|$|E
25|$|Darlington is {{currently}} {{in the process of}} considering a major re-build of several units, as it too is reaching its design mid-life time. The budget {{is currently}} estimated to be between $8.5 and $14 billion, and produce power at 6 to 8 cents/kWh. This prediction is based on three assumptions that appear to have never been met in operation: that the rebuild will be completed on-budget, that the system will operate at an average capacity utilization of 82%, and that the Ontario taxpayer will pay 100% of any cost overruns. Although Darlington Units 1, 3 and 4 have operated with an average lifetime annual capacity factor of 85% and Unit 2 with a capacity factor of 78%, refurbished units at Pickering and Bruce have lifetime capacity factors between 59 and 69%. This includes periods of several years while the units were shut down for the retubing and refurbishing. In 2009, Bruce A Units 3 and 4 had capacity factors of 80.5% and 76.7%, respectively, in a year <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> major Vacuum Building outage.|$|E

25|$|Ainsworth's {{narrative}} records {{showed that}} infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The child's needs are frequently not met {{and the child}} comes to believe that communication of needs has no influence on the caregiver. Ainsworth's student Mary Main theorised that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situational Procedure {{should be regarded as}} 'a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection' by de-emphasising attachment needs. Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver – avoiding {{a situation in which the}} child is overwhelmed with emotion ('disorganised distress'), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.|$|E
25|$|In weeks {{three and}} four, Argentina and South Africa both {{travelled}} to Australasia for two away matches. Argentina played the All Blacks in Napier where they lost 28–9, before facing Australia on the Gold Coast where they lost 32–25. The Pumas {{loss to the}} All Blacks was played in wet conditions, with New Zealand scoring four tries, and Argentina three penalties. Argentina's loss to Australia was much closer than their defeat in New Zealand. Despite leading by 16 points after 60 minutes, Australia conceded twelve points in the final quarter. Argentina trailed by seven points, {{the value of a}} converted try, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> scrum deep within Wallabies' territory, but Australia were awarded a free-kick after the Pumas' scrum-half fed the ball too early and the game ended. In the third week the Springboks played Australia in Perth, where the Wallabies won 24–23. The Wallbies had trailed 23–14, but scored ten unanswered points after Springbok wing Bryan Habana, who was playing in his 100th test match, was yellow carded for a high tackle. The following week South Africa played the All Blacks in Wellington. The match was won 14–10 by New Zealand, but only after they resisted repeated South African attacks on their try-line late in the game. The win was the 36th consecutive victory for the All Blacks in New Zealanda record stretching back to 2009.|$|E
