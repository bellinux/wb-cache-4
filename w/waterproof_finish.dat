40|$|In the {{historic}} buildings built with face brick tile {{it is very}} common to have copings and cornices of soldier or header course, made with the same brick as the facade and these bricks are usually more deteriorated {{than the rest of}} the facade. The cause of the deterioration is the action of the water combined with dirt, vegetation, and other moisture-related causes. One of the possible systems to conserve and protect these elements is by projecting a water repellent. This article will present the results of tests conducted on laboratory specimens formed by low brick walls with and without the application of a <b>waterproofing</b> treatment, <b>finished</b> off at the top part by a sloping course also of brick...|$|R
40|$|What is {{formaldehyde}} {{and where}} is it found? Formaldehyde is a chemical that is used widely across many products in our environment. It {{would be difficult to}} list all the possible sources of formaldehyde; the table below shows some of the more common sources of formaldehyde exposure. Sources of formaldehyde Fabrics treated with formaldehyde resins and in which some free formaldehyde remains. Formaldehyde resins provide the unique qualities of the following fabrics: Permanent press Anti-cling, anti-static, anti-wrinkle and anti-shrink finishes Chlorine-resistant finishes Stiffening on lightweight nylon knits <b>Waterproof</b> <b>finishes</b> Perspiration proof finishes Moth proof and mildew resistant finishes Suede and chamois Cosmetics and toiletries including fingernail polishers and hardeners, antiperspirants, makeup, bubble bath, bath oils, shampoos, creams, mouthwashes and deodorants. In many cases formaldehyde is used as a preservative. Household cleansers, disinfectants and polishes Paper products — formaldehyde is used to improve the water resistance, grease resistance, shrink resistance and other characteristics of paper Building materials — urea-formaldehyde glue or adhesive is used in pressed wood products such as particle board, plywood and MDF Medications including wart remedies, anhidrotics, medicated creams, orthopaedic casts and root canal preparation disinfectant Paints, primers and paint-stripping agents Embalming fluid and as a preservative for laboratory specimens Formaldehyde is released in the smoke from burning wood, coal, charcoal, cigarettes, natural gas and kerosene What are the reactions to formaldehyde allergy? Reactions to formaldehyde depend on the type of exposure that has occurred. Formaldehyde is not only a sensitiser but also a potent primary irritant. Exposure to formaldehyde gas may cause burning sensations in the eye, nose and throat, skin rashes, tightness of the chest and wheezing, fatigue and headaches. These symptoms may be a result of a primary irritant effect or an allergic sensitisation to formaldehyde...|$|R

The original roofs were constructed of flat concrete slabs with a membrane <b>waterproofing</b> and <b>finished</b> with a bituminous coating {{which was designed to}} be walked on. At the roofline, {{on either side of the}} main entrance, are large painted reliefs of the Royal and Commonwealth coats of arms. The railings on the front steps were installed after the federal parliament had left the building and were not present during its active lifetime. The interior continues the stripped-classicism of the exterior, with the use of common motifs and simple lines, in both the decor and furnishings. To represent the federal nature of the Commonwealth of Australia, the building also makes extensive use of timbers from various parts of Australia, with a timber native to each state, (except South Australia), being used for different purposes. The building is also designed to make good use of natural light from windows, skylights and light-wells.|$|R
50|$|The {{innovative}} {{construction of}} the visitor center ensures that the cave entrance has full exposure to the skylight. To achieve this, the layout has incorporated techniques of local building architecture {{in the form of}} 'currais de figueira' meaning 'fig tree walls” structure. Such walls used {{to be part of the}} vineyards in the region as protection from wind and seawater. This front elevation forms the natural southern part of the building. The wall which is 1.8 m in height has an “open-weave structure” or undulating structure to permit natural lighting to the entire building, thus eliminating provision of windows. It also provides protection to the entrance into the tunnel. The building also incorporates a design which provides uniform illumination of the interior. It eliminates the need for other openings. Except for the wall at the entrance, the main building is painted with a <b>waterproof</b> black colour <b>finish</b> to match with the colour and texture of the vitrified lava inside the cave.|$|R
40|$|Key-words: flat roofs, thermal performance, high {{reflectance}} products, experimental cells. Abstract. Flat roofs {{are particularly}} unfavourable to the thermal performance of single family houses and apartments {{of the the}} upper floor of multifamily buildings. Often these housing typologies are too hot during summer, when incident solar radiation affects the roof {{more than any other}} element of the building envelope. Recent developments have given rise to many high reflectance products. However, thermal performance of these products has not yet been thoroughly quantified, when applied to flat roofs under real weather conditions. Performance assessment of innovative solutions must consist in the evaluation under real exposure conditions and analytical modelling. Two full-scale experimental cells under weathering conditions, located in Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil (LNEC) campus, were used in this study. The experimental cells have identical dimensions, constructive characteristics and thermal behaviour. Initially, the two cells (C 5 and C 6) presented the same APP modified bitumen <b>waterproofing</b> solution, <b>finished</b> on the top layer with natural slate granules (XN). Subsequently, simulating a rehabilitation intervention, it was introduced in C 5 an improved reflectance APP modified bitumen membrane surfaced with thermally coloured white slate granules (XB). After a coexistence period of solutions XB (C 5) and XN (C 6), it was applied over C 6 XN a high reflectance white paint (XN/PB). The characterization of the thermal performance under real weather of each tested solution was based on the analysis of the values of the following parameters recorded under free-floating operation and controlled regime: temperature of the flat roof’s upper and lower surfaces, indoor temperature and electric consumption under controlled regime...|$|R
