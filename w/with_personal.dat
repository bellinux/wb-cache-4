5|$|Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star is {{the eighth}} studio album by American {{experimental}} rock band Sonic Youth, released on May 10, 1994 by DGC Records.

5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset <b>with</b> <b>personal</b> loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson {{may have been too}} overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace the old one. Emily once again was responsible for chores, including the baking, at which she excelled.|$|E

For years he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical, then finally reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable. Though he recounted the insipid benefits of slavery, he predicted its eventual death. Indeed, he freed his own slaves in 1845, 16 years prior to his death.|$|E
5|$|Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann {{proposed}} that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language <b>with</b> <b>personal</b> import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could be overcome by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August, a {{proposed}} move to Werder Bremen failed {{to come to}} fruition after the club's sporting director Klaus Allofs declared that the club {{was not interested in}} Ben Arfa, despite reports of Werder Bremen offering Marseille a transfer fee of €8million. On 27 August, Dassier confirmed that the club had reached an agreement on a loan fee with Newcastle for the transfer of Ben Arfa <b>with</b> <b>personal</b> terms being the only stumbling block in the deal. Marseille agreed to a £2million loan fee. Newcastle had been set to pay Marseille another £5million if Ben Arfa had made 25 club appearances in the 2010–11 season, which would have made the transfer permanent.|$|E

5|$|Bass guitarist and lyricist Roger Waters {{conceived}} the album {{as a rock}} opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour, when his frustration with the audience became so acute that he spat on them. Its story, which follows themes of abandonment and personal isolation, explores Pink, a character whom Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett. Pink's life begins {{with the loss of}} his father during the Second World War, and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, represented by a metaphorical wall. The band, who were then struggling <b>with</b> <b>personal</b> and financial difficulties, supported the idea. The album {{is considered one of the}} most recognisable concept albums.|$|E
5|$|Cottage gardens, {{which emerged}} in Elizabethan times, {{appear to have}} {{originated}} as a local source for herbs and fruits. One theory is that they arose out of the Black Death of the 1340s, when the death of so many laborers made land available for small cottages <b>with</b> <b>personal</b> gardens. According to the late 19th-century legend of origin, these gardens were originally created by the workers that lived in the cottages of the villages, {{to provide them with}} food and herbs, with flowers planted in for decoration. Helen Leach analysed the historical origins of the romanticised cottage garden, subjecting the garden style to rigorous historical analysis, along with the ornamental potager and the herb garden. She concluded that their origins were less in workingmen's gardens in the 19th century and more in the leisured classes' discovery of simple hardy plants, in part through the writings of John Claudius Loudon. Loudon helped to design the estate at Great Tew, Oxfordshire, where farm workers were provided with cottages that had architectural quality set in a small garden—about an acre—where they could grow food and keep pigs and chickens.|$|E
