5|$|An aspect <b>weaver</b> is a metaprogramming utility for aspect-oriented {{languages}} {{designed to}} take instructions specified by aspects (isolated representations of a significant concepts in a program) and generate the final implementation code. The <b>weaver</b> integrates aspects into the locations specified by the software as a pre-compilation step. By merging aspects and classes (representations {{of the structure of}} entities in the program), the <b>weaver</b> generates a woven class.|$|E
5|$|Despite the loss, <b>Weaver</b> still {{believed}} the Populist cause would triumph. He {{agreed to be}} nominated one last time for his old 6th district House seat on a Democratic-Populist fusion ticket. As he had ten years earlier, Republican John Lacey defeated <b>Weaver.</b> In 1900, <b>Weaver</b> attended a convention of fusionist Populists in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the party having split {{on the issue of}} cooperation with the Democrats. The fusionists backed Bryan, the Democratic nominee, but he lost again to McKinley, this time by a greater margin. The following year, <b>Weaver</b> was elected to office for the last time as the mayor of his hometown, Colfax, Iowa.|$|E

5|$|<b>Weaver</b> {{embarked}} on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, {{the issue of race}} hurt <b>Weaver</b> among white Southern voters, as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to lynchings. <b>Weaver</b> drew good crowds in the South, but {{he and his wife were}} also subjected to abuse from hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted <b>Weaver</b> as a threat to the conservative Democrats in power there; with the increasing disenfranchisement of black voters, this was to prove fatal to the Populists' hopes in the South.|$|E

On 23 February 1725 an agreement was recorded between the <b>weavers</b> of Glasgow and the <b>weavers</b> of Calton and Blackfaulds to regulate and control the industry, to ensure good standards of craftmanship and to prevent destructive competition.The agreement involved payment. As late as 1830, the <b>weavers</b> in Calton were paying the <b>weavers</b> of Glasgow five groats out of every loom, and thirty pounds Scots yearly.|$|R

At the 1939 election <b>Weaver</b> was returned uncontested. He served as Speaker until the succeeding government of Alexander Mair was defeated at the May 1941 election by the Labor Party under William McKell. <b>Weaver</b> was returned in his seat uncontested.|$|E
5|$|After the election, <b>Weaver</b> {{returned}} to the lame-duck session of Congress and proposed an unsuccessful constitutional amendment that would have provided for the direct election of Senators. After his term expired in March, he resumed his speaking tour, promoting the Greenback Party across the nation. He and EdwardH. Gillette, another Iowa Greenback Congressman, bought the Iowa Tribune in 1882 to help spread the Greenback message. That same year, <b>Weaver</b> ran for his old 6th district seat in the House against the incumbent Republican, MarsenaE. Cutts. This time the Democrats and Greenbackers ran separate candidates, and <b>Weaver</b> finished a distant second. Cutts died before taking office, and the Republicans offered to let <b>Weaver</b> run unopposed in the special election if he rejoined their party; he declined, and JohnC. Cook, a Democrat, won the seat.|$|E

Polk. <b>Weaver</b> attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for {{a break from the}} two major parties, and his argument carried the day, although <b>Weaver</b> and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E

25|$|It was {{believed}} that artisan <b>weavers</b> wove cloth during poor weather and worked on their land when possible.

5|$|By 1877, {{differences}} with the Republican party leadership on the money question led him to consider other options. After initially supporting the Republican candidate for governor that year, <b>Weaver</b> joined the Greenback Party in August. In 1878, <b>Weaver</b> accepted the Greenback nomination for Iowa's 6th congressional district. Although Weaver's political career up to then had been as a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district considered that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Ezekiel S. Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Despite objections from some hard-money Democrats, the Greenback-Democrat ticket prevailed, and <b>Weaver</b> was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, <b>Weaver,</b> {{now living}} in Dubbo, contested the seat of Ashburnham for the Liberal Party but was {{defeated}} on 46-53% against the Labor Party's John Lynch. Undeterred, <b>Weaver</b> stood again in 1913 as the Farmers and Settlers Party candidate for the seat of Macquarie but was narrowly defeated with 49.61% against the Labor Party candidate's 50.39%. <b>Weaver</b> contested the result, accusing the Labor Party of manipulating the rolls. An inquiry found no fault in these accusations against the Labor Party, but instead found Weaver's own organisers guilty of roll-stuffing.|$|E

The variety cremoricolor is found in eastern North America and has longer spores than the nominate variety, measuring 7â€“12 by 3.8â€“5Âµm. According to Shaffer and <b>Weaver,</b> it differs macroscopically from the typical variety in having cream- to buff-colored cap and stem, and pale pinkish-cinnamon gills.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from the political traditions of the day, <b>Weaver</b> himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, <b>Weaver</b> and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South. As the campaign progressed, however, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, <b>Weaver</b> campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.|$|E
