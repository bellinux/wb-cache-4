Hughes assented, and for several years afterwards UC Berkeley Library staff developers and other volunteers maintained and enhanced it. It is now maintained by a team of volunteers.|$|E
5000|$|Metadata <b>web</b> <b>indexing</b> {{involves}} assigning keywords {{or phrases}} to web pages or web sites within a metadata tag (or [...] "meta-tag") field, {{so that the}} web page or web site can be retrieved with a search engine that is customized to search the keywords field. This {{may or may not}} involve using keywords restricted to a controlled vocabulary list. This method is commonly used by search engine indexing.|$|E
50|$|The {{approach}} here is {{to reuse}} Web semantic standards to describe things and their services. In particular, people {{have been working on}} HTML5 Microdata integration, RDF / RDFa, JSON-LD and EXI. This enables searching for things through search engines and other <b>Web</b> <b>indexes</b> as well as enabling machine to machine interaction based on a small set of well-defined formats and standards.|$|R
40|$|In this {{document}} {{we describe the}} retrieval and user interface functions of the EWI. We define those functionalities of the European <b>Web</b> <b>Index</b> (EWI) that depend directly upon the information retrieval protocol used. Having done that, we discuss the structure that is subsequently built {{on top of that}} using HTTP and CGI. Finally, we will provide some practical guidance for those who would like to install an EWI compliant gateway. 1. Introduction The European <b>Web</b> <b>Index</b> (EWI) is developed {{as a part of the}} DESIRE project, in the European Union Telematics for Research program. Part of the project is "aimed at meeting the needs of research users for better means of locating the information that is relevant to their research endeavour" and EWI attempts to do so by providing "methods and tools for automatic indexing of information in the World-Wide Web" [1]. In short, the goal is to provide the technology needed for the establishment of WWW search services for European higher education, reseach [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Search engines {{have become}} {{important}} tools for Web navigation. In {{order to provide}} powerful search facilities, search engines maintain comprehensive indices of documents available on the Web. The creation and maintenance of <b>Web</b> <b>indices</b> is done by Web crawlers, which recursively traverse and download Web pages on behalf of search engines. Analysis of the collected information is performed after the data has been downloaded. In this research, we propose an alternative, more efficient approach to building <b>Web</b> <b>indices</b> based on mobile crawlers. Our proposed crawlers are transferred to the source(s) where the data resides in order to filter out any unwanted data locally before transferring {{it back to the}} search engine. Our approach to Web crawling is particularly well suited for implementing so-called "smart" crawling algorithms which determine an efficient crawling path based on the contents of Web pages that have been visited so far. In order to demonstrate the viabili [...] ...|$|R
