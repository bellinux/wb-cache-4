50|$|In the United States, {{biomedical}} {{waste is}} usually regulated as medical waste. In 1988 the U.S. federal government passed The Medical <b>Waste</b> <b>Tracking</b> Act which set {{the standards for}} governmental regulation of medical waste.

It was designed primarily to monitor the treatment of medical wastes through their creation, transportation and destruction, i.e. from “cradle-to-grave.” Congress approved the bill “to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promulgate regulations on the management of infections waste.” In short, Congress enacted the MWTA as a pilot study to better determine how {{the life cycle of}} medical wastes played out under federal regulations.|$|E
50|$|The University of Vermont has a {{long history}} toward {{operational}} environmental sustainability on its campus. In 1995, the Environmental Council at UVM was established to fill a gap regarding a bridge between operations and academics on campus greening issues. The first Council project was to hear presentations from the various environmental programs on campus to provide a baseline scan of campus operation environmental impact. Greening UVM was published in 1998 by the Council to establish a baseline on the environmental impact of the campus' operations. During the same year, a Recycled Paper Policy was created and was implemented in 1999. As a community stakeholder in the Lab-XL project, the Environmental Council received an EPA grant to support the Tracking UVM project and publication to assess relative environmental impact and community interest in laboratory chemical <b>waste.</b> <b>Tracking</b> UVM, a follow-up to the Greening UVM report, was published in 2002 and reported on the environmental progress of the university from 1990 to 2000. The University of Vermont's commitment to tracking its environmental performance was recognized in 2004 with Vermont's Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence for this 2002 environmental report card.

40|$|Ontario Power Generation (OPG) {{recognizes the}} {{importance}} of information management particularly with regards to its low and intermediate level waste program. Various computer based <b>waste</b> <b>tracking</b> systems {{have been used in}} OPG since the 1980 s. These systems tracked the physical receipt, processing, storage, and inventory of the waste. As OPG moved towards long-term management (e. g. disposal), it was recognized that tracking of more detailed waste characterization information was important. This required either substantial modification of the existing system to include a waste characterization module or replacing it entirely with a new system. After a detailed review of available options, it was decided that the existing <b>waste</b> <b>tracking</b> application would be replaced with the Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL) Integrated <b>Waste</b> <b>Tracking</b> System (IWTS). Installing and commissioning a system which must receive historical operational waste management information (data) and provide new features, required much more attention than was originally considered. The operational readiness of IWTS required extensive vetting and preparation of historic data (which itself had been created from multiple databases in varied formats) to ensure a consistent format for import of some 30, 000 -container records, and merging and linking these container records to a waste stream based characterization database.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how {{location tracking}} technologies can transform {{municipal solid waste}} management in smart cities. While waste is often tracked in aggregate as it flows between and through handling facilities, {{there have been few}} attempts to follow individual trash items geographically using GPS and web-based mapping. Such data change the interaction between citizens, local government, and service providers, by revealing inefficiencies or fraud in disposal practices, or building trust between stakeholders and enabling alternative approaches for contracting waste services. Five essays demonstrate various designs and evaluations of real-time <b>waste</b> <b>tracking</b> systems, identify challenges and opportunities for incorporating these tools, and show how developed and developing cities can learn from each other. The first essay presents a system where individuals electronically tag a trash item, and view its movements in real-time. By surveying volunteers who participated in this experiment, it shows how this feedback can significantly improve their knowledge of how waste systems operate and where different types end up. The second essay extends this method for tracking hazardous electronic waste, such as CRT monitors, when illegally exported from high- to low-income countries. This information allows activist groups to investigate smuggling routes and support public agencies in enforcing international law. The third and fourth essays implement <b>waste</b> <b>tracking</b> in Brazil and Kenya, where many cities rely on informal workers to collect and recycle trash. By carrying smartphones tracking their location, waste pickers can map their own movements, waste generation, and material flow across the city. This allows them to organize more efficient routes, coordinate actions in real-time, and negotiate more favorable partnerships with government and private clients. Planners also benefit from crowdsourced data in informal areas. Looking to the future, the fifth essay considers how formal waste collection services could be made transparent, and how this supports crowdsourcing efforts to improve their efficiency and better meet resident needs. Doing so requires design of both real-time urban dashboards and citizen feedback mobile applications. The result transforms how cities benchmark effective municipal services and strive for high quality urban environments. by David Lee. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the challenges associated with creating a data management system for <b>waste</b> <b>tracking</b> at the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Plant (AMWTP) at the Idaho National Engineering Lab (INEEL). The <b>waste</b> <b>tracking</b> system combines data from plant automation systems and decision points. The {{primary purpose of}} the system is to provide information to enable the plant operators and engineers to assess the risks associated with each container and determine the best method of treating it. It is also used to track the transuranic (TRU) waste containers as they move throughout the various processes at the plant. And finally, the goal of the system is to support paperless shipments of the waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). This paper describes the approach, methodologies, the underlying design of the database, and the challenges of creating the Data Management System (DMS) prior to completion of design and construction of a major plant. The system was built utilizing an Oracle database platform, and Oracle Forms 6 i in client-server mode. The underlying data architecture is container-centric, with separate tables and objects for each type of analysis used to characterize the waste, including real-time radiography (RTR), non-destructive assay (NDA), head-space gas sampling and analysis (HSGS), visual examination (VE) and coring. The use of separate tables facilitated the construction of automatic interfaces with the analysis instruments that enabled direct data capture. Movements are tracked using a location system describing each waste container's current location and a history table tracking the container's movement history. The movement system is designed to interface both with radio-frequency bar-code devices and the plant's integrated control system (ICS). Collections of containers or information, such as batches, were created across the various types of analyses, which enabled a single, cohesive approach to be developed for verification and validation activities. The DMS includes general system functions, including task lists, electronic signature, non-conformance reports and message systems, that cut vertically across the remaining subsystems. Oracle's security features were utilized to ensure that only authorized users were allowed to log in, and to restrict access to system functionality according to user role...|$|E

40|$|Predicting future thaw slump {{activity}} {{requires a}} sound {{understanding of the}} atmospheric drivers and geomorphic controls on mass wasting {{across a range of}} time scales. On sub-seasonal time scales, sparse measurements indicate that mass wasting at active slumps is often limited by the energy available for melting ground ice, but other drivers such as rainfall or the formation of an insulating veneer are also thought important. To study the sub-seasonal drivers, we derive topographic changes from single-pass radar interferometric data acquired by the TanDEM-X satellite (12 m resolution). The high vertical precision (around 30 cm), frequent observations (11 days) and large coverage (5000 km²) allow us to track volume losses as drivers such as the available energy change during summer in two study regions. We find that thaw slumps in the Tuktoyaktuk coastlands, Canada, are not energy limited in June, as they undergo limited mass wasting (height loss of around 0 cm/day) despite the ample available energy, indicating the widespread presence of an insulating snow or debris veneer. Later in summer, height losses generally increase (around 3 cm/day), but they do so in distinct ways. For many slumps, mass <b>wasting</b> <b>tracks</b> the available energy, a temporal pattern that is also observed at coastal yedoma cliffs on the Bykovsky Peninsula, Russia. However, the other two common temporal trajectories are asynchronous with the available energy, as they track strong precipitation events or show a sudden speed-up in late August, respectively. The observed temporal patterns are poorly related to slump characteristics like the slump area. The contrasting temporal behaviour of nearby thaw slumps highlights the importance of complex local and temporally varying controls on mass wasting...|$|R

40|$|Accurate and {{efficient}} management {{of hazardous waste}} {{is not only a}} regulatory requirement but good management practice as well. Local, state, and federal requirements for managing waste include a multitude of reports and paperwork to verify and validate the characterization, location, and status of each waste container.
