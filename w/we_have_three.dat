25|$|Jesus' arrest. Eight statues {{tell the}} story of Jesus' arrest. First, we have a helmeted guard in armour who holds a rope in his hand and to his left is Saint Peter brandishing the sword with which he has cut off Malchus' ear. Then we see Jesus and Judas and at their feet Malchus who has fallen {{backward}} to the ground after being struck by Saint Peter and has dropped the lantern he was carrying. He tries to steady himself by holding on Jesus' arm. Judas stands close to Jesus holding the purse no doubt containing the reward for his treachery. He has either kissed Jesus or is about to do so. Then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> other guards who will make the arrest. The one in the middle holds a sword. Jesus is then led before Caiaphas who is seated and holds a sceptre and wears a crown, symbols of his power.|$|E
500|$|The {{two ships}} met at half past {{five in the}} afternoon, [...] east of the Boston Light, between Cape Ann and Cape Cod. Shannon was flying a weather-worn blue ensign, and her {{dilapidated}} outside appearance after a long period at sea suggested {{that she would be}} an easy opponent. Observing the Chesapeakes many flags, a sailor had questioned Broke: [...] "Mayn't <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> ensigns, sir, like she has?" [...] "No," [...] said Broke, [...] "we've always been an unassuming ship." [...] HMS Shannon refused to fire upon USS Chesapeake as she bore down, nor would USS Chesapeake rake HMS Shannon despite having the weather gage. Lawrence's behaviour that day earned him praise from the British officers for gallantry.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of her birth, it was unknown if she was a male or female, as it was {{considered}} too dangerous to approach her and her parents. [...] Her handlers assumed she was a male and originally named her [...] "Sonny Jim". When it was established that Pattycake was a female, a contest was held by the New York Daily News to find her a name. [...] "Patty Cake", the winning entry, was submitted by New York fireman John O'Connor, who named the gorilla after his wife and a proposed daughter. [...] "It just so happens that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> boys and I told my wife that if we ever have a girl, we should name her Patty, which happens to be her name. I thought we'd let the baby gorilla use the name in the meantime," [...] O'Connor told reporters.|$|E

His message was simple: [...] "The basis for the Ustasha movement is religion. For minorities such as Serbs, Jews, and Gypsies, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> million bullets."

2500|$|So we {{reduce the}} problem to that of tracking, from frame to frame, which {{intervals}} do intersect. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> lists of intervals (one for each axis) and all lists are the same length (since each list has length , the number of bounding boxes.) In each list, each interval is allowed to intersect all other intervals in the list.

2500|$|In four {{dimensions}} the Hodge dual of a bivector is a bivector, {{and the space}} Λ2ℝ4 is dual to itself. Normal vectors are not unique, instead every plane is orthogonal to all the vectors in its Hodge dual space. This {{can be used to}} partition the bivectors into two 'halves', in the following way. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>three</b> pairs of orthogonal bivectors: (e12, e34), (e13, e24) and (e14, e23). There are four distinct ways of picking one bivector from each of the first two pairs, and once these first two are picked their sum yields the third bivector from the other pair. For example, [...] (e12, e13, e14) and (e23, e24, e34).|$|E
2500|$|In 1903, a {{cache of}} gold coins were found in Khirbet Dajun by villagers from Bayt Dajan, who used this site as a quarry. The {{discovery}} prompted R. A. Macalister to visit the site.
