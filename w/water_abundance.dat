Each ChemCam passive sky observation acquires spectra at two different elevation angles.

The retrieval proceeds by first fitting {{the continuum of}} {{the ratio of the}} two elevation angles to solve for aerosol properties, and then fitting the continuum-removed ratio to solve for gas abundances. The final step of the retrieval makes use of the observed CO 2 absorptions and the known CO 2 abundance to correct the retrieved <b>water</b> vapor <b>abundance</b> for the effects of the vertical distribution of scattering aerosols and to derive an aerosol scale height parameter. The ChemCam-retrieved <b>water</b> <b>abundances</b> show, with only a few exceptions, the same seasonal behavior and the same timing of seasonal minima and maxima as the TES, CRISM, and REMS-H data sets that we compare them to. However ChemCam-retrieved <b>water</b> <b>abundances</b> are generally lower than zonal and regional scale from-orbit water vapor data, {{while at the same time}} being significantly larger than pre-dawn REMS-H abundances.

The main aim of this thesis is to reconcile the <b>water</b> vapour <b>abundance</b> results from these two sets of observations reported in previous studies. New radiative transfer and retrieval models have been developed for this purpose based on new correlated-k absorption tables calculated with up-to-date spectral line data. The H 2 SO 4 cloud opacity and scattering properties have been recalculated from new refractive index data using Mie theory. For the first time these two sets of observations have been analysed using the same retrieval tools. From the Pioneer Venus Orbiter Infrared Radiometer observations we report a high <b>abundance</b> of <b>water</b> vapour in the early afternoon at the equatorial cloud-top region and a strong day-night variability in the cloud-top pressure.

40|$|We present deep Herschel-PACS {{spectroscopy}} of far-infrared {{water lines}} from {{a sample of}} four protoplanetary disks around solar-mass stars, selected to have strong water emission at mid-infrared wavelengths. By combining the new Herschel spectra with archival Spitzer-IRS spectroscopy, we retrieve a parameterized radial surface water vapor distribution from 0. 1 - 100 AU using two-dimensional dust and line radiative transfer modeling. The surface water distribution is modeled with a step model comprising of a constant inner and outer relative <b>water</b> <b>abundance</b> and a critical radius at which the surface <b>water</b> <b>abundance</b> is allowed to change. We find that the four disks have critical radii of ∼ 3 - 11 AU, at which the surface <b>water</b> <b>abundance</b> decreases by at least 5 orders of magnitude. The measured values for the critical radius are consistently smaller than {{the location of the}} surface snow line, as predicted by the observed spectral energy distribution. This suggests that the sharp drop-off of the surface <b>water</b> <b>abundance</b> is not solely due to the local gas-solid balance, but may also be driven by the de-activation of gas-phase chemical pathways to water below 300 K. Assuming a canonical gas-to-dust ratio of 100, as well as coupled gas and dust temperatures T_ gas=T_ dust, the best-fit inner water abundances become implausibly high (0. 01 - 1. 0 H_ 2 ^- 1). Conversely, a model in which the gas and dust temperatures are decoupled leads to canonical inner disk water abundances of ∼ 10 ^- 4 H_ 2 ^- 1, while retaining gas-to-dust ratios of 100. That is, the evidence for gas-dust decoupling in disk surfaces is stronger than for enhanced gas-to-dust ratios...|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the resource curse links the abundance of natural resources {{to higher levels of}} conflict occurrence. Until now, most literature merely focuses on non-renewable resources such as diamonds or gold. This paper sheds the light on water as a renewable resource and takes a new perspective arguing that <b>water</b> <b>abundance</b> can also be linked to conflict occurrence. The main argument for water to be a curse is based on the expectation that the commercialization of water resources can lead through the effects of greed or grievances to interstate clashes. The quantitative time-series cross-section analysis focuses on shared water basins and examines their link to low-level militarized interstate disputes (MID). Multivariate logistic regressions, interaction terms and marginal effects show that larger water basins are associated with a lower conflict risk which means that the expectation of a water curse cannot be confirmed. The results for greed and grievance as determinants of conflict show that greed does in fact increase the conflict risk, but the effect is independent from <b>water</b> <b>abundance.</b> In contrast, grievances {{turn out to be a}} conflict-decreasing factor, also when set in relation with <b>water</b> <b>abundance.</b> The results strengthen previous findings suggesting that scarcer water resources are a conflict-contributing factor.

40|$|Aims. Our {{aim is to}} {{determine}} the critical parameters in water chemistry and the contribution of water to the oxygen budget by observing and modelling water gas and ice for a sample of eleven low-mass protostars, for which both forms of water have been observed. Methods. A simplified chemistry network, which is benchmarked against more sophisticated chemical networks, is developed that includes the necessary ingredients {{to determine}} the water vapour and ice abundance profiles in the cold, outer envelope in which the temperature increases towards the protostar. Comparing the results from this chemical network to observations of water emission lines and previously published water ice column densities, allows us to probe the influence of various agents (e. g., far-ultraviolet (FUV) field, initial abundances, timescales, and kinematics). Results. The observed <b>water</b> ice <b>abundances</b> with respect to hydrogen nuclei in our sample are 30 – 80 ppm, and therefore contain only 10 – 30 % of the volatile oxygen budget of 320 ppm. The keys to reproduce this result are a low initial <b>water</b> ice <b>abundance</b> after the pre-collapse phase together with the fact that atomic oxygen cannot freeze-out and form water ice in regions with Tdust ≳ 15 K. This requires short prestellar core lifetimes ≲ 0. 1 Myr. The water vapour profile is shaped through the interplay of FUV photodesorption, photodissociation, and freeze-out. The water vapour line profiles are an invaluable tracer for the FUV photon flux and envelope kinematics. Conclusions. The finding that {{only a fraction of the}} oxygen budget is locked in water ice can be explained either by a short pre-collapse time of ≲ 0. 1 Myr at densities of nH ~ 10 ⁴ cm-³, or by some other process that resets the initial <b>water</b> ice <b>abundance</b> for the post-collapse phase.
