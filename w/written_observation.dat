40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to uncover the {{emergence}} of cultural mathematical understandings and communications in young children's spontaneous pretend play. It is based on Vygotskian cultural-historical perspectives and social-semiotic theory, informed by research into ‘funds of knowledge' and considers how children's informal knowledge of family practices enriches their play and cultural mathematical understandings. Longitudinal, ethnographic data were gathered in an inner-city mainstream nursery in the south-west of England. Data include <b>written</b> <b>observation</b> and graphics of seven children aged three to four years of age engaged in social pretend play. The findings reveal that many play episodes included aspects of mathematics and that these increased through the year: they show how the children's home cultural knowledge underpinned their pretend play and informed their mathematics. The children's graphicacy to communicate mathematics within their pretend play was also evident. The findings show also that where children are immersed in mathematical- and graphical-rich environments, bridging home and early childhood cultures becomes a natural feature of their pretend play. They will add to our understanding of cultural mathematical knowledge in young children...|$|E

40|$|Objective ‐ This study aims {{to assess}} student {{learning}} {{with respect to}} basic database searching at three different points within a required first year course. Methods ‐ Three methods were employed at three different points to identify evidence of successful learning: 1. Analysis of in‐class exercises from the initial library workshop, e. g. how many students showed evidence of satisfactorily achieving the stated learning outcomes. 2. Participant observation of student presentations, noting themes, {{strengths and weaknesses of}} student research strategy; <b>written</b> <b>observation</b> reports from librarians were coded and quantified to identify major themes. 3. Interviews with course instructors responsible for grading the final submitted projects, focusing on both student achievement and instructor perceptions of the impact of library involvement. Results ‐ Though performance on in‐class exercises showed evidence of successful learning in over 70 % of students, observational data indicated that very few students showed evidence of applying new knowledge and new search skills to their own topics two weeks later. Instructor interviews revealed a perception of similar difficulties in final project submissions, and instructors suggested that students did not appreciate the need for library resources. Conclusion ‐ In this study, students showed evidence of learning in a simulated environment, but were unable or unwilling to demonstrate this learning in authentic situations. Multiple assessment methods reveal a lack of student ability to apply search skills...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} {{that would later}} be called the parathyroid gland was first observed around 1850, {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century in which so many new discoveries in anatomy and histology were made [1]. The first description of “a small compact yellow glandular body ” [3] was followed 30 years later by the notion that removal of this structure might be responsible for acute tetany occurring after thyroidectomy. This was the period during which detailed anatomical and histological observations led to increased understanding of bodily functions in health and disease, including that of the parathyroids [2]. The pathologist Jacob Erdheim (1874 – 1937) built on these new discoveries in elucidating through clinical observations as well as experimental studies how parathyroids play a role in calcium metabolism and how their dysfunction leads to serious bone pathology. The story illustrates that scientific discovery is not a linear process: Erdheims understanding of parathyroid function was hampered through his misinterpretation of some of his observations. The first observation and discovery of the parathyroid glands The first <b>written</b> <b>observation</b> of a parathyroid gland was made by Richard Owen (1804 – 1892) in an Indian Rhinoceros with a weight of approximately 5, 000 lbs avoirdupois (± 2, 267 kg).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{travel to}} continental Europe as undertaken by {{several generations of}} Irish Protestants between 1660 and 1727. Historians draw parallels between the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland and other polities in ancien régime Europe, but these demand an exploration of contemporary encounters. Research on the Irish in Europe concentrates on Catholics without much regard to Protestant experiences, while work on English or British travel overlooks ways in which Irish Protestant voyages differed. This thesis analyses the experiences of Church-of-Ireland families from the gentry, nobility and aristocracy, especially the Southwells, Percevals, Molesworths, Molyneuxs, Boyles and Butlers. Correspondence, notebooks and financial accounts reconstruct their voyages, mainly to France, Italy, the Low Countries and Germany, and their attitudes towards the practice of travel. Journeys to other destinations are incorporated, as are the voyages of neighbours, acquaintances and employees. Purposes varied, but travel was consistently considered an opportunity for 'improvement'. The thesis follows the successive preoccupations of travellers, beginning with demonstrations of 'fitness to travel'. Wealthy young men were judged according to criteria that privileged anglicisation and Protestantism, though linguistic skill was a more socially-comprehensive standard. Advisors emphasised civil conversation and <b>written</b> <b>observation,</b> but warnings to avoid 'countrymen' were ignored. The company of English-speaking travellers and Irish Catholic expatriates created distinctive European experiences. Foreign hosts often saw uncomplicated Englishmen, though some recognised Irish difference. Anglican travellers held qualified membership of a 'Protestant international', drawing on a cross-confessional 'stock of friends'. Travellers received tuition that complicates perceptions of travel as 'informal' education and they memorialised experiences through souvenirs and gifts. Voyages encouraged some into English residence and identifications, though others brought improvements home to Ireland. 'Improvement', as it related to wealthy Church-of-Ireland families, functioned not as a binary between approved England and disdained Ireland but a triangular exchange in which continental Europe featured prominently.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have {{observed}} the youngest {{children and their}} use of the physical environment in one kindergarten. The kindergarten is organized with bases, which means that most of the rooms are viewed as common area. By using the term physical environment, I mean the rooms and the material that is intended for the children. My research question in this study is: “How do the youngest children use the physical environment in the kindergarten” The Norwegian kindergarten has in the recent years had a tremendous development and since 2009 all children older than one year has a legal right to attend the kindergarten. This means that a great deal of Norwegian one- and two-year-olds attend the kindergarten. In the period 2004 - 2010 there was a massive development of new kindergartens to secure a place for all children who wanted to attend. Instead of building the traditional kindergarten with separate sections for different age groups, the kindergartens were built with either a base- or zonestructure. This change in the kindergartens physical environment has contributed to curiousness and I want more knowledge on how the youngest children use the physical environment. This is a micro-ethnographic study conducted in a kindergarten with a base structure. I have used <b>written</b> <b>observation</b> and a logbook to observe how the children use the rooms and the play materials that are intended for them, and what activities that occurs in the physical environment. In this study, I have positioned myself within the postmodern paradigm. This means that I am not seeking a universal truth of how the youngest children use the physical environment. But I wish to contribute with reflection and a piece of the puzzle on the topic of how children use the physical environment. I have had a focus on discourses related to views on children and how the physical environment in the kindergarten has changed as a result of changes in how children are viewed. The discourse of the competent child is seen as the current view on children these days and this has had a great impact on how the new kindergartens are built. In the analysis I have thematised my data material in six topics and used different theory on children, rooms and materials to create an image of the children’s use of the physical environment in the kindergarten of my observations.
