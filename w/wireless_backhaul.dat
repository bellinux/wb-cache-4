While such <b>wireless</b> <b>backhauls</b> have been predominantly used in redundant tree and ring topologies in the past, mobile network operators have become increasingly interested in meshed topologies for carrier-grade <b>wireless</b> <b>backhauls.</b> However, <b>wireless</b> mesh <b>backhauls</b> are potentially more susceptible to security vulnerabilities, given that radio links are more exposed to tampering and given their higher system complexity.

40|$|Using tools from {{stochastic}} geometry, {{we develop}} a framework {{to model the}} downlink rate coverage probability of a user in a given small cell network (SCN) with massive MIMO-enabled <b>wireless</b> <b>backhauls.</b> The considered SCN is composed of a mixture of small cells that are configured in either in-band or out-of-band backhaul modes with a certain probability. The performance of the user in the considered hierarchical network is limited by several sources of interference such as the backhaul interference, small cell base station (SBS) -to-SBS interference and the SI. Moreover, due to the channel hardening effect in massive MIMO, the backhaul links experience long term channel effects only, whereas the access links experience both the long term and short term channel effects. Consequently, the developed framework is flexible to characterize different sources of interference while capturing the heterogeneity of the access and backhaul channels. In specific scenarios, the framework enables deriving closed-form coverage probability expressions. Under perfect backhaul coverage, the simplified expressions are utilized to optimize the proportion of in-band and out-of-band small cells in the SCN in closed-form. Finally, few remedial solutions are proposed that can potentially mitigate the backhaul interference and in turn improve the performance of in-band FD <b>wireless</b> <b>backhauling.</b> Numerical results investigate the scenarios in which in-band <b>wireless</b> <b>backhauling</b> is useful and demonstrate that maintaining a correct proportion of in-band and out-of-band FD small cells is crucial in <b>wireless</b> <b>backhauled</b> SCNs.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} three {{scenarios}} of small-cell deployment in a heterogeneous network comprising a macro base station (MBS) {{and a set}} of small cells. The first sce-nario corresponds to wired backhauling and the remaining two scenarios correspond to two different ways of <b>wireless</b> <b>backhauling.</b> In one of the scenarios of <b>wireless</b> <b>backhauling,</b> the backhaul links have to compete with the user links for LTE channel resources (user-band relay scenario). In the other, an additional (mmWave) band is available exclusively for operating the backhaul links (dedicated-band relay scenario). For each of the scenarios, several different configurations based on channel allocation and node capabilities are considered. We formulate an optimization framework to model, dimension and evaluate all of these configurations. For user-band relay scenario, our results show that some configurations offer either negative or negligible throughput gains over the MBS-only case. By noting that any relay deployment’s performance is upper-bounded by wired backhauling with sufficiently large capacity, the results also show that some other configurations offer very good throughput gains, with values very close to the upper-bound. The results highlight the importance of the right choice of configuration to justify the deployment of user-band relay nodes. Further, our results show that, for dedicated-band relay scenario, a small fraction of a typical mmWave bandwidth suffices to yield performance very close to the upper-bound. I...|$|R
