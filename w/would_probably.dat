5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 Capital Program plan, the {{connection}} to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be removed with the elimination of Track 4.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary ancient food experts, noting Strabo's {{commentaries on}} Britain have {{proposed}} that the early Britons <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have clotted cream to preserve its freshness.|$|E
5|$|If magma were to rise {{towards the}} surface of Nazko, new {{earthquake}} swarms would occur, with {{a significant increase in}} the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko area <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be forest fires and, if an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.|$|E

50|$|For treason or theft, the {{punishment}} <b>would</b> most <b>probably</b> be {{being placed in}} a sack of snakes and thrown into a nearby river or lake.|$|R
5|$|Two days later, the Memphis draft board {{announced}} that Presley would be classified 1-A and <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be drafted sometime that year.|$|E
5|$|A {{freelance}} killer <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{not be able}} {{to manufacture}} polonium from commercially available products in the amounts used for Litvinenko's poisoning, because more than microscopic amounts of polonium can only be produced in state-regulated nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|A high {{obliquity}} <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> {{result in}} {{dramatic changes in}} the climate and may destroy the planet's habitability. When the axial tilt of the Earth exceeds 54°, the yearly insolation at the equator is less than that at the poles. The planet could remain at an obliquity of 60° to 90° for periods as long as 10million years.|$|E
50|$|Rick {{married an}} African-American woman and {{produced}} a bi-racial child, Leah. The discrimination the family <b>would</b> have <b>probably</b> experienced in real life though, was not shown.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the show}} was a blockbuster, a second season was not made as Neveneffecten though their {{approach}} <b>would</b> most <b>probably</b> not work anymore as they became famous.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, I {{have always}} {{considered}} it a lucky one, for if it had gone a few inches on one side it <b>would</b> have <b>probably</b> finished me altogether.” ...|$|R
5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were now}} {{led by a}} praefectus (prefect), who could be either a native nobleman, who <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be granted Roman {{citizenship}} for the purpose (e.g. the famous German war leader Arminius gained Roman citizenship probably by serving as an auxiliary prefect before turning against Rome); or a Roman, either of knightly rank, or a senior centurion.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Department for Transport {{predicted}} that, by 2037, annual cross-channel passenger numbers <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> reach 16 million, {{considerably less}} optimistic than London and Continental Railways's original 1996 forecast. In 2007 Eurostar set {{a target of}} carrying 10million passengers by 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Amar {{brothers}} {{noted that}} such a plan could be enacted by the passage of laws in as few as eleven states and <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> not require Congressional approval, though this is not certain (see Debate above).|$|E

5000|$|About {{the failure}} of the song, Busta Rhymes said: [...] "The only thing I <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have changed is I Love My Chick would not have been on that album. I <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have put I Love My Chick on another album {{that it would have been}} more {{appropriate}} for." ...|$|R

5|$|The attack led to {{engineering}} improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremendous forces, improvements which {{were incorporated into}} the design of Oklahoma City's new federal building. The National Geographic Channel documentary series Seconds From Disaster suggested that the Murrah Federal Building <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have survived the blast had it been built according to California's earthquake design codes.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy was}} promulgated by Thomas Jefferson in 1801, in {{reference}} to a 1796 address by George Washington. Despite its enduring influence on U.S. foreign-policy discussions, Washington said privately that the view on which his pronouncements were based <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be irrelevant in 20 years due to a changing geopolitical situation.|$|E
5|$|A further twelve bodies, pending {{refinements}} {{of knowledge}} regarding their physical properties, were possible candidates {{to join the}} list under this definition. Some objects in this second list were more likely eventually to be adopted as 'planets' than others. Despite what had been claimed in the media, the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the definition, and that a complete survey <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> reveal more than 200.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, {{the club}} {{resigned}} to play any competition and announced it <b>would</b> be <b>probably</b> dissolved, but in September 2012 the Spanish Basketball Federation finally invited it to join Liga EBA.|$|R

5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have proven to be unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Blake Heinemann {{created the}} first breed {{standard}} and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, the aims of which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell's original dogs, as Russell <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> have hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club {{and is likely to}} have provided at least some of their original terriers. By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had done}} for other Adventures of Tintin which {{featured}} sea travel, Hergé was careful to obtain as much data about ships as possible {{in order to make}} his portrayals more realistic. The design of the Aurora was based on the RRS William Scoresby, while that of the Peary was most likely based upon another Antarctic ship, the RRS Discovery. The seaplane on which the expedition travels was based on the German Arado 196-A. Hergé nevertheless later criticised his own efforts in this area, saying that if Aurora had been a real ship, it <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> be unseaworthy.|$|E
5000|$|Poughkeepsie Sunday Courier (May 3, 1931): [...] "If {{a certain}} crusading congressman {{could have seen}} last night's {{production}} he <b>would</b> have <b>probably</b> branded the whole company as dangerous, if not Red agitators." ...|$|R

5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; {{although}} the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) {{will cause the}} planets' orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus and Earth <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth will likely be swallowed up {{as a result of}} tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{explains}} that he knew Homer <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> change his mind, and decided to send the letter before that could happen. Homer desperately tries to prevent the letter from reaching Mr. Burns, but fails. Mr. Burns becomes furious and demands that Homer be beaten. However, Smithers calls off the beating {{on the grounds that}} is no way to thank the man who saved Mr. Burns' life, and instead convinces Mr. Burns to instead reward the Simpson family. The Simpsons receive an antique Xtapolapocetl, an Olmec head (a massive, Tiki-god-like affair) that Bart, the blood donor, likes, and which Homer hates.|$|E
5|$|Black women {{played a}} minor role in units {{such as the}} Rhodesia Native Regiment, {{accompanying}} the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated {{the presence of these}} women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take them away from the men <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> lead to mutiny.|$|E

50|$|Kett was now {{left with}} a decision. He <b>would</b> not, <b>probably</b> could not, {{disperse}} the camp, but without access to the markets of Norwich, his people would starve. It was therefore decided to attack Norwich.|$|R
