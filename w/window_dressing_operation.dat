Some researchers and analysts conclude this behavior as what-so-called <b>window</b> <b>dressing,</b> which is a practice to present the report {{in favor of the}} investors’ expectation. This study is intended to examine the existence of such behavior in Indonesia. Some of the signals that aid in proving the existence of <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> are the turn-of-year factor, lagged returns, and fund’s objectives. The result of this study exhibits indications of turn-of-year factor and lagged return inclined to <b>window</b> <b>dressing.</b> This study fails to verify the indications of fund’s objective inclined to <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> because of the changing objectives during the portfolio management.

However, top-ranked funds, including closed-end funds and open-end funds, report an abnormal return at some year-ends. They manipulate the price of their stockholdings upwards with relatively small capital and obtain a higher pre-return {{at the end of}} year. We further analyze the empirical results by relating them to the unusual environment of Chinese stock market. Then we find that the underdevelopment of Chinese securities market; fund companies compensation scheme and lack of related regulation are main reasons for Chinese fund managers <b>window</b> <b>dressing...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Window</b> <b>dressing</b> ” is the {{practice}} by fund managers of adjusting a fund’s portfolio composition immediately before disclosing the holdings {{to the public}} {{at the end of the}} quarter. The common wisdom on the street and in the financial press is that <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> activity has become widespread as investors have become increasingly sophisticated in analyzing fund holdings as well as pastreturnsinaneffort to detect skill. So far there has been little empirical evidence on mutual funds in the academic literature to this effect. We analyze the semi-annual holdings and daily net asset values of 4, 025 U. S. domestic equity mutual funds over the period from 1997 to 2002 and find strong evidence of <b>window</b> <b>dressing.</b> In particular, a substantial fraction of funds report holdings that are very misleading due to <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> activity. We show that growth funds and funds with poor recent performance are more likely to be window dressers. Furthermore, the <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> activity is not associated with trading strategies that on average provide any added value to investors even before accounting for expenses. We find that neither liquidity costs nor momentum trading can explain these findings. ...|$|R

The results depict that the <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> behavior is unpopular among Greek IPO firms. The after-market performance of IPO firms in Greece reveals that issuers use underpricing as a means to signal their quality to the market. In addition, the findings posit that investors do not overreact to past earnings growth and that the <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> assumption is unable to explain the post-issue performance of IPO firms in Greece. Finally, the results indicate that the market exhibits the ability to anticipate intentional income-smoothing behavior and classifies smoothing firms to higher risk classes.

40|$|Similar to equity {{mutual funds}} that {{practice}} <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> by holding winning funds {{at the time of}} disclosure, many industry experts have speculated that bond mutual funds also practice <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> by holding higher quality bonds during the time of disclosure. Despite such speculation, no direct test of <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> behavior in bond mutual funds has been conducted. This paper attempts to fill that void. We examine portfolio credit quality holding and daily return patterns in a large sample of bond mutual funds and document evidence of <b>window</b> <b>dressing.</b> Using portfolio credit quality holdings data, we find that bond funds on average hold significantly more government bonds during disclosure than nondisclosure, presumably to present a safer portfolio to shareholders. We also detect a clientele of bond funds that increase positions in speculative-grade corporate bonds at disclosure, most likely in an attempt to advertise higher yields. Multiple index market models estimated with daily returns data corroborate these findings. We detect differences in factor loadings around disclosure periods that indicate systematic tilting of the portfolio toward one sector of the bond market and away from another. Consistent with our findings with portfolio holdings data, the market models indicate one clientele of funds that tilts toward government bonds and another that tilts toward corporate bonds...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with the reaction of UK investment analysts when confronted with <b>window</b> <b>dressed</b> financial statements {{and its implications for}} stock market information processing and efficiency. Three associated empirical examinations are undertaken. 1) A detailed investigation of the prevalence of <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> in UK company accounts and the nature of such exercises is conducted using a random sample of 100 sets of accounts for large UK corporates. A substantial degree of <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> is identified. The analysis is developedfurther to explore the relationship between extent of <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> and financial position of the firm although the results are ambiguous. 2) To explore the importance of accounting information generally to the investment analysis community, relative to alternative sources, {{and the manner in which}} it is used to drive investment recommendations a detailed content analysis of a large sample of stockbroker circulars is conducted. The results suggest the importance of accounting information for market participants may be conventionally overstated. Nonetheless the statistical findings, although significant, are not very strong which may partially reflect the heterogeneity found in the methods used by different stockbroking firms in appraising shares. Further work is required. 3) The main part of the thesis reports on a laboratory experiment with 63 experienced stockbroking analysts drawn from five of the top City houses. The analysts were required to process company accounts and adjust for <b>window</b> <b>dressed</b> items. We were forced to conclude that, at least at the time, the research took place in early 1990, investment analysts were neither very concerned by nor able or inclined to correct for creative accounting. These findings are discussed in detail and implications for different market theories drawn. The theories conclude that there may well be valid concerns about the conventional role attributed to investment analysts as information intermediaries in maintaining market efficiency, particularly in the processing of and disseminating complex accounting information...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} samples three episodes from {{nineteenth century}} United States history that conveniently illustrate economic {{behavior in the}} arena of banking and finance. The first chapter considers improvements in cross-market arbitrage due to technological change. The completion of the undersea Atlantic telegraph cable in July 1866 more closely integrated securities markets on two continents. Chapter 1 conducts an event study on one security with a dual listing on the New York and London Stock Exchanges using daily data. The event study provides some evidence that the information lag between the two markets shortened from ten days to zero days. We can recover transatlantic steamship crossing times from securities prices. The second chapter investigates bank <b>window</b> <b>dressing.</b> <b>Window</b> <b>dressing</b> is a temporary change in portfolio designed to produce a more appealing report to regulators or to the public. Market observers accused national banks of <b>window</b> <b>dressing</b> after the Civil War. Chapter 2 attempts {{to determine whether or not}} postbellum Philadelphia banks <b>window</b> <b>dressed</b> their balance sheets. A test finds some evidence for <b>window</b> <b>dressing.</b> The third chapter conducts an econometric test of Diamond and Dybvig's (1983) theory of bank runs as interpreted by Calomiris and Gorton (1991). Diamond and Dybvig employ an exogenous liquidity shock to depositors in order to develop a theory of bank runs. Calomiris and Gorton interpret the exogenous liquidity shock as a seasonal withdrawal from the nation's agricultural interior. Chapter 3 reexamines the hypothesis that a seasonal interior reserve drain served as the exogenous liquidity shock before the bank panics of 1873 and 1893 in the United States. Using individual bank level data in New York, this paper tests whether the banks that held most of the deposits from the interior, the "interest-paying" banks, experience reserve drains just before the panic. The evidence reveals that a seasonal interior drain could have triggered the 1873 panic, but that Diamond and Dybvig's model cannot be applied to the bank panic of 1893 without a non-seasonal interpretation of the exogenous liquidity shock...|$|R
