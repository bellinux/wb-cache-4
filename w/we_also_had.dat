He owned a summer house in Marseilles, France, and another house in İskenderun, then in Syria and {{afterwards}} Turkey, and a number of houses in Palestine itself. Most of the time we lived in Jaffa. Our house had about twenty rooms, and we children would go down to swim in the sea. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> stables with Arabian horses, and one of our homes in Ashkelon even had a large swimming pool. I think we must have been the only family in Palestine with a private swimming pool.|$|E

He claimed to have {{engineered}} the pressure cooker bombs with his associates in a flat in central Mumbai. If verified, these allegations could invalidate the previous claims by the ATS that the ISI or the SIMI were involved. Sadiq states in his confession, ‘‘All five of us arranged local first class train passes beforehand. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the local train time table with us {{so that we could}} choose a train as per our convenience. We purchased bags and pressure cookers in Bombay.’’ He also claimed to have misled investigators by blaming the attacks on the Al-Qaeda.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Abby West {{focused on}} Carell's acting, {{explaining}} that [...] "the way that Michael's desire to boast and his healthy fear of offending Jan {{played out on}} Steve Carell's face was fantastic. From his braggadocio {{on the phone with}} Todd Packer (Packer!) to his death march up the stairs to face Jan, it was a thing of beauty." [...] BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl believed that [...] "Back from Vacation" [...] was [...] "one of the two or three best of the season", opining that [...] "simplicity" [...] was the key to the series' success. Dahl continued, [...] "Each episode's premise can be entirely mundane and inconsequential. It will still mine laughs from the situation at hand. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> some nice development in the Jim-Pam-Karen triangle, with Pam giving Jim relationship advice, then bawling her eyes out afterwards. Maybe the best scene in the episode saw Dwight comfort her." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A.|$|E

500|$|Exteriors {{were later}} {{directed}} by Griffith and Welles over two successive weekends, with $279 worth of rented equipment. Griffith and Welles paid {{a group of}} children five cents apiece to run out of a subway tunnel. They were also able to persuade winos to appear as extras for ten cents apiece. [...] "The winos would get together, two or three of them, and buy pints of wine for themselves! <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a couple of the winos act as ramrods—sort of like production assistants—and put them in charge of the other wino extras." [...] Griffith and Welles also persuaded a funeral home to donate a hearse and coffin—with a real corpse inside—for the film shoot. Griffith and Welles were able to use the nearby Southern Pacific Transportation Company yard for an entire evening using two bottles of scotch as persuasion. The scene in which a character portrayed by Robert Coogan is run over by a train was accomplished by persuading the railroad crew to back the locomotive away from the actor. The shot was later printed in reverse. Griffith and Welles spent a total of $1,100 on fifteen minutes worth of exteriors.|$|E
500|$|John [...] "DJ" [...] Desjardin {{served as}} the visual {{supervisor}} for Man of Steel, with Weta Digital, MPC, and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film. Zack Snyder wanted the film to [...] "appear very natural because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team {{had to make it}} as easy as possible for them to do so." [...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to think about what that would mean, since <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So {{for a lot of the}} previs we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel [...] developed for that miniseries, where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense. Unless the action is so over the top, like in the end where Superman is beating up Zod—we had to break it a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{positive}} {{reviews from}} the heavy metal {{press and the}} release of the album Sleep's Holy Mountain (1992) on Earache Records, Sleep's label announced that they would release their follow-up record. Sleep had been touring in Europe with Cathedral and in the United States with Hawkwind in support of Sleep's Holy Mountain when the group felt they had to write new material. The new album {{was going to be an}} hour-long song. This song was written and practiced at sound checks, motel rooms and in friends' houses. Matt Pike said the songwriting process was long and that they were [...] "working on [...] for like four years. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> two other songs that were working on that were really long, too—like 15 and 20 minutes. But we never recorded them." [...] Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was important to the song's creative process: [...] "I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it, and some of the lyrics are about that...The line, 'Drop out of life ,' was kind of a creed at that point." [...] The song was originally known and performed live under the title [...] "Dopesmoker". After their tour, the group began to be interested in a Middle Eastern desert theme which led to Sleep referring to the song as [...] "Jerusalem" [...] during later practice sessions.|$|E

500|$|To {{compete with}} Nintendo, Sega was {{more open to}} new types of games than its rival, but still tightly {{controlled}} the approval process for third-party games and charged high prices for cartridge manufacturing. Technicians from American third-party video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) reverse engineered the Genesis in 1989, following nearly one year of negotiations with Sega in which EA requested a more liberal licensing agreement than was standard in the industry before releasing its games for the system. The clean room reverse engineering was led by Steve Hayes and Jim Nitchals, lasting several months before EA secretly began game development. EA founder Trip Hawkins confronted Nakayama with this information one day prior to the 1990 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), noting that EA {{had the ability to}} run its own licensing program if Sega refused to meet its demands. Sega relented, and the next day EA's upcoming Genesis games were showcased at CES. EA signed what Hawkins described as [...] "a very unusual and much more enlightened license agreement" [...] with Sega in June 1990: [...] "Among other things, we had the right to make as many titles as we wanted. We could approve our own titles... the royalty rates were a lot more reasonable. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> more direct control over manufacturing." [...] After the deal was in place, EA chief creative officer Bing Gordon learned that [...] "we hadn't figured out all the workarounds" [...] and [...] "Sega still had the ability to lock us out," [...] noting [...] "It just would have been a public relations fiasco." [...] EA released its first two Genesis games, Populous and , within the month. The first Genesis version of EA's John Madden Football arrived before the end of 1990, and became what Gordon called a [...] "killer app" [...] for the system. Taking advantage of the licensing agreement, Gordon and EA's vice president of marketing services Nancy Fong created a visual identifier for EA's Genesis cartridges: A yellow stripe on their left side added during manufacturing.|$|E
2500|$|A bronze Roman piece c. 200 BC to 200 AD {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} in the museum – it was {{discovered}} in 1960 and is a rare item that was unearthed after over 1,800 years. Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: [...] "That's all we do! My husband and I have never been on a cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> nutcrackers waiting for us to pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Attiya was 16 years old, {{his family}} immigrated to Jerusalem's Old City, {{to which a}} large number of rabbis from Aleppo had immigrated. Soon after, his father died, leaving an impoverished widow and two orphans. While his mother hired herself out for {{domestic}} work in the homes of wealthy people, young Ezra decided to devote his life to Torah study. He went to learn, pray, and sleep on a bench in a small beth midrash in the Bukharim neighborhood of the New City called Shoshanim LeDavid, covering vast amounts of the Talmud with commentaries and poskim (halakhic decisors). As money was scarce in his household, he sustained himself with a nightly meal of dry pita seasoned with salt. In his old age, he told his students, [...] "When I was young, I studied Torah through hardship. If we were truly fortunate, my mother and I had a whole pita to share. On rare occasions <b>we</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> an egg, which we divided in half. But the hunger did not bother me in the least." ...|$|E

He told Channel 4 in 2000 that the advertisement was [...] "meant to be taking the mickey out of other ads that were on the television at the time", comparing it to coffee advertisements where [...] "they have a drink and go 'oh, whoopy' and flowers bloom," [...] noting that Orange Man decided to [...] "express this in an really OTT fashion". The idea for the advertisement originally started out as a joke, with Robinson recalling [...] "We said how brilliant it would be if you had a drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. <b>We</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened." [...] The idea to use commentators in the advert were taken from another idea they had for another advert, but they decided to mash the two ideas together, a [...] "cardinal sin in adland." [...] One commentary considered the advertisement to be a [...] "riff on the sort of sports commentary Andy Gray with his video tapes and ranty shouting at the time." ...|$|E
