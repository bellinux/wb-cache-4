25|$|Prior to the Taney Court, no {{reported}} decision recorded {{an attempt}} by a party to obtain review {{in a criminal case}} by means of a prerogative writ other than habeas corpus. In Ex parte Gordon (1861), the Court held that it had no power to issue a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> to examine a death sentence issued by an admiralty court for piracy (the Court did possess the power to issue writs of prohibition in civil admiralty cases).|$|E
25|$|In his case, Homer Adolph Plessy v. The State of Louisiana, Plessy's lawyers {{argued that}} the state law which {{required}} East Louisiana Railroad to segregate trains had denied him his rights under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution, which provided for equal treatment under the law. However, the judge presiding over his case, John Howard Ferguson, ruled that Louisiana {{had the right to}} regulate railroad companies while they operated within state boundaries. Plessy was convicted and sentenced to pay a $25 fine. Plessy immediately sought a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the 13th century, the <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> {{were issued}} by the Chancery. However, by the later half of the 16th century, the <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> had become a {{judicial}} writ. That meant that if a party wanted to halt proceedings in another court {{on the grounds that}} the presiding court did not have proper jurisdictional authority, the party would petition the managing courts to do one of the following things: (1) eliminate liability altogether by applying common law, (2) have the case be sued de novo at common law, or (3) secure trial by the common law method of a jury or judicial ruling. Prior to deciding whether or not to grant the writ, the managing court would usually allow for open-court debate between the plaintiff seeking prohibition, the defendant opposing prohibition, and/or the judges themselves. However, <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> could be granted without such debate.|$|R

25|$|On 30 December 1988, the {{applicant}} Fong Thin Choo, {{a director of}} the company, applied to the High Court of Singapore for leave to obtain a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> (now known as a prohibiting order) to prohibit the DG from recovering this sum by deducting it from certain bankers' guarantees that had been lodged with Customs as security. When the Court was hearing the application to grant leave, the State Counsel, relying on section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act, submitted that the court had no jurisdiction to issue an order of prohibition against the Government.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of contract law {{began in the}} Church courts, following Roman law. These courts claimed (with some validity) to enforce all promises made by oath, or by [...] "pledge of faith". The man who pledges his faith, or on his soul, arguably has pawned his soul, and in so doing, has left his salvation to actions of another. Henry II of England asserted his jurisdiction over such cases. Thomas Becket claimed concurrent jurisdiction for the Church. Henry won. From that time onward, the royal court was always at the ready to prohibit ecclesiastical judges from entertaining a breach of faith, unless both parties were clerks (church clerics) or the matter lay {{outside the realm of}} the temporal. The method was to issue a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition,</b> prohibiting the church court from hearing and ruling on the case. The practice developed whereby a contractor would seek relief in a church court and renounce all right to a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition.</b> Sometimes the litigant would not receive the decision he wanted in the ecclesiastic court, and then would renounce his pledge, and seek a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> from the common law court. Bracton explained that it was a terrible sin to seek a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> when one had promised not to seek one. This was a crime that deserved imprisonment. Jurisdiction over such matters, as well as marriages and wills remained contentious in Bracton's day.|$|E

50|$|The <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> {{were the}} main {{means by which the}} {{managing}} common law courts, the King's Bench and Common Pleas, restricted other courts from overstepping their jurisdictional boundaries. The writs originally functioned like administrative orders, though over time they acquired the power <b>of</b> legal commands. <b>Writs</b> could be issued against another court or an individual defendant, somewhat similar to the way an injunction works in courts today. The <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prohibition</b> were primarily used against the ecclesiastical courts. However, they were also used against the equity courts, admiralty courts, and local courts. The highest of the equity courts was the Chancery, but although as a fact of law the Chancery could be prohibited, it rarely, if ever, was.|$|R
50|$|The Circuit Courts are trial courts with {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} cases involving capital offenses and other felonies; land disputes; contested probates of wills; and civil lawsuits in disputes with an amount in controversy over $5,000.

Oaks, in the opinion delivered by the court, held that the order barring the media from using the words [...] "Sugarhouse rapist" [...] or disseminating any information on past convictions of defendant during the pendency of the criminal trial was invalid {{on the ground that}} it was not accompanied by the procedural formalities required for the issuance of such an order.|$|E

25|$|In {{all other}} cases, however, the Court has only appellate jurisdiction, {{including}} {{the ability to}} issue <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> mandamus and <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> to lower courts. It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely; almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal.

2500|$|The {{subpoena}} {{developed as}} a creative writ, the [...] "writ subpoena", from the Court of Chancery. [...] Writs of many kinds formed the essential parts of litigation. [...] The primary function of a writ in the 13th and 14th centuries was to convey the king's commands to his officers and servants. [...] It was irrelevant what the nature of those commands might be. The Register of Writs shows a large variety of writs to be administrative in nature, as opposed to judicial. [...] These former writs acquired the name prerogative writs in the 17th and 18th centuries. [...] Prerogative writs that have survived into modern law are the writ of mandamus and writ of certiorari. The medieval <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibition</b> played {{an important part in}} the conflict between the church and state in England. [...] The writ was also used in the courts of admiralty and local courts. It has survived in relative obscurity in United States law. The writ subpoena began to be attached {{to a wide variety of}} writs in the 14th century. These were an invention of the Court of Equity, which were a part of Chancery. Thus, [...] "subpoena" [...] was a product of the Ecclesiastical Courts in England. [...] The commonest writ from this era was the Praecipe quod reddat ("You are commanded to return [...] "). To these were often added the phrase sub poena ("under penalty").|$|E

25|$|As a result, a two tiered {{legal system}} developed: The Ecclesiastic Courts and the Common Law Courts. Jurisdiction was {{frequently}} blurred. One not receiving a satisfactory result in one court could re-file {{the case in}} another. <b>Writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>Prohibition</b> were frequently issued by Common Law courts to bar filing the case in a Church court. Bracton considered it a sin {{for a person to}} pledge to live by the result of a Common law court, only to file it in a Church court.|$|R

The majority's ruling was flawed, he said, because it would allow the NLRB to avoid judicial review of its orders simply by not filing transcripts. Butler would have refused the writs.|$|R

25|$|In Bracton's time, the {{question}} frequently arose about land held in frankalmoign (land {{donated to the}} Church).

The question was that of lay fee, which was the equivalent of secular lands, even though it may have been held in free, pure and perpetual alms. Bracton posited that land which is sacred (housing Churches and the like) was within the jurisdiction of the Church. To this could be added lands donated {{in the form of a}} dower. A glance of the plea rolls demonstrates them to be covered with <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>prohibitions</b> directed at ecclesiastical judges in a continuous battle over jurisdiction of Church lands.|$|R
