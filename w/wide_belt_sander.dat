40|$|Abstract — Facility {{planning}} {{is concerned with}} the design, layout, and accommodation of people, machines and activities of a system or enterprise within a physical spatial environment. Facility {{planning is}} very important in a manufacturing process due to their effect in achieving an efficient product flow. It is estimated that between 20 %- 50 % of the total costs in manufacturing is related to material handling. This cost can be reduced until 30 % through an effective facility planning. Proper analysis of facility layout design could improve the performance of production line such as decrease bottleneck rate, minimize material handling cost, reduces idle time, raise the efficiency and utilization of labour, equipment and space. Many researches have been done in finding optimum facility design. Heuristic methods for layout optimization are Tabu Search (TS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Beside the heuristic methods, simulation technique is also recommended in optimizing of facility design. The present study is aims to develop new methodology for optimum facility layout in SME (Small Medium Enterprise) using combination of location mathematical model and simulation technique. The industrial case study in this analysis focused on the new facility investment in the existing layout. A job shop manufacturing company intends to add one type of new facilities WBS (<b>Wide</b> <b>Belt</b> <b>Sander)</b> machine. This new facilities would be added to the current job shop production layout. The new methodology used to find the optimum coordinates location, optimu...|$|E
50|$|In woodworking, <b>wide</b> <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> use platens {{to press}} the sanding paper {{into contact with the}} wood being sanded. The platen sits between two steel rolls which deliver the moving force to the sanding belt. Sanding heads with a platen are used on finish sanding with papers of finer grits, when the coarser ones are {{typically}} used with contact drum type sanding heads. Stock is fed {{into and out of the}} machine on a conveyor belt. Since the abrasive belt creates a substantial pressure on the stock that tends to push the stock toward the infeed, the hold down shoes and rollers hold the workpiece down against the belt while it is moving through the machine in order to ensure uniform contact with the abrasive and continuous movement.|$|R
50|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>sander</b> is a sander used {{in shaping}} and {{finishing}} wood and other materials. It {{consists of an}} electric motor that turns a pair of drums on which a continuous loop of sandpaper is mounted. <b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> may be handheld and moved over the material, or stationary (fixed), where the material is moved to the sanding <b>belt.</b> Stationary <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are sometimes mounted on a work bench, in which case they are called bench <b>sanders.</b> Stationary <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are often combined with a disc sander.|$|R

50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{can vary}} {{in size from}} the small {{handheld}} unit shown in the illustration to units wide enough to sand a full 1.2 by 2.5 m (4-by-8 foot sheet) of plywood in a manufacturing plant. Some <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> can be as large as 1.2 × 0.7 m.Sanding wood produces {{a large amount of}} sawdust. Therefore, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> employed in woodworking are usually equipped with some type of dust collection system. It may be as simple as a cloth filter bag attached to a portable sander or a large vacuum system to suck dust particles away into a central collector.|$|R
50|$|Stationary <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{are used}} for {{removing}} non-ferrous metals, such as aluminum. Non-ferrous metals tend to clog grinding wheels, quickly making them useless for grinding soft metals. Because the small grooves in the sandpaper are opened up as they go around the arc of the drive wheel, <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are less prone to clogging.|$|R
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{can have}} a very {{aggressive}} action on wood and are normally used only for the beginning stages of the sanding process, or used to rapidly remove material. Sometimes they are also used for removing paints or finishes from wood. Fitted with fine grit sand paper, a <b>belt</b> <b>sander</b> {{can be used to}} achieve a completely smooth surface.|$|R

5000|$|Belt-sander {{racing is}} the {{practice}} of racing <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> competitively. <b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> {{were one of the}} first power tools used in the growing field of power tool drag racing wherein a pair of stock or modified <b>belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are placed in parallel wooden channels and fitted with long extension cords.

Both stock sanders and modified sanders race down a [...] long track. Sanders of all shapes and sizes can go very fast, or very slow depending on the power of the motor. The fastest time on a 75-foot track was 2.2103 seconds recorded by Dudley Harper's Sudden Death Racer of San Marcos, Texas. Sudden Death raced on that date at the Legends Raceway in Rockport, Texas.

50|$|All modern sanding {{projects}} are completed with specialized sanding machines. The majority of material is removed by large 220 volt <b>belt</b> or drum <b>sander.</b> <b>Belt</b> <b>sanders</b> are preferred for the continuous sand paper belt design to prevent sanding machine marks in floors.

The remaining 10% left such as edges, corners, under cabinets, and stairs, are sanded by an edge sanding machine. A finishing machine known as a multi disc sander or buffer is then used for the final sanding steps.|$|R

40|$|Model-based {{analysis}} and inversion of thermography data relies on knowledge of thermal diffusivities. Through-thickness diffusivity is readily measured using the flash method [1]. In composite materials, lateral diffusivities may be drastically {{different from the}} through-thickness values, {{but there is no}} comparable simple and standard approach for measuring those lateral thermal diffusivities. Welch, Heath, and Winfree [2] proposed a technique based on laser line pulse excitation, but that approach requires a reasonably powerful laser and thermal camera with the concomitant costs and safety requirements. In this presentation, we show a simple and low cost (but not entirely nondestructive) system and method for in-plane thermal diffusivity measurement for composites. It is conceptually similar to the flash method but uses a mechanical heat source (<b>belt</b> <b>sander)</b> rather than a flash and multiple layers of the specimen are laminated together and encased in insulating foam. A thermistor measures the temperature and embedded software performs a curve-fitting (thermographic signal reconstruction) process to measure the inflection point of the temperature-time curve [3] and therefore the thermal diffusivity. The device is built from open source hardware and software, with a materials cost well under $ 200 (not including the <b>belt</b> <b>sander)</b> ...|$|R
