5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed <b>Waterhouse</b> manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. <b>Waterhouse</b> decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing <b>Waterhouse</b> into the water and righting the yawl. <b>Waterhouse</b> climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time <b>Waterhouse</b> surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but <b>Waterhouse</b> had already gone under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, {{claiming}} that he owed US$32,000,000.

In 1978, after he fired Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price <b>Waterhouse.</b> To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped. While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied), due to penalties and interests, the debt increased {{by the end of}} the decade.|$|E
