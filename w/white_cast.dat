The film's cast was rounded out with {{respected}} talent {{of the era}} in Gilbert Roland, Joanne Dru and Jim Backus. His collaboration with Walter Mirisch on the black and <b>white</b> <b>Cast</b> a Long Shadow included an uncredited stint as co-producer. The film co-starred Terry Moore. His performance in No Name on the Bullet was well received. The storyline follows the cool, jaded hired gun as the townspeople are gripped with fear by his presence.|$|E
5|$|White {{received}} his early {{education in the}} public schools of Romney, and attended Romney's Potomac Academy. At the age of 16, he began his career in public service serving as the Deputy Clerk of Court in the office of his father, Christian Streit White, who was then serving as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County. In 1894, White graduated from Potomac Academy at the age of 18. Two years later, he began studying jurisprudence at the West Virginia University College of Law in Morgantown. He graduated from the West Virginia University College of Law in 1899, earning a Bachelor of Laws degree. <b>White</b> <b>cast</b> his first vote for Democratic Party presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan in the United States presidential election of 1900.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} {{challenged}} for {{its lack of}} non-white characters. Reverend Wil Gafney, associate professor of Hebrew and Old Testament at the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, sees the film as {{a throwback to the}} Hollywood era of all <b>white</b> <b>casts</b> and considers it worrisome in today's more multi-ethnic America. She goes on to state that [...] "The Bible is the most multicultural piece of literature that most people will ever read. So a film about the Bible should reflect that diversity." ...|$|R
25|$|Tolerance as an {{important}} theme in musicals has continued in recent decades. The final expression of West Side Story left a message of racial tolerance. By {{the end of the}} 1960s, musicals became racially integrated, with black and <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> members even covering each other's roles, as they did in Hair. Homosexuality has also been explored in musicals, starting with Hair, and even more overtly in La Cage aux Folles, Falsettos, Rent, Hedwig and the Angry Inch and other shows in recent decades. Parade is a sensitive exploration of both anti-Semitism and historical American racism, and Ragtime similarly explores the experience of immigrants and minorities in America.|$|E
500|$|... "White" [...] {{cast irons}} contain their carbon {{in the form}} of cementite, or iron carbide (Fe3C). This hard, brittle {{compound}} dominates the mechanical properties of <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron-carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723Â°C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and ferrite, which is soft and malleable and is called pearlite for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle martensite. The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite. The end product below 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-ferrite mixture, and that above 0.8% carbon content is a pearlite-cementite mixture.|$|E
500|$|He {{featured}} in three westerns in 1959: he starred opposite Sandra Dee in The Wild and the Innocent, collaborated as an uncredited co-producer with Walter Mirisch {{on the black}} and <b>white</b> <b>Cast</b> a Long Shadow, and performed as a hired killer in No Name on the Bullet, a film that was well received by critics. Thelma Ritter was his costar in the 1960 Startime television episode [...] "The Man".|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} a {{stereotyping}} of minorities and people of colour in the horror genre, especially within American films. Throughout {{the history of the}} genre there has a devaluing of the roles of minorities within such films, and according to one critic [...] "a use of aspects from their culture as fodder for the plot". These films tend to have a predominately <b>white</b> <b>casts</b> and audience, and cast minorities as violent, and as monsters and villains. The horror genre in particular holds the power to play with aspects of violence in intriguing and symbolic ways.|$|R
50|$|Whitewashing is {{a casting}} {{practice}} in the film industry of the United States in which <b>white</b> actors are <b>cast</b> in historically non-white character roles.

500|$|Fuller readily agreed, having focused {{much of his}} {{own career}} on racial issues. Already {{familiar}} with the novel and {{with the concept of}} [...] "white dogs," [...] he was tasked with [...] "reconceptualizing" [...] the film to have the conflict depicted in the book occur within the dog rather than the people. In an earlier Variety magazine interview, Fuller stated that viewers would [...] "see a dog slowly go insane and then come back to sanity." [...] Before filming began, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Black Anti-Defamation Coalition (BADC), and other civil-rights leaders began voicing concerns that the film would spur racial violence. In an editorial in the Los Angeles Times, Robert Price, executive director of the BADC, criticized the studio for producing the film based on a book by a white man and using a primarily <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> and crew, rather than producing the film with African Americans in key positions. He also considered Gary's work to be a [...] "second-rate novel" [...] and questioned its use when [...] "bookshelves are laden with quality novels by black writers who explore the same social and psychological areas with far more subtlety?" ...|$|E
500|$|While in prison, Cox mailed several {{letters to}} the St. Petersburg Times in 2008 in which he accused {{politician}} Kevin White of taking bribes from him during Cox's criminal career. He claims he made payoffs to White, an ultimately successful candidate for the Tampa City Council, in 2002 and 2003. Cox said White {{told him he could}} not receive the money directly, and suggested that Cox have friends donate $500 each, and then reimburse them. Records and statements from those who donated show that Cox did in fact make numerous contributions to White's campaign, and reimbursed others who did so as well. White, he claims, agreed to vote to rezone vacant properties in Tampa and Ybor City. When Cox was first arrested, the FBI talked to him about White, whom they were also investigating, and he told them the same information. He claimed to have paid him $7,000 in cash in addition to the recorded contributions he arranged. When White and a fellow City Council member were told Cox's contributions might have been illegal in 2004, his colleague told the police, while White kept silent. White has denied that he knew these contributions were reimbursed, and called Cox's accusations [...] "the jailhouse ramblings of a reputed con man." [...] White said he befriended Cox when he came to believe the con man was interested in revitalizing Tampa Heights. Cox had fled the Tampa area before <b>White</b> <b>cast</b> any rezoning votes, so there is no voting record which could help confirm the validity of his accusations. In 2012, White, who had gone on to serve as Hillsborough County Commissioner, was convicted of unrelated federal bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to three years in federal prison.|$|E
2500|$|Vang {{argued that}} the use of the Hmong people did not seem {{relevant}} to the overall plot. He said [...] "there is no real reason for us to be Hmong in the script" [...] and that even though Walt Kowalski had fought in Korea, he had still confused the Hmong with Koreans and other Asian ethnic groups.s Hmong Lead Bee Vang on Film, Race and Masculinity Conversations with Louisa Schein, Spring, 2010." [...] p. 6. In a 2011 program Vang said that Hmong actors were treated unfairly on the set, and that Eastwood did not give tips on how to build the characters. Vang also said that other <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> members made Hmong actors feel excluded. Vang said that some important lines that the Hmong characters said in the Hmong language were not subtitled, so audiences developed a skewed perception of the Hmong people.|$|E

2500|$|Given {{the recent}} {{popularity}} of injecting characters of color into popular comic titles, a new concern has arisen regarding possible tokenism, and many writers advocate {{not just the}} inclusion of characters of color into predominantly <b>White</b> <b>casts</b> of characters, but that these minority characters defy the racial and ethnic stereotypes so prevalent {{in the history of}} comics, as well as maintaining the high standard of comic book writing. Daley Osiyemi, creator of Brodie's Law and co-founder of Pulp Theatre Entertainment said, [...] "...we don't just want black characters or superheroes in comics as mere tokens, they have to be strong characters in their own right and have strong stories built around them." ...|$|R

2500|$|Rathbone {{was also}} one to dismiss the {{complaints}} {{in an interview with}} MTV, saying, [...] "I think it's {{one of those things where}} I pull my hair up, shave the sides, and I definitely need a tan. It's one of those things where, hopefully, the audience will suspend disbelief a little bit." [...] The controversy was poorly received by critics as well. Film critic Roger Ebert was one of the critical voices against the casting. When asked about casting a <b>white</b> <b>cast</b> to portray the characters, he said, [...] "The original series Avatar: The Last Airbender was highly regarded and popular for three seasons on Nickelodeon. Its fans take it for granted that its heroes are Asian. Why would Paramount and Shyamalan go out of their way to offend these fans? There are many young Asian actors capable of playing the parts." [...] Jevon Phillips of the Los Angeles Times noted that despite Shyamalan's attempts to defuse the situation, [...] "this is definitely not an issue that will fade away or be overlooked" [...] and that this film exemplifies the need for a debate within Hollywood about racial diversity in its films.|$|E
