5|$|When {{appealing}} the District Court's decision, {{the government}} did not argue that there <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> suspicion. Instead, the government argued that the border search doctrine supported both the initial search and the transportation of the laptop to Tucson for examination.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a {{concurrence}} that {{agreed with}} {{the finding that the}} state court's decision <b>was</b> <b>reasonable.</b> However, O'Connor held that there could be cases in which age would be relevant to custody analysis. This would be affirmed by the Court in 2011 in J.D.B. v. North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the {{character}}s. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were more appropriate for an early first-season episode, not being as pertinent or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E

5000|$|Ignore the issue.

5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the deregistration order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative law does not recognize proportionality as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|The emperor was the {{ultimate}} authority in policy- and decision-making, {{but in the early}} Principate he was expected to be accessible to individuals from all walks of life, and to deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually. The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen. After Nero, the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor's council (consilium) became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater transparency. Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions {{until the end of the}} Antonine dynasty, equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium. The women of the emperor's family often intervened directly in his decisions. Plotina exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian. Her influence was advertised by having her letters on official matters published, as a sign that the emperor <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> in his exercise of authority and listened to his people.|$|E

5000|$|... "Fear {{of serious}} injury cannot alone justify {{suppression}} {{of free speech}} and assembly. Men feared witches and burnt women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears. To justify suppression of free speech, there must <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> ground to fear that serious evil will result if free speech is practiced. There must <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> ground {{to believe that the}} danger apprehended is imminent. There must <b>be</b> <b>reasonable</b> ground to believe that the evil to be prevented is a serious one." [...] Justice Louis Brandeis in the Whitney opinion.|$|R
5|$|The game's {{campaign}} received mixed impressions from reviewers. USgamer editor Jaz Rignall {{thought it}} was great for teaching the mechanics of the game and the progression of difficulty <b>was</b> <b>reasonable.</b> GameSpot reviewer Kallie Plagge thought the highest points of the campaign missions were the sequences that borrowed elements from the main Halo games. Brown stated that while the campaign was brief, he felt it had good pacing and there was a decent variety of objectives and scenarios. Stapleton agreed that the campaign missions offered enough variety to prevent them from becoming repetitive. However, overall he was unimpressed by the campaign missions, which he perceived as unambitious in their design. He was also surprised by the frequent bugs, which included crashing and mission events failing to trigger, that he experienced during his playthrough of the campaign on the Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|The main {{threat to}} {{crocodilians}} {{around the world}} is human activity, including hunting and habitat destruction. Early in the 1970s, more than 2 million wild crocodilian skins of a variety of species had been traded, driving down the majority of crocodilian populations, in some cases almost to extinction. Starting in 1973, CITES attempted to prevent trade in body parts of endangered animals, such as the skins of crocodiles. This proved to be problematic in the 1980s, as crocodiles were abundant and dangerous to humans in some parts of Africa, and it was legal to hunt them. At the Conference of the Parties in Botswana in 1983, it was argued on behalf of aggrieved local people that it <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> to sell the lawfully hunted skins. In the late 1970s, crocodiles began to be farmed in different countries, started from eggs taken from the wild. By the 1980s, farmed crocodile skins were produced in sufficient numbers to destroy the unlawful trade in wild crocodilians. By 2000, skins from twelve crocodilian species, whether harvested lawfully in the wild or farmed, were traded by thirty countries, and the unlawful trade in the products had almost vanished.|$|E

The province's Criminal Justice Branch decided in December 2008 not to charge the officers, saying their use of force <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> in the circumstances, but Peck said the inquiry unearthed new evidence and he recommended that {{the decision not to}} lay charges should be revisited.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 case Christian Legal Society v. Martinez, the Court {{held that}} a public law college's policy {{requiring}} that all student organizations allow any student to join was constitutional. The Christian Legal Society wanted an exemption from the policy because the organization barred students based on religion and sexual orientation. Hastings College of Law refused to grant the exemption. The Court found that Hastings' policy <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> and viewpoint neutral. Kennedy wrote a concurrence joining the majority.|$|E
25|$|Smiley v. Citibank, (517 U.S. 735), is a 1996 U.S. Supreme Court {{decision}} upholding {{a regulation}} of the Comptroller of Currency which included credit card late fees and other penalties within the definition of interest and thus prevented individual states from limiting them when charged by nationally-chartered banks. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for a unanimous court that the regulation <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> enough under the Court's own Chevron standard for the justices to defer to the Comptroller.|$|E

Washington had wanted to test the abilities of Lee's troops, since they {{were among the first to}} be trained in European tactics by Baron von Steuben.|$|E
25|$|The {{legions of}} Syria, however, had proclaimed Pescennius Niger emperor. At the same time, Severus felt it <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> to offer Clodius Albinus, the {{powerful}} governor of Britannia who had probably supported Didius against him, {{the rank of}} Caesar, which implied some claim to succession. With his rearguard safe, {{he moved to the}} East and crushed Niger's forces at the Battle of Issus.

25|$|The {{following}} year, 1987, the Supreme Court {{had first}} {{dealt with the}} Fourth Amendment rights of government employees under administrative investigation in O'Connor v. Ortega, a case arising from the search of a supervising physician's office and records at a California public hospital. By a 5-4 margin the court had ruled that while public employees had Fourth Amendment protections, the search <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> and constitutional and that other such warrantless searches of public employees' belongings or workspace, where applicable, were similarly permissible {{as long as they}} were reasonably work-related in inception and scope.|$|E

25|$|With the {{widespread}} introduction of superchargers to the aviation industry {{in order to}} improve altitude performance, Fedden felt it <b>was</b> <b>reasonable</b> to use a small amount of boost at all times {{in order to improve}} performance of an otherwise smaller engine. Instead of designing an entirely new block, the existing Jupiter parts were re-used with the stroke reduced by one inch (25mm). The smaller capacity engine was then boosted back to Jupiter power levels, while running at higher rpm and thus requiring a reduction gear for the propeller. The same techniques were applied to the original Jupiter-sized engine to produce the Pegasus.|$|E
25|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss an {{action on the}} ground of FNC. Invoking this doctrine usually means that the plaintiff properly invoked the jurisdiction of the court, but it is inconvenient for the court and the defendant to have a trial in the original jurisdiction. The court must balance convenience against the plaintiff’s choice of forum. In other words, if the plaintiff’s choice of forum <b>was</b> <b>reasonable,</b> the defendant must show a compelling reason to change jurisdiction. If a transfer would simply shift the inconvenience from one party to the other, the plaintiff’s choice of forum should not be disturbed.|$|E
25|$|Justice White concurred in the judgment. He {{believed}} {{that in this}} case, the search and seizure {{was consistent with the}} Fourth Amendment.

He stated that the exclusion of the evidence would have set the criminals free and it would not have served “any constitutional interest in securing compliance with the important requirements of the Fourth Amendment.” Justice White does not believe that the exclusionary rule should be used in any case where law enforcement officials reasonably believe their actions are consistent with the Fourth Amendment.|$|E
