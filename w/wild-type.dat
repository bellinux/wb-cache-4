To detect early signs of tau aggregate-associated changes, we investigated behavioral alterations and cognitive deficits in such mice using an amygdala-specific test battery for anxiety-related and cognitive behavior. P 301 L mice had anxiety levels not different from <b>wild-types,</b> but their exploratory behavior was significantly increased. Acquisition of a fear response to tone and context as well as taste aversion was comparable to <b>wild-types.</b> However, extinction of a conditioned taste aversion was significantly accelerated.

40|$|SummaryWhile {{firing rate}} is well {{established}} as a relevant parameter for encoding information exchanged between neurons, the significance of other parameters is more conjectural. Here, we show that regularity of neuronal spike activities affects sensorimotor processing in tottering mutants, which suffer from a mutation in P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels. While the modulation amplitude of the simple spike firing rate of their floccular Purkinje cells during optokinetic stimulation is indistinguishable from that of <b>wild-types,</b> the regularity of their firing is markedly disrupted. The gain and phase values of tottering’s compensatory eye movements are indistinguishable from those of flocculectomized <b>wild-types</b> or from totterings with the flocculus treated with P/Q-type calcium channel blockers. Moreover, normal eye movements can be evoked in tottering when the flocculus is electrically stimulated with regular spike trains mimicking the firing pattern of normal simple spikes. This study demonstrates the importance of regularity of firing in Purkinje cells for neuronal information processing...|$|R

Maize (Zea mays L.) {{has at least}} two putative UDPGDH genes (A and B), according to sequence similarity to a soya bean UDPGDH gene. The predicted maize amino acid sequences have 95 % similarity to that of soya bean. Maize mutants with a Mu-element insertion in UDPGDH-A or UDPGDH-B were isolated (udpgdh-A 1 and udpgdh-B 1 respectively) and studied for changes in wall polysaccharide biosynthesis. The udpgdh-A 1 and udpgdh-B 1 homozygotes showed no visible phenotype but exhibited 90 and 60 – 70 % less UDPGDH activity respectively than <b>wild-types</b> in a radiochemical assay with 30  μM UDP-glucose. Ethanol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity varied independently of UDPGDH activity, supporting the hypothesis that ADH and UDPGDH activities are due to different enzymes in maize. When extracts from <b>wild-types</b> and udpgdh-A 1 homozygotes were assayed with increasing concentrations of UDP-Glc, at least two isoforms of UDPGDH were detected, having Km values of approx.   380 and 950  μM for UDP-Glc. Leaf and stem non-cellulosic polysaccharides had lower Ara/Gal and Xyl/Gal ratios in udpgdh-A 1 homozygotes than in <b>wild-types,</b> whereas udpgdh-B 1 homozygotes exhibited more variability among individual plants, suggesting that UDPGDH-A activity has a more important role than UDPGDH-B in UDP-GlcA synthesis. The fact that mutation of a UDPGDH gene interferes with polysaccharide synthesis suggests a greater importance for the sugar nucleotide oxidation pathway than for the myo-inositol pathway in UDP-GlcA biosynthesis during post-germinative growth of maize...|$|R

In a study using 32 lung cancer tissues, all tumor samples expressed MET with no significant MET staining in corresponding normal lung tissues, and 61 % (14 of 23) of NSCLC showed strong MET expression examined by IHC.

Furthermore, a leu and a glu marker were found in the two other groups of deletion mutants. From B. licheniformis ~ 1026, derived from strain ATCC~~~~A, 36 single site mutants were obtained and classified into eight groups, chlA to H, by transformation and phage SPI~-mediated transduction. The glu deletion comprises the mutations chl A and B. In total, 13 chl mutations have been found and there may be up to 13 chl genes. Of the single-site chl mutations, only chl E is linked with a known reference marker, ura- 1. All chl mutants are unable to form nitrate reductase under conditions of oxygen shortage. This nitrate reductase is mainly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. Most mutations have pleiotropic effects: (i) retarded growth under anaerobic conditions; (ii) an increased sensitivity to penicillin and related antibiotics; (iii) completely altered membrane protein patterns on acrylamide-SDS gels. In the <b>wild-types,</b> 11 membrane protein bands are observed. There are only small, quantitative differences between membrane protein patterns of cells cultivated aerobically or anaerobically.

We used a prospective population-based cohort study {{to estimate the}} prevalence of elevated iron indices and hemochromatosis-related morbidity for compound heterozygotes. In all, 31, 192 subjects of northern European descent were genotyped for HFE C 282 Y and H 63 D. An HFE-genotype stratified random sample of 1, 438 subjects, followed {{for an average of}} 12 years to a mean age of 65 years, completed questionnaires and gave blood. Clinical examinations were blinded to HFE genotype. A total of 180 (84 males) clinically examined C 282 Y/H 63 D participants were compared with 330 (149 males) controls with neither HFE mutation; 132 (65 males) and 270 (122 males), respectively, had serum iron measures at both timepoints. Mean serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) were significantly greater for male and female compound heterozygotes than for <b>wild-types</b> at baseline and follow-up (all P < 0. 02) except for females who were premenopausal at baseline, where SF was similar in both genotype groups. For subjects with serum measures from both baseline and follow-up, mean SF and TS levels did not change significantly for men or for postmenopausal women, but for premenopausal women SF levels increased from 43 to 109 μg/L for compound heterozygotes and from 35 to 64 μg/L for <b>wild-types</b> (both P < 0. 001). Male and female compound heterozygotes had a similar prevalence of hemochromatosis-related morbidity to <b>wild-types.</b> One of 82 males and zero of 95 females had documented iron overload-related disease.

DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study. Two outpatient fertility clinics and nine midwifery practices in The Netherlands. PATIENT(S) : One hundred thirteen fertile and 77 subfertile males. Daily capsules of folic acid (5 mg) and/or zinc sulfate (66 mg), or placebo for 26 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) : Prevalence of C 677 T MTHFR polymorphism and the response of sperm concentration related to MTHFR carriership after intervention treatment.

25|$|A {{good example}} of this contradiction {{can be seen in the}} {{literature}} regarding the R192Q mutation. The first investigation of this mutation, using the rabbit isoform of the channel expressed in oocytes, found that it did not alter any measured channel properties. A subsequent report, using human channels expressed in HEK293 Cells, found a small hyperpolarizing shift in the midpoint for activation, a result common among FHM1 mutants. This shift results in channels that open at more negative potentials and, thus, have a higher open probability than <b>wild-type</b> channels at most potentials. This report also found that the R192Q mutant produced almost twice as much whole-cell current compared to <b>wild-type</b> channels. This is not due to a change in single channel conductance but to an equivalent increase in channel density. A subsequent group noticed that this mutation is in a region important for modulation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). GPCR activation leads to inhibition of <b>wild-type</b> CaV2.1 currents. R192Q mutant channel currents are also decreased by GPCR activation, but by a smaller amount. A more recent group has confirmed some of these results by creating a R192Q knock-in mouse. They confirmed that the R192Q mutant activates at more negative potentials and that neurons producing these channels have much larger whole-cell current. This resulted in a much larger quantal content (the number of neurotransmitter packets released per action potential) and generally enhanced neurotransmitter release in R192Q expressing neurons versus <b>wild-type.</b> Consequently, these mutant mice were more susceptible to cortical-spreading-depression than their <b>wild-type</b> counterparts. The most recent experiments on this mutant, however, have contradicted some of these results. In CaV2.1 knockout neurons transfected with human channels, P/Q-type currents from mutant channels are actually smaller than their <b>wild-type</b> counterpart. They also found a significant decrease in calcium influx during depolarization, leading to decreased quantal content, in mutant versus <b>wild-type</b> expressing neurons. Neurons expressing mutant channels were also less able to mediate inhibitory input and have smaller inhibitory postsynaptic currents through P/Q-type channels. Further testing with this and other mutants is required to determine their end affect on human physiology.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of these}} mutant {{channels}} have been expressed in {{dorsal root ganglion}} (DRG) or sympathetic neurons. In DRG neurons expressing the F1449V mutation, a lower threshold is required for action potential creation (93.1 ± 12.0 pA) than those expressing <b>wild-type</b> channels (124.1 ± 7.4 pA). Furthermore, while DRG neurons expressing <b>wild-type</b> channels only respond with a few action potentials, those expressing F1449V channels respond with a high-frequency train of action potentials. There is a similar effect in DRG neurons expressing the L858H and A863P mutants. Here, {{there is also a}} notable change in resting membrane potential, being depolarized by 4-7 mV versus <b>wild-type</b> channel expressing cells. The situation is different, however, in sympathetic neurons expressing the L858H mutation. While L858H expressing sympathetic ganglion are depolarized ~5mV relative to <b>wild-type</b> expressing neurons, their threshold for action potential initiation is notably higher. Furthermore, while current injection of 40pA for 950ms provokes an average of 6 action potentials in sympathetic neurons expressing <b>wild-type</b> channels this stimulation evokes only approximately 2 action potentials with reduced overshoots in sympathetic neurons expressing L858H mutant channels. Further investigation has demonstrated that the differences in response between DRG and sympathetic neurons is due to expression of NaV1.8 in the former. Consequently, expression of NaV1.8 channels in sympathetic neurons also expressing L858H mutant NaV1.7 results in neurons with a depolarized resting membrane potential that nevertheless have a normal action potential threshold and overshoot.|$|E

The mutation also results in greatly decreased sensitivity in the receptor for activation by GABA. This combination of mutant containing receptors also activates far more slowly than <b>wild-type</b> containing receptors.

C 57 BL/ 6 J mice lacking Period 1 (Per 1 ⁻/⁻) are an anomaly because their SCN molecular rhythm is weak or absent in vitro {{even though their}} locomotor activity rhythm is robust. To resolve the contradiction between the in vitro and in vivo circadian phenotypes of Per 1 ⁻/⁻ mice, we measured the multi-unit activity (MUA) rhythm of the SCN neuronal population in freely-behaving mice. We found that in vivo Per 1 ⁻/⁻ SCN have high-amplitude MUA rhythms, demonstrating that the ensemble of neurons is driving robust locomotor activity in Per 1 ⁻/⁻ mice. Since the Per 1 ⁻/⁻ SCN electrical activity rhythm is indistinguishable from <b>wild-types,</b> in vivo physiological factors or coupling of the SCN to a known or unidentified circadian clock(s) may compensate for weak endogenous molecular rhythms in Per 1 ⁻/⁻ SCN. Consistent with the behavioral light responsiveness of Per 1 ⁻/⁻ mice, in vivo MUA rhythms in Per 1 ⁻/⁻ SCN exhibited large phase shifts in response to light. Since the acute response of the MUA rhythm to light in Per 1 ⁻/⁻ SCN is equivalent to <b>wild-types,</b> an unknown mechanism mediates enhanced light responsiveness of Per 1 ⁻/⁻ mice.

25|$|A second subtype of GEFS+, type 2, is {{the result}} of {{mutations}} in SCN1A, a gene encoding a sodium channel α subunit. There are currently almost 90 known mutations in the SCN1A gene throughout the entirety of the channel (see table 1). These mutations result in almost any imaginable mutation type in the gene, short of duplications. The results of these mutations are highly variable, some producing functional channels while others result in non-functional channels. Some functional channels result in membrane hyperexcitability while others result in hypoexcitability. Most of the functional mutant channels result in hyperexcitability due to decreased frequency dependent rundown. An example of this is the D188V mutation. A 10Hz stimulation of <b>wild-type</b> channels causes current to decrease to approximately 70% of maximum whereas the same stimulation of mutant channels results in rundown to 90% of maximum. This is caused by an expedited recovery from inactivation for mutant channels versus <b>wild-type.</b> The D188V mutant, for example, recovers to 90% maximal current in 200ms while <b>wild-type</b> channels are unable to recover to this degree in >1000ms.

To investigate the relative involvement of D(1) vs D(5) receptors in mediating seizures, ethological behavioral topography and cortical EEGs were recorded in D(1), D(5) and DARPP- 32 knockout mice in response to a convulsant dose of SKF 83822.

In both heterozygous and homozygous D(5) knockouts, the latency to first seizure was significantly increased and total EEG seizures were reduced relative to <b>wild-types.</b> The majority (60 %) of homozygous DARPP- 32 knockouts did not have seizures; of those having seizures (40 %), the latency to first seizure was significantly increased and the number of high amplitude, high frequency polyspike EEG events was reduced.

Ventricular conduction velocity was reduced by 38 % in Cx 431 / 2 mice compared with <b>wild-types,</b> but atrial conduction velocity in the same hearts was normal. QRS duration was significantly greater in Cx 431 / 2 mice than in <b>wild-types,</b> but P-wave duration and amplitude did not differ. Atrial expression of Cx 43 was reduced by 50 %. Conclusions—These results indicate that Cx 43 is a principal conductor of intercellular current in the ventricle because ventricular conduction is significantly slowed when Cx 43 content is reduced by only 50 %. In contrast, a similar reduction in Cx 43 content in atrial muscle {{has no effect on}} atrial conduction, suggesting that Cx 40 (which is expressed in atrial bu...|$|R
40|$|Consumption {{of fruits}} and {{vegetables}} has been associated with a decrease in cancer incidence and cardiovascular disease, presumably caused by antioxidants. We designed a human intervention study to assess antioxidative and possible anti-genotoxic properties of fruit-borne antioxidants. We hypothesized that individuals bearing genetic polymorphisms for genes related to quercetin metabolism, benzo[a]pyrene metabolism, oxidative stress and DNA repair differ in their response to DNA protective effects of increased antioxidant intake. In the present study, 168 healthy volunteers consumed a blueberry/apple juice that provided 97 mg quercetin and 16 mg ascorbic acid a day. After a 4 -week intervention period, plasma concentrations of quercetin and ascorbic acid and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) were significantly increased. Further, we found 20 % protection (P < 0. 01) against ex vivo H 2 O 2 -provoked oxidative DNA damage, measured by comet assay. However, the level of ex vivo induced benzo[a]pyrene-diol-epoxide (BPDE) -DNA adducts was 28 % increased upon intervention (P < 0. 01). Statistical analysis of 34 biologically relevant genetic polymorphisms revealed that six significantly influenced the outcome of the intervention. Lymphocytes from individuals bearing variant genotype for Cyp 1 B 1 * 5 seemed to benefit more than <b>wild-types</b> from DNA damage-protecting effects upon intervention. Variants for COMT tended to benefit less or even experienced detrimental effects from intervention. With respect to GSTT 1, the effect is ambiguous; variants respond better in terms of intervention-related increase in TEAC, but <b>wild-types</b> benefit more from its protecting effects against oxidative DNA damage. We conclude that genotyping for relevant polymorphisms enables selecting subgroups among the general population that benefit more of DNA damage-modulating effects of micronutrients...|$|R
