5|$|A Ghost Story for Christmas is {{a strand}} of annual British short {{television}} films originally broadcast on BBC One between 1971 and 1978, and revived in 2005 on BBC Four. With one exception, the original instalments were directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark and the films were all shot on 16mm colour film. The remit behind the series <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> television adaptation of a classic ghost story, {{in line with the}} oral tradition of telling supernatural tales at Christmas.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Safi Thomas {{founded the}} Hip-Hop Dance Conservatory (HHDC) in New York City. Thomas' goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> {{comprehensive}} education to hip-hop dancers that was comparable to what ballet, modern, and jazz dancers experience at their respective institutions. HHDC provides a formal curriculum with dance classes (breaking, freestyle, locking, etc.) and academic classes (dance theory, physiology, kinesiology, etc.) {{to people who}} want to pursue hip-hop dance as a career. It is the only educational institution in the United States that is exclusively dedicated to hip-hop dance instruction. HHDC does not grant degrees. It is a non-profit organization and repertory company that grants certifications to dancers that complete the three-year program.|$|E

5|$|According to Dekema, {{planning}} for I-805 began in 1956. The original routing for I-805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July1958. It {{was added to}} the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as Route241. I-805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US101 between Los Angeles and San Diego, when the former was opened. Route241 was renumbered to Route805 in the 1964 state highway renumbering, and I-5 was designated along the route from Los Angeles to San Diego. Further planning was underway in 1965, with the goal to have the route built by 1972, the federal highway funding deadline. This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace; the goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico, and improve access for local residents. By June, houses along the route in the North Park area were being sold, as the land was needed for the first stretch of the freeway to be constructed. The next year, Dekema confirmed that the first portion of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be built would be between Home and Adams avenues.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the harbour is Watchet station. This {{is now an}} {{intermediate}} stop on the West Somerset Railway, a largely steam-operated heritage railway that links Bishops Lydeard, near Taunton, with Minehead. The station was first opened on 31 March 1862 when the West Somerset Railway was opened from Norton Junction. The station was built as a terminus, {{as part of the}} commercial aim of the WSR <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> wider and cheaper distribution route for goods from the then major port of Watchet. On 16 July 1874 the line was extended westwards by the Minehead Railway Company, with an industrial railway siding provided at the same time into the Wansbrough Paper Mill. The GWR undertook many projects to increase the capacity of the line in the 1930s. Nationalisation in 1948 saw the GWR become the Western Region of British Railways. Freight traffic was withdrawn on 6 July 1964 and passenger trains on 4 January 1971. The station was reopened by the new West Somerset Railway on 28 August 1976.|$|E

5|$|After Parliament {{partially}} repealed the Townshend {{duties in}} 1770, Boston's boycott of British goods ended. Politics became quieter in Massachusetts, although tensions remained. Hancock tried {{to improve his}} relationship with Governor Hutchinson, who in turn sought to woo Hancock away from Adams's influence. In April 1772, Hutchinson approved Hancock's election as colonel of the Boston Cadets, a militia unit whose primary function <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> ceremonial escort for {{the governor and the}} General Court. In May, Hutchinson even approved Hancock's election to the Council, the upper chamber of the General Court, whose members were elected by the House but subject to veto by the governor. Hancock's previous elections to the Council had been vetoed, but now Hutchinson allowed the election to stand. Hancock declined the office, however, not wanting to appear to have been co-opted by the governor. Nevertheless, Hancock used the improved relationship to resolve an ongoing dispute. To avoid hostile crowds in Boston, Hutchinson had been convening the legislature outside of town; now he agreed to allow the General Court to sit in Boston once again, to the relief of the legislators.|$|E
5|$|Astrology {{was taken}} up by Islamic {{scholars}} following the collapse of Alexandria to the Arabs in the 7th century, and {{the founding of the}} Abbasid empire in the 8th. The second Abbasid caliph, Al Mansur (754–775) founded the city of Baghdad to act as a centre of learning, and included in its design a library-translation centre known as Bayt al-Hikma 'House of Wisdom', which continued to receive development from his heirs and <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> major impetus for Arabic-Persian translations of Hellenistic astrological texts. The early translators included Mashallah, who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad, and Sahl ibn Bishr, (a.k.a. Zael), whose texts were directly influential upon later European astrologers such as Guido Bonatti in the 13th century, and William Lilly in the 17th century. Knowledge of Arabic texts started to become imported into Europe during the Latin translations of the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of Madeline, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the Baja California Peninsula southward from La Paz, and a hurricane warning from San Patricio, Jalisco to El Dorado, Sinaloa, including the Islas Marías. The storm was initially forecast to move ashore near Mazatlán, prompting officials to close the city's port. President Ernesto Zedillo advised potentially affected residents to stay indoors or seek refuge in shelters. Also, {{the threat of the}} hurricane canceled a fishing expedition in the Gulf of California due to rough surf. The expedition <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> new aquarium in downtown Denver, Colorado with about 8,500fish. Mexican authorities deployed 2,000soldiers in remote areas of the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa to prepare for the hurricane. Several thousand residents and tourists at the resorts of Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan were put on standby to evacuate their homes. Authorities along the coast in the state of Nayarit went house to house, advising people about the oncoming storm. In addition, ships from Salina Cruz to Acapulco were advised to stay in port.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey's {{first state}} {{constitution}} was adopted on July 2, 1776. The American Revolutionary War was underway and George Washington {{had recently been}} defeated in New York, putting New Jersey in imminent danger of invasion. With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other, New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war. Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later, during this state of emergency, on July 2, 1776, the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment. Its primary objective <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey's fall into anarchy. And yet this Constitution served as the charter document for the State's government for the next 68 years.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 2001, {{concurrent}} {{with the}} closure of the IND Sixth Avenue Line tracks of the Manhattan Bridge, B and Q train service to this station ceased and was replaced with a full-time shuttle. At this time, the northern tracks of the bridge were closed to allow for bridge repairs to take place. The southern BMT Broadway Line tracks were reopened allowing for half of the tracks on the bridge to remain open. On December 16, 2001, the 63rd Street Connector, which was built to connect the IND 63rd Street Line and the IND Queens Boulevard Line officially opened, and the F train was rerouted to serve this station at all times, which it still does to this day. When this happened, a free MetroCard out-of-system transfer to the Lexington Avenue–59th Street station was added. This <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> transfer to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line for F train customers as such a connection had been provided at the Lexington Avenue–53rd Street station along the previous routing of the F train.|$|E
5|$|The Australian 4th Armoured Brigade {{was formed}} in January 1943 to provide {{armoured}} support for Australian Army units operating in the South West Pacific Area. The brigade was never intended {{to serve as a}} single formation, rather its role <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> pool of armoured units from which units and sub-units could be provided to augment infantry forces. The brigade was also responsible for developing doctrine and specialised armoured vehicles for armoured warfare in tropical terrain. In keeping with the brigade's task of providing armoured units to other formations, its armoured regiments were organised into self-supporting regimental groups and the brigade did not possess the reconnaissance, infantry and other supporting elements which were common in World War II-era armoured brigades. Elements of the brigade saw action in the Huon Peninsula campaign of 1943–44 and attached to the Australian 6th Division during the Aitape–Wewak campaign from October 1944 {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|The Comilla Model (1959) was Khan's {{initiative}} {{in response to}} the failure of a Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) programme that was launched in 1953 in East and West Pakistan with technical assistance from the US government. V-AID remained a government-level attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of rural development. Khan launched the project in 1959 on his return from Michigan, and developed a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of grassroots-level participation. Initially, the aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country. Advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from Harvard and Michigan State Universities, the Ford Foundation, and USAID. Practical help was also sought from Japan to improve the local farming techniques.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} these reforms <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> sizable, well-trained force in the British Isles, which could be sent {{overseas}} in time of crisis, with a system of reservists and home-service volunteers to support it. However, with {{the outbreak of the}} South African War in October 1899, the system immediately began to show some strain; {{by the end of the}} first year of fighting, the reserves had been entirely exhausted. Various novel measures, including the extensive use of auxiliary forces, were experimented with for the remainder of the war; the Militia provided garrison units to free up regulars, the Volunteers sent service companies to be attached to regular battalions, and the Imperial Yeomanry was created to supply much-needed mounted infantry.|$|E
5|$|The school's {{governance}} {{was inspired}} by the county school movement of Joseph Lloyd Brereton, who was largely inspired in turn by the example of Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School. The object of the school <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> liberal education, with fees a fraction of those charged by public schools. Tolerance of non-conformist denominations such as Methodism and Roman Catholicism informed the school's ethos, and the school has always remained independent of the Church of England. Brereton's son became the first headmaster of the school. In contrast to the largely classical education offered by many of the public schools of the time, the school always maintained a focus on scientific and technological education. A strong sporting programme was believed to build character. Extensions {{over the next few years}} included a sanatorium in 1890 (now the music school) and a swimming-bath block in 1896. In 1900 a £4,000 (£400,000 in 2010) science block was opened by Lord Barnard with Brooke Foss Westcott, Bishop of Durham in attendance. The building is now inhabited by Tees and Dale houses.|$|E
