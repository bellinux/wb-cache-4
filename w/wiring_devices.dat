40|$|The {{expanded}} use of {{longwall mining}} systems has led, in particular, to different installation arrangements and combinations of ground wire monitors and ground <b>wire</b> <b>devices</b> {{for the purpose}} of monitoring the grounding circuit-These installation arrangements and combinations of ground wire monitors and ground <b>wire</b> <b>devices</b> were not evaluated at the time MSHA originally tested and accepted the ground wire monitor. Although these installation schemes differ from the accepted scheme, they can provide equivalent protection when their operation is coordinated with other electrical power system components. For this reason MSHA’s Approval and Certification Center developed an application procedure to evaluate these installation arrangements. To differentiate the procedure from the standard ground wire monitor or ground <b>wire</b> <b>device</b> application procedure, MSHA has identified this application procedure as the Monitor and Power System (MAPS) Program. This program includes tests and analyses to evaluate and assess various arrangements and combinations of proposed ground wire monitor and ground <b>wire</b> <b>device</b> installations...|$|R
2500|$|These {{electrical}} <b>wiring</b> <b>devices</b> {{are designed}} to quickly and automatically disconnect a circuit when it detects that the electric current is not balanced between the energized (line) conductor(s) and the return (neutral) conductor. Under normal circumstances, these two wires are expected to carry matching currents, and any difference can indicate a short circuit or other electrical anomaly is present, such as leakage. Leakage can indicate a shock hazard (or shock in progress) which is a potential danger to a person. Current leakage can result in harm or death due to electric shock, especially if the leaking electric current passes through the torso of a human. A current of around 30mA (0.030amperes) is potentially sufficient to cause cardiac arrest or serious harm if it persists {{for more than a}} small fraction of a second. RCDs {{are designed to}} disconnect the conducting wires quickly enough to prevent serious injury from such shocks, commonly described as the RCD being [...] "tripped".|$|E

40|$|Abstract An Investigation was {{conducted}} to determine electrical behavior when a dc-to-frame ground fault occurs on the secondary side of au AC/DC shuffle car which utilizes an auto-transformer fed SCR package and an SCR drive for the traction motors. Ten different ground <b>wire</b> <b>devices</b> from five manufacturers and eight sizes of neutral ground resistors were used during testing. Fault voltage and current data were recorded at low and high tramming speeds and at locked rotor. Harmonic analysis of the fault signals revealed that the 180 Hz signal of the SCR drive produced the major portion of the fault current and voltage drop across the ground <b>wire</b> <b>device.</b> A simplified equivalent circuit describing the electrical fault was derived. A series L-C circuit (notch fi 1 ter), resonant at 180 Hz was fabricated and placed across each of the ground <b>wire</b> <b>devices</b> {{to determine if the}} filter would simultaneously reduce frame-to-ground fault voltage and increase the total current flow to enhance ground fault detection capabilities.

40|$|Abstract — Mobile grid is a {{promising}} paradigm {{in the field}} of distributed computing in which mobile <b>devices</b> along with <b>wired</b> <b>devices</b> are part of the grid and participate in the activities of the grid as the <b>wired</b> <b>devices</b> do. One of the major challenges which hurdles the growth of mobile grid computing is the issue of faults and failures. The network is subject to intermittent connections and limited bandwidth which leads to frequent disconnections amongst mobile devices. Apart from the network, the device’s own resource pool is limited by battery and power. Fault-tolerant execution is necessary for extracting maximum benefits from the mobile devices. In this paper, we present a task migration based approach to support fault tolerant execution of jobs on mobile devices. The proposed technique provides better utilization of resources compared to other fault tolerance techniques. Keywords- Task migration; fault-tolerance; mobile grid I...|$|R
