2500|$|The anthropic {{principle}} was discussed by Leonard Susskind {{as well as}} Carlo Rovelli, who mentions it in his essay. [...] The {{anthropic principle}} claims {{that the universe is}} the way it is because if it was not specifically like how we see it, we <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> to describe it. Leonard Susskind expands by talking about the idea that the anthropic principle can be seen as a threat to the mentality that every law governing the cosmos is set in stone; thus being unalterable.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the tension}} between the two {{seemingly}} unresolved, following England's victory over Australia in the 4th Ashes Test at Melbourne which saw England retain the Ashes {{for the first time since}} the 1986-87 Ashes, Pietersen claimed that without the removal of Moores, England would not have been in a position to beat Australia, claiming the change in regime brought about a better working climate within the squad. [...] Pietersen went on to say: [...] "You know what - I have never said this before - I lost the captaincy, I got rid of the captaincy for the good of English cricket, and we <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> today if I had not done what I did then." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "At any rate, I will {{accompany}} him. After that thrashing we gave Balloba's horsemen, my head <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> safe <b>here</b> an hour, {{after his}} arrival." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} come again. You {{should not have}} come now. I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>here</b> had I thought it {{possible}} you would have come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{why do you}} ask that?" [...] she cried. [...] "You know I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>here</b> had I {{thought you}} were coming. Anne promised me that you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, so did I, like a shot. But {{what do you}} say it in {{that tone}} for? Of course you jumped overboard. If you hadn't you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are many}} sorrows: has he lost ships? If {{a man is}} in sound health, all the rest are dreams. And Besso needs no hakeem, or you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> my Rose of Sharon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you well?" [...] said Amelia. [...] "I {{dare say}} you are. You don't love your husband. You <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> if you did. Tell me, Rebecca, did I ever do you {{anything}} but kindness?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir Richard {{had drawn}} back a step. [...] "I trust {{neither of these}} gentlemen knows me," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>here</b> by any that did. It might {{compromise}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Scatcherd," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "she cannot come here; she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> happy <b>here,</b> and, to {{tell the}} truth, I do not wish her {{to know that she}} has other relatives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The fellows you {{are going}} to see <b>are</b> Navahoes, though <b>not</b> good {{specimens}} of the tribe, or they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> down <b>here</b> to sell ponies. Still, they are a very different sort from those you have seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} {{is safe and}} well," [...] I said, [...] "or you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> and before you say {{anything}} more about her, please {{tell me what you}} meant by that terrible word 'but.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The rain {{broke up}} my {{week-end}} party," [...] he explained, [...] "and I met Sophy in the Strand. In any case, I intended returning to-night. I understood that you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> until to-morrow about eleven o'clock." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{symptoms}} were sometimes curious as she now found {{when she went}} to inquire after Dame Verdon, who, Lizzie informed her, had her heart hanging by only one string, and when that gave way, she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is that of}} your trusty {{slave and}} jester," [...] {{answered}} Wamba, throwing back his cowl.

6000|$|... "Yes; {{all about}} you lived under a cruel error, and you helped them in it. But if you had not a better nature in you, my poor child, you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> happy <b>here</b> and thankful for {{what we can do}} for you." ...|$|R
2500|$|The United States Supreme Court {{received}} {{a message on}} the verdict during oral arguments, with the justices quietly passing the note to each other while listening to the attorney's presentation. Congressmen canceled press conferences, with one telling reporters [...] "Not only <b>would</b> you <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> but I wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> either".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Adriana, {{to whom we}} both of us owe everything. Were it not for Adriana, you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> {{you would}} be nothing," [...] and she whispered some words which made him start, and {{alternately}} blush and look pale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Young man," [...] {{interrupted}} the squatter, {{with a dark}} frown, [...] "you, too, have said enough. If fear of the law had come over me, you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> to witness {{the manner in which}} Ishmael Bush deals out justice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No! no!" [...] Johnson {{declared}} earnestly. [...] "I used no weapon! It was an accident, a pure accident. Remember {{that this}} is his son. He <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> {{if it was not}} quite certain that it was accident--and accident alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly I {{mentioned}} it," [...] the Doctor said calmly; [...] "how could I do otherwise?

6000|$|... "No, no poor sister--this can {{no longer}} <b>be.</b> Two girls <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> safe <b>here,</b> even should these Hurons fail in getting us into their power. Even father had {{as much as he}} could {{sometimes}} do, to keep peace upon the lake, and we should fail altogether. We must quit this spot, Hetty, and remove into the settlements." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{one such}} as I <b>am.</b> She <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> happy over <b>here.</b> She {{does not like}} new faces. You have enough {{depending}} on you; I have but her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] he said. [...] "Confess {{that if it}} {{had been}} that fisher-boy, you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> now!" [...] and he kept tight the arm {{that she was going to}} take away. Her face was in a flame.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] he remarked, [...] "you {{have had}} a pretty narrow escape. If we had not got in when we did, you <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> to tell the tale. I don't know that I ever saw any one much nearer to the undertaker." ...|$|E
5000|$|Each dialect of Aramaic {{has its own}} {{distinctive}} pronunciation, and it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> feasible <b>here</b> to go {{into all}} these properties.

Some modern Aramaic pronunciations lack the series of [...] "emphatic" [...] consonants, and some have borrowed from the inventories of surrounding languages, particularly Arabic, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, Persian and Turkish.|$|R
2500|$|Following the 1991 Rugby World Cup former Irish flyhalf Tony Ward said that, [...] "Although {{the finale}} is disappointing {{in terms of}} entertainment, there's no doubt in anyone's mind that Australia {{has been the best}} team and Campese is the {{outstanding}} player."

I <b>am</b> <b>here</b> today only because my skin is yellow and my religion is Unification Church. The ugliest things in this beautiful country of America are religious bigotry and racism." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] she {{returned}} wistfully, [...] "you {{are like the}} rest. You have a long memory for injuries, but a short one for benefits.

6000|$|... 'What is this?' thought Amalek. 'Besso is not ill, or his {{daughter}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>here.</b> This arrow flies not straight. Does {{he want to}} scrape my piastres? These sons of Israel that dwell in cities will mix their pens with our spears. I will be obstinate as an Azafeer camel.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very slightly," [...] Fenella replied. [...] "She was a {{very clever}} actress and I saw her {{sometimes}} upon the stage.

5000|$|On October 30, 2005, Rice {{attended}} {{a memorial service}} in Montgomery, Alabama, in Rice's home state, for Rosa Parks, an inspiration for the American Civil Rights Movement.

60|$|Occasionally an Arabian {{horse is}} brought to this country, {{but we do not}} often see them.
