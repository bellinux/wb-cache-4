5|$|Language {{assessment}} {{will allow}} the recognition of medical conditions presenting with aphonia or dysarthria, neurological conditions such as stroke or dementia presenting with aphasia, and specific language disorders such as stuttering, cluttering or mutism. People with autism or Asperger syndrome may have abnormalities in paralinguistic and pragmatic aspects of their speech. Echolalia (repetition of another person's words) and palilalia (repetition of the subject's own <b>words)</b> <b>can</b> be heard with patients with autism, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease. A person with schizophrenia might use neologisms, which are made-up words which have a specific meaning to the person using them.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether <b>words</b> <b>can</b> represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.|$|E
5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire <b>words</b> <b>can</b> be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E

50|$|Linguists {{working with}} Australian {{languages}} today purposely use unambiguous phonemic orthographies based on detailed phonological {{analysis of the}} language in question.

25|$|The suffixes ‑o, ‑a, ‑e, and ‑i {{indicate}} that a word is a noun, adjective, adverb, and infinitive verb, respectively.

25|$|Hungarian orthography {{generally}} {{follows the}} phonemic principle: most <b>words</b> <b>can</b> be read out correctly if {{one knows the}} pronunciation of the letters.

25|$|Georgian has a rich word-derivation system. By using a root, {{and adding}} some {{definite}} prefixes and suffixes, one can derive many nouns and adjectives from the root.

Noting that the modifying component in Germanic compound <b>words</b> <b>can</b> {{take the form}} of a genitive or a bare root, he points to behavioural similarities between genitive determinants and the modifying element in regular Old Norse compound words, such as the fact that neither can be modified by a free-standing (declined) adjective.
