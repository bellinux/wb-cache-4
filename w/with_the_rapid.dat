5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> {{suburban}} {{expansion of}} Guelph in the 1950s and 1960s, a revised transportation plan was conceived {{to handle the}} increasing traffic load. The Guelph Area Transportation Study was completed in 1967, and recommended a new controlled-access highway to allow through-traffic on Highway6 to bypass the city. Route planning, engineering and design began on October2, 1967 and was subsequently completed in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{standards}} and enrollment numbers at the Baltimore City College (B.C.C.) after reaching {{a high of}} near 4,000 boys by the mid-1960s went {{through a period of}} decline first in the late 1960s to mid 1970s, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> opening of newer additional high schools both in the outreaches of the city along with the rapidly expanding suburbs in surrounding Baltimore County. Two in the city system were Northwestern in 1965 and Northern in the following year. Three high schools were completed and opened all at one time in September 1971, with Southwestern, Walbrook and a massive huge complex nearby to City in Clifton Park on the bed of the old reservoir off Harford Road, Lake Clifton. The 'A' and 'B' courses were slowly dying out and unfortunately discontinued by 1973, and a single academic track was offered.|$|E
5|$|Beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> {{industrial}} growth {{that began in}} Indiana during the gas boom of the late 19th-century, labor unions began to form with goals of increasing wages and providing other benefits to workers through collective bargaining. The Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company was founded to own and operate the streetcar terminal in downtown Indianapolis, and operate the Indianapolis Street Railway under a lease agreement for a term of 31 years. In 1892 the employees of Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company launched a short-lived strike. The company was the primary public transportation provider in Indianapolis and operated the central transportation hub {{for the city of}} Indianapolis and state of Indiana. The company offered small concessions, and the workers returned to work without unionizing.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2005, Colorado Rapids {{selected}} Lowery in {{the third}} round (45th overall) in the 2005 MLS SuperDraft.

50|$|Hankinson was not {{the first}} person {{formerly}} associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Colorado <b>Rapids</b> to hold <b>the</b> DoC post. For a brief time in 2004, former US MNT player Marcelo Balboa was the Club’s DoC, but soon departed to return to <b>the</b> <b>Rapids</b> for a front office post. Coincidentally, Hankinson and Balboa also had a history. Their paths crossed for one season in 2001, Hankinson’s first year <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rapids</b> and Balboa’s last.

5|$|Communities {{have formed}} around the creation, play and {{discussion}} of LARP. These communities have developed a subculture that crosses over with role-playing, fan, reenactment, and drama subcultures. Early LARP subculture focused on Tolkien-like fantasy, but it later broadened to include appreciation of other genres, especially the horror genre <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> uptake of the World of Darkness setting in the 1990s. Like many subcultures, LARP groups often have a common context of shared experience, language, humour, and clothing that can be regarded {{by some as a}} lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic {{herpesvirus}}es (EEHV) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1' {{is a type}} of herpesvirus, {{which can}} cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants. In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be treated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} {{can also be}} found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropics. The first discovered was Vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase {{in the case of the}} smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open for a very long time and was only solved recently. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, just {{sixteen years}} after it was built, the church was {{destroyed}} by fire. This was not uncommon, however, as devastating fires frequently plagued the developing colony, and a new cathedral was quickly built on the same site. It featured iconic twin steeples at its facade. However, the Victoria Harbour waterfront district where the church was situated became more overcrowded <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> growth of Hong Kong at the time, and it became apparent that a permanent and larger cathedral was necessary. As a result, plans were made for a new church on a more elevated ground in Mid-Levels, located close to the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{economy of}} the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on whaling and sealing. The {{exploitation}} of the forests for timber started in the 1860s <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> growth {{of the city of}} Dunedin {{as a result of the}} goldrush of 1861–62. In the early 1870s more timber cargo was loaded at Owaka than at any other New Zealand port. Forestry and sawmilling declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible timber had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed new life into these industries, however, with activity peaking during the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> Japanese advance {{through the}} Pacific {{and the fall}} of Singapore in February 1942, the 3,400 troops aboard Orcades were {{diverted}} from Sumatra to Java in the Dutch East Indies. Disembarking at Batavia on 18 February, Peeler's battalion was combined with the other units aboard Orcades to form Blackforce. This ad hoc grouping, {{under the command of}} fellow Victoria Cross holder Brigadier Arthur Blackburn, was tasked with defending a series of airfields and supporting the Dutch. Blackburn organised his men into a brigade formation, consisting of a headquarters and three infantry battalions—the men of the 2/2nd Pioneers made up the bulk of Blackforce's 2nd Battalion.|$|E

5|$|Angola {{held the}} first round of its 1992 presidential {{election}} on 29–30 September. Dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. As no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations. Savimbi sent Jeremias Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA, to Luanda to negotiate the terms of the second round. The election process broke down on 31 October, when government troops in Luanda attacked UNITA. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by-house raids <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rapid</b> Intervention Police, killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. Assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy on 2 November, pulling him out of his car and shooting him and two others in their faces. The MPLA massacred over ten thousand UNITA and FNLA voters nationwide in a few days in what was known as the Halloween Massacre. Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused to participate in the second round. He then proceeded to resume armed struggle against the MPLA.|$|E
5|$|Mari {{was first}} {{abandoned}} {{in the middle of}} the 26th century BC but was rebuilt and became the capital of a hegemonic East-Semitic state before 2500 BC. This second Mari engaged in a long war with its rival Ebla, and is known for its strong affinity with the Sumerian culture. It was destroyed in the 23rd century BC by the Akkadians who allowed the city to be rebuilt and appointed a military governor bearing the title of Shakkanakku ("military governor"). The governors later became independent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> disintegration of the Akkadian empire and rebuilt the city as a regional center in the middle Euphrates valley. The Shakkanakkus ruled Mari until the second half of the 19th century BC when the dynasty collapsed for unknown reasons. A short time after the Shakkanakku collapse, Mari became the capital of the Amorite Lim dynasty. The Amorite Mari was short lived as it was annexed by Babylonia in c. 1761 BC, but the city survived as a small settlement under the rule of the Babylonians and the Assyrians before being abandoned and forgotten during the Hellenistic period.|$|E
5|$|Rakoto Frah {{performed}} traditional vakindrazana and vazikoava {{pieces for}} sodina, commonly heard {{at a variety}} of holidays and rites observed in the central highlands of Madagascar. The music accompanying the famadihana reburial ceremonies of the central highlands, for instance, is typically performed by an ensemble of sodina players accompanied by the amponga drum. These sodina performances, which express the joy of reuniting with the ancestors, are often competitive. More than one troupe may be present at the famadihana and will take turns showing off their musical skills, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> flight of notes intended to inspire dancing {{over the course of the}} entire day or week of the celebration. The rural artistic tradition of the hira gasy is equally joyful but more elaborate, showcasing the music, dance and oratory skills of a large troupe that includes male and female vocalists, drums, sodina, and a variety of orchestral instruments such as clarinets, trumpets and violins.|$|E

50|$|After {{leaving the}} station, the raft will enter {{relatively}} calm waters. After travelling {{a safe distance}} (usually 5-15 metres), the raft will enter more turbulent waters.

5|$|The Battle of Lộc Ninh {{was a major}} battle fought {{during the}} Easter Offensive during the Vietnam War, {{which took place in}} Bình Long Province, South Vietnam between 4–7 April 1972. Towards the end of 1971, North Vietnamese leaders decided to launch a major {{offensive}} against South Vietnam, with the objective of destroying Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) units and capturing as much territory as possible, in order to strengthen their bargaining position in the Paris Peace Accords. On 30 March 1972, two North Vietnamese Army divisions smashed through the Demilitarized Zone, marking the commencement of the Easter Offensive. They quickly overwhelmed South Vietnamese units in the I Corps Tactical Zone. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> collapse of South Vietnamese forces in the northern provinces of South Vietnam, North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng forces began preparing for their next offensive, targeting Bình Long Province in the Mekong Delta region. On 4 April, the Việt Cộng's 5th Division opened their attack on Lộc Ninh, defended by the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment. After three days of fighting, the vastly outnumbered South Vietnamese forces, though well supported by American air power, were forced to abandon their positions in Lộc Ninh.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>rapid</b> {{advances}} in theatre technology made during this period, the 1868 theatre quickly became outmoded, and the sub-lease of the theatre, still {{held by the}} Dudley family, was due to expire in 1891. The Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues (forerunners of the Crown Estate) desired the entire block on which the theatre stood to be rebuilt, except for the Royal Arcade, where the lease did not expire until 1912. Problems were encountered in obtaining all the buildings and in financing the scheme, but the theatre and surrounding buildings were demolished in 1892. Plans were commissioned from architect Charles J. Phipps for a theatre and a hotel. In February 1896 an agreement was reached with Herbert Beerbohm Tree for the erection of the theatre {{at a cost of}} £55,000. The plans were approved in February 1897, and on 16 July 1896, the foundation stone of the new theatre was laid. Phipps died in 1897, and the theatre was his last work.|$|E
