40|$|ABSTRACT. Relatively {{little is}} known about the {{distribution}} of avian paramyxoviruses (APMVs) among <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> in Japan. <b>Surveillance</b> of APMV in migratory waterfowl was conducted in the San-in region of western Japan during winters of 2006 to 2012. A total of 16 avian paramyxoviruses consisting of 3 lentogenic Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs), 12 APMV- 4 and 1 APMV- 8 were isolated from 1, 967 wild-bird fecal samples. The results show that NDV and APMV- 4 are relatively widely distributed among wild waterfowl that migrate to Japan from northern regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that there was no genetic relationship between the isolates from <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> and domestic poultry in Japan. However, surveillance of APMVs in wild waterfowl needs to be conducted due to the pathogenic potential of these isolates in domestic poultry.

40|$|Historically, {{surveillance}} for influenza A viruses (IAVs) in <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> {{has relied}} on viral detection assays. This was largely due to poor performance of serological assays in wild birds; however, recently developed commercial serological assays have improved the ability to detect IAV antibodies in <b>wild</b> <b>birds.</b> Serological <b>surveillance</b> for IAV antibodies in Canada geese (Branta canadensis) has shown that, despite a low prevalence of virus isolations, Canada geese are frequently exposed to IAVs and that exposure increases with latitude, which follows virus isolation prevalence patterns observed in dabbling ducks. The objectives {{of this study were}} to further evaluate IAV antibodies in Canada geese using a subtype-specific serological assay to determine if Canada geese are exposed to subtypes that commonly circulate in dabbling ducks. We collected serum samples from Canada geese in Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin and tested for antibodies to IAVs using a blocking ELISA. Positive samples were further tested by hemagglutination inhibition for 10 hemagglutinin IAV subtypes (H 1 –H 10). Overall, we detected antibodies to NP in 24 % (714 / 2919) of geese. Antibodies to H 3, H 4, H 5, and H 6 subtypes predominated, with H 5 being detected most frequently. A decrease in H 5 HI antibody prevalence and titers was observed from 2009 to 2012. We also detected similar exposure pattern in Canada geese from New Jersey, Minnesota, Washington and Wisconsin. Based on the published literature, H 3, H 4, and H 6 viruses are the most commonly reported IAVs from dabbling ducks. These results indicate that Canada geese also are frequently exposed to viruses of the same HA subtypes; however, the high prevalence of antibodies to H 5 viruses was not expected as H 5 IAVs are generally not well represented in reported isolates from ducks...|$|R

In the final parsimonious model, population density, growing degree-days, temperature, WNV positive mosquitoes, dead birds and WNV positive birds were significant predictors of human infection risk, with an ROC value of 0. 75.

40|$|Evaluation of avian {{influenza}} virus (AIV) diagnostic methods, including a nucleoprotein (NP) competitive {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (c-ELISA), hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, type A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), and embryonating chicken egg (ECE) virus isolation (VI), suggested validity of these tests in <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> comparable to that reported in poultry. This was determined by analyzing the results from experimental inoculation of three species of <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> with a low-pathogenicity AIV and from field surveillance data. The NP c-ELISA in a high-AIV prevalence setting had 100 % diagnostic sensitivity (Se; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 81. 5 %- 100 %) and 91 % diagnostic specificity (Sp; 95 % CI: 70. 8 %- 98. 9 %) in negative controls compared with the RRT-PCR. In low-AIV prevalence flocks using a > 60 % inhibition positivity threshold, relative to the HI test, c-ELISA performed with 90. 5 % Se (95 % CI: 86. 2 %- 93. 8 %) and 41. 2 % Sp (95 % CI: 38. 1 %- 44. 5 %). Assessment of HI suggests a titer ≥ 8 is a positive test result in wild-bird sera, and using this titer had 83. 3 % Se (95 % CI: 58. 6 %- 96. 4 %) in experimentally infected birds. The RRT-PCR diagnostic performance compared with VI in cloacal swabs varied over 2 - 6 days postinoculation, having high Se (83. 3 %- 100 %) and Sp (94. 1 %- 100 %) with substantial agreement (kappa = 0. 8).

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that wild aquatic birds {{are the major}} reservoir for Avian Influenza viruses (AIV), and also {{play a significant role}} as vectors for the disease. However, despite intensive surveillance, we still know very little about the role individual wild birds (and their populations) play in the transmission and maintenance of these viruses. Traditionally, combinations of single-location surveillance and historical migration patterns have been used to estimate the degree to which different species may be involved. However, this broad scale approach tends to neglect the ecology of the virus, and just as importantly, the ecology of the host. Over 100 species have been found infected with these viruses worldwide, with many more purportedly negative for the disease. Using data from ten years of <b>wild</b> <b>bird</b> <b>surveillance</b> in the Netherlands we catalogued the ecological properties of each species sampled, in order to determine whether infected species are ecologically separated from those that are not. Using stable isotope analysis of feathers and blood components, we also examine whether infection risk of individuals within a species known to be infected by AIV can be attributable to antecedent foraging habitats. The use of an aquatic habitat is strongly associated with infection risk at all levels analysed, including individuals and populations of a single species, and between species. These unique findings underscore the usefulness of stable isotope methods in disease ecology, particularly when compared to broader-scale inter-species patterns, and the potential role of host ecology in transmission and maintenance of AIV...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a method for}} evaluation of surveillance for avian influenza (AI) in wild birds and compares surveillance activities before and after changes in surveillance strategy in Great Britain (GB). In October 2008 the AI <b>Wild</b> <b>Bird</b> <b>Surveillance</b> (AIWBS) system in GB was modified to focus on passive surveillance (birds found dead), including those found during warden patrols of wetlands and wildlife reserves, with less emphasis on public reporting of birds found dead. The number of birds sampled by active surveillance (birds live-trapped or shot) was also reduced. In the present study {{the impact of these}} changes was investigated by comparing the 12 mo prior to October 2008 with the subsequent 12 mo. Four factors were considered for each surveillance system component: 1) the number of wild birds tested; 2) whether the tested wild birds were considered "higher risk species" (HRS) for being infected with AI; 3) the location of the birds tested with respect to counties designated as a priority for surveillance; and 4) the probability that the birds tested might yield a positive AI virus result based on surveillance results in wild birds across Europe. The number of birds tested by both surveillance types was greatly reduced after the strategy change. The proportion of birds sampled in priority counties also significantly decreased in the second year for both active and passive surveillance. However, the proportion of HRS sampled by active surveillance significantly increased, while a significant decrease in these species was seen for passive surveillance in the second year. The derived probability scores for detecting AI based on European surveillance results indicated a reduction in sensitivity for H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic AI detection by passive surveillance. The methods developed to evaluate AIWBS in GB may be applicable to other European Union countries. The results also reflect the complex issues associated with evaluation of disease surveillance in wildlife populations in which the disease ecology is only partially understood...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{concern about the}} impact of human {{activities}} on wildlife, both {{at the level of the}} individual animal and at a global population level, and the need for surveillance of wildlife for evidence of infectious and non-infectious diseases has never been greater. There is also much interest in attempting to help wildlife by treating and rehabilitating sick and injured wild animals and by providing supplementary feeding to garden birds. This thesis reviews the literature describing the diseases found in the United Kingdom (UK) in different birds of the orders Passeriformes and Columbiformes, the orders of birds with which members of the general public and wildlife rehabilitators are most likely to have contact. The thesis then collates and analyses the postmortem findings from <b>wild</b> <b>bird</b> <b>surveillance</b> carried out on 2048 birds of these orders at one diagnostic laboratory in Scotland over a twenty-year period (1994 - 2013). The overall aim was to make maximum use of surveillance data already gathered but not previously readily available, to inform those involved with wildlife disease surveillance, wildlife rehabilitation, and members of the public providing supplementary feeding to garden birds. During the 20 years of wild bird disease surveillance, 42 endemic conditions or pathogens were identified, raising awareness and increasing our understanding of these conditions. One re-emerging disease, salmonellosis, came to prominence and then declined during the surveillance period, and was confirmed in approximately 350 garden birds. Two new conditions were described in finches; Escherichia albertii bacteraemia in approximately 150 finches and Trichomonas gallinae infection in approximately 370 finches. The large numbers of birds with salmonellosis, E. albertii bacteraemia or trichomonosis permitted further analysis by species of bird, geographic region, and distribution by age and sex, permitting conclusions to be drawn regarding the epidemiology of these diseases. Two new conditions were diagnosed in choughs (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), a species of conservation concern in the UK; a developmental abnormality of the eye and sometimes brain of young choughs, most likely inherited, and significant helminthosis caused by spirurid gizzard worms and intestinal thorny-headed worms. These findings will influence future attempts to conserve this species in Scotland. Another new condition encountered was enteritis and/or hepatitis associated with schistosome-like eggs, diagnosed in blackbirds (Turdus merula) and a dunnock (Prunella modularis). More specific identification of the causal organism and evaluation of potential zoonotic implications are required. Two conditions were investigated for which no satisfactory aetiological agent could be identified; a nonsuppurative encephalitis affecting multiple fledgling starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and house sparrows (Passer domesticus), and a necrotic oesophagitis of unknown cause detected in five chough nestlings. Three organisms identified in wild birds elsewhere in the world and found for the first time in the UK as part of this surveillance study were the avian gastric yeast Macrorhabdus ornithogaster (“megabacteria”) in greenfinches (Chloris chloris) and a waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus), Mycoplasma sturni in blackbirds, starlings and corvids, and Ornithonyssus sp. mites in corvids. Screening for two zoonotic pathogens exotic to UK wildlife, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) and West Nile virus (WNV) was carried out on over 600 samples and over 500 samples respectively, but no positive results were obtained. Investigation of novel and re-emerging conditions and screening for exotic pathogens relied heavily on work carried out by other laboratories, underlining the importance of collaboration between multiple laboratories when carrying out disease surveillance. To aid those working in wild bird disease surveillance, diagnosis and treatment, a collection of approximately 700 images of lesions, parasites and their eggs or oocysts is included as an appendix to this thesis, as has a guide to the presumptive identification of some of the internal parasites encountered. This study has demonstrated the ever-changing nature of diseases of wild birds of the orders Passeriformes and Columbiformes, and the same is likely to be true of wild birds in other orders. Continued wild bird disease surveillance is essential, to help safeguard the health of wildlife, livestock, humans, and indeed the environment itself...|$|E
40|$|The CD {{starts with}} {{introduction}} by ILRI Director General Carlos Sere Then follows the seven interviews conducted by Brian Perry, ILRI Epidemiologist covering aspects {{and issues of}} the current Avian Flu situation, their experiences, national and regional surveillance as well as community surveillance and action. The representatives were from South East Asia (Robyn Alders, IRPC/KYEEMA Foundation; India (Santanu Bandopadhyay, Ministry of Agriculture; Nigeria (Daniel F Adene, Poultry Diseases Unit, Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Ibadan; Senegal (Poultry specialist E. Fallou Gueye ISRA/Family Poultry Network; Kenya (Catherine Wanjohi from Department of Veterinary Services); World Bank Adam lagerstedt; and South Africa (Celia Abolnik Ondeistepoort Veterinary Institute, Pretoria). The South East Asia representative talked about Laos, East Tumor. She states that Laos {{is one of the}} first countries to suffer the Bird Flu outbreak, which was in 2004. That it has small commercial industry and that people preferred village poultry. The outbreak was limited to commercial units, and that it was under control. The government's key efforts were also discussed. She indicated that in Laos no veterinarians are trained. There is luck of sufficient information and communication. Laos is still building capacity. Surveillance is one of the failures because of neglected veterinary services and education on basic sciences over many years. Community action was also discussed. The interview with India's representative started with geographical distribution of Bird Flu, and limitation to specific areas. It was indicated that it was a sudden outbreak in a district in a remote area commercial farm. Soon after, there was another outbreak in rural backyard poultries. The discussion included developing of national policies, and whom it involved. Other topics were - active laboratories, vaccination, strains imported, compensation to farmers on destroyed birds, depopulation, animal welfare, public health issues, mortalities, and community awareness. The third interviewee from Nigeria discusses cases of Bird Flu, mortality rate, diagnosis, outbreaks, training, lack of participation in surveillance, spreading mechanism, and recommendations. The representative from Senegal discusses the vulnerability of Avian Flu, preparedness, expertise, how avian flu affects the livelihood of the small farmers, risk of smuggled carcasses, role of migratory birds and water, compensation to farmers, education, training, and action. With the Kenyan representative the discussion was on role in preparedness, coordinating of activities, how effective was the surveillance system, capacity building in lab level, diagnosis methods, and bodies involved in the surveillance like the national museum which was involved in <b>wild</b> <b>bird</b> <b>surveillance</b> by collecting samples. He also stated that there is an active surveillance team for domestic poultry and birds, major risks are said to be migratory birds, and illegal importation. The discussion ends with what actions to be taken and control policies.

He mentioned that country strategy is used to allocate money and that reprogramming of funding is already in use. The discussion on South Africa is on the ongoing work which involved diagnosis and research in Avian Influenza. The discussion includes tracing the origin, mutation, strains in South Africa, Ostrich viruses, intensive farming system, identify how the virus come to the country, the surveillance program, lessons learnt, direct and indirect impact, increasing awareness, inadequate compensation, and coordination of surveillance. A summary of possible ways forward was presented by Tom Randolph, Agricultural economist at ILRI. He looked into how to develop policies to control Avian Flu, service needed to support different front line agencies, and indicates the research community can contribute by its expertise, lab capacity etc. and how to develop control policies, why and how can the community translate those lessons into better control efforts in the future. Front line agencies like, FOA, OIE and WHO and national institutes were reminded to prepare for and fight any outbreaks of the disease. It was mentioned that ILRI and IFPRI representing the CGIAR, would like to help to facilitate the process, help to get it started but not control or lead...|$|E
