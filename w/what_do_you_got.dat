500|$|Lawrence Tierney {{was cast}} as Alton Benes. He {{was known for}} his bad-guy roles in films during the 1940s and 1950s, such as Dillinger, The Hoodlum and Born to Kill. Tierney's {{appearance}} in the episode is one of his only comedic roles. Cast and crew members were very impressed with Tierney's performance, and intended to make Alton Benes a recurring character. However, they were frightened of him; during filming it was discovered that Tierney had stolen a butcher knife from the knife block in Jerry's apartment set. Various cast members remember Seinfeld encountering Tierney and stating [...] "Hey Lawrence, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> there in your jacket?". Tierney, realizing he had been caught, tried to make a joke about how he thought taking the knife would be funny, by reenacting a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), holding the knife above his head and making threatening motions towards Seinfeld. Tom Cherones, Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus saw this happen, and, as Alexander recalled, it [...] "scared the living crap out of all of us." [...] Cherones stated that, afterwards, Larry David would jokingly threaten to have Tierney back on the show if Cherones did his work badly.|$|E

5000|$|... "What Do You Got?" [...] is a {{song that}} was written by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora and Brett James, {{produced}} by Howard Benson and co-produced by Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora. It was recorded in Bay 7 Studios in Valley Village and Sparky Dark Studios in Calabasas, California. The song was written during sessions for The Circle (2009), but it didn't fit that album, so band decided to hold it and finished it for the Greatest Hits (2010). Lyrically, the song is about the esthetic of love. Richie Sambora explained: [...] "It's a worldly thing and it doesn't have to be exactly about romance.

Most non-top 40 dance hits remain at the station, although they are classics. It continues to report on Mediabase & Nielsen BDS as a contemporary hit radio.

40|$|This chapter {{argues that}} {{contrary}} to conventional wisdom and {{the views of}} many scholars and critics, rock and roll’s most important rhythmic elements are derived from a complex blend of African, American, and European musical traditions.

5000|$|Skinny Puppy's {{primary goal}} with VIVIsectVI {{was to provide}} a vicious {{depiction}} of vivisection and shine a spotlight on other issues regarding animal rights. The group's singer and songwriter Nivek Ogre explained his stance on animal testing to Vinyl Propaganda in 1988, stating the following: When I was young, growing up, I always thought that animal experimentation was necessary, that there was some reason for it, that there was some good being done with it... now against all of it. All animal experimentation. Every bit of it. My brother’s a doctor, too; it’s a very hardline stance. But, yes. I mean, the only reason we’re living longer nowadays is because of the food we’re eating, and the foods we’re not eating, and the preventative medicine that we’re taking upon ourselves, isn’t that correct? On the album's name, Ogre went on to say: It's just taking a shot at what Jimmy Swaggart will do with Mr. Ed … we just thought, well, look at this …we’ll break down all the syllables, and we’ll add our own interpretation at the end, a roman numeral - and <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> have?
