The BNP know the present system is their only chance of election. This is another example of the increasingly Goebbels-like campaign from the anti-AV people, for whom no lie is too idiotic given the truth is so unpalatable to them. AV makes lazy MPs work harder and reach out beyond their tribe. It is what Britain needs to clean up politics.|$|E

John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, gave the episode a positive review and complimented its exploration of Reyes' character. He rated it an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "overall, a wonderful unexpected {{look into the}} underlying motivations of a character that, until now, has been only vaguely drawn for the audience. Thankfully it is completely consistent <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen before". Keegan added that the [...] "greatest drawback may be that we are unlikely to see this theme explored much further, since this is now officially the final season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the entry's plot—comparing it to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze" [...] and the fourth season episode [...] "The Field Where I Died"—calling the writing [...] "delightfully subtle". They praised Amann's misdirection, noting that the episode contains several red herrings. Shearman and Pearson also praised the episode's effects, calling the skinless bodies [...] "the high point of the series' trading in gore". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "unexpectedly entertaining" [...] and praised the script's attempts to shed more light on Reyes' character.|$|E
500|$|Baba himself {{maintained}} an ambiguous profile, unwilling {{to identify with}} {{either of the two}} religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: [...] "You have been with me for eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?" [...] Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing: Baba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would always talk of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was [...] "Allah rakhega vaiia rahena", that is, [...] "Let us be content <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> and submit our will to Allah." [...] On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis and even a few Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal.|$|E

His bid proposed to keep the team in the Glendale area while engaging young hockey players in the region through school partnerships and scholarship efforts.

2500|$|Funeral for a Friend {{spent all}} of 2012, bar their brief festival {{appearances}} writing and recording for their sixth studio album. Over the year they released several studio updates showing the band members tracking different instruments for the album. On 4 October of that year the band confirmed the title and release date of their sixth album Conduit for a 28 January 2013 release in the United Kingdom and on 5 February 2013 through The End Records In the United States. To support {{the release of the}} album, the band underwent a headlining tour with support acts such as Such Gold, Daytrader and I Divide throughout January and February. However, Daytrader had {{to pull out of the}} tour, so Major League took their place on the bill. The band continues to work with Welsh music producer, Romesh Dodangoda, on the album as they did with their previous album. Vocalist Matthew Davies-Kreye spoke of their working union, [...] "To me, he gets our individual personalities and works his magic with each of us, making sure that we're all comfortable <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to do for the record." [...] Davies-Kreye has described the reasoning behind the title Conduit as [...] "the experiences of being in a band" [...] and summarised the album's style as “a post-hardcore record that is not afraid to drop into some hardcore for good measure.” The first single from the album, [...] "Best Friends and Hospital Beds", would be released on 12 November with the music video being released prior on 10 October.|$|E

5000|$|While touring Germany {{in support}} of their Debut EP, the band started saving up for a {{possible}} future release with Stricker stating that [...] "While we were all content <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> at the time, 7 Symptoms was still basically just a home recording. We wanted more, {{so we decided to}} save up, go to a studio and record a full length album. That became our next goal." ...|$|R
60|$|Long {{though the}} list was, {{it must have}} been small in {{comparison}} <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> done to the lobster backs.

5000|$|Dotsch {{was also}} {{critical}} of league spending. [...] "Every good coach has a game plan. In this case, the USFL {{got away from}} the game plan. There's no question we did, or I'll say the USFL did. I don't think we did or Tampa Bay did. Hindsight is much better than foresight, I know, but things were done that hurt us. We (the Stallions) didn't go crazy. We lost the fewest dollars of any USFL team. We were always the poorest team in the playoffs, but we held our own and I'm proud of that. We did a good job <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>had.</b> <b>We</b> won a lot more than we lost, and that's the biggest thing".|$|R

The cries of the souls of their loved ones still haunt me today." ...|$|R

60|$|And I may {{add that}} another {{extraordinary}} {{feature of the}} Judge's conduct in this canvass--made more extraordinary by this incident--is, {{that he is in}} the habit, in almost all the speeches he makes, of charging falsehood upon his adversaries, myself and others.
