5|$|Wasps {{have been}} {{modelled}} in jewellery {{since at least}} the nineteenth century, when diamond and emerald wasp brooches were made in gold and silver settings. A fashion for wasp <b>waisted</b> female silhouettes with sharply cinched waistlines emphasizing the wearer's hips and bust arose repeatedly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.|$|E

25|$|Hourglass drums (or <b>waisted</b> drums) are hourglass-shaped and {{generally}} two-headed. The drumheads are laced onto the body, and the laces may be squeezed during performance {{to alter the}} drum's pitch. Examples include folk drums in India (like the damaru) and much of Africa, {{as well as some}} talking drums.|$|E
25|$|From 1600 to c. 1630, hose or {{breeches}} were {{fastened to}} doublets {{by means of}} ties or points, short laces or ribbons pulled through matching sets of worked eyelets. Points were tied in bows at the waist and became more elaborate until they disappeared with the very short <b>waisted</b> doublets of the late 1630s. Decorated metal tips on points were called aiguillettes or aiglets, {{and those of the}} wealthy were made of precious metals set with pearls and other gemstones.|$|E
500|$|Vulcanodons limbs were {{sturdy and}} column-like, and its forelimbs were already {{proportionally}} long, reaching 76% of hindlimb length. Its lower leg, metatarsus, and toes were shortened {{in comparison to}} its bipedal ancestors, but still not as short as in later sauropods. The sacrum was made out of four fused sacral vertebrae; [...] "prosauropods" [...] possessed only three sacrals. The tail vertebra bodies already showed an incipient excavation of their lateral sides, saving weight and giving them a <b>waisted</b> appearance when viewed from below. In later sauropods, this excavations were enlarged to form extensive perforated pockets called pleurocoels. Contrasting the many sauropod-like features of the skeleton, the pelvis was relatively primitive, reminiscent of its [...] "prosauropod" [...] ancestors. One such feature is that the brevis shelf of the ilium has a fossa, which is not found in any more derived sauropods.|$|E
500|$|Shen Kuo {{experimented with}} the pinhole camera and burning mirror as the ancient Chinese Mohists {{had done in}} the 4th century BC. Although the Iraqi Muslim {{scientist}} Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) {{was the first to}} experiment with camera obscura, Shen Kuo was the first to attribute geometrical and quantitative properties to the camera obscura, just several decades after Ibn al-Haytham's death. [...] Using a fitting metaphor, Shen compared optical image inversion to an oarlock and <b>waisted</b> drum. He also discussed focal points and noted that the image in a concave mirror is inverted. Shen, who never asserted that {{he was the first to}} experiment with camera obscura, hints in his writing that camera obscura was dealt with in the Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang written by Duan Chengshi (d. 863) during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), in regard to the inverted image of a Chinese pagoda by a seashore.|$|E

The performance featured a large camouflage tank and two robots similar to those used for her performance at the ECHO Awards. On May 23, 2010, Rihanna performed a 40-minute set at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend Music Festival in Bangor, Wales. Rihanna wore a hooded leather playsuit with red, green, and yellow stripes as she performed several of her biggest hits, which included [...] "Mad House", [...] "Hard", [...] "Disturbia", [...] "Rude Boy", [...] "Te Amo", [...] "Russian Roulette", [...] "Don't Stop the Music", [...] "SOS", and [...] "Umbrella". The song was featured on Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth Tour,. Rihanna was criticized for poor choreography and because she [...] "omitted the difficult parts and even forgot some of the lyrics." [...] "Rude Boy" [...] was also on the set-list of her Loud Tour, where Rihanna wore a denim bra and high <b>waisted</b> shorts. This performance was received far more positively than that of her previous tour, and critics praised the production of the concert. Jane Stevenson of the Toronto Sun wrote, [...] "the two-hour, larger-than-life show lived up to the billing." [...] Rihanna performed [...] "Rude Boy" [...] at Radio 1's Hackney Weekend on May 24, 2012, as the seventh song on the set list. She also performed the song at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards in a medley with Pon De Replay, What's My Name? and Work.|$|E

They were tall, muscular, broad-shouldered, small <b>waisted</b> and ankled, round-muscled, black-polished--in a word, elegantly powerful. Many of them might have stood as models for Hercules.

6000|$|... "Ah, my dears, in my day, Thaddeus was our hero, and {{we thought}} the scene where he and Miss Beaufort are in the Park a most thrilling one. Two fops ask Thaddeus where he got his boots, and he replies, with {{withering}} dignity, 'Where I got my sword, gentlemen.' I treasured the picture of that episode for a long time. Thaddeus wears a hat as full of black plumes as a hearse, Hessian boots with tassels, and leans over Mary, who languishes on the seat in a short- <b>waisted</b> gown, limp scarf, poke bonnet, and large bag,--the height of elegance then, but very funny now. Then William Wallace in 'Scottish Chiefs.' Bless me! we cried over {{him as much as}} you do over your 'Heir of Clifton,' or whatever the boy's name is. You wouldn't get through it, I fancy; and as for poor, dear, prosy Richardson, his letter-writing heroines would bore you to death.

60|$|That {{night the}} Company slept at St. Leonard's, {{in the great}} monastic barns and spicarium--ground well known both to Alleyne and to John, for they were almost {{within sight of the}} Abbey of Beaulieu. A strange thrill it gave to the young squire to see the well-remembered white dress once more, and to hear the {{measured}} tolling of the deep vespers bell. At early dawn they passed across the broad, sluggish, reed-girt stream--men, horses, and baggage in the flat ferry barges--and so journeyed on through the fresh morning air past Exbury to Lepe. Topping the heathy down, they came of a sudden full in sight of the old sea-port--a cluster of houses, a trail of blue smoke, and a bristle of masts. To right and left the long blue curve of the Solent lapped in a fringe of foam upon the yellow beach. Some way out from the town a line of pessoners, creyers, and other small craft were rolling lazily on the gentle swell. Further out still lay a great merchant-ship, high ended, deep <b>waisted,</b> painted of a canary yellow, and towering above the fishing-boats like a swan among ducklings.|$|E
6000|$|LIEUTENANT. It's HIS voice, I tell you. Let me go. (He breaks away, {{and rushes}} {{to the inner}} door. It opens in his face; and the Strange Lady steps in. She is a very {{attractive}} lady, tall and extraordinarily graceful, with a delicately intelligent, apprehensive, questioning face--perception in the brow, sensitiveness in the nostrils, character in the chin: all keen, refined, and original. She is very feminine, {{but by no means}} weak: the lithe, tender figure is hung on a strong frame: the hands and feet, neck and shoulders, are no fragile ornaments, but of full size in proportion to her stature, which considerably exceeds that of Napoleon and the innkeeper, and leaves her at no disadvantage with the lieutenant. Only her elegance and radiant charm keep the secret of her size and strength. She is not, judging by her dress, an admirer of the latest fashions of the Directory; or perhaps she uses up her old dresses for travelling. At all events she wears no jacket with extravagant lappels, no Greco-Tallien sham chiton, nothing, indeed, that the Princesse de Lamballe might not have worn. Her dress of flowered silk is long <b>waisted,</b> with a Watteau pleat behind, but with the paniers reduced to mere rudiments, as she is too tall for them. It is cut low in the neck, where it is eked out by a creamy fichu. She is fair, with golden brown hair and grey eyes.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Pickering rose, and we strolled {{away into}} the forest, talking of lighter things. At last we reached {{the edge of the}} wood, sat down on a fallen log, and looked out across an {{interval}} of meadow at the long wooded waves of the Taunus. What my friend was thinking of I can't say; I was meditating on his queer biography, and letting my wonderment wander away to Smyrna. Suddenly I remembered that he possessed a portrait of the young girl who was waiting for him there in a white-walled garden. I asked him if he had it with him. He said nothing, but gravely took out his pocket-book and drew forth a small photograph. It represented, as the poet says, a simple maiden in her flower--a slight young girl, with a certain childish roundness of contour. There was no ease in her posture; she was standing, stiffly and shyly, for her likeness; she wore a short- <b>waisted</b> white dress; her arms hung at her sides and her hands were clasped in front; her head was bent downward a little, and her dark eyes fixed. But her awkwardness was as pretty as that of some angular seraph in a mediaeval carving, and in her timid gaze there seemed to lurk the questioning gleam of childhood. [...] "What is this for?" [...] her charming eyes appeared to ask; [...] "why have I been dressed up for this ceremony in a white frock and amber beads?" ...|$|E
