5|$|The {{second major}} {{division}} of the ancestral Pawnees was the Southern, or Black Pawnees. Their migration history is not well documented; but by 1750 they, with the related and allied Wichitas, had established <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be a secure territory on the Arkansas River.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body, with <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, some very good, and reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it had only two arms, and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, {{similar to the ones}} used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{him to be a}} disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and the snap from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.|$|E

5|$|Within a week, United {{squared off}} in their return match against the {{defending}} league champions, Colorado Rapids. The 14 May affair {{ended in a}} 1–1 draw between the two camps as the Rapids' Drew Moor netted a 23rd-minute brace to give the visitors an advantage. The hosts, United, continued to press throughout the match, dominating possession. In the 56th minute, <b>what</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be a certain foul in the box for a penalty from Colorado's Jeff Lorentowictz on D.C.'s Joseph Ngwenya was waved off, resulting in heavy dissent from both {{the players and the}} bench of United. The incident was seemingly hindered in the 62nd minute when the Rapids' Kosuke Kimura collided with United's Chris Pontius. Pontius would subsequently score from the penalty spot, leveling the scoreline and thus giving United a draw.|$|E

25|$|Campbell {{maintained}} {{his place in}} the centre of defence as he took part in England's successful qualification campaign for Euro 2004.

However, referee Urs Meier decided that John Terry had pushed Portuguese goalkeeper Ricardo and instead gave a free-kick. The game ended 2–2 after extra time, and England lost the penalty shoot-out.|$|E
