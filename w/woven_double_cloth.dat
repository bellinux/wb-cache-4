50|$|Grödinge {{tapestry}} (Grödingebonaden) is a handwoven tapestry that is {{on display}} at the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm, Sweden. It originates from Grödinge church in Södermanland. The tapestry is made in a <b>weaving</b> technique called <b>double</b> <b>cloth</b> (finnväv), and it has a symmetrical square pattern in blue and white with lions, birds and eagles or falcons, as well as dragons along the lower edge. All animals are depicted in profile and in the same direction. The dragons along {{the lower part of the}} tapestry are linked to each other with their long tails. The patterns on Grödingebonaden have been associated to patterns from Byzantium, with clear traces of Scandinavian influences. Grödingebonaden consists of two lengths, of which one has remaining edges which shows the weave width to be about 85 cm. The original length for both the tapestries is unknown. The tapestry is made of wool. It has been difficult to date, but it is believed to be manufactured in the 1400s. It stands out for great technical finesse and clear composition, representing the transition between the early medieval textiles made in <b>double</b> <b>cloth</b> (finnväv) and the later ones with strong renaissance elements. A simpler version from Sankt Mårten is in the National Museum of Finland in Helsinki. Other tapestries of the same kind, have been found in Södra Råda and Överenhörna in Sweden, and in Raumo in Finland. The tapestry was donated to the Swedish History Museum in 1910.|$|R
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>cloth</b> or <b>double</b> <b>weave</b> (also doublecloth, double-cloth, doubleweave) {{is a kind}} of {{woven textile}} in which two or more sets of warps and one or more sets of weft or filling yarns are {{interconnected}} to form a two-layered cloth. The movement of threads between the layers allows complex patterns and surface textures to be created.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary couture {{designers}} use [...] "true" [...] <b>double</b> <b>cloth</b> to make self-lined or reversible {{coats and}} jackets by using hand-finishing {{techniques such as}} separating the two layers at the hem and turning the raw edges under. [...] <b>Double</b> <b>cloth</b> garments may also be made reversible by binding or overcasting edges.|$|R

50|$|Distinct stages can be {{identified}} in Voysey's wallpaper and textile designs. His earliest works, through the late 1880s, have historically-influenced traditional repeats. By the mid-1890s, he was creating his most characteristic and original designs, flowing patterns in pastel colourways with flattened silhouettes of birds, florals, and hearts. Designs were used for both wallpaper and textiles, which were often executed as wool <b>double</b> <b>cloths</b> for furnishing.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} 19th century, {{craftsman}} and designer William Morris offered wool and silk <b>double</b> <b>cloth</b> fabrics for furnishing through his firm Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. (later Morris & Co.). These double-woven fabrics had separate warps of wool and silk yarn and were woven by Alexander Morton & Co. of Darvel, Scotland, {{who would later}} weave similar fabrics from designs by C. F. A. Voysey and others.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contemporary}} textile manufacturing, {{the term}} [...] "double cloth" [...] or [...] "true double cloth" [...] is sometimes restricted to fabrics with two warps and three wefts, made up as two distinct fabrics lightly connected {{by the third}} or binding weft, but this distinction is not always made, and double-woven fabrics in which two warps and two wefts interlace to form geometric patterns are also called <b>double</b> <b>cloths.</b>|$|R

The colour pallette had the dominance of black, red and blue with products ranging from dresses, jackets and trenchcoats to name a few.|$|R

Like <b>double</b> <b>weave,</b> it is dark on one side and light on the other but there is only one layer of cloth, therefore it is much lighter in mass and thickness.|$|R

60|$|After {{three or}} four months of the {{scorching}} hot weather had gone by, my friend Strickland, of the Police, saw fit to rent the bungalow from the native landlord. This was before he was engaged to Miss Youghal--an affair which has been described in another place--and while he was pursuing his investigations into native life. His own life was sufficiently peculiar, and men complained of his manners and customs. There was always food in his house, but there were no regular times for meals. He ate, standing up and walking about, whatever he might find at the sideboard, and this is not good for human beings. His domestic equipment was limited to six rifles, three shot-guns, five saddles, and a collection of stiff-jointed mahseer-rods, bigger and stronger than the largest salmon-rods. These occupied one-half of his bungalow, and the other half was given up to Strickland and his dog Tietjens--an enormous Rampur slut who devoured daily the rations of two men. She spoke to Strickland in a language of her own; and whenever, walking abroad, she saw things calculated to destroy the peace of Her Majesty the Queen- Empress, she returned to her master and laid information. Strickland would take steps at once, and the end of his labours was trouble and fine and imprisonment for other people. The natives believed that Tietjens was a familiar spirit, and treated her with the great reverence that is born of hate and fear. One room in the bungalow was set apart for her special use. She owned a bedstead, a blanket, and a drinking- trough, and if any one came into Strickland's room at night her custom was to knock down the invader and give tongue till some one came with a light. Strickland owed his life to her, {{when he was on the}} Frontier, in search of a local murderer, who came in the gray dawn to send Strickland much farther than the Andaman Islands. Tietjens caught the man as he was crawling into Strickland's tent with a dagger between his teeth; and after his record of iniquity was established in the eyes of the law he was hanged. From that date Tietjens wore a collar of rough silver, and employed a monogram on her night-blanket; and the blanket was of <b>double</b> <b>woven</b> Kashmir <b>cloth,</b> for she was a delicate dog.|$|R

5000|$|Vráka (βράκα) are the {{traditional}} breeches {{of the islands}} of Greece from the westernmost Ionian Islands to the easternmost, Cyprus. Greek breeches are extremely roomy and {{are meant to be}} tucked inside long boots just below the knee. They were originally meant to facilitate movement on fishing boats and sailing ships. They are usually accompanied by a long, wide piece of cloth turned many times around the natural waist as a belt. As the vráka lacks pockets, items (such as money) were stored inside the folds of this belt. Vrákas are usually made of sturdy cotton <b>double</b> <b>cloth,</b> usually dark blue or black, with brighter color cloth used as the belt. They were usually worn with white, long-sleeved shirts and a roomy waistcoat.|$|R

50|$|Tablet weaving {{can also}} be used to <b>weave</b> tubes or <b>double</b> <b>weave.</b> The tablets are made to have four levels in the warp, and then two sheds are beat and wefted, one in the top pair of warps, and the other in the bottom pair, before turning the deck. Since groups of tablets can be turned separately, the length, width and joining of the tubes can be {{controlled}} by the weaver.|$|R

50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>Weave</b> Cotton: This gi top {{is made of}} {{significantly}} more fabric than a single weave. It is heavier, harder wearing, and is typically more expensive. The thickness of the gi can {{make it more difficult}} for an opponent to grip the fabric, but the weight of the gi (typically between 650-1050 g/m2) makes them retain more heat. The stiffness of the material can make <b>double</b> <b>weaves</b> more abrasive on the skin of opponents and wearers alike.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe fashion silhouettes {{had been}} {{replaced}} by the material oriented hand-made looks of surfaces of the textile materials after the 1980 s when the plurality of styles started to appear in fashion industry. Textile designers have begun to explore relief effects taking their inspirations from traditional craft techniques of pleating, printing, crochet, shibori and smocking. Nowadays, crafted textiles are highly popular due to their distinctive prominent appearance, hi this study, a survey is executed to obtain relief effects on pictorial fabric surfaces by using elastic yarns combined with yarns of low elasticity, and with different weave structures such as brocade, <b>double</b> <b>cloth,</b> and overshot on hand jacquard weaving loom. As the pieces are hand-woven on jacquard loom, they reveal the weaver's respect to the craft of weaving. The paper concludes with the presentation of fabrics for use as clothing and with implications for fashion design...|$|R
