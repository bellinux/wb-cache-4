Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter stated that [...] " [...] mid-tempo numbers [...] seemed to stall out quickly, where faster offerings like 'Womanizer,' 'I Wanna Go' and 'Toxic' had the sold out crowd jumping {{in place and}} pumping their number twos in the air." [...] August Brown of the Los Angeles Times said [...] "The set's only weak spots were sonic revisions of catalog staples – the Bollywood spy-flick vamp of 'Toxic' remains utterly groundbreaking and didn’t need an Ibiza-inspired revision.".

40|$|AbstractThe orebody roof {{grouting}} <b>water</b> protecting <b>curtain</b> {{technology is}} to drill {{hole in the}} orebody roof {{to enter into the}} limestone strong aquifer, forming grouting <b>water</b> protecting <b>curtain.</b> The reasonable thickness of ore deposit roof <b>water</b> protecting <b>curtain</b> is critical for the effective precautions against permeability of Karst flood deposits and the safety in production during the mine service period. Currently, there is no uniformly distributed water protecting thickness design specifications for the orebody roof curtain grouting. In allusion to the design conditions of the curtain grouting mining for Gujiatai iron ore, this paper utilized coal, tunnel specifications to determine the thickness of <b>water</b> protecting <b>curtain.</b> On this basis, this paper applied numerical analysis method to conduct simulation analysis and calculation for the stability of the <b>water</b> protecting <b>curtain</b> thickness. The results showed that the curtain thickness based on the empirical formula could not meet the watertight requirements, and it should properly increase the thickness of <b>water</b> protecting <b>curtain</b> in accordance with the sphere of stope room mining influence to ensure safety of exploitation, providing a basis and guidance for the design and construction of <b>water</b> protecting <b>curtain,</b> which had certain important theoretical and practical significance for the mining of Karst water ores...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, <b>water</b> <b>curtains</b> {{are often}} {{employed}} in industry to contain flammable or toxic clouds due to accidental releases of process fluids (Deaves, 1983; St-Georges et al., 1992). The action of <b>water</b> <b>curtains</b> consists, essentially, in diluting vapour clouds down to safety level from both toxic effect threshold and lower flammability limit (Mc Quaid et al., 1983). The extent of dilution {{depends on the}} effectiveness of the mechanism involved: dispersion enhancement, owing to the air entrainment and the mixing of entrained air with the vapour released; physical absorption of the released gas, eventually joined to chemical reaction; heating of gas clouds (if gas behaving like heavy ones, due to low temperature, are concerned, e. g. cryogenically liquefied LNG or ammonia gas). Recently it has been observed that the effect of mitigation could be increased by the use of a chemical solution giving a non-reversible reaction with the released substance (Griolet et al., 1995). This research programme aims to design and realize the experimental equipment allowing experimenta 1 simulation of <b>water</b> spray <b>curtain</b> interaction with gas plume; to carry out a complete fluidynamic analysis; to evaluate the effect of physical absorption; to evaluate the effect of combined chemical and physical absorption and, finally, to develop a theoretical model, validated by experimental results and useful in scale-up operation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. This work {{represents}} {{further development}} of earlier received results of simulation of <b>water</b> <b>curtains</b> used as fire protection walls. Subject of the theoretical analysis is the flat fan sprays which flow from the slot-hole sprinkler. The central objective {{of the study is}} to develop calculation method of one of the main parameters of this mathematical model. It is such parameter as the equivalent diameter of droplets of the sprayed water stream. Earlier there was no such calculation procedure, and determination of this parameter was made by means of the difficult experimental measurements. Approach. In this study earlier published literary data are applied to calculation of this parameter. The formula received in the work allows carrying out calculation of called parameter on the basis of design characteristics of drencher installation. The graphic dependences constructed on the formula allowed defining dependence of the equivalent diameter of droplets of the sprayed stream on technical parameters. Findings. Application of this formula to earlier developed mathematical model of thermal shielding allowed expanding its opportunities for practical use.

40|$|The {{mainstream}} {{of the experimental}} work related to the mitigation of disaster consequences is done with steam and <b>water</b> <b>curtains.</b> The disadvantage of steam <b>curtains</b> and <b>water</b> <b>curtains</b> is their use limited only to plant sites. Therefore they are of little use to consequence mitigation of accidents with non fixed sources. In case of a liquid pool forming hazardous compounds it might be advantageous to use foam for suppressing the evaporation of the hazardous compound, thus mitigating the consequences of such accidents. To understand the interactions of foam on cryogenic pools the reaction of frigen 12 / 22 / 114, ammonia, butadiene 1, 3, chlorethene, chlormethane, propane and sulfur dioxide with 18 different types of commercially available foams in laboratory experiments were investigated. In addition large scale field experiments with cryogenic ammonia, propane and frigene 114 were carried out to understand wether any scaling problems occured. Those experiments were carried out with and without different types of foam. In the paper the results are given and discussed. (orig.) Available from TIB Hannover: D. Dt. F.

50|$|Paint {{spray booths}} for {{vehicles}} are typically 100-300 {{feet in length}} and usually contain many robotic and manual spray zones. The temperature and humidity are rigorously controlled in these systems. As items are painted in these booths, {{a certain amount of}} paint does not contact the article being painted and forms a fine mist of paint in the air space surrounding the article. This paint must be removed from the air. To accomplish this, the contaminated air is pulled through the paint spray booth by exhaust fans. A curtain of circulating water is maintained across the path of the air {{in such a way that}} the air must pass through the <b>water</b> <b>curtain</b> to reach the exhaust fans. As the air passes through the <b>water</b> <b>curtain,</b> the paint mist is “scrubbed” from the air and carried to a sump basin (sludge pit), usually located below the paint spray booth.

5000|$|One of Fontana's most {{well known}} works is the {{fountain}} [...] "Sirius" [...] which was located at Escher-Wyss-Platz in Zürich. This fountain sculpture was removed on 18 March 2009. It was constructed from 1969 to 1972, made from bright orange polyester. The sculpture, its appearance resembling two intertwined spiral staircases, was mounted {{in a pool}} with a height {{of just a few}} centimetres. The pool was painted green on the inside. As inspiration for the fountain's dynamics, Annemie Fontana filmed the opening and closing of morning glory flowers in time lapse. The concept for the fountain was modified two times. Originally, the intention was to create continuous <b>curtains</b> of <b>water</b> falling from the edges of half-open pipes which were embedded in the underside of the wings. At the pool's bottom there were two lights illuminating the underside of the sculpture through the water. However, it wasn't possible to achieve the desired appearance of the <b>water</b> <b>curtains</b> and therefore, with the agreement of Annemie Fontana, an attempt was made to change them to a [...] "water comb" [...] by drilling small holes into the pipes. This construction remained prone to malfunctions as the pipes often clogged. Cleaning was an elaborate process and water sprayed out of the pool. Again with the artist's agreement, this led to a thorough conversion. In 1996, the pipes were removed and as a replacement for the <b>water</b> <b>curtains</b> the pool was fitted with two small water jets, each of a height of approximately thirty centimetres. The water jets were additionally illuminated from above by lamps fitted to the sculpture. At night, the fountain was turned off.|$|R
