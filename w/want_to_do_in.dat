5|$|Max Payne 2 {{allows the}} player to enable bullet time, a mode that slows time, while still {{allowing}} the player to aim in real-time, {{to give the}} player more time to determine what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> this mode, the screen's color changes to a sepia tone {{to act as a}} visual cue. When in use, the bullet time meter will decrease until it is either empty or the player disables bullet time mode. The meter will eventually increase when not in use, but can be replenished quickly by killing enemies. To simulate the bullet time effect, Max can also execute a shoot-dodge maneuver. When the maneuver is performed, Max jumps in a direction specified by the player, and although Bullet Time is activated while Max is in mid-air, this will not deplete the bullet time meter. The combat system has been improved for Max Payne 2; the player can now arm Max with a secondary weapon such as a grenade or Molotov cocktail, and when near an enemy, Max can pistol whip them. AI companions can occasionally come to Max's aid, although their deaths do not affect the gameplay or story.|$|E
500|$|This [...] "70/30 Law" [...] was {{not only}} applied to the visual designs for the film, {{but also for the}} sound effects and music. Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique windup toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried [...] "affected his comedy", and [...] "the last thing you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> a story like this is affect performances".|$|E
500|$|Because Johnston was {{believed}} to be safe at the ColdwaterII observation post, the fact that he died shocked his friends and co-workers alike. However, most of his colleagues and family asserted that Johnston died [...] "doing what he wanted to do." [...] His mother stated in an interview shortly after the eruption, [...] "Not many people get to do what they really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> this world, but our son did.... He would tell us he may never get rich but he was doing what he wanted. He wanted to be near if the eruption came. In a phone call on Mother's Day, he told us it's a sight very few geologists get to see." [...] Dr. Stephen Malone agreed that Johnston died doing what he loved, and stated that he [...] "was very good at his work".|$|E

5000|$|In January 2014, Strachan {{told the}} The Daily Beast that President Barack Obama's {{failures}} in Afghanistan and Syria {{have shown that}} he is [...] "chronically incapable" [...] of military strategy. He said, [...] "Bush may have had totally fanciful political objectives {{in terms of trying}} to fight a global War on Terror, which was inherently astrategic, but at least he had a clear sense of what he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the world.

500|$|Overmars enjoyed further {{success in}} the 1994–95 season. Ajax {{retained}} the league and won the UEFA Champions League, beating Milan in the final. He scored against Bayern Munich at the semi-final stage of the latter competition. In later years, Overmars criticised {{the expansion of the}} Champions League to include non league champions: [...] "When I won it with Ajax it was only the teams who finished first who took part. It's not special any more. I think the Champions' League is just a starter for what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the future, create a European League." [...] Overmars' exposure to European football had prompted him to be a sought-after player in England. He knew of Arsenal's interest, but was puzzled as to why a move [...] "didn't work out." [...] In the summer of 1995, he was linked with a move to Manchester United, but said, [...] "No thanks I want to stay with Ajax for two more seasons." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for its depth. IGN's Doug Perry called GoldenEye 007 an immersive game which [...] "blends smart strategy gameplay with fast-action gunmanship". Similarly, Greg Sewart of Gaming Age {{remarked that}} players have [...] "a bit of freedom {{as to what}} they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> any given situation, and what order the directives are completed in". Reviewers also enjoyed the wide variety of weapons and the multi-objective-based missions, stating that they make the game stay [...] "fresh by never having you do the same thing twice". The controls were praised for being more intuitive than Acclaim's earlier well-received Nintendo 64 first-person shooter [...] Game Revolution credited the gameplay for being realistic and different from other shooters, but also criticised the campaign for being badly paced. The publication noted that GoldenEye 007 [...] "takes it for granted that you have already seen the movie" [...] and that players may get stuck due to the game's lack of orientation. At the time, the multiplayer mode was considered the best multiplayer game on the system, [...] "edging Mario Kart 64 by a hair" [...] according to IGN. Edge called it addictive and praised the originality of some of the scenarios such as You Only Live Twice.|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally planned}} {{to add a}} feature that would allow players to craft weapons, but the idea was ultimately discarded. According to Hope, [...] "We thought about what people would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> order to survive. We explored different ideas, {{and one of them}} was fashioning weapons to defend yourself. That was quite early on, but then we realised that this game isn't really about pulling the trigger." [...] Another cancelled feature was the alien's iconic acid blood as a game mechanic, which could melt through metal like in the film. Although the feature was implemented at one point, it was eventually removed from the game because the developers felt it would change the course of the game in a [...] "weird" [...] direction. In addition, the developers considered the possibility for the game to be played from a third-person perspective, but then realised that it would significantly change the experience. Hope explained that it would become [...] "a game about jockeying the camera and looking after your avatar. But in first-person it's you that's being hunted. If you're hiding behind an object and you want to get a better view of your surroundings, you have to move." [...] The actual development of the game took overall four years to complete after the Creative Assembly first pitched the idea to Sega. The game went gold on 9 September 2014 and is dedicated to Simon Franco, a programmer of the game, who died during its development.|$|E

In the video, Badu is seen {{walking the streets}} of Dealey Plaza in Dallas, slowly stripping to the nude, before being shot by an unseen assassin. On her Twitter feed, she stated that the music video [...] "was shot guerrilla style, no crew, 1 take, no closed set, no warning, 2 min., Downtown Dallas, then ran like hell".

Badu has expressed that her video is a criticism of the psychological concept groupthink. On the video's location, Badu expressed that Matt & Kim's video and its [...] "monumental" [...] Times Square setting influenced her to film in Dealey Plaza, which {{is known as the}} site of President John F.

60|$|Now, {{looking at}} the {{question}} of what we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> this broad and general way, it appears to me that it is necessary for us, in the first place, to amend and improve our system of primary education in such a fashion as will make it a proper preparation for the business of life. In the second place, I think we have to consider what measures may best be adopted for the development to its uttermost of that which may be called technical skill; and, in the third place, I think we have to consider what other matters there are for us to attend to, what other arrangements have to be kept carefully in sight in order that, while pursuing these ends, we do not forget that which is the end of civil existence, I mean a stable social state without which all other measures are merely futile, and, in effect, modes of going faster to ruin.|$|E
