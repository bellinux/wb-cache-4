5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, {{which most}} probably contained remains {{taken out of}} the royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke is {{introduced}} in Part I as a young, spiky black-haired teenager {{who wears a}} blue shirt, with a fan representing his clan on his back. He also wears short white pants and the customary Konohagakure head band. Early in the series, a man named Orochimaru brands Sasuke with a cursed seal that causes black marks to cover his body, and later grants him new Cursed Seal powers, which give him gray skin, white hair, and claw-like wings. In Part II, he usually appears wearing a white kimono with black pants. While skilled {{in the use of}} shurikens, in Part II Sasuke wields a chokutō sword <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Kusanagi. Besides using Kusanagi for Kenjutsu, Sasuke can additionally combine it with lightning-based techniques to increase the range of his attacks.|$|E
5|$|The name Efa first appears during Roman rule, {{some time}} {{after the end of}} the 1st century, when a Roman {{fortress}} and small Jewish settlement were established not far from Tel Shikmona. Haifa is also mentioned more than 100 times in the Talmud, a work central to Judaism. Hefa or Hepha in Eusebius of Caesarea's 4th-century work, Onomasticon (Onom. 108, 31), is said to be another name for Sycaminus. This synonymizing of the names is explained by Moshe Sharon, who writes that the twin ancient settlements, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Haifa-Sycaminon, gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names Sycaminon or Sycaminos Polis. References to this city end with the Byzantine period.|$|E

5|$|In the book, Mason Verger runs an orphanage, from <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> {{children}} to verbally abuse {{as a substitute}} for his no longer being able to molest them. He also has a sister, Margot, whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian. When she disclosed her sexual orientation to her family, their father disowned her. As she is sterile due to steroid abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then inherit the Verger fortune. Also, in the novel, Verger literally has no face and has to be kept in a sterile room at all times to keep bacteria from affecting exposed muscle and tissues. At the book's end, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger's guards. Margot, at Lecter's advice, stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted cattle prod, and then kills him by ramming his pet Moray eel down his throat.|$|E
5|$|Bones in the {{secondary}} burial were arranged without respect for anatomical order; it is plausible {{to assume that the}} distribution process was the result of symbolic rituals that indicated the changing of the deceased's role by incorporating him or her into the group of royal ancestors. Pottery vessels were deposited next to {{the secondary}} burial remains; they were fixed on top of food offerings meant as a food supply for the dead, giving evidence for the performance of Kispu (nourishing and caring for one's ancestor through a regular supply of food and drink). Hundreds of pilled vessels provide evidence that the living participated and dined with their ancestors, venerating them. Pfälzner argues for a third burial process <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the tertiary burial; the eastern chamber of the hypogeum was used as an ossuary where human remains and animal bones left from the Kispu were mixed and pilled. Pfälzner conclude that bones left in that chamber were deposited there because they had become useless in funerary rituals, thus the chamber was their final resting place. Bones in the eastern chamber were stored with no respect for the unity of an individual, indicating that the persons buried were now part of the collective group of ancestors; this did not mean that the individuals were no longer cared for, as the many bowls in the chamber indicate the continuation of food offerings to those ancestors.|$|E

He proposes that all three have ‘classical’ Zurvanism as their foundation.|$|E

25|$|This leads Unger to the {{conclusion}} that change happens piecemeal through struggle and vision, rather than suddenly in revolutionary upheaval with the replacement of one set of institutional arrangements with another. Unger theorizes that cumulative change can alter formative contexts, and he goes on to propose a number of such changes as institutional alternatives to be implemented, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> Empowered democracy.|$|E

25|$|Stuart Shapiro divides AI {{research}} into three approaches, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> computational psychology, computational philosophy, and computer science. Computational psychology {{is used to}} make computer programs that mimic human behavior. Computational philosophy, is used to develop an adaptive, free-flowing computer mind. Implementing computer science serves the goal of creating computers that can perform tasks that only people could previously accomplish. Together, the humanesque behavior, mind, and actions make up artificial intelligence.|$|E

25|$|An {{element of}} Kierkegaard's {{critique}} of modernity in his socio-political work, Two Ages, is {{the mention of}} money — <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> an abstraction. An abstraction is something that only has a reality in an ersatz reality. It is not tangible, and only has meaning within an artificial context, which ultimately serves devious and deceptive purposes. It is a figment of thought that has no concrete reality, neither now nor in the future.|$|E

25|$|In section one, Kant argues from {{common sense}} {{morality}} {{to the supreme}} principle of morality, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the categorical imperative. Kant thinks that uncontroversial premises from our shared common sense morality, and analysis of common sense concepts such as ‘the good’, ‘duty’, and ‘moral worth’, will yield the supreme principle of morality, namely, the categorical imperative. Kant’s discussion in section one can be roughly divided into four parts: (1) The good will (2) The teleological argument. (3) The three propositions regarding duty and (4) The categorical imperative.|$|E

25|$|The “history” of Doro’s {{reproductive}} {{colonies in}} <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> “seed villages,” embodies the rationales of Western modernity. Doro also poses these “seed villages” as alternatives to Western modernity, more specifically slavery and colonization. As we see, the moment Anyanwu agrees to Doro’s continuation of his colonial project, she agrees to a patriarchal {{system of governance}} that controls not only her capacity to reproduce, but also whomever Doro chooses. This control of women’s reproduction is not dissimilar from the very same patriarchal governances of reproduction in slavery and colonization. After her agreement, Doro and Anyanwu’s relationship is described in a master-slave/, colonizer/colonized dialectic. In this instance, colonization is linked to patriarchal desires, particularly those of control over reproduction.|$|E

25|$|Gilgamesh {{delivers}} a lamentation for Enkidu, in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> upon mountains, forests, fields, rivers, wild animals, {{and all of}} Uruk to mourn for his friend. Recalling their adventures together, Gilgamesh tears at his hair and clothes in grief. He commissions a funerary statue, and provides grave gifts from his treasury to ensure that Enkidu has a favourable reception {{in the realm of}} the dead. A great banquet is held where the treasures are offered to the gods of the Netherworld. Just before a break in the text there is a suggestion that a river is being dammed, indicating a burial in a river bed, as in the corresponding Sumerian poem, The Death of Gilgamesh.|$|E
25|$|In the 6th century Jordanes named two tribes, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> the Suehans and the Suetidi, {{who lived}} in Scandza. These two names are both {{considered}} {{to refer to the}} same tribe. The Suehans, he says, has very fine horses just as the Thyringi tribe (alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis). The Icelander Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241) wrote of the 6th-century Swedish king Adils (Eadgils) that he had the finest horses of his days. The Suehans supplied black fox-skins for the Roman market. Then Jordanes names the Suetidi which is considered to be the Latin form of Svitjod. He writes that the Suetidi are the tallest of men—together with the Dani, who were of the same stock. Later he mentions other Scandinavian tribes as being of the same height.|$|E

Garak asserts that Sisko included him in the plan {{to do the things that}} Sisko was unwilling to do. Garak also states that Sisko can ease his conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha quadrant may have been saved at the cost of the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal and the self respect of one Starfleet officer, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> a bargain.|$|E
