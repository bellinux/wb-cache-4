5|$|In January 1995, Qubilah Shabazz {{was charged}} with trying to hire an assassin to kill Farrakhan in {{retaliation}} for the murder of her father. Farrakhan surprised the Shabazz family when he defended Qubilah, saying he did not think she was guilty and that he hoped she would not be convicted. That May, Betty Shabazz and Farrakhan shook hands on the stage of the Apollo Theater during a public event intended to raise money for Qubilah's legal defense. Some heralded the evening as a reconciliation between the two, but others thought Shabazz was doing <b>whatever</b> <b>she</b> had to in order to protect her daughter. Regardless, nearly $250,000 was raised that evening. In the aftermath, Shabazz maintained a cool relationship with Farrakhan, although she agreed to speak at his Million Man March that October.|$|E
5|$|On the {{appointed}} day, the White Queen and the Red Queen gather their armies on a chessboard-like battlefield and send Alice and the Jabberwocky {{to decide the}} battle in single combat. Encouraged by the advice of her late father, Alice fights the Jabberwocky among the ruins surrounding the battlefield and finally jumps from {{the remains of a}} spiral staircase onto the Jabberwocky's neck and beheads it. During this fight, a falling masonry stone kills the Jubjub bird. The White Queen banishes the Red Queen and the Knave into exile. After the Hatter performs a celebration dance called Futterwacken, the White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood whose power will bring her <b>whatever</b> <b>she</b> wishes. She decides to rejoin the everyday world, after saying farewell to his friends (especially the Hatter). Back in England, Lord Ascot takes Alice as his apprentice with the idea of establishing oceanic trade routes to Hong Kong. As the story closes, Alice prepares to set off on a trading ship. A light-blue butterfly with dark vein markings lands on her shoulder, and Alice recognizes him as Absolem.|$|E

25|$|On August 11, 1990, a woman {{threw her}} four-month-old {{daughter}} onto {{the tracks of}} the park's monorail. The baby supposedly fell at least eight feet. The event occurred {{at one of the}} monorail's loading stations located at the Anheuser-Busch Hospitality Center. A monorail operator spotted the baby and immediately shut off the power. Although the baby did have extensive injuries to her head, she ultimately recovered. The mother was in an altercation with the baby's father when the baby was reportedly tossed over a fence and into the path of the monorail. Although the mother stated that the baby slipped out of her arms, that claim was dismissed due to the height of the fence. A source stated that the mother confessed to throwing her baby girl onto the tracks in order to prove to the baby's father that it was her baby and she could have done <b>whatever</b> <b>she</b> wanted to her. Both the father and mother were charged with child endangerment.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{wrote the}} opera's libretto, {{in the process}} cutting almost half of Wilde's play, {{stripping}} it down and emphasizing its basic dramatic structure. The structural form of Strauss's libretto is highly patterned, notably {{in the use of}} symmetry and the hierarchical grouping of events, passages, and sections in threes. Examples of three-part structure include Salome's attempt to seduce Narraboth, in order to get him to let her see Jochanaan. She tries to seduce him three times, and he capitulates on the third. When Jochanaan is brought before Salome he issues three prophecies, after which Salome professes love for Jochanaan three times—love of his skin, his hair, and his lips, the last of which results in Jochanaan cursing her. In the following scene Herod three times asks Salome to be with him—to drink, eat, and sit with him. She refuses each time. Later Herod asks her to dance for him, again three times. Twice she refuses, but the third time Herod swears to give her <b>whatever</b> <b>she</b> wants in return and she accepts. After she dances and says she wants Jochanaan's head on a platter, Herod, not wanting to execute the Prophet, makes three offers—an emerald, peacocks, and finally, desperately, the Veil of the Sanctuary of the Holy of Holies. Salome rejects all three offers, each time more stridently insisting on Jochanaan's head. Three-part groupings occur elsewhere on both larger and smaller levels.|$|E

500|$|Genevieve Atkinson is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. Created by former head writer Maria Arena Bell {{as the mother}} of Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard), the role was portrayed by Genie Francis, who was widely known for her three-decade long portrayal of Laura Spencer on ABC's General Hospital. Francis was excited to join the soap opera, expressing disappointment in her former daytime role and saying that her fan base would [...] "follow <b>whatever</b> <b>she</b> does."

500|$|The {{scenes in}} which Candace travels {{back to the}} Phineas and Ferb {{building}} a roller coaster are taken from the pilot episode, [...] "Rollercoaster."

[...] The inclusion was inspired by the [...] episode [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations," [...] in which the Deep Space 9 crew travel back in time to the [...] episode [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles."

500|$|Varian and {{her parents}} began using the farm name [...] "Varian Arabians" [...] in 1954. She {{credited}} her parents for helping her believe that she could do <b>whatever</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to do and}} for trusting her own judgement, which gave her confidence in her own ability to work with horses. They worked as a team to build a horse business; Eric, an electrical contractor, built fences and managed the land, Wenonah studied pedigrees, and Sheila handled the horses. In time, their ranch expanded from 21 to 150 acres. As a young adult, Varian completed college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and taught high school physical education for three years, until 1963, when running the Varian Arabian ranch became her full-time job. The ranch was self-supporting from 1963 on, with the short-term assistance of loans from Sheila's aunt, Dorothy Varian, which were promptly repaid. Ultimately, the ranch grew to 230 acres.|$|E
500|$|Six weeks later, in May 2010, {{she asked}} Swivel {{to work on}} the entire project. Concerning his working {{relationship}} with Beyoncé, he commented, [...] "There was no 'We're doing this today.' It was a very kind of open project, where <b>whatever</b> <b>she</b> felt like recording at that time was what we'd work on. It was based on how she felt, her mood, and also her listening to the demos that writers would give us." [...] With Swivel, she experimented with horns, drums, guitars and percussion instruments. Mostly inspired by the Fela! sessions, Swivel began to formulate beats using their own recordings and those from Fela! The project was moved to KMA Studios for {{a week and a half}} because Roc the Mic was not large enough. There they began recording [...] "I Care", [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] "Rather Die Young", and completed [...] "Party". They recorded the songs [...] "Schoolin' Life", [...] "1+1" [...] and [...] "Start Over" [...] at Jungle City Studios in New York.|$|E
500|$|Francis also {{expressed}} her disappointment in her former daytime role on General Hospital.

What I loved about Laura—and what people loved about Laura—is that she is a terrific memory, but it’s just not there anymore." [...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson. Co-head writer of The Young and the Restless, Scott Hamner, stated that the role {{was going to be a}} [...] "very, very different character than we've seen Genie Francis portray". Bell opened up about hiring Francis, revealing: [...] "Genie is amazing and a real pro. I put pen and paper and she ran with it. She is really a brave, courageous actress" [...] and added that [...] "It really has been fantastic to watch, and I think she is terrific." ...|$|E

[...] He noted that they [...] "get sidetracked" [...] with the blackouts in this episode, and then Gabe asks Johnson to leave. Luna said [...] "that look on his face you see is perhaps a little disappointment in that he started to have a bond with someone he hasn’t killed. I think that face you see is one of—not fear, but definitely concern that the one person who knows that Robbie Reyes is Ghost Rider is now back out there running around, doing <b>whatever</b> <b>she</b> has to do." [...] Whedon called Gabe asking Johnson to leave Robbie [...] "another blow to Daisy and her emotional makeup" [...] as she [...] "has been trying to operate alone, because she doesn’t want to be a danger to anyone else.

500|$|In [...] "another land, far away," [...] "many, {{many years}} ago," [...] {{about the time}} of fairy tales of castles, knights, fair maidens, romance, magic and witches," [...] a mysterious and icily {{beautiful}} woman with magical powers (a 1938 promotional brochure suggests she is able to work her witchcraft having sold [...] "herself body and soul to the bad spirits" [...] of the Harz mountains) has gained her royal position by seducing and marrying the widowed King, giving her rule over his kingdom before he died. [...] "From that time on the cruel Queen ruled all alone, her every word was law, and all trembled in mortal fear of her anger." [...] The vain Queen owned a magical mirror with which she could look upon <b>whatever</b> <b>she</b> wished. The Magic Mirror shows a haunted, smokey face of her familiar demon which replies to the Queen's requests. She regularly asks the mirror who is the fairest in the realm ("Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?"
