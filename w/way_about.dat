5|$|At {{their last}} session, Kaira admits to Jug {{that she has}} grown to like him. Jug {{responds}} that it is normal for a patient to feel this <b>way</b> <b>about</b> his/her therapist and while he likes her too, she is still his patient and he, her psychologist, and a relationship would not be possible. The two share a hug before Kaira leaves.|$|E
5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same <b>way</b> <b>about</b> my manager. So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers that would have allowed for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at the Dunder Mifflin office, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) is {{revealed}} {{to have an}} obsession with soccer, {{and the rest of}} the employees pretend to feel the same <b>way</b> <b>about</b> it. When Jim (John Krasinski) tries claiming to be an experienced soccer player, Dwight (Rainn Wilson), attempting to humiliate Jim, suggests that the staff play a game after work in the parking lot. During the game, when Charles kicks the ball towards Jim, he ducks and the ball hits Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) in the face. Charles berates Jim for ducking, and Dwight mocks him.|$|E

5|$|The third, and final, season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson, Cyrano de Bergerac.

Richardson's other roles in the season were Inspector Goole in An Inspector Calls, Face in The Alchemist and John of Gaunt in Richard II, which he directed, with Alec Guinness in the title role.|$|E
5|$|After their {{conquest of}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, the Japanese {{proceeded}} to march towards {{the city of}} Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there. Perched on a hill (near present Keppel Country Club) along Pasir Panjang Road, the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and waited patiently to ambush the Japanese convoy heading towards the city. Using mounted Bofors guns, they let loose deluge of gunshots causing the Japanese to scramble for cover. The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy {{but they could not}} advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its <b>way.</b> <b>About</b> 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated to the city to join their fellow men for their final stand against the Japanese.|$|E

They {{advanced}} quickly along the main road protected by flank guards; the 36th Jacob's Horse, 11th Cavalry Brigade, capturing some German soldiers along the <b>way.</b> <b>About</b> 100 enemy soldiers retreating {{from the direction of}} Mount Ephraim were captured during this advance, and while moving down the railway through Shatta into Beisan another 100 or more soldiers with three 150-mm howitzers facing eastwards were captured. A line of piquets was established from Afulah to Beisan and another 700 prisoners were captured during the night.|$|E

5|$|Marine {{deposition}} occurred 1200 to 800 Ma, creating thick {{sequences of}} conglomerate, mudstone, and carbonate rock topped by stromatolites, and possibly glacial deposits from the hypothesized Snowball Earth event. Rifting thinned huge roughly linear {{parts of the}} supercontinent Rodinia enough to allow sea water to invade and divide its landmass into component continents separated by narrow straits. A passive margin developed {{on the edges of}} these new seas in the Death Valley region. Carbonate banks formed on this part of the two margins only to be subsided as the continental crust thinned until it broke, giving birth to a new ocean basin. An accretion wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} submerged precipice, entombing the region's first known fossils of complex life. These sandy mudflats gave <b>way</b> <b>about</b> 550 Ma to a carbonate platform which lasted for the next 300 million years of Paleozoic time.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he had never felt that <b>way</b> <b>about</b> her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

25|$|Over 4000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{recorded}} from Slovakia. Of these, nearly 1500 are lichen-forming species. Some of these fungi are undoubtedly endemic, but not enough is known to say how many. Of the lichen-forming species, about 40% have been classified as threatened in some <b>way.</b> <b>About</b> 7% are apparently extinct, 9% endangered, 17% vulnerable, and 7% rare.

25|$|It was {{the site}} of the now defunct Hurst Park horse race course. The 1872 Ordnance Survey map shows a race course marked Molesey Hurst in this position. The {{location}} of the cricket ground was probably in the centre of the racecourse, which was common practice in the 18th century. It was at this ground where the now modern-day East Molesey CC began, although the current ground now lies (albeit still {{on the bank of the}} River Thames) on Graburn <b>Way,</b> <b>about</b> a quarter of a mile further east and a short walk from Hampton Court Palace.|$|E
25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim to have experienced and the effects these experiences have had on their lives. The study was conducted as an online survey with over 2,000 respondents {{from around the world}} participating. The results revealed that around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in a positive <b>way.</b> <b>About</b> 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or been touched by an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E

25|$|In a gravity dam, {{the force}} that holds the dam in place against the push from the water is Earth's gravity pulling down on {{the mass of the}} dam. The water presses {{laterally}} (downstream) on the dam, tending to overturn the dam by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom downstream side of the dam). The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other <b>way</b> <b>about</b> its toe. The designer ensures that the dam is heavy enough that the dam's weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, that is true whenever the resultant of the forces of gravity acting on the dam and water pressure on the dam acts in a line that passes upstream of the toe of the dam.|$|E

I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and that is what I am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
25|$|In fact, Drake {{had been}} {{preparing}} for action since the previous visit by Ranger, taking on volunteers from the Carrickfergus area to boost the crew from 100 to about 160, many of them landsmen who were to be used only for close-quarters combat, {{although there was a}} shortage of ammunition. Absent from the ship's company at this crucial time were the gunner, master's mate, boatswain, and lieutenant. The aging captain, George Burdon, was later reported to have been in poor health himself. Drake got under <b>way</b> <b>about</b> 8am, but with wind and tide against it, made little progress. After an hour or so a boat was therefore sent {{to get a closer look}} at the intruder. Jones opted to try a slight variant of the plan which had failed to capture the customs vessel a few days earlier; hiding most of the crew and the big guns. This time it worked; the crew of the reconnaissance boat was captured, and this success raised the morale of the Americans. One of the prisoners revealed the large number of volunteers who had gone aboard Drake.|$|E
