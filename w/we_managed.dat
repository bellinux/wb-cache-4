5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and <b>we</b> <b>managed</b> to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think <b>we</b> <b>managed</b> to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
25|$|After {{the intense}} touring {{that had been}} taking place through the first two albums, working almost 24 hours a day, basically, <b>we</b> <b>managed</b> to stop and have a proper break, {{a couple of months}} as opposed to a couple of weeks. We decided to go off and rent a cottage to provide a {{contrast}} to motel rooms. Obviously, it had quite an effect on the material that was written... It was the tranquility of the place that set the tone of the album. Obviously, we weren't crashing away at 100 watt Marshall stacks. Having played acoustic and being interested in classical guitar, anyway, being in a cottage without electricity, it was acoustic guitar time... After all the heavy, intense vibe of touring which is reflected in the raw energy of the second album, it was just a totally different feeling.|$|E

500|$|The ship's {{constant}} movement also impacted character animation. Once the ship's movement reached a certain angle, Hansen {{and any other}} characters on deck start to slide, and have to compensate in whatever direction was necessary relative to their position. According to Levastre, this meant Hansen required nine times the animations usually seen in third-person games (center, front, back, left, right and four intermediary positions). Ultimately, Hansen had {{two hundred and fifty}} separate animations, and most of the non-player characters had one hundred and fifty. According to Antonin Delboy, lead animator on the game, [...] "all the technical decisions were taken in favor of animation, both in terms of quality and quantity, which is very rare on this kind of project." [...] Basic animation was produced with 3D Studio Max software. Inverse kinematics were then used to create the nine directional animations, with the engine calculating the level of character compensation depending on the angle of the ship. Each character movement is composed of basic animation and compensation animation, and Delboy says that in total, the game contains more than nine hundred animations, allowing for over five thousand possible movements. Levastre stated [...] "The interaction between the storm and the characters that are on the deck sometimes creates some really breathtaking moments. And on top of that, <b>we</b> <b>managed</b> to offer some really intense action sequences featuring far more enemies than in most horror games." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Selena's third studio album Entre a Mi Mundo and the launch of a {{clothing}} boutique in 1993, the singer and her band began working on Amor Prohibido. Having achieved the success and the fan base that EMI Latin's president Jose Behar was seeking, {{he wanted to take}} advantage of [...] "newly discovered markets". The singer's brother, A.B. Quintanilla, felt it was important that the music he produced for Selena remain [...] "fresh". EMI Latin had insisted on a Grammy Award-winning producer to work with Selena on the album. A.B. later told BuzzFeed how he had to [...] "outdo" [...] himself to remain her principal record producer. Owing to Entre a Mi Mundos commercial success, and its career-launching single [...] "Como la Flor", A.B. found it [...] "difficult" [...] to produce another successful recording. In a 2002 interview he said that writing [...] "a part two" [...] to [...] "Como la Flor" [...] was infeasible so he enlisted Selena y Los Dinos band members Pete Astudillo and Ricky Vela to help with the album's writing process. The result was a [...] "more mature sound [...] " [...] that included experimental recording and production. It was the final album with any production and songwriting assistance by Astudillo, as he parted with Los Dinos to pursue a solo career. The entire production of Amor Prohibido lasted six months beginning on September 17, 1993. It took two weeks for the band to complete its post-production before the album was given a street date of March 13, 1994. Vela noticed the band was becoming stagnant and had to rush the production because of an approaching deadline. Selena's husband and guitarist Chris Pérez, wrote that the constant touring demands and the opening of the boutiques depleted time spent creating Amor Prohibido, saying [...] "I don't even know how <b>we</b> <b>managed</b> to find time to make the next album." [...] Vela {{said in an interview that}} it was common for the band to arrange the sequencing of the entire project in their homes before going into the studio to record the songs.|$|E
500|$|They {{considered}} {{working on}} the show {{to be similar to}} working in a bubble {{due to the lack of}} interference from the Fox network's executives, as is commonplace on other shows. This allowed them to produce any episodes they wanted, as Weinstein commented: [...] "The great thing about The Simpsons is that we pretty much were able to get away with everything, so there weren't any episodes we really wanted to do that we couldn't do. Even the crazy high-concept ones like [...] "Two Bad Neighbors" [...] and [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] <b>we</b> <b>managed</b> to put on the air because honestly there were no network execs there to stop us." [...] Such was the network's limited input, when an executive suggested the staff introduce a new character to live with the Simpsons so as to [...] "liven up the show", the staff rejected the idea and instead created the episode [...] "The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show", inserting the one-time character Roy, with no explanation as to who he was, or why he was living with the family, as a reference to the executive's proposal. The episode, which marked the point at which The Simpsons surpassed The Flintstones for the number of episodes produced for an animated series, was named by the BBC as one of the ten most memorable episodes of the show. They noted [...] "the writers used the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of animation and rail against network interference in their show." [...] The intrusion of the network censors was limited: the normal procedure is for an episode's script to be sent to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted, causing limited problems as often the offending lines are removed or changed for comedic purposes after animation. The episode [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] drew the censor's objections. Its script came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line. The censors stated that they did not like the use of the word [...] "gay", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that [...] "the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for broadcast". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: [...] "acceptable for broadcast".|$|E
