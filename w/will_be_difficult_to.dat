It is expected that if the ionization energy of the element is high enough, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> oxidize and therefore, the most common oxidation state would be 0 (as for other noble gases); nevertheless, this appears {{not to be the}} case.|$|E
5|$|In the {{wilderness}} {{of the dance}} floor, Gaga recognizes the wolf-woman she has become and refuses to misrepresent herself any longer. She notes that in the quiet of the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Air Force {{has made}} plans to retire the A-10 Thunderbolt II, with its close air support mission to be {{initially}} covered by F-16s and F-15Es until it can transition to the F-35A. An inexpensive replacement aircraft may be considered to perform CAS against enemies without sophisticated air defenses. Analysts believe that the Scorpion <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> sell to the Air Force; Textron AirLand believes it can sell without a requirement or lengthy competition. Budget cuts make new programs unattractive, and its missions of irregular warfare, border patrol, maritime surveillance, emergency relief, counter narcotics, and air defense operations are performed by RPAs. However, the Air Force pursued fully developed aircraft, excluding the Scorpion that lacked data {{on the cost of}} sustainment.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Rivers invites Sassoon {{to visit}} the Conservative Club. At the lunch, Rivers realises it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{convince}} Sassoon {{to return to the}} war and does not want to force him. Later, Owen convinces Sassoon to publish his poetry in the hospital magazine The Hydra. During this time, Prior meets Sarah in town and explains why he missed their meetings. Reconciled, they take a train to the seaside and walk along the beach together, where he feels relieved, though he is distracted thinking about the plight of fellow soldiers. Caught in a storm, he and Sarah have sex while sheltering in a bush. Meanwhile, Rivers, exhausted by the taxing work of caring for the shell shocked soldiers, is ordered by his superiors to holiday for three weeks away from Craiglockhart. Rivers' departure resurrects Sassoon's feelings of abandonment when his father left him, and he realises that Rivers has taken the place of his father.|$|E
25|$|At {{the other}} end of the scale, balls that bounce {{slightly}} closer to the batsman than the good length are said to be full pitched or overpitched or described as a half volley. These are often easier for the batsman to play than the good length because they do not have time to move much after bouncing off the seam and, arriving at the batsmen low to the ground, are ideal for drive strokes. However, in conditions favourable to swing bowling full pitched bowling gives the ball more time to move through the air challenging the batsman weigh up the risk of being able to play drives against uncertainty about the swing. Closer still to the batsman's feet is the yorker. An effective yorker's length <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> pick early, forcing the batsman back into the crease. Additionally, because it bounces at the batsmen's feet, a well bowled yorker is not playable by a conventional cricket shot. If the ball fails to bounce at all before reaching the batsman it is labelled a full toss or beam ball. It is very easy for a batsman to play such a delivery as it will not have deviated at all from bouncing off the pitch.|$|E

40|$|If {{a signal}} for physics beyond the Standard Model is {{observed}} at the Tevatron collider or LHC, we <b>will</b> <b>be</b> eager to interpret it. Because only certain observables {{can be studied}} at a hadron collider, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> or impossible <b>to</b> measure masses and spins that could easily establish what physics was being seen. Nevertheless, different underlying physics implies different signatures. We examine the main signatures for supersymmetry, with some emphasis on recognizing supersymmetry in parts of parameter space where generic signatures are reduced or absent. We also consider how to distinguish supersymmetry from alternatives that most closely resemble it, such as Universal Extra Dimensions (UED). Using the robust connection between spins and production cross section, we think it <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish UED from supersymmetry. We expect that by considering patterns of signatures {{it is very likely}} that it <b>will</b> not <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> find a compelling interpretation of any signal of new physics.

25|$|The test {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} danger never matched the practical realities facing individuals where {{the consequences of}} a refusal to marry might not be immediate, but nevertheless serious. In Hirani v Hirani (1982) 4 FLR 332, the Court of Appeal considered the case of a nineteen-year-old Hindu woman who was dating a Muslim man. Her parents told the petitioner that unless she married a Hindu of their choosing, she would be ostracized socially from her family and left to fend for herself. Under the circumstances, the Court agreed that the petitioner had acted without full consent in marrying her parents' choice of husband. Thus, it is for the courts of all countries {{to strike a balance between}} well-intentioned parental authority to arrange marriages in the face of a reluctant child, and unreasonable threats that would overbear the will of any reasonable person, while maintaining the trust of local communities whose cultures have included arranged marriages for centuries. As to transnational recognition, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> disturb the validity of the marriage if no complaint of coercion was made around the time the ceremony was performed in the lex loci celebrationis or immediately the parties entered the state where proceedings were commenced. It would be more usual to use the local divorce system to terminate the relationship.|$|E
25|$|It is {{just before}} dawn. Four priests are {{mourning}} {{the death of}} King Séthos. They wish he had died an honourable death in battle, but the terrible truth {{is that he was}} murdered by the brother he loved. Dawn breaks as Queen Nephté arrives with her young son to pay tribute to her dead husband. Nephté says that it is only the thought of her child which keeps her alive, otherwise life is barren for her without Séthos. She asks the priests to reveal who killed him. When the arrival of her brother-in-law Pharès is announced, the priests are horrified and Nephté begins to suspect he is the murderer. Pharès tries to flatter Nephté. He also claims it was Séthos' dying wish that he should become her new husband. Nephté admits this is true but she thinks it wrong to talk of marriage while Séthos is still unavenged. However, Pharès seems reluctant to search for the assassin, but at Nephté's insistence he finally agrees to swear on his brother's tomb that he will bring the criminal to justice. The priests are shocked at this sacrilege. After Pharès has left, the chief priest Amédès reveals what Nephté has suspected: Pharès is the killer. Nephté demands vengeance, but she also fears for her son's safety. Amédès agrees to hide the boy among the tombs. He says it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> get revenge because Pharès is both respected and feared by the Egyptians. The temple opens as the statesmen and common people arrive for Séthos' funeral rites. The temple girls reveal that Sethos is now an immortal in heaven. Nephté implores the Egyptians to avenge her husband. They swear on the altar to do so. Amédès says he will reveal the murderer's name that evening.|$|E

[...] According to the OPCW chief, one abandoned site is in rebel-held territory and routes to others lead through rebel-held territory.

500|$|Frequencies {{which are}} {{sufficiently}} low {{are not easily}} localized by humans, hence many stereo and multichannel audio systems feature only one subwoofer channel and a single subwoofer can be placed off-center without affecting the perceived sound stage, since the sound produced <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> localize. The intention in a system with a subwoofer is often to use small main speakers (of which there are two for stereo and five or more for surround sound or movie tracks) and to hide the subwoofer elsewhere (e.g. behind furniture or under a table), or to augment an existing speaker to save it from having to handle woofer-destroying low frequencies at high levels. This effect is possible only if the subwoofer is restricted to quite low frequencies, usually taken to, say, 100Hz and below—still less localization is possible if restricted to even lower maximum frequencies. [...] Higher upper limits for the subwoofer (e.g., 125Hz) are much more easily localized, making a single subwoofer impractical.|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} {{with the two}} larger coins, little attention {{was given to the}} half eagle and quarter eagle until late 1907. [...] On November 28, 1907, Treasury Secretary George Cortelyou wrote in a letter that the double eagle design was to be used for the two small gold pieces. [...] On December 2, Mint Director Frank Leach instructed the Philadelphia Mint to prepare coinage dies for the small pieces, using the double eagle design. [...] Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber replied [...] a week later that {{it would be difficult to}} put all the legends that were required by law on the new pieces, such as the name of the country. [...] On the double eagle, [...] "E Pluribus Unum" [...] is placed on the edge, an impractical setting on pieces about the size of the nickel and dime. [...] Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis forwarded Barber's letter to Leach with his own note, stating, [...] "I know it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> put the inscription 'E Pluribus Unum' on the periphery of a quarter eagle, but I do not see where else it can [...] and we must try to do it".|$|E
500|$|According to Rimsky-Korsakov, {{the other}} members of the Five showed little enthusiasm for the symphony, and less still for the quartet. Nor was his public debut as a conductor, at an 1874 charity concert where he led the {{orchestra}} in the new symphony, considered favorably by his compatriots. He later wrote that [...] "they began, indeed, to look down upon me as one on the downward path". Worse still to Rimsky-Korsakov was the faint praise given by Anton Rubinstein, a composer opposed to the nationalists' music and philosophy. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote that after Rubinstein heard the quartet, he commented that now Rimsky-Korsakov [...] "might amount to something" [...] as a composer. He wrote that Tchaikovsky continued to support him morally, telling him that he fully applauded what Rimsky-Korsakov was doing and admired both his artistic modesty and his strength of character. Privately, Tchaikovsky confided to Nadezhda von Meck, [...] "Apparently [...] is now passing through this crisis, and how it will end <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> predict. Either a great master will come out of him, or he will finally become bogged down in contrapuntal tricks".|$|E

500|$|By May 2014, the Beverly Hills City Council {{passed a}} {{resolution}} urging the Sultan of Brunei to sell the Beverly Hills Hotel. Lili Bosse, the mayor of Beverly Hills at the time, welcomed the resolution and added {{that she had made}} a [...] "personal decision" [...] not to return to the hotel until the situation had been solved. The decision was lauded by Rabbi Laura Geller of Temple Emanuel, where Bosse is a congregant. By then the Jewish Journal reported that [...] "more than $2 million worth of events have been canceled at the Beverly Hills Hotel by dozens of groups." [...] Dorchester Collection Chief Executive Officer Christopher Cowdray then responded to the controversy by asking the public to consider the issue at hand in a broader perspective, citing the fact that many brands are backed by foreign investors. Sharia law exists alongside other normative systems and has been adopted by many other Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia which has major investments in the American hospitality industry, including the Four Seasons and Fairmont hotel chains. Adweek declared that [...] "the bad press and protests have tarnished the glamorous image of the Beverly Hills Hotel, {{one of the most famous}} hotels in the world" [...] and added that [...] "such extreme brand damage <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> repair".|$|E
500|$|Professor Shiela Bird, a {{statistician}} at the Medical Research Council, {{suggested the}} ban of mephedrone {{may lead to}} more cocaine-related deaths. In {{the first six months}} of 2009, the number of cocaine-related deaths fell for the first time in four years, and fewer soldiers tested positive for cocaine in 2009 than in 2008. She suggested this may have been due to users switching to mephedrone from cocaine, but cautioned that before full figures are available for 2009 and 2010, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> determine whether mephedrone saved lives, rather than cost them. Other supposedly legal drugs have filled the gap in the market since mephedrone was made illegal, including naphyrone (NRG-1) (since made illegal) and Ivory Wave, which has been found to contain MDPV, a compound made illegal at the same time as mephedrone. However, some products branded as Ivory Wave possibly do not contain MDPV. When tested, some products sold six weeks after mephedrone was banned, advertised as NRG-1, NRG-2 and MDAI, were found to be mephedrone. A Drugscope survey of drugs workers at the end of 2012 reported that mephedrone use was still widespread in the UK and that there increasing reports of problematic users. It was being taken as not only a [...] "poor man's cocaine" [...] but also amongst users of heroin and crack cocaine. Cases of intravenous use were also reported to be on the increase.|$|E
