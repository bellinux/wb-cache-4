Hill had initially auditioned for another role in the film, but was unavailable as he was shooting another film at the same time. Blitz was keen to have him appear, though, and so <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> small role as the Junior Philosopher, appearing in only two scenes.|$|E
5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay {{received}} numerous {{letters from}} fans of Allah jang Palsoe, spurring {{him to continue}} writing. Considering the play too difficult for native troupes to stage, when one such troupe, the Union Dalia Opera, requested permission to perform it, Kwee Tek Hoay instead wrote a new story for them. This later became his best-selling novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang). Another of Kwee Tek Hoay's stage dramas, Korbannja Kong-Ek, {{was inspired by a}} friend, who <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter asking for another comforting and educational play after reading Allah jang Palsoe.|$|E
5|$|His wartime {{experiences}} led Fitch {{to decide}} to become a physicist. Robert Bacher, {{the head of the}} physics division at Los Alamos, offered him a graduate assistantship at Cornell University, but first he needed to complete his undergraduate degree. Rather than return to Northwestern or Carnegie Mellon, he elected to enter McGill University, which Titterton had recommended. Fitch graduated from McGill with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1948. On the advice of Jerry Kellogg, who had been a student of Rabi's at Columbia University, and was a division head at the Los Alamos, Fitch decided to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia. Kellogg <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter of introduction to Rabi. James Rainwater became his academic supervisor. Rainwater gave him a paper by John Wheeler concerning mu-mesic atoms, atoms in which an electron is replaced by a muon. These had never been observed; they were completely theoretical and {{there was no evidence that}} they existed, but it made a good thesis topic.|$|E

5|$|Reginald {{was elected}} Bishop of Bath in late April 1173, and was consecrated 23 June 1174. However, Henry the Young King {{challenged}} the election, {{on the grounds}} of illegitimacy and an uncanonical election. Reginald went to Rome in the company of Richard of Dover, who had just been elected Archbishop of Canterbury and was facing a challenge from the Young King to his election. Reginald was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 18 April 1174 with Walter Map alleging bribery as the only reason the election was confirmed. Ralph de Diceto, however, states that Reginald swore an oath that he was uninvolved in the death of Becket and that his birth took place before his father became a priest. During the dispute, Reginald's friend Peter of Blois <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter, which is still extant, encouraging him to persevere.|$|E
5|$|The RF united behind Field after Sandys <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> terse letter warning him of {{the likely}} Commonwealth {{reaction}} to a declaration of independence, but the Prime Minister then lost his party's confidence by failing to pursue a possible route to at least de facto independence devised by Desmond Lardner-Burke, a lawyer and RF MP for Gwelo. During March 1964, the Legislative Assembly in Salisbury considered and passed Lardner-Burke's motion that the Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, should submit a petition to the Queen requesting alteration of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution so that the Royal Assent described therein would be exercised {{at the request of}} the Southern Rhodesian government rather than that of its British counterpart. This would both remove the possibility of British legislative interference and pave the way for an attempted assumption of independence by Order in Council.|$|E

25|$|Eden's eldest son, Pilot Officer Simon Gascoigne Eden, {{went missing}} in action and was later {{declared}} dead, while serving as a navigator with the RAF in Burma, in June 1945. There was a close bond between Eden and Simon, and Simon's death was a great personal shock to his father. Mrs. Eden reportedly reacted to her son's loss differently, and {{this led to a}} breakdown in the marriage. De Gaulle <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> personal letter of condolence in French.|$|E
25|$|He studied {{mathematics}} and {{physics at the}} University of Hong Kong. He received a Commonwealth scholarship and went to Imperial College London, where he studied meteorology instead of physics for the fear that physics would lead to wars. After a few months, {{he decided to go}} to the United States. The lecturer <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter of recommendation, saying that he was his best post-war student. However, he had only studied at Princeton University for three weeks before dropping out, saying that he wanted to get a job instead of studying theories.|$|E
25|$|The Allied {{occupation}} of the Rhineland {{was coming to an}} end, and de Gaulle's battalion was due to be disbanded, although the decision was later rescinded after he had moved to his next posting. De Gaulle wanted a teaching post at the École de Guerre in 1929. There was apparently a threat of mass resignations on the faculty if he was appointed to a position there. There was talk of a posting to Corsica or North Africa, but on Pétain’s advice he accepted a two-year posting to Lebanon and Syria. In Beirut he was chief of the 3rd Bureau (military operations) of General Louis-Paul-Gaston de Bigault du Granrut, who <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> glowing reference recommending him for high command in the future.|$|E

25|$|Both Theophilus and Susannah Maria {{were members}} of the Drury Lane theatre company managed by Cibber. From 1735, Cibber began drawing his wife's {{earnings}} from the theatre personally, ignoring the marriage settlement, and by 1737 he was even selling her clothes and personal effects to make money. In 1738, the couple were involved in a notorious lawsuit which drew public attention to Cibber's connivance in his wife's adultery. The Cibbers had established a ménage à trois with John Sloper, a country squire, from whom Theophilus accepted money. The three of them set up house together in Kensington, for which Sloper paid the rent and maintenance, until Cibber slipped away to France to escape his creditors. To his dismay, Susannah Maria <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter to say that she was leaving him for Sloper.|$|E
25|$|The Germans had {{recently}} added 300 battalions to their forces by intensive mobilisation, and Haig claimed (3 March) {{that with the}} BEF spread more thinly by having taken over line to the south, these forces {{might be used to}} attack at Ypres and cut him off from the Channel Ports. Assuming Haig was inventing this threat, Nivelle <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter, addressing him as a subordinate, and revived the idea of a British staff at GQG, this time reporting to Robertson, but through whom Nivelle would issue orders to Haig. Nivelle now demanded that the BEF be split into two Army Groups or else that Haig be sacked and replaced by Gough. Nivelle also believed that Lloyd George hoped to become Allied Commander-in-Chief, a suggestion so absurd that it caused President Poincaré to laugh.|$|E
25|$|Al-Mu'tazz's brother Abu Ahmad was put {{in charge}} of the Samarran forces at the {{beginning}} of the war. He was charged by the caliph with defeating al-Musta'in and Muhammad b. 'Abdallah, and was given the authority to command the army in any manner he pleased. Abu Ahmad's overall strategy was to keep Baghdad under constant attack from his troops, and to gain the surrender of the city by either assaulting it or starving its inhabitants until they lost the will to fight any longer. Toward this end, al-Mu'tazz sent armies to secure the neighboring towns that controlled access to Baghdad, and Abu Ahmad attempted to halt and seize any revenue shipments heading toward the city. The way in which Abu Ahmad ran the siege was not unquestionably accepted by al-Mu'tazz, who reportedly <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter in the middle of the war complaining of his lack of progress in forcing al-Musta'in's capitulation, but he remained in command of the main besieging force throughout the entire conflict.|$|E

25|$|One of Reilly's {{claims is}} that he went behind enemy lines to attend a German High Command conference (see below). However, Cook in chapter 6 {{effectively}} debunks this by revealing that Reilly's activities between 1915 and 1918 (reference only) precluded such an escapade. Further, author Richard Spence in Trust No One, states that Reilly lived in New York City {{for at least a}} year, 1914–15, where he engaged in arranging munitions sales to both the Germans and the Imperial Russian Army. This is confirmed by papers of Norman Thwaites, MI1c Head of Station in New York, which contain evidence that Reilly approached Thwaites seeking a job in 1917–1918. Thwaites was reportedly sufficiently impressed with Reilly that he <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter of recommendation to Mansfield Cumming, head of MI1c. It was also Thwaites who recommended that Reilly first visit Toronto to obtain a military commission, which is why Reilly joined the Royal Canadian Flying Corps.|$|E
25|$|In early 1865 Pai Mārire leader Te Ua Haumēne {{sent two}} prophets, Kereopa Te Rau and Patara Raukatauri, to convert East Coast tribes. Kereopa, an ageing {{veteran of the}} Waikato wars, carried with him the head of Captain P.W.J. Lloyd, {{who had been killed}} in the Ahuahu attack of April 1864 in Taranaki. Kereopa had lost his family in the bloody British raid on Rangiaowhia the {{previous}} year and blamed much of the massacre of women and children on missionary complicity, so he and his followers sought utu, or revenge, against missionaries. In Whakatane he demanded that Ngāti Awa iwi hand over the local Roman Catholic priest; without waiting for a result the pair continued on to Opotiki, where they succeeded in winning the allegiance of local Māori from the Whakatohea iwi to the Pai Mārire creeds. German-born Lutheran missionary Carl Sylvius Volkner, who had lived in Opotiki for four years, was absent in Auckland and Patara, believing the cleric was acting as a government spy, <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter stating that missionaries would henceforth not be permitted to live among Māori and ordered him not to return. Ignoring warnings that his life was in danger, Volkner sailed back to Opotiki, arriving on 1 March. The schooner was looted and Volkner and another missionary, Thomas Grace, were taken captive. The following day Volkner was hanged, then beheaded. In a church service that followed, Kereopa swallowed Volkner's eyes—momentarily choking on one of them—and passed around a chalice containing the missionary's blood for it to be consumed by his congregation. Grace remained captive for two weeks before escaping.|$|E
500|$|Trevelyan {{claimed that}} Reeves later <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter admitting that the cuts {{were not as}} harmful as he had expected. No copy of the letter has ever surfaced, and based on several other {{comments}} the director subsequently made about how the edits [...] "ruined the film", Reeves's biographer Benjamin Halligan believes Trevelyan may have somehow [...] "misremembered" [...] {{the existence of this}} letter, confusing it with an earlier missive from the director in which he made a plea for the BBFC's leniency.|$|E

Kościuszko concluded that Napoleon had created the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807 only as an expedient, not because he supported Polish sovereignty.

500|$|In early 1874, Riley {{returned}} to Greenfield {{to become a}} writer full-time. In February he submitted a poem entitled [...] "At Last" [...] to the Danbury News, a Connecticut newspaper. The editors accepted his poem, paid him for it, and <b>wrote</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter encouraging him to submit more. Riley found the note and his first payment inspiring. He began submitting poems regularly to the editors, but after the newspaper shut down in 1875, Riley was left without a paying publisher. He began traveling and performing with the Adelphians around central Indiana to earn an income while he searched for a new publisher. In August 1875 he joined another traveling tonic show run by the Wizard Oil Company.|$|E
