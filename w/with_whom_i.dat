Harper was sceptical about the Reform Party's United Alternative initiative in 1999, arguing that it would serve to consolidate Manning's hold on the party leadership.

Still walking a mile a day at nearly 90, she died in her chair in the morning of 25 December 1634, aged 91. Widely mourned as a symbol of a by-gone age, she wished to be buried [...] "at Warwick by my dear lord and husband the Earl of Leicester <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> desire to be entombed".

500|$|As a young woman, Elizabeth Cady met Henry Brewster Stanton {{through her}} early {{involvement}} in the temperance and the abolition movements. Henry Stanton was an acquaintance of Elizabeth Cady's cousin, Gerrit Smith, an abolitionist {{and member of the}} [...] "Secret Six" [...] that supported John Brown's raid at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Stanton was a journalist, an antislavery orator, and, after his marriage to Elizabeth Cady, an attorney. Despite Daniel Cady's reservations, the couple was married in 1840, with Elizabeth Cady requesting of the minister that the phrase [...] "promise to obey" [...] be removed from the wedding vows. She later wrote, [...] "I obstinately refused to obey one <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> supposed I was entering into an equal relation." [...] The couple had six children between 1842 and 1856.

Mahomet becomes convinced that Bassa, with Irene's complicity, is plotting against him. Two of Abdalla's captains kill Irene, but with her dying words she reveals that Bassa's true accomplice was the Greek soldier Demetrius, Aspasia's lover, who has safely escaped with his loved one. On learning that Irene had not been conspiring against him, Mahomet is distraught:MAHOMET:Robb'd of the maid, <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> wish'd to triumph,No more I burn for fame or for dominion;Success and conquest now are empty sounds,Remorse and anguish seize on all my breast;Those groves, whose shades embower'd the dear Irene,Heard her last cries, and fann'd her dying beauties,Shall hide me from the tasteless world for ever.(Irene V. xii. ll. 42–48) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} the films saw a surge of {{interest}} in The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien's other works, vastly increasing his impact on popular culture. It was rumored that the Tolkien family became split on the series, with Christopher Tolkien and his son Simon Tolkien feuding {{over whether or not}} it was a good idea to adapt. Christopher has since denied these claims, saying, [...] "My own position is that The Lord of the Rings is peculiarly unsuitable to transformation into visual dramatic form. The suggestions that have been made that I 'disapprove' of the films, even to the extent of thinking ill of those <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> may differ, are wholly without foundation." [...] He added that he had never [...] "expressed any such feeling".

500|$|In 1891, {{after many}} failed {{attempts}} at reconciliation by the pair, Tom Chappell, the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, {{stepped in to}} mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded. [...] Two more operas resulted: Utopia, Limited (1893) and The Grand Duke (1896). Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (His Excellency, 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting Nancy McIntosh, his protegée from Utopia, led to Sullivan's refusal. Utopia, concerning an attempt to [...] "anglicise" [...] a south Pacific island kingdom, was only a modest success, and The Grand Duke, in which a theatrical troupe, {{by means of a}} [...] "statutory duel" [...] and a conspiracy, takes political control of a grand duchy, was an outright failure. After that, the partnership ended for good. Sullivan continued to compose comic opera with other librettists but died four years later. In 1904, Gilbert would write, [...] "...Savoy opera was snuffed out by the deplorable death of my distinguished collaborator, Sir Arthur Sullivan. When that event occurred, I saw no one <b>with</b> <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> felt that I could work with satisfaction and success, and so I discontinued to write libretti." ...|$|E
