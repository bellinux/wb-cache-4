That was the date when Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect plutonium. Blandy {{was aware of the}} health problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, and the fact that plutonium <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> have a similar biological effect. When plutonium was discovered in the captain's quarters of Prinz Eugen, unaccompanied by fission products, Blandy realized that plutonium could be anywhere.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, Jeremiah Horrocks {{published}} a reasonably accurate {{model of the}} Moon's motion in which the Moon <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> follow a precessing elliptical orbit. A sufficiently accurate and simple method for predicting the Moon's motion would have solved the navigational problem of determining a ship's longitude; in Newton's time, {{the goal was to}} predict the Moon's position to 2' (two arc-minutes), which would correspond to a 1° error in terrestrial longitude. Horrocks' model predicted the lunar position with errors no more than 10 arc-minutes; for comparison, the diameter of the Moon is roughly 30 arc-minutes.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-4b's {{discovery}} was announced on January 4, 2010. It {{is the size}} of planet Neptune, at 0.077 MJ (7% the mass of Jupiter) and 0.357 RJ (36% the radius of Jupiter). The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. This distance compares to planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12.

This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical gravitation, electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|Until {{late in the}} 20th century, the {{temperature}} of Eta Carinae <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be over 30,000K {{because of the presence}} of high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.|$|E
5|$|A fossil {{discovered}} in the Horse Room of the Salamander Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota may possibly be C.dirus; if so, this fossil {{is one of the}} earliest specimens on record. It was catalogued as Canis cf. C.dirus (where cf. in Latin means confer, uncertain). The fossil of a horse found in the Horse Room provided a uranium-series dating of 252,000 yearsYBP and the Canis cf. dirus specimen <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be from the same period. C.armbrusteri and C.dirus share some characteristics (synapomorphies) that imply the latter's descent from the former. The fossil record suggests C.dirus originated around 250,000YBP in the open terrain of the mid-continent before expanding eastward and displacing its ancestor C.armbrusteri. The first appearance of C.dirus would therefore be 250,000YBP in California and Nebraska, and later {{in the rest of the}} United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru, but the identity of these earliest fossils is not confirmed.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, King Christian VIII of Denmark {{died and}} his only son, Frederick ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, {{had been through}} two {{unsuccessful}} marriages, and <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein, and the succession rules of each territory differed. In Holstein, the Salic law prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia. In 1852, the great powers called a conference in London to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own mother-in-law, brother-in-law and wife) were surrendered.|$|E

The film remained in development and <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be in development hell until 2011, when it was reported that Jim Sheridan was interested in directing the movie.

5|$|Kepler-4b orbits {{its host}} star in 3.213 {{days at a}} {{distance}} of 0.046 AU. This places it almost 10 times closer to its star than Mercury is to the Sun. Consequently, Kepler-4b is thought to be extremely hot, with an equilibrium temperature greater than 1700 kelvins (2600°F). The planet is estimated to be 25 times more massive than the Earth with a radius that is 4 times greater than the Earth. This makes it similar to Neptune in terms of size and mass, but with a temperature that is not comparable to any planet in the Solar System (Venus, the hottest planet, is only 735 kelvins). Kepler-4b's eccentricity <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be 0, however an independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12, and a later reanalysis of the light curve discovered a secondary eclipse with depth 7.47 ± 1.82ppm at a phase of about 0.7.|$|E
5|$|Leif's {{successful}} expedition in Vinland encouraged other Norsemen to {{also make}} the journey. The first apparent contact between the Norse and the indigenous people, who the Norse later referred to as skrælingjar, was made by his brother Thorvald, and resulted in hostilities and killing. In the end there were no permanent Norse settlements in Vinland, although sporadic voyages at least to Markland for forages, timber and trade possibly lasted for centuries. The casual tone of references to these areas may suggest that their discovery was not seen as particularly significant by contemporaries, or that it <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be public knowledge, or both. Knowledge of the Vinland journeys might have spread around medieval Europe, as writers such as Adam of Bremen made mention of remote lands to the west. It {{has been suggested that}} the knowledge of Vinland might have been maintained in European seaports in the 15th century, and that Christopher Columbus, who claimed in a letter to have visited Iceland in 1477, could have heard stories of it.|$|E
5|$|Portuguese traders reached Sri Lanka by 1505 {{where their}} initial forays were against the {{south-western}} coastal Kotte kingdom {{due to the}} lucrative monopoly on trade in spices that the Kotte kingdom enjoyed that was also {{of interest to the}} Portuguese. The Jaffna kingdom {{came to the attention of}} Portuguese officials in Colombo for multiple reasons which included their interference in Roman Catholic missionary activities, (which <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be patronizing Portuguese interests) and their support to anti-Portuguese factions of the Kotte kingdom, such as the chieftains from Sittawaka. The Jaffna Kingdom also functioned as a logistical base for the Kandyan kingdom, located in the central highlands without access to any seaports, as an entrypot for military aid arriving from South India. Further, due to its strategic location, it was feared that the Jaffna kingdom may become a beachhead for the Dutch landings. It was king Cankili I who resisted contacts with the Portuguese and even massacred 600-700 Parava Catholics in the island of Mannar. These Catholics were brought from India to Mannar to take over the lucrative pearl fisheries from the Jaffna kings.|$|E

Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form that most of them survive.

5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting {{man at the}} same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E
5|$|Theropods, {{including}} spinosaurids, {{could not}} pronate their hands (rotate the forearm so the palm faced the ground), but a resting {{position on the}} side of the hand was possible, as shown by fossil prints from an Early Jurassic theropod.

The reconstruction used in the study was an extrapolation based on different sized individuals, scaled to what <b>was</b> <b>assumed</b> <b>to</b> be the correct proportions. Palaeontologist John Hutchinson of the Royal Veterinary College of the University of London has expressed scepticism to the new reconstruction, and cautioned that using different specimens can result in inaccurate chimaeras. Scott Hartman also expressed criticism because he believed the legs and the pelvis were inaccurately scaled (27% too short) and didn't match the published lengths. However, responses from Ibrahim et al. to Mark Witton have been positively received as reliable. The 2015 re-description of Sigilmassasaurus Evers et al. 2015 doubted whether the material assigned to Spinosaurus by Ibrahim et. al. belonged to it.|$|E
