5|$|The {{massacre}} at Rock Springs led to other incidents of anti-Chinese aggression, primarily in Washington Territory, {{though there were}} incidents in Oregon and other states as well. Near Newcastle, Washington a mob of whites burned down the barracks of 36 Chinese coal miners. Throughout the Puget Sound area, Chinese workers <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> out of communities and subject to violence in Washington cities and towns, including Tacoma, Seattle, Newcastle, and Issaquah. Chinese workers <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> out of other Washington towns, but sources indicated, as early as 1891, that the above events were specifically connected to the wave of violence touched off at Rock Springs.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 640s, the Irish monk Fursey, having {{spent a year}} as a hermit, left East Anglia for Gaul. His monastery at Cnobheresburg (identified by some with Burgh Castle) was left in the hands of his half-brother, Foillan. In 651, shortly after his departure, the heathen threat he had {{foreseen}} became a reality, when Foillan and his community <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> out by Penda's forces and Anna, who encountered Penda at Cnobheresburg, was exiled.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the forces}} {{stationed}} in the Middle East provinces of Judaea and Syria had acclaimed Vespasian as emperor and the Danubian armies of the provinces of Raetia and Moesia also acclaimed Vespasian as emperor. Vespasian's and Vitellius' armies met in the Second Battle of Bedriacum, after which the Vitellian troops <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> back into their camp outside Cremona, which was taken. Vespasian's troops then attacked Cremona itself, which surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{fighting}} was very close, many of the Confederates were killed before {{they had a chance}} to retreat. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry drove the rebels {{to the end of the}} field, only to be partially driven back by a second group of Confederate cavalrymen. After the regiment was reinforced by the rest of Capehart's brigade, the Confederates <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> from the area, and numerous battle flags were captured.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} state workers grew from 12,000 to 70,000 during Kirchner's administration. The {{creation}} of private-sector {{jobs in the}} province was minimal, and private companies <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> away. A local journalist interviewed by journalist Jorge Lanata said that this placed de facto restrictions on economic freedom and allowed Kirchner to control the population. Most available jobs were in public works.|$|E

5|$|The pygmy {{blue whale}} formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the Last Glacial Maximum. This is likely because blue whales <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> north by {{expanding}} ice, {{and some have}} stayed there ever since. The pygmy blue whale's evolutionarily recent origins cause it to have a relatively low genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|These {{advances}} {{took place}} under Swedish artillery fire. From 21 March until 29 March (when, according to Aleksander Myshlayevsky, the Russians began firing their artillery), 66 bombs and 1,200 round shots were released by Swedish artillery. Also, the Swedes attempted a ground assault, but <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> {{back into the}} fort.|$|E
5|$|When Miranda {{attacked}} that morning, Coburg's {{first reaction}} was to draw substantial troops from his center to reinforce his right flank. Initially, Archduke Charles' men <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> back to Dorsmael but then they {{held on to the}} village. The French Reserve captured Leau and threatened Halle but was soon thrown back. The main fighting occurred between 3:00 and 6:00 PM when Miaczinski's column seized Dorsmael but counterattacks drove his soldiers out. Other attacks withered {{in the face of the}} strong Coalition defenses. Charles saw an opportunity and hurled his cavalry on the tired French soldiers. The Left Wing became so demoralized that its troops <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> back to Tienen before Miranda could rally them. When Dumouriez heard of the defeat of Miranda's wing on the morning of the 19th he was forced to order a retreat.|$|E

40|$|A flow {{model of}} labor market {{participation}} {{is used to}} describe how various exogenous variations jointly affect unemployment and participation and provides short-run identification restrictions of a structural VAR. In some countries, fast rising female participation {{may have had a}} moderate short- and medium-run impact on unemployment rates. A variance decomposition exercise indicates that, in Continental Europe, participation <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> in the short run by unemployment shocks, whereas in the USA, it <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by participation shocks (demography, immigration). Unemployment in Europe <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by participation shocks, whereas in the USA, it <b>is</b> <b>driven</b> by unemployment shocks...|$|R
5|$|When the {{generator}} building first went into operation, it housed two Westinghouse horizontal generators originally rated at 6,600 volts, operating at 225 rpm and producing 3 phase 60 cycle AC. They <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> by turbines. The voltage was {{stepped up to}} 100,000 volts using three delta-connected oil-cooled transformers of 3,000 kilowatt capacity. These were regulated with oil switches, and the transformers and switch gear were housed in {{the south end of}} {{the generator}} building.|$|E
5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 15,045 all-electric cars and vans were {{registered}} in 2014, of which, pure electric passenger cars totaled 10,560 units. This figure rises to 10,968 units if the BMW i3 with range extender is accounted for. All-electric utility vans totaled 4,485 units registered in 2014. All-electric cars captured a 0.59% {{market share of}} new car registered in France in 2014. Plug-in hybrid car registrations totaled 1,519 units in 2014, almost doubling registrations from a year earlier. Plug-in hybrid sales <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> by the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, with 820 units registered in 2014.

5|$|After some desperate {{fighting}} in close action, pressure eased somewhat and some lost ground was recovered, but the Ottoman force began to outflank the mounted brigade to the west. The 5th Battalion, Norfolk Regiment <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> out of Shilta, but infantry from the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{in the process}} of being relieved, returned to the front, closed the gap, and pushed the Ottoman soldiers back out of the lines of communication.|$|E
5|$|After the Franks <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> {{from the}} Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack {{so that they could}} allow the women and {{children}} to retreat across the Halys River. Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference. While they were going to the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry charging at them. In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius' bodyguard due to their numbers but <b>were</b> <b>driven</b> back when the escort that had been accompanying the Roman foragers arrived and forced the Galatians to retreat.|$|E
