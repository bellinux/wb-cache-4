500|$|In another Rolling Stone interview, {{the band}} {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} the title track, saying that is based on a [...] "whirlwind rocker about the pressures on the band members" [...] and how they have changed as they have aged. Bassist Peter Mosely, in discussion of this, said: [...] "We're older than people think we are. [...] We go through months of serenity, and then there'll be this one night where there will be evil." [...] In another interview discussion about [...] "Lights and Sounds", Key noted that it is [...] "about a band like us coming into a career that we didn't think we'd have. You find yourself surrounded by a lot of false people, {{a lot of people who}} are not doing it for the same reasons you are. That song is about the struggle of not giving in to that." [...] The band explained that the lyrics, [...] "Make it new but stay in the lines / Just let go but keep it inside / Smile big for everyone / Even when you know what they've done / They gave you the end but not <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> / Not how to build, how to tear it apart", were written because of that particular reason. Key also revealed that the lyrics, [...] "They gave you the end / But not <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> / Not how to build / But how to tear it apart", were references to bands Nofx and Bad Religion. Key also explained that when he was preoccupied by distractions, in which he referred to them as [...] "lights and sounds", which ultimately resulted in the band naming the album and track title just that. Key also revealed that it was because that is how it surrounded the band, when working on the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard to know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far {{one of the most}} loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of when you think of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive reception from critics. In the Blender magazine {{review of}} the album, critic Andy Greenwald, wrote: [...] "The title track , bursting with buzzing distortion, builds into a satisfying anti-glitz rant." [...] Tom Beajour of Entertainment Weekly reported that the song [...] "crams all of the genre's essential tropes — distorted power chords, abrupt dynamic shifts, and singsong melodies — into {{three and a half}} minutes of radio-friendly fire." [...] Chris Saunders of MusicOMH noted that the song is laden with [...] "memorable hooks, quiet/loud dynamics and emotive lyrics which will no doubt cut through to many a disenchanted youth: 'They gave you the end but not the <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> / not how to build, how to tear it apart.'" [...] Saunders concluded that the song [...] "is as lively and rousing as most of their best tracks." [...] Sputnikmusic wrote: [...] "The adventure is only on the second track [...] and the guys of Yellowcard are just getting started. This is by far the best tune on the album." [...] Bart Gottula of The Clarion wrote: [...] "The album's single and title cut, 'Light's and Sounds', follows with an amazing performance by every band member. The song provides a quick, hard-hitting beat that brings back Yellowcard's hybrid punk and emo music that the band explored in its previous single, 'Way Away'." ...|$|E

500|$|The website Touch Arcade {{said that}} they loved the game, {{and that it was}} one of their {{favorite}} role-playing games on iOS. They did however think that the game was bad at explaining things, including the system of saving one's progress. Pocket Gamer, too, thought that things were not explained enough. For instance, they said that the game does not guide players from point A to point B, and often does not even let players know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> looking for point B. RPGFan echoed this, and said that it is not uncommon for players to wander around, wondering where to go. Gamezebo said they did not think the battle system was particularly exciting, but appreciated how the conversation system and the demon fusion adds elements of risk and reward to the game. The British newspaper Metro found the game more entertaining than most role-playing games from its time. Gamezebo found the iOS version's touch screen-based virtual buttons clumsy to use, while Pocket Gamer found the interface to work [...] "reasonably well" [...] while using the landscape mode, and RPGFan found the interface to be excellent. Both Gamezebo and Touch Arcade wished the game had been a [...] "universal app", so that it could have been played on other devices than iPhone and iPod Touch without having the graphics upscaled.|$|E
500|$|... "Fix a Heart" [...] is a pop piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is composed in the key of C major and has a tempo of 54 beats per minute. Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain". The track {{has been described by}} some critics and the singer herself as a break-up song, which is demonstrated in the chorus, [...] "Baby, I just ran out of bandaids / I don't even know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> / 'Cause you can bandage the damage / You never really can fix a heart". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never really can fix a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I think every time you get your heart broken, there's a little piece of it that chips away, and I don't think you ever get that piece back. But I think you're able to bandage it with time and with new people and other things that make you happy".|$|E

2500|$|The {{seventh and}} final season, {{consisting}} of 13 episodes, begins with Michael receiving an assignment from Andrew Strong (Jack Coleman), a high-ranking CIA official {{with whom he}} made the deal that got his team and Maddie set free. Strong made the deal because he believes Michael {{is the only person}} he can entrust with a dangerous mission that involves thwarting an American named Randall Burke (Adrian Pasdar) believed to be running freelance terror operations. Fiona has moved on to a new job with her new bounty hunter boyfriend. Sam and Jesse continue to help Michael despite, or perhaps because of, intrusions on their personal and professional lives. Maddie, meanwhile, is trying to get custody of Nate's son, Charlie, to keep him out of foster care. It turns out Burke {{is part of a larger}} organization, and he sacrifices his life in order to help Michael rescue a woman whom Burke called [...] "the key to everything": Sonya (Alona Tal). Michael and the team, including Fiona, begin working with Sonya to get deeper into her organization. As they do, Michael meets James (John Pyper-Ferguson), the man calling the shots for Sonya and Burke, and after passing some intense tests, Michael is welcomed into James's [...] "family". It doesn't take long for Michael to find out that James works for peace and justice in the world, but uses extreme methods to get what he wants. After Michael kills Sonya to protect Fiona, James sends his men to kill Maddie, Charlie, and Jesse. Maddie sacrifices herself to protect them and Michael shoots James, intent on taking him in custody. James blows up his own building, hoping to kill Michael and Fiona. They escape, but must be presumed dead to protect themselves. Strong releases Sam and Jesse, without imprisonment. [...] While the two of them contemplate continuing helping out those who need it like they had for the past seven years, Michael and Fiona have made their home in a small town in Ireland raising Charlie as their own and being the family that Fi had always dreamed of with Michael as her husband. As the show ends, Michael asks Fiona what should he tell Charlie when he is older. Fi says Michael should tell him the truth, but Michael doesn't know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>start.</b> Fiona tells him to start from the beginning, by saying, [...] "My name is Michael Westen.

"Then {{the bull}} made {{a pass at}} him and uttered a bellow that sounded {{perfectly}} frightful, it {{was so close to}} me, and that seemed to literally prostrate my horse's reason, and make a raving distracted maniac of him, and I wish I may die if he didn't stand on his head for a quarter of a minute and shed tears. He was absolutely out of his mind--he was, as sure as truth itself, and he really didn't know what he was doing. Then the bull came charging at us, and my horse dropped down on all fours and took a fresh start--and then for the next ten minutes he would actually throw one hand-spring after another so fast that the bull began to get unsettled, too, and didn't know <b>where</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> in--and so he stood there sneezing, and shovelling dust over his back, and bellowing every now and then, and thinking he had got a fifteen-hundred dollar circus horse for breakfast, certain. Well, I was first out on his neck--the horse's, not the bull's--and then underneath, and next on his rump, and sometimes head up, and sometimes heels--but I tell you it seemed solemn and awful to be ripping and tearing and carrying on so in the presence of death, as you might say. Pretty soon the bull made a snatch for us and brought away some of my horse's tail (I suppose, but do not know, being pretty busy at the time), but something made him hungry for solitude and suggested to him to get up and hunt for it.|$|E
