5|$|In June 2012 Chapman was not {{included}} in the final 18–player Great Britain squad for the 2012 London Olympics. She had made the 35–player longlist but <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> and disappointed to be overlooked for the event in her home city. Chapman felt that her decision to withdraw from the England squad had caused Hope Powell – who managed Great Britain as well as England – to leave her out.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' quarterbacks {{benefited from}} the profusion of passing. Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller {{finished}} the game having completed 18 of his 34 pass attempts for 266 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He also ran three times for a total gain of one yard. Texas quarterback James Brown completed 14 of his 36 pass attempts for 148 yards, three interceptions, and a touchdown. He rushed six times for -43 yards because sacks are counted as runs for negative yardage. Texas also <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by penalty yardage. The Longhorns' nine penalties for 91 yards are both Texas bowl-game records.|$|E

5|$|During {{the making}} of Greed, the {{production}} company merged into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, putting Irving Thalberg {{in charge of the}} production. Thalberg had fired Stroheim a few years earlier at Universal Pictures. Originally almost eight hours long, Greed was edited against Stroheim's wishes to about two-and-a-half hours. Only twelve people saw the full-length 42-reel version, now lost; some of them called it the greatest film ever made. Stroheim later called Greed his most fully realized work and <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> both professionally and personally by the studio's re-editing of it.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Bush {{established}} Arbusto Energy, a small {{oil exploration}} company, {{although it did}} not begin operations until the following year. He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of his stock sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s Adkins again {{found himself}} {{in trouble with the}} law. In 1983 he was living with his girlfriend who was still a minor.

In October the same year, another relationship ended with jail time, when a shootout occurred between Adkins and a jealous husband.

5|$|Prior {{to moving}} across the island of Hawaii, strong {{thunderstorms}} developed in the northeastern portion of the remnant circulation of Fefa. The thunderstorms developed further as they moved over the slopes of Mauna Kea and Kohala. The thunderstorms produced heavy rainfall in areas, resulting in flash flooding in Kohala and Hamakua. Hurricane Fefa resulted in no known deaths. Lightning from the storm caused two injuries. A man in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> when lightning struck where he was walking. A man in Hilo was burnt when lightning moved through telephone wires. The storm resulted in no reported damage.|$|E

Around this time, on a visit to America, MacLaren made a brief appearance in the Hollywood film The Four Feathers, which starred his friend, former cricketer C. Aubrey Smith. In the 1940s, his health began to fail. He <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> in a car crash and then contracted cancer. He died on 17 November 1944, aged 72; his wife died a few months later.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{traded for}} Jones {{in part to}} replace Glenn Dobbs – a star {{tailback}} in Brooklyn's single-wing offense – because Dobbs was suffering from injuries. Jones himself <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> early in the 1947 season, however, when {{he was hit by}} Bill Willis of the Cleveland Browns. Injuries to his knee, hip and clavicle forced him to sit out for several weeks. He broke his hand when he returned and had to play exclusively on defense {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|Vanderbilt {{defeated}} rival Sewanee 16–0. In {{the first}} period, Sewanee had to punt {{from its own}} end zone. The pass to Jenks Gillem went wide, and before he could recover it he was downed by Enoch Brown for a safety. Gillem had one punt of 58 yards that day. Vanderbilt's game seemed to stagnate until Wilson Collins <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> and replaced by Tom Shea in the third quarter. Then two touchdowns came in the fourth period, one by Robins and another Turner. In his last game, Lew Hardage played well despite his hurt left ankle.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of Ringgold High School and the University of Maryland, Zolak was selected 84th in the 1991 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots.

When Drew Bledsoe was drafted in 1993, Zolak became his backup {{for the next six}} seasons. He appeared as a replacement for Bledsoe when he <b>was</b> <b>hurt,</b> but only started three games during this time. He was released {{at the end of the}} 1998 season, and signed with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins in 1999, playing in one game for Miami before retiring. After his retirement, he became a sportscaster and football analyst in the New England area.|$|E
5|$|Cotto and Judah {{delivered}} an all-action brawl, {{but after}} weathering some difficult early rounds as he figured out Judah's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed, Cotto {{took over the}} bout. In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was bleeding from a cut over his right eye and <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes, but Judah stayed upright. Early in the eleventh round, Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah to the canvas. He managed {{to get to his}} feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along the ropes as he continued to throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.|$|E

5|$|His next fight {{took place}} on January 7, 2006 at Madison Square Garden in New York City against Carlos Baldomir. For Judah, the fight {{was viewed as a}} tuneup bout that would lead to a lucrative bout between Judah and WBC Light Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., which was {{tentatively}} scheduled for April. Judah entered the fight as a 10-to-1 favorite over Baldomir. The stage was set when Judah unsportingly punched Baldomir on the thigh during the prefight introductions instead of touching gloves to show sportsmanship. The early rounds of the fight were close, but as the rounds passed, Judah was doing less than necessary to win, while Baldomir kept applying pressure on Judah. In round seven, Judah <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by a right hand and Baldomir landed a series of right hands to Judah's head along the ropes during the tenth round. Baldomir defeated Judah by unanimous decision with scores of 115–113, 114–113 and 115–112 from the three judges.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, the Democrats {{selected}} Breathitt and Benjamin Taylor {{as their}} candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. They faced a Whig (formerly National Republican) ticket of Richard Aylett Buckner and James Turner Morehead. Buckner <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by his extremely religious ideals, including opposition to handling mail on Sunday, {{and failed to}} garner the support {{of some of his}} own party's newspapers. Breathitt defeated Buckner by a small margin, but Morehead defeated Taylor, Breathitt's little-known running mate. Breathitt's election marked the first time a Democrat had ascended to the governorship of Kentucky. The election was marred by fraud, however. In Oldham County, the number of votes tallied represented 162.9% of the eligible voters in the county, and these votes broke two-to-one in favor of Breathitt. Most Kentuckians were more concerned about the upcoming presidential election, hoping Whig and native son Henry Clay would defeat Democrat Andrew Jackson. Because of this, most of the other state offices went to Whig candidates.|$|E
5|$|In February 1869 Smetana had {{the text}} {{translated}} into French, {{and sent the}} libretto and score to the Paris Opera with a business proposal for dividing the profits. The management of the Paris Opera did not respond. The opera was first performed outside its native land on 11 January 1871, when Eduard Nápravník, conductor of the Russian Imperial Opera, gave a performance at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg. The work attracted mediocre notices from the critics, one of whom compared the work unfavourably to the Offenbach genre. Smetana <b>was</b> <b>hurt</b> by this remark, which he felt downgraded his opera to operetta status, and was convinced that press hostility had been generated by a former adversary, the Russian composer Mily Balakirev. The pair had clashed some years earlier, over the Provisional Theatre's stagings of Glinka's A Life for the Tsar and Ruslan and Lyudmila. Smetana believed that Balakirev had used the Russian premiere of The Bartered Bride {{as a means of}} exacting revenge.|$|E
