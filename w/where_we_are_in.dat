According to drummer Chris Adler, [...] "Without Mikey, we'd very well might not be a band today." [...] Drummer Chris Adler was quoted saying [...] "This album is going to surprise a lot of people. Typically bands that get to <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> our career begin to slack off, smell the roses and regurgitate. We chose a different path. No one wants to hear another band member hyping a new record. ‘Wrath’ needs no hype. We have topped ourselves and on February 24 you will feel it."

6000|$|His {{resolution}} impressed us {{even more}} in another matter. He had an extraordinary talent for inventing stories, mostly of wars and wild adventures with plenty of fighting in them, and whenever we boys were all together, which was usually after we {{had gone to bed}} and put the candle out, he would begin one of his wonderful tales and go on for hours, we all wide awake, listening in breathless silence. At length towards midnight the flow of the narrative would suddenly stop, and after an interval we would all begin to cry out to him to go on. [...] "Oh, you are awake!" [...] he would exclaim, with a chuckle of laughter. [...] "Very well, then, you know just <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> our history, to be resumed another day. Now you can go to sleep." [...] On the following evening he would take up the tale, which would often last an entire week, to be followed by another just as long, then another, and so on-our thousand and one nights. And this delightful yarn-spinning was also dropped as he became more and more absorbed in his mathematical and other studies.|$|E

My {{goal was to}} determine if a hotel room that would be from the mid to late 1970 s be accurately portrayed onstage without all the set dressings and three walls that make up a traditional, realistic box set. In order to try and achieve this look, I spent the focus of the design in the paint treatment of the floor as well as finding dated, more period, furnishings from the prop warehouse. The floor treatment, coloring and pattern were all inspired by looking at linoleum floors from the 1970 s.
