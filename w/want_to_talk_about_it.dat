500|$|University of Florida {{historian}} David Colburn stated, [...] "There is {{a pattern}} of denial with the residents and their relatives about what took place, and in fact they said to us on several occasions they don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> they don't want to identify anyone involved, and there's also a tendency to say that those who were involved were from elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Netherlands' exit at Euro 2000, Overmars {{was asked}} whether he would stay at Arsenal. He replied: [...] "I really don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at the moment but you never know. There are some {{meetings}} with the club going on, we will talk over the next week." [...] Lazio and Barcelona were reportedly interested in signing Overmars; the latter club hastened their efforts once Joan Gaspart was elected as president. Overmars was [...] "flattered" [...] by Barcelona's interest and said moving to such a club would [...] "excite any player". Gaspart travelled to London to open negotiations with Arsenal and eventually reached an agreement to sign Overmars and his teammate Emmanuel Petit for a combined fee of around £32million in July 2000. Overmars cost £25million, making him the most expensive player in Dutch football history. The announcement of his transfer was unconventional; he publicised it on his personal website before informing the media. His site garnered 250,000 hits in one day, highlighting the internet's [...] "potential for exponential growth" [...] in regards to football. Overmars was delighted with the move, saying, [...] "I can't wait to pull on the famous shirt and play my first game." ...|$|E
500|$|West first {{collaborated with}} Jackson several {{months prior to}} the release of his debut album, The College Dropout (2004). West stated, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before it comes out, but it'll be unbelievable." [...] John Legend, who co-wrote the track, also plays the piano on the track. Legend was an {{upcoming}} artist and relatively unknown at the time, having not yet released his debut album Get Lifted or any singles. The song was among Legend's first major credits along with Jay-Z's [...] "Encore", West's remix of Britney Spears' [...] "Me Against the Music", and The Black Eyed Peas' [...] "The Boogie that Be." [...] Legend commented, [...] "I'm not going to focus on her breast like the rest of y'all. I'm about the music. Since everyone's paying attention to her, it should bode well for her next single [...] "Have Your Way With Me" [...] which is gonna drop next week. We're just wrapping up the production now. It's produced by Kanye West and co-written by Kanye, Harold Lilly and yours truly. I played some piano on there too. It's a sweet, soulful song. I think it'll be a smash." [...] The song also features contributions from Israeli violinist Miri Ben-Ari. Simon Umlauf of CNN commented Ari's contribution [...] "gently caresses" [...] the song, providing [...] "a dramatic edge you won't find anywhere else." ...|$|E

500|$|Soon after sobering up, Stewie {{stretches}} {{and takes}} out a Jenny Craig Anytime Bar from his shopping bag. [...] Brian loses his temper with Stewie for not revealing that he had been storing food the entire time, and Stewie punishes him by only offering one of the Bars he doesn't want to eat himself (though Brian is happy to have it). After Brian calms down, Stewie asks Brian why he has a gun, noting that Brian is a staunch gun control proponent and seems like the last person who would ever have a gun. Brian doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> at first, but eventually admits to Stewie's shock and disbelief that he has the gun in case he ever feels he has to commit suicide. Brian confesses that he cannot find his purpose in life, and finds comfort in knowing he has the option of killing himself. He admits that the Scotch was to be a last drink. Stewie then admits that he would be lost without Brian, claiming he is {{the only person in the}} world that he really cares about; he tells a skeptical Brian that his earlier ranting against Brian was only an attack because Brian verball attacked him, and he finally tells Brian he loves him. Brian tells Stewie he loves him back. In addition, Stewie reminds Brian that maybe making someone else happy is enough, because it is the best gift one person can give, for which Brian thanks him. Stewie falls asleep as Brian reads the beginning of David Copperfield to him. The following morning, the vault door opens, and Brian carries a sleeping Stewie and their belongings out of the room in silence. The episode plays the closing credits without music as well.|$|E

2500|$|One of Tanaka's most remembered {{achievements}} is normalizing Japanese {{relations with}} the People's Republic of China, which occurred {{around the same time}} as Richard Nixon's efforts {{to do the same for}} Chinese {{relations with the}} United States. In 1972, Tanaka met with Zhou Enlai of the People's Republic of China to discuss the normalization of relations between the two countries. Among other matters, they discussed the Senkaku Islands, which would later become a major point of contention between the two countries. Tanaka reportedly asked Zhou [...] "What is your view on the Senkaku Islands? Some people say things about them to me," [...] to which Zhou replied [...] "I do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> this time. If there wasn't oil, neither Taiwan nor the United States would make this an issue." [...] Just two months after taking office, Tanaka met Mao Zedong.|$|E

Russell Means and Canupa Gluha Mani have claimed that some 13,000 Lakota, including 77% {{of the population of}} Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, have shown support for the Republic of Lakotah, and that the eight-member delegation which traveled to Washington, D.C. was only a portion of some 77 tribal elders and activists taking part in the movement. However, Rapid City Journal reporter Bill Harlan reported on his blog that [...] "most folks I talk to hadn't heard about the declaration.
