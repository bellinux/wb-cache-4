25|$|After 80 overs, {{the captain}} of the bowling side may take a new ball, {{although}} this is not required. The captain will usually take the new ball: being harder and smoother than an old ball, a new ball generally favours faster bowlers <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> it bounce more variably. The roughened, softer surface of an old ball can be more conducive to spin bowlers, or those using reverse swing. The captain may delay the decision to take the new ball if he wishes to continue with his spinners (because the pitch favours spin). After a new ball has been taken, should an innings last a further 80 overs, then the captain will have the option to take another new ball.|$|E

25|$|Mullich {{contracted}} the Dreamers Guild {{to do the}} programming, artwork and sound effects. Its S.A.G.A. game engine {{was seen as an}} ideal user interface for the player to interact with the environment and to converse with the characters in AM's world. It was decided early on that high resolution graphics were necessary to capture the nuances and mood of Ellison's vivid imagination, and so Technical Director John Bolton adapted the engine to utilize SVGA graphics and included the Fastgraph graphics library. Mullich and Cyberdreams art director Peter Delgado had frequent meetings with Dreamers Guild art director Brad Schenck to devise art direction complementing the surreal nature of the story. Since the story takes place in the mind of a mad god <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> anything happen, the team chose a variety of art styles for each of the scenarios, ranging from the unsettling perspectives used in German Expressionist films to pure fantasy to stark reality. Assistant art director Glenn Price and his team rendered more than 60 backgrounds utilizing a number of 2D and 3D tools, including Deluxe Paint and LightWave. Hundreds of animations were drawn by assistant art director Jhoneil Centeno and his team of animators.|$|E

The counterpoint is that it is precisely those in power who are best placed to scrutinize bills for illegitimate differentiating measures, because [...] "it is often those with political affiliations <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> the biggest contribution to the discussion; if nothing else, from the folly and error of their past ways".|$|E

[...] The process of making the bell grows into a huge, expensive endeavour with many hundreds of workers and Boriska makes several risky decisions, guided only by his instincts. As the furnaces are opened and the molten metal pours into the mould, he privately asks God for help. Andrei silently watches Boriska during the casting, and the younger man notices him too.|$|E

Yusa's dead older sister Misa makes use of this ability to freely possess her at any time, which allows Misa to use her own ability, pyrokinesis. Nao soon arranges for Yusa to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy and join the student council.|$|E
