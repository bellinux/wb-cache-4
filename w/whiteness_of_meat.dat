40|$|Discoloration of dark-fleshed {{fish species}} during storage and {{processing}} was mainly due to the reaction of myoglobin, a monomeric globular heme protein contributed to the pigmentation <b>of</b> red <b>meat</b> fish, alone and with other muscle components. Metmyoglobin formation caused by the autooxidation of myoglobin was a major factor influencing the darkening <b>of</b> dark-fleshed fish <b>meat</b> during iced and frozen storage. The increase in metmyoglobin content concomitant with a decrease in redness index <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> usually occurred during storage of dark-fleshed fish. Lipid oxidation {{was positively correlated with}} myoglobin oxidation and related to the discoloration of fish flesh. Aldehydic lipid oxidation products such as hexanal and hexenal potently induced the formation of metmyoglobin and the lowered <b>whiteness</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>meat.</b> Furthermore, a green pigment could be produced during heat processing in some dark muscle fish species such as tuna. Greening was generated when tuna myoglobin was reacted with other muscle components including trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) and cysteine. After heating, a single type of green pigment was formed and resulted in discoloration <b>of</b> cooked tuna <b>meat.</b> Furthermore, green pigmentation <b>of</b> tuna <b>meat</b> could be formed by the reaction of myoglobin with hydrogen peroxide, a by-product of lipid and myoglobin oxidations. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study {{examining}} the ranking of selected attributes of fresh pork by Asian-origin consumers in San Francisco, California. Freshness is ranked {{as the most important}} attribute, followed by the attributes of the color <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> lowness in fat, and the <b>whiteness</b> <b>of</b> fat. The attributes of price, freedom from chemicals, and being USDA labelled were also ranked to be of importance. Empirical results from an ordered probit model, postulated to explain respondents' importance rankings of attributes, suggested that particular demographic and socio-economic characteristics of Asian-origin consumers influenced the importance rankings of selected pork attributes. The findings suggest that Asian-origin consumers should not be treated as a single homogeneous niche group in marketing, since there are identifiable sub-groups of these consumers with specific attitudes and preferences.
