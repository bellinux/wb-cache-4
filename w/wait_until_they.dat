5|$|The length time {{in which}} {{offspring}} stay with their mother varies, though it can last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or {{as long as a}} year. Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. Spermatogenesis in male giraffes begins at three to four years of age. Males must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.|$|E
5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, on a video monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E

The processors then <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> next see that card, upon which data can be modified on them. For example, a hot-listed (or cancelled) card's number will be sent out to all processors (usually within 1–2 days of being reported), and when the card is next used the 'tag on' will be declined and the card updated to cancelled status (resulting in it being rejected in the future).|$|E
25|$|Hamilcar offered {{safety to}} Antander {{and the other}} leaders if they {{surrendered}} the city. However Erymnon the Aetolian, who had been appointed co-ruler with him by Agathocles, disagreed. He convinced the leading men to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> had more certainty of the fate of Agathocles. Meanwhile, Agathocles had built two ships {{and sent them to}} Syracuse to bring news of his victory in Libya. As they approached Syracuse they were spotted by Carthaginian ships, which pursued them. The Greek ships barely managed to escape and entered the port of Syracuse. There, the inhabitants of the city, including those who defended the walls, quickly gathered to hear the news.|$|E

25|$|Failure to enjoin the unconstitutional statute {{would require}} the person subject to a {{potential}} violation to either pay the increased rate or face the threat of prosecution. Therefore, the Court determined {{that it would be}} unfair to require challengers of a law to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> faced a harsh sanction before they could bring any kind of action questioning the validity of that law. The Court also noted that, although a number of cases had held that the state itself could not be sued, those cases did not prohibit enjoining a state official, as an individual, from carrying out some task on behalf of the state.|$|E
25|$|During the {{majority}} of the year caribou roam the tundra in small herds, but twice a year large herds of caribou cross the inland regions. Caribou have excellent senses of smell and hearing so that the hunters must be very careful when in pursuit. Often, Inuit hunters set up camp miles away from the caribou crossing and <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> are in full view to attack. There are many ways in which the caribou can be captured, including spearing, forcing caribou into the river, using blinders, scaring the caribou, and stalking the caribou. When spearing caribou, hunters put the string of the spear in their mouths and the other end they use to gently spear the animal.|$|E
25|$|These {{items of}} {{evidence}} were secretly {{brought back to}} the camp and presented to the war council, which concluded that they had been sent by Jayavira Bandara Mudali to the Kandyan king. Pedro Afonso Mudali declared that he had previously intercepted messages of similar nature, supposedly sent by King Vimaladharmasuriya to Jayavira Bandara, promising him the kingdoms of Sitawaka and Kotte if he rose against the Portuguese. A Franciscan priest further disclosed a confession made by a Badaga mercenary, who happened to be a relative of Jayavira's, regarding an impending betrayal. The council was divided in their opinion, but Sousa decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> returned to Colombo to hold an inquiry, as it would be dangerous to seize Jayavira {{in the middle of the}} campaign.|$|E

25|$|With {{his small}} daughters and sister Atje, Alma-Tadema arrived in London at the {{beginning}} of September 1870. The painter wasted no time in contacting Laura, and it was arranged that he would give her painting lessons. During one of these, he proposed marriage. As he was then thirty-four and Laura was now only eighteen, her father was initially opposed to the idea. Dr Epps finally agreed on the condition that they should <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> knew each other better. They married in July 1871. Laura, under her married name, also won a high reputation as an artist, and appears in numerous of Alma-Tadema's canvases after their marriage (The Women of Amphissa (1887) being a notable example). This second marriage was enduring and happy, though childless, and Laura became stepmother to Anna and Laurence. Anna became a painter and Laurence became a novelist.|$|E
25|$|Ed Roberts optimistically {{told his}} banker {{that he could}} sell 800 computers, while in reality they needed to sell 200 {{over the next year}} just to break even. When readers got the January issue of Popular Electronics, MITS was flooded with {{inquiries}} and orders. They had to hire extra people just to answer the phones. In February MITS received 1,000 orders for the Altair 8800. The quoted delivery time was 60 days but it was months before they could meet that. Roberts focused on delivering the computer; all of the options would <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> could keep pace with the orders. MITS claimed to have delivered 2,500 Altair 8800s by the end of May. The number was over 5,000 by August 1975. MITS had under 20 employees in January but had grown to 90 by October 1975.|$|E
25|$|Females are oviparous, {{with three}} to eleven rather large, {{leathery}} eggs being laid (four to six are most common). These are incubated by the female {{under the ground}} (via a shivering motion), and hatch after 55 to 60 days. Sexual maturity is reached at 11–18 months for males, and 20–36 months for females. Age is only one factor in determining sexual maturity and ability to breed; weight is the second factor. Males breed at 600 g or more, but in captivity are often not bred until they are 800 g (1.7 lb), although in captivity, some males {{have been known to}} begin breeding at 300-400 g. Females breed in the wild at weights as low as 800 g though 1200 g or more in weight is most common; in captivity, breeders generally <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> are no less than 1500g (3.3lb). Parental care of the eggs ends once they hatch, and the female leaves the offspring to fend for themselves.|$|E

500|$|Tâtonnement (roughly, French for groping toward) {{was meant}} {{to serve as the}} {{practical}} expression of Walrasian general equilibrium. [...] Walras abstracted the marketplace as an auction of goods where the auctioneer would call out prices and market participants would <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> could each satisfy their personal reservation prices for the quantity desired (remembering here that this is an auction on all goods, so everyone has a reservation price for their desired basket of goods).|$|E

Orson and Bree become engaged and, although they initially planned to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> were married to have sex, they are unable to overcome temptation. Bree visits the doctor immediately after, fearing that she may have suffered a stroke; her doctor informs her that Bree had just experienced her first orgasm. Later at the couple's engagement party, Orson's former neighbor, Carolyn Bigsby (Laurie Metcalf), arrives uninvited and accuses Orson of having killed his missing wife, Alma (Valerie Mahaffey). Despite a sense of doubt, Bree believes Orson when he denies Carolyn's claims. Later, the rain washes away mud at a construction site and uncovers a buried body.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, {{gameplay}} footage from [...] "No Russian" [...] was leaked on the Internet. This early footage divided opinions among video game journalists, although most decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> could play the level to judge its quality. After the game's release, [...] "No Russian" [...] sparked significant controversy for allowing players to partake in a terrorist attack. Journalists described the level's plot as illogical, and derided the ability to skip the level. Due to the graphic content featured in [...] "No Russian", Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was subject to censorship in international versions of the game, including the entire removal of the level from Russian versions. Journalists have since discussed the importance of [...] "No Russian" [...] to the video game industry.|$|E
500|$|The scenes {{featuring}} {{shots of}} beetles crawling out of corpses were shot and filmed using real insects {{as well as}} real actors. In particular, during the scene wherein the Complaining Man is discovered dead, over 3,000 live bugs were shot crawling {{on the body of}} Mike Hungerford, the portraying actor. Producer Harry Bring noted that the bug scenes were tedious and hard to film because [...] "bugs don't take directions very well, so you pretty much have to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> decided to get it right." [...] Although the shots of the bugs were considerably brief in the final episode, the scenes required a full day of shooting to get perfect. The shots of bugs crawling out of Daniel Brimley's mouth and the shots of the bugs being sucked out of Mulder were created via a combination of CGI and [...] "dummy bugs".|$|E
500|$|The Disasters of War was not {{published}} during Goya's lifetime, possibly because he feared political repercussions from Fernando VII's repressive regime. Some art historians {{suggest that he}} did not publish because he was sceptical about the use of images for political motives, and instead saw them as a personal meditation and release. Most, however, believe the artist preferred to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>they</b> could be made public without censorship. A further four editions were published, the last in 1937, so that in total [...] over 1,000 impressions of each print have been printed, though not all of the same quality. As with his other series, later impressions show wear to the aquatint. [...] The 1863 edition had 500 impressions, and editions followed in 1892 (100) before which the plates were probably steel-faced to prevent further wear, 1903 (100), 1906 (275), and 1937. [...] Many sets have been broken up, and most print room collections will have {{at least some of the}} set. [...] Examples, especially from later editions, are available on the art market.|$|E
