5|$|In June 2011, Yash Raj Films {{released}} a statement announcing a new directorial venture by Yash Chopra coinciding with the 50th anniversary of his Bollywood career. The producers also announced that the film would be released during the Diwali 2012 weekend. Chopra said the film was untitled at that time, similar to previous project Veer-Zaara (which was named {{on the day of}} its submission to the Central Board of Film Certification). The producers considered a number of titles but were not satisfied <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In September 2012, it was announced that the title of the film was Jab Tak Hai Jaan. It was inspired by a similarly titled song from the 1975 film, Sholay.|$|E

The Philadelphia Soul of the Arena Football League expressed interest in signing Mitchell in January 2006, but president Ron Jaworski, a former Eagles quarterback, had difficulties contacting him.|$|E
5|$|At {{the house}} of Will's friends Max and Bella, Anna fits in {{perfectly}} as they all share stories. Honey immediately recognizes Anna and declares them best friends instantly. She and Will share a private moment in a garden square as they walk back from the birthday party. The following evening {{they go to a}} restaurant, where Will overhears a group of patrons making crude remarks about Anna and attempts to defend her, before Anna steps in herself and humiliates them. As they walk back to her hotel, she invites Will up to her room. But when he arrives, she tells him he must leave immediately. Her American movie star boyfriend (who was never mentioned until now) appears and starts to bark orders at him, as well as make unflattering comments about Anna's weight. Anna is apologetic and embarrassed, while a stunned Will leaves. Over the next six months, Max and Bella set Will up on a series of blind dates, trying to help him move on; however Will, still hung up on Anna, does not connect <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|Also {{there was}} found {{more of their}} corn and of their beans of various colors; the corn and beans they brought away, purposing to give them full {{satisfaction}} when they should meet <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as, about some six months afterward they did, to their good content.|$|E

25|$|She has {{involved}} {{herself in the}} causes of her protagonists which are generally women, farm workers and laborers and also include the indigenous, such as the Zapatistas in Chiapas in the 1990s. She puts many in touch with those {{on the left side}} of Mexico's and the world's political spectrum although she is not officially affiliated <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> She considers herself a feminist to the bone and looks upon civil movements with sympathy and enthusiasm. However she has resisted offers to become formally involved in political positions. She became involved in Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s 2005 presidential campaign. She wrote about the seven-week occupation of the Zócalo that followed López Obrador's loss in 2006. She blames Mexico's businessmen and the United States for his loss as well as López Obrador's naivete.|$|E
500|$|Although Lennon {{often made}} sarcastic {{comments}} about Epstein's homosexuality {{to friends and}} to Epstein personally, no one outside the group's inner circle was allowed to comment. Ian Sharp, one of Lennon's art school friends, once made a sarcastic remark about Epstein, saying, [...] "Which one of you [...] does he fancy?" [...] Sharp was sent a letter by Epstein's office within 48 hours that demanded a complete apology. Sharp apologised, but was then completely ostracised. McCartney sent him a letter directing him to have no contact <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> in the future. Epstein went on holiday to places such as Amsterdam, Torremolinos and Barcelona or Manchester at weekends, as the attitude to homosexuals there was more tolerant than Liverpool, even though Liverpool did have several gay bars.|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Ruthie Morris had {{recently}} moved to Atlanta from West Palm Beach, Florida—where she played a few shows as the guitarist for The Pockets. She attempted to play with local male musicians, but did not feel comfortable <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Hopper and Morris were introduced by a mutual acquaintance and became fast friends; they wrote their first song together at Hopper's apartment the day they met. The duo {{had a difficult time}} finding collaborators to form a complete band (as Hopper described it, [...] "We had to beg people to come and play with us.") The duo eventually recruited bassist Tim Lee and McNair on drums in March 1990. Lee left the band after a brief tenure and was replaced by Shannon Mulvaney, whom Morris met at a record store. The musicians named themselves Homemade Sister after a line from the film Baby Doll and released their first single—"Rip the Wreck"/"Merry"—on Safety Net Records in 1990. Displeased with their name, the band was briefly renamed Swell, before they found out a San Francisco band had the same name and then billed themselves as Swell Dopa.|$|E
500|$|A {{detailed}} {{breakdown of}} the pilot written by Thomas was released on March 17, containing information on the plot and characters of the series. [...] None of the characters {{were related to the}} original series; however, the series' featured a similar premise: a family with two teenagers who recently moved from the Midwest to Beverly Hills. To reflect the situation at the Beverly Hills school, where around 40 percent of the students were from Persian descent, a student named Navid Shirazi was created. Thomas intended to introduce The Peach Pit, the diner from Beverly Hills, 90210, but noted {{that it would not be}} featured in the pilot. The writer considered giving the siblings a job at a movie theater, as he did not want them to use their parent's credit cards. Thomas revealed that there were plans to reintroduce one of the original cast members, but had not met <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> to discuss a role. Thomas later elaborated the producers wanted to see [...] "as many of the original cast members as possible", but were careful not to [...] "parade them all out in the pilot".|$|E

60|$|These puerile----not to say infantine----forms of a Sorites I have, in this book, ignored {{from the}} very first, and have not only {{admitted}} freely Propositions in E, but have purposely stated the Premisses in random order, leaving to the Reader the useful task <b>of</b> arranging <b>them,</b> for himself, in an order which can be worked {{as a series of}} regular Syllogisms.

Measurements in one inertial frame can be converted to measurements in another by a simple transformation (the Galilean transformation in Newtonian physics and the Lorentz transformation in special relativity). In general relativity, in any region small enough for the curvature of spacetime and tidal forces to be negligible, one can find a set of inertial frames that approximately describe that region.|$|E

It is the opinion of Blackie [...] that about 35 - 40 natives have been despatched on this establishment and that there is only two men left alive of the tribe.

Upon entry into this round, Virgil says [...] "Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni" [...] ("The banners of the King of Hell draw closer"). Judecca is completely silent: {{all of the}} sinners are fully encapsulated in ice, distorted and twisted in every conceivable position. The sinners present an image of utter immobility: {{it is impossible to}} talk <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> so Dante and Virgil quickly move on to the centre of Hell.|$|E

'I put my washing out, except the handkerchiefs and stockings and petticoats and collars, and light stuff like that.

2500|$|Two serious flaws {{work against}} the novel, however — flaws made all the worse by being easily correctable, to my mind. Carl opens the book by {{throwing}} almost the entire cast at the reader, {{making it hard to}} grasp and identify <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> much less the setting of contemporary Glastonbury. ... The other major problem I had with Lucifer's Crown is infuriating simply because it's so utterly unnecessary: The novel takes place in the final months of the year 2000. That's right, we're treated to yet another clichéd end-of-the-millennium apocalypse. Other than hopelessly dating a story that otherwise manages to be effectively timeless, the move is just downright dumb.|$|E
