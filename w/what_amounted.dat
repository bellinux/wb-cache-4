5|$|Boortz {{announced}} his retirement from radio on June 4, 2012. His last live show aired on January 18, 2013. Boortz's regular fill-in host, Herman Cain, replaced him on January 21, 2013, in <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to a swap of seats, as Boortz now is Cain's fill-in host. Boortz stated he would host commentaries for WSB and national syndication, and also substitute for Sean Hannity, whose show airs on WSB in Atlanta, when needed {{in addition to being}} Cain's fill-in.|$|E
5|$|Cicero, upon {{becoming}} consul, immediately {{moved to}} strike a deal with his consular colleague Hybrida, who had supported Catiline and his party, and who might join a rebellion against the state. In exchange for <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to the sole consulship for Cicero, Hybrida was to receive the rich consular province of Macedonia. Hybrida himself was heavily in debt and was wasteful of his money, and the wealth of Macedonia {{could be used by}} him to restore his lost fortune.|$|E
5|$|Each side {{considered}} {{how best}} to eliminate {{the threat posed by}} its opponent, and after Virginia returned each side tried to goad the other into attacking under unfavorable circumstances. Both captains declined the opportunity to fight in water not of their own choosing; Jeffers in particular was under positive orders not to risk his ship. Consequently, each vessel spent the next month in <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to posturing. Not only did the two ships not fight each other, neither ship ever fought again after March 9.|$|E

5|$|In 1548 Charles {{declared}} an interreligio imperialis (also {{known as the}} Augsburg Interim) through which he sought to find some common ground for religious peace. This effort alienated both Protestant and Catholic princes and the papacy; even Charles, whose decree it was, was unhappy with the political and diplomatic dimensions of <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to half of a religious settlement. The 1551–52 sessions convened by Pope Julius III at the supposedly ecumenical Council of Trent solved none of the larger religious issues but simply restated Catholic teaching and condemned Protestant teaching as heresies.|$|E

25|$|In August 2005, O'Neal {{signed a}} 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's {{willingness}} to take <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to a pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. They contended that O'Neal was worth more than $20million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.|$|E
25|$|The {{ending of}} <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to an export tariff {{severely}} damaged government revenues, {{and as of}} 4 February 1952, the rupiah was officially devalued to Rp 11.4, with export tariffs of 15–25% on commodities that Indonesia was strong in. Weaker commodities were not subject to tariffs, and from 1955 were actually given a premium of 5–25% to boost their export.|$|E

Class action service companies like Chicago Clearing Corporation helped many financial institutions, like hedge funds, mutual funds, and bank trust, regain this money after holding {{what appeared to be a}} seemingly safe investment.|$|E
25|$|The Foster and Ruthenberg factions {{likewise}} blamed {{each other}} for the defeat of the 1926 strike of textile workers in Passaic, New Jersey, in which the Ruthenberg leadership supported an overt Party role in the strike and <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to creation of a dual union. When it appeared that the leadership's communist leanings were an obstacle to negotiations, TUEL handed the strike over to the United Textile Workers, which was unable to make any more progress than the CP leadership had.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this time Sammartino found out through Angelo Savoldi, a {{recently}} fired office employee of Capitol Wrestling Corporation, {{that he had been}} cheated by Vince McMahon Sr. on the promised gate percentages for his entire second title run. Sammartino filed suit against McMahon and his Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The suit was eventually settled out of court by McMahon's son, Vince McMahon after his father had died. Part of the settlement included Sammartino returning to do color commentary on WWF television in exchange {{for hundreds of thousands of}} dollars for <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to nineteen days of work.|$|E

25|$|The tunnels {{accommodated}} <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to {{an underground}} city. The entire 16,000-strong garrison could be housed there along with {{enough food to}} last them for 16 months. Within the tunnels there were also an underground telephone exchange, a power generating station, a water distillation plant, a hospital, a bakery, ammunition magazines and a vehicle maintenance workshop. They also housed one of Gibraltar's most secret places – Stay Behind Cave, built for Operation Tracer, a plan to maintain a secret observation post manned by six men within the Rock if it had fallen to a German invasion. It was not rediscovered until as recently as 1997.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} those factors, the Outlaws {{averaged}} 21,038 fans (in a 40,000-seat stadium), 14th in the league. It {{might have been}} even higher if not for brutally cold and wet early-season weather and <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to season-long lame duck status. While Tulsa as a USFL host city {{had a number of}} legitimate problems, fan turnout was surprisingly respectable, especially compared to the unsustainable attendance numbers seen by USFL teams in Chicago (7,455), Washington (7,694) and Los Angeles (15,361). They were also one of eight teams whose average attendance was 45 percent or more of listed capacity. The Outlaws would draw decent crowds of 25,403, 21,625, 22,017 and 29,324 later in the season.|$|E
25|$|The {{first was}} Universal's Son of Frankenstein (1939), {{when he played}} the {{character}} role of Ygor, a mad blacksmith with a broken neck, in heavy makeup and beard. The same year saw Lugosi playing a straight character role in a major motion picture: he was a stern commissar in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's comedy Ninotchka, starring Greta Garbo. This small but prestigious role {{could have been a}} turning point for the actor, but within the year, he was back on Hollywood's Poverty Row, playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and mystery B-films were released by Monogram Pictures. At Universal, he often received star billing for <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to a supporting part. The Gorilla (1939) had him playing straight man to Patsy Kelly.|$|E

25|$|In September 1918, the Bolshevik government, facing {{continuous}} military difficulties, declared <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to {{martial law}} and reorganized the Red Army. The Supreme Military Council was abolished {{and the position}} of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by {{the commander of the}} Latvian Riflemen, Ioakim Vatsetis (a.k.a. Jukums Vācietis), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of day-to-day operations of the army while Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.|$|E
25|$|Jason and Cyane tracked Iphigénie and {{initially}} fired on her but broke off the engagement {{because they were}} outgunned. Cyane continued the chase for over three days until Venerable was able to rejoin the fight after having sailed 153 miles in the direction she believed that Iphigénie had taken. On 20 January 1814, after a 19-hour chase, or <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> in all to a four-day chase Iphigénie, Venerable captured the quarry, having again left Cyane behind. In the chase, Iphigénie cast off her anchors and threw her boats overboard {{in order to try}} to gain speed. She had a complement of 325 men, under the command of Captain Emerie. She apparently did not resist after Venerable came up. Before meeting up with the British ships, the two French vessels had taken some eight prizes.|$|E
25|$|The Wildcats {{received}} the Southeast regional bracket's eighth seed and were matched {{in the first}} round against ninth-seeded Dayton, with the game held in Dayton's home arena. Despite the disadvantage of playing in <b>what</b> <b>amounted</b> to a road game, Villanova advanced after a closely contested contest; a go-ahead layup by Pressley gave the Wildcats a late lead that they held until the end. The Wildcats then won their second-round game, 59–55, over the region's top seed, Michigan, before a 46–43 victory in a rematch against Maryland (the fifth seed) that sent them to the regional final. North Carolina, their opponent, held a five-point lead at halftime before a strong performance in the second half led to a 12-point Villanova win and a spot in the Final Four. In their game against Memphis State, the Wildcats won by a 52–45 final score to gain their title game berth.|$|E
