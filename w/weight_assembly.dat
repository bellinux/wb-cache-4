5000|$|After {{the initial}} launch the Numark units {{received}} mixed reviews, with several flaws and inadequate quality assurance being pointed out. Some found the tonearm as supplied was not accurately calibrated or properly {{aligned with the}} platter, {{but it can be}} tweaked and adjusted to perform well. The platter in some cases exhibited noticeable warp or axial run-out, which appears to be in part due to the ceramic ring magnetic that secures the platter to the spindle not being glued correctly to the underside of the platter. Some reviewers complained that the pitch system was not calibrated accurately, although not off by much. On later production models, probably the Pro TT-2 only, it is reported that access holes are provided {{on the bottom of the}} turntable base to permit pitch calibration using a screwdriver. Others considered the LCD display to be of little practical value since the pitch value shown is not precise. Also, in some cases the stylus pressure ring on the tonearm counterbalance <b>weight</b> <b>assembly</b> turns much too freely. And, unfortunately, the dust cover hinges eventually fail due to cracking at the bottom of the plastic housing for the counterbalance spring which is under the constant load of the stiff spring.

Low molecular weights have yielded an incomplete “island growth” coating while high molecular weight resulted in a homogeneous coating which thickness was controlled by the adopted pH. Both low and high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>assemblies</b> induced a reduction of the cellulose decomposition temperatures that was, conversely, delayed by coatings assembled at pH = 10.

DdrA((1 - 160)) has a complex three-dimensional structure based on a heptameric ring that can self-associate to form a larger molecular <b>weight</b> <b>assembly.</b> We suggest that the complex architecture of DdrA plays a role in the substrate specificity and favors an efficient DNA repair...|$|E
40|$|Optical solar reflectors are {{devices that}} combine high {{reflection}} for visible wavelengths {{with a strong}} emissivity in the infrared. Compared to the conventional rigid quartz tiles used on spacecraft since the 1960 s, thin-film solutions can offer a significant advantage in <b>weight,</b> <b>assembly,</b> and launch costs. Here, we present a metasurface-based approach using an Al-doped ZnO (AZO) transparent conducting oxide as infrared plasmonic material. The AZO is patterned into a metasurface to achieve broad plasmonic resonances with an enhanced absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the thermal infrared. In the visible range, the transparent conducting oxide provides low losses for solar radiation, while intrinsic absorption losses in the ultraviolet range are effectively suppressed using a multilayer reflecting coating. The addition of high-emissivity layers to the stack eventually results in comparable emissivity values to the thin plasmonic device, thus defining {{a window of opportunity}} for plasmonic absorption as a design strategy for ultrathin devices. The optimized experimental structure achieves solar absorptance (α) of 0. 16 and thermal emissivity (ε) of 0. 79.

40|$|Solvent-damped, {{thermally}} activated {{motions of}} {{high molecular weight}} proteins and nucleic acid assemblies are key to understanding and controlling their functions and activities. The finite element method is a well-established approach to analyzing protein conformational fluctuations that are not accessible to all-atom representations. However, like conventional all-atom normal mode analysis, the finite element method has previously been used only to model protein dynamics in vacuum. Here, we extend the finite element based modeling approach to incorporate solvent damping for proteins and nucleic acid assemblies to compute non-equilibrium conformational properties. The proposed model is computationally effective for calculating translational and rotational diffusion coefficients in addition to dynamical motions in solvent, as demonstrated for Taq polymerase and several nanometer-scale DNA assemblies. A distinct advantage of the finite element-based approach is that computational cost does not increase with increasing molecular weight, rendering the procedure applicable to long time-scale structure-based simulations of high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>assemblies</b> including chaperones, molecular motors, and nucleic acid nanostructures...|$|R

We also determined the affinity of Ssa 1 p for Ure 2 p, and its globular domain. To map the Ure 2 p-Ssa 1 p interface, we have used chemical cross-linkers and MS. We demonstrate that Ure 2 p and Ssa 1 p form a 1 : 1 complex. An analytical strategy combining in-gel digestion of cross-linked protein complexes, and both MS and MS/MS analysis of proteolytic peptides, allowed us to identify a number of peptides that were modified because {{they are exposed to}} the solvent. A difference in the exposure to the solvent of a single lysine residue, lysine 339 of Ure 2 p, was detected upon Ure 2 p-Ssa 1 p complex formation. These observations strongly suggest that lysine 339 and its flanking amino acid stretches are involved in the interaction between Ure 2 p and Ssa 1 p.

The sequences contained related hydrophobic core segments varying in length from 5 to 12 residues and flanked by di- or tri-lysine segments. Three remarkable peptides consisting of just 11 residues with hydrophobic core sequences of FLIVI, IGSII, and IVIGS flanked by three lysine residues gave the highest dry adhesion shear strength and displayed unusual biophysical {{properties in the}} presence and absence of water. KKKFLIVIKKK had its highest adhesion strength at 2 % (w/v) at pH 12. 0 and showed the highest adhesion strength after exposure to water (water resistance). Both KKKIGSIIKKK and KKKIVIGSKKK, at 4 % (w/v) at pH 12. 0, displayed nearly identical dry shear strength values to that with the FLIVI core sequence. The peptide with IGSII core, however, displayed a lower water resistance and the latter, IVIGS, showed no water resistance, completely delaminating upon soaking in water. These are the smallest peptides with adhesive properties reported to date and show remarkable adhesion strength even at lower concentrations of 0. 2 % (w/v), which corresponds to 1. 6  mM.

40|$|International audienceThe {{aggregation}} of α-synuclein (α-Syn), {{the primary}} component of Lewy bodies, into high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>assemblies</b> is {{strongly associated with}} Parkinson disease. This event is believed to result from a conformational change within native α-Syn. Molecular chaperones exert critical housekeeping functions in vivo including refolding, maintaining in a soluble state, and/or pacifying protein aggregates. The influence of the stress-induced heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) on α-Syn aggregation has been notably investigated. The constitutively expressed chaperone Hsc 70 acts as an antiaggregation barrier before cells are overwhelmed with α-Syn aggregates and Hsp 70 expression induced. Here, we investigate the interaction between Hsc 70 and α-Syn, {{the consequences of this}} interaction, and the role of nucleotides and co-chaperones Hdj 1 and Hdj 2 as modulators. We show that Hsc 70 sequesters soluble α-Syn in an assembly incompetent complex in the absence of ATP. The affinity of Hsc 70 for soluble α-Syn diminishes upon addition of ATP alone or together with its co-chaperones Hdj 1 or Hdj 2 allowing faster binding and release of client proteins thus abolishing α-Syn assembly inhibition by Hsc 70. We show that Hsc 70 binds α-Syn fibrils with a 5 -fold tighter affinity compared with soluble α-Syn. This suggests that Hsc 70 preferentially interacts with high molecular <b>weight</b> α-Syn <b>assemblies</b> in vivo. Hsc 70 binding certainly has an impact on the physicochemical properties of α-Syn assemblies. We show a reduced cellular toxicity of α-Syn fibrils coated with Hsc 70 compared with "naked" fibrils. Hsc 70 may therefore significantly affect the cellular propagation of α-Syn aggregates and their spread throughout the central nervous system in Parkinson disease...|$|R

Recent advances in electron microscopy and solid state NMR have allowed the characterization of fibril structures to different extents of refinement. However, structural details about the mechanism of fibril formation remain relatively poorly defined. This is mainly due to the complex, heterogeneous and transient nature of the species responsible for assembly; properties that make them difficult to detect and characterize in structural detail using biophysical techniques. The ability of solution NMR spectroscopy to investigate exchange between multiple protein states, to characterize transient and low-population species, and to study high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>assemblies,</b> render NMR an invaluable technique for studies of amyloid assembly.

Although steel is the traditional material of choice in the mining industry, and particularly for conveyor support structures, the strength and weight advantages offered by composite materials has prompted this investigation into the feasibility of using composite materials in underground mining conveyor support structures. The {{first phase of the}} project centred on establishing and applying selection criteria for the materials and processes which could be used in such a structure. Key concerns include fire performance, electrical conductivity, cost, availability and manufacturability. Based on these considerations, the project identified a phenolic-glass laminate manufactured using the RTM method (for moulded components) or the pultrusion process (for tube sections) as a possible basis for a composite conveyor support structure. The second phase of the project developed a set of design criteria for the use of composite materials in conveyor support structures and a series of preliminary designs based on current conveyor configurations.

The third phase of the project used the findings of the preliminary design analysis and the key design criteria to develop a prototype final design.

40|$|Nonfibrillar, {{water-soluble}} low-molecular <b>weight</b> <b>assemblies</b> of the amyloid beta-protein (A beta) {{are believed}} {{to play an important}} role in Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD). Aqueous extracts of human brain contain A beta assemblies that migrate on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and elute from size exclusion as dimers (similar to 8 kDa) and can block long-term potentiation and impair memory consolidation in the rat. Such species are detected specifically and sensitively in extracts of Alzheimer brain suggesting that SDS-stable dimers may be the basic building blocks of AD-associated synaptotoxic assemblies. Consequently, understanding the structure and properties of A beta dimers is of great interest. In the absence of sufficient brain-derived dimer to facilitate biophysical analysis, we generated synthetic dimers designed to mimic the natural species. For this, A beta(1 - 40) containing cysteine in place of serine 26 was used to produce disulphide cross-linked dimer, (A beta S 26 C) (2). Such dimers had no detectable secondary structure, produced an analytical ultracentrifugation profile consistent for an similar to 8. 6 kDa protein, and had no effect on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). However, (A beta S 26 C) (2) aggregated more rapidly than either A beta S 26 C or wild-type monomers and formed parastable beta-sheet rich, thioflavin T-positive, protofibril-like assemblies. Whereas wildtype A beta aggregated to form typical amyloid fibrils, the protofibril-like structures formed by (A beta S 26 C) (2) persisted for prolonged periods and potently inhibited LIP in mouse hippocampus. These data support the idea that A beta dimers may stabilize the formation of fibril intermediates by a process distinct from that available to A beta monomer and that higher molecular <b>weight</b> prefibrillar <b>assemblies</b> are the proximate mediators of A beta toxicity...|$|R
