25|$|A {{couple and}} their adult son and two adult daughters {{live in a}} fenced compound. The {{children}} {{have no knowledge of}} the outside world; their parents say they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> leave once they lose a dogtooth, and that one can only leave safely by car. The children entertain themselves with endurance games, such as holding their hands under hot water. They believe they have a brother {{on the other side of}} the fence to whom they throw supplies. The parents reward good behaviour with stickers and bad with violence.|$|E
25|$|Maturin and Bonden {{return from}} Mauritius with news that HMS Bombay is nearby, in a running fight {{with both the}} French Vénus and Victor. The Boadicea engages the French ships. Aubrey makes use of {{volunteer}} crew from the refitting HMS Africaine to board and capture Bombay and Vénus. During the encounter the French Commodore Hamelin is killed. Aubrey plans how to finish the battle, once the remaining French ships <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> sail, and his ships are ready to fight again, when they reach Mauritius. Keating is equally ready. The Emma nears the Boadicea, with many other British sails in view. Tom Pullings comes aboard with the Gazette announcing {{the birth of a}} son to Sophia. Aubrey is ecstatic at the news. Then he opens Admiral Bertie's letter ordering him to join the fleet at Rodriguez, where he will be on HMS Illustrious, and the Army led by General Abercrombie. The final invasion, based on Aubrey and Keating's original plan, is almost without bloodshed. The French capitulate after being given honourable terms.|$|E
500|$|The OUN {{decided to}} attack Polish civilians, who {{constituted}} {{about a third}} of the population of the disputed territories. The OUN equated Ukrainian independence with ethnic homogeneity; the Polish presence had to be removed completely. By February 1943 the OUN began a deliberate campaign of murdering Polish civilians. OUN forces targeted Polish villages, prompting the formation of Polish self-defense units (e.g., the Przebraże Defence) and fights between the Home Army and the OUN. The Germans encouraged both sides against each other; Erich Koch said: [...] "We have to do everything possible so that a Pole, when meeting a Ukrainian, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> kill him, and conversely, a Ukrainian <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> kill the Pole." [...] A German commissioner from Sarny, when local Poles complained about massacres, answered: [...] "You want Sikorski, the Ukrainians want Bandera. Fight each other." [...] In massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, beginning in the spring of 1943, between 60,000 and 100,000 Poles were killed.|$|E

40|$|Most {{parents with}} “ problem {{children}}” have other children who present {{few or no}} problems, but they declare, practically without exception, that from the start they {{have been unable to}} fathom their “ problem child”. Early help in this connection could be valuable. A mother will appreciate recognition of her baby as an individual by a doctor or nurse and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>readier</b> <b>to</b> approach them later with her problems...|$|R

500|$|The forty-second trailer {{features}} Donna Noble, {{portrayed by}} comedian Catherine Tate, sitting over a camp fire, talking about [...] "creatures of metal, fire, and blood" [...] threatening {{the universe as}} shots of the Daleks, Sontarans, and the Ood come into view. She talks about a man called the Doctor (David Tennant), who is portrayed in fleeting glimpses until his name is mentioned, who constantly saves the universe from these threats. Donna ends her narration by saying the Doctor will be back to save them and she <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> join him. The trailer ends with the Doctor and Donna simultaneously saying [...] "and just like that, we'll be gone." ...|$|E
500|$|The Apostolic Faith {{publication}} {{reported the}} happenings at the Azusa Street Mission to the world. Its first issue's lead story was titled [...] "Pentecost has Come". It contained {{a letter from}} Charles Parham, an article on Pentecost from Acts, {{and a series of}} anecdotes of people's experience within the revival. One edition in 1907 wrote, [...] "One token of the Lord's coming is that He is melting all races and nations together, and they are filled with the power and glory of God. He is baptizing by one spirit into one body and making up a people that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> meet Him when He comes". The Apostolic Faith brought increasing attention to the happenings at Azusa Street and the fledgling movement that was emerging from the revival.|$|E

2500|$|The song Far Away in Australia [...] sung by the Irish ballad group The Wolfe Tones {{portrays the}} sorrow {{of two young}} Irish lovers who are {{separated}} when the male youth is forced to make his living far away in Australia, leaving his girl behind.

2500|$|There is, most {{importantly}} to the Baconians' argument, evidence that Bacon had {{control over the}} Gray's Inn players. In a letter either to Lord Burghley, dated before 1598, or to the Earl of Somerset in 1613, he writes, [...] "I am sorry the joint masque from the four Inns of Court faileth here are a dozen gentlemen of Gray's Inn that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> furnish a masque". [...] The dedication to a masque by Francis Beaumont performed at Whitehall in 1613 describes Bacon as the [...] "chief contriver" [...] of its performances at Gray's Inn and the Inner Temple. He also {{appears to have been}} their treasurer prior to the 1594–95 revels.|$|E
2500|$|Socrates tells Cebes to [...] "bid him (his friend) {{farewell}} from me; {{say that}} I would have him {{come after me}} if he be a wise man" [...] Simmias expresses confusion {{as to why they}} ought hasten to follow Socrates to death. Socrates then states [...] "...he, who has the spirit of philosophy, will be willing to die; but he will not take his own life." [...] Cebes raises his doubts as to why suicide is prohibited. He asks, [...] "Why do you say...that a man ought not to take his own life, but that the philosopher <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> follow one who is dying?" [...] Socrates replies that while death is the ideal home of the soul, man, specifically the philosopher, should not commit suicide except when it becomes necessary.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{teach me}} better," [...] said Will. [...] "I will never grumble {{on that subject}} again." [...] There was a {{gentleness}} in his tone which came from the unutterable contentment of perceiving--what Dorothea was hardly conscious of--that she was travelling into the remoteness of pure pity and loyalty towards her husband. <b>Will</b> <b>was</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> adore her pity and loyalty, if she would associate himself with her in manifesting them.

These studies demonstrate that historical approaches to improving the resolution and sensitivity of space telescopes have reached technology barriers {{which can only be}} overcome by innovative solutions to the telescope design. Some of the key technology issues which are guiding the approaches for advanced space telescopes are discussed, and arguments are presented that enabling technology development for these future systems must commence now...|$|R
