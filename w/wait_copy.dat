40|$|Abstract—As for {{the problem}} of how to carry out task {{scheduling}} and data replication effectively in the grid and to reduce task’s execution time, this thesis proposes the task scheduling algorithm and the optimum dynamic data replication algorithm and builds a scheme to effectively combine these two algorithms. First of all, the scheme adopts the ISS algorithm considering the number of tasks waiting queue, the location of task demand data and calculation capacity of site by adopting the method of network structure’s hierarchical scheduling to calculate the cost of comprehensive task with the proper weight efficiency and search out the best compute node area. And then the algorithm of ODHRA is adopted to analyze the data transmission time, memory access latency, <b>waiting</b> <b>copy</b> requests in the queue and the distance between nodes, choose out the best replications location in many copies combined with copy placement and copy management to reduce the file access time. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme compared with other algorithm has better performance in terms of average task execution time...|$|R

I have no doubt that you feel the same way yourself, and that you would not care to stake the whole credit of the Gazette upon this adventure until we can meet the chorus of criticism and scepticism which such articles must of necessity elicit. So this wonderful incident, which would make such a headline for the old paper, must still wait its turn in the editorial drawer.|$|R

As Fingerprince was originally {{meant to be}} a three-sided album (a concept abandoned due to expense and Monty Python's Matching Tie and Handkerchief beating them to the punch), much of the material was abandoned and the third side remained unfinished until November 1977 although most tracks from the EP was shown at the Residents Radio Special in September 1977. Thus, the group reduced the third side to an extended play record entitled '"Babyfingers'", and released it in 1979 to people who had been <b>waiting</b> for their <b>copy</b> of The Third Reich and Roll box sets. A second printing was made for members of the W.E.I.R.D. fan club in 1981, and a last pressing, on pink vinyl, in 1985. For the most part, it has been incorporated into most CD versions of Fingerprince, beginning in 1988.|$|R

MY DEAR READER,--The work we {{have already}} gone through {{together}} has, I hope, enabled you to draw with fair success either rounded and simple masses, like stones, or complicated arrangements of form, like those of leaves; provided only these masses or complexities will stay quiet for you to copy, and do not extend into quantity so great as to baffle your patience. But if we are now {{to go out to}} the fields, and to draw anything like a complete landscape, neither of these conditions will any more be observed for us. The clouds will not <b>wait</b> while we <b>copy</b> their heaps or clefts; the shadows will escape from us as we try to shape them, each, in its stealthy minute march, still leaving light where its tremulous edge had rested the moment before, and involving in eclipse objects that had seemed safe from its influence; and instead of the small clusters of leaves which we could reckon point by point, embarrassing enough even though numerable, we have now leaves as little to be counted as the sands of the sea, and restless, perhaps, as its foam.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Bulk memory copying and {{initialization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} ubiquitous operations performed in current computer systems by both user applications and Operating Systems. While many current systems rely on a loop of loads and stores, there are proposals to introduce a single instruction to perform bulk memory copying. While such an instruction can improve performance due to generating fewer TLB and cache accesses, and requiring fewer pipeline resources, in this paper we show that the key to significantly improving the performance is removing pipeline and cache bottlenecks of the code that follows the instructions. We show that the bottlenecks arise due to (1) the pipeline clogged by the copying instruction, (2) lengthened critical path due to dependent instructions stalling while <b>waiting</b> for the <b>copying</b> to complete, and (3) the inability to specify (separately) the cacheability of the source and destination regions. We propose FastBCI, an architecture support that achieves the granularity efficiency of a bulk copy-ing/initialization instruction, but without its pipeline and cache bottlenecks. When applied to OS kernel buffer management, we show that on average FastBCI achieves anywhere between 23 % to 32 % speedup ratios, which is roughly 3 ×– 4 × of an alternative scheme, and 1. 5 ×– 2 × of a highly optimistic DMA with zero setup and interrupt overheads.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} how pioneers in {{sustainable}} entrepreneurship influence other enterprises and how government {{can help in}} this process. The analysis is inspired by Hockerts and Wüstenhagen (2010). Schaltegger (2002, p. 46) describes the importance of pioneers/innovators as follows: „Innovations can alter the economy and society fundamentally. Cars, computers and the Internet have changed {{the world in a}} more fundamental way than have most political programs‟. Finding a proper definition for a pioneer is not simple. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (Simpson & Weiner, 1991, p. 883) a pioneer is ‘one who goes before to prepare or open up the way for others to follow; one who begins, or takes part in beginning, some enterprise, course of action etc’. Pioneers in corporate social responsibility (CSR) play an important role because of their leadership and precedent role in innovation and everything that deals with sustainability. The power of the pioneer is that he demonstrates that CSR is economically attractive (Bouckaert, Boulogne, Sas, Van Liedekerke, Vercaeren & Vloeberg, 2008). Therefore, they can fulfill an important role on other enterprises. Bouckaert et. al (2008) define a pioneer as someone who explores new possibilities, who does groundbreaking work. Other words are icebreaker, innovator or trailblazer. It can be seen that incumbent enterprises tend to become more sustainable the last decades. In this movement towards sustainability, an important factor is the influence of pioneers in sustainable entrepreneurship, which can be defined as enterprises that introduce sustainability in a way the market hasn’t seen before. This article researches whether there is an influence of pioneers in sustainable entrepreneurship on other enterprises in becoming more sustainable. Case studies of six pioneers in different sectors are analyzed. This provides us with a view on the relevance of pioneers in sustainable entrepreneurship. Cases are: De Duurzame Drukker (the Sustainable Printer), Desso, Ecopower, Ecover, GreenPan, and Green Gastronomy. Nine important factors have been found that enhance influence of the pioneers: values and persuasion; education, sensitizing and lectures; relationship with suppliers; get out of the niche markets; work together; successful business model; show that sustainable enterprises work; same price while sustainable and no way back to ensure credibility. The cases show that pioneers have an influence and provoke a reaction of other enterprises, making them more sustainable. Other enterprises start behaving more sustainable, produce bad greenwashed <b>copies,</b> <b>wait</b> and see or just do nothing. This reaction could however be just in a small part influenced by pioneers, as other factors can also be of importance. When {{we take a look at}} pioneers, they start doing business in a sustainable way because they want it themselves, not because a competitor has shown that it is profitable. Pioneering takes too much risk to fit the strategic view. Pioneers are rather value driven and thus altruistic, hence they can be important to influence the market and strategic entrepreneurs because of an increase in sustainable products. Through sustainable innovation, not only qualitative sustainable products are being put into the market. Also the enterprises that implement sustaibable innovation make the rest of the sector more sustainable. Crals and Vereeck (2004) state that sustainable entrepreneurship is applied mostly by large companies. The selected cases however contradict this, because most of the discussed pioneers are in fact SMEs, even small companies. This shows that all enterprises can act responsible and even be a pioneer in sustainable entrepreneurship. The things that pioneers in sustainable entrepreneurship have in common however are numerous: driven by values, a big persuasiveness and perseverance, pioneers have an influence on other enterprises and the market that cannot be neglected. An important role is educating, sensitizing and giving lectures. This way, knowledge can be spread. Telling much about their R&D activities is a bridge too far however. A good relationship with suppliers is an important asset that helps sustainable entrepreneurs doing business. In order to reach consumers, getting out of the niche and position in the mass market is important. Working together with others helps doing this. Pioneers show that they have a good business model and soon become fixed values within their sector. They show that it is possible to be a sustainable enterprise, and that it is possible to get somewhere where others never went before. Once pioneers in sustainable entrepreneurship have taken the lead, they tend to keep it for a while because pioneers are very driven and enjoy a great amount of know-how. When sustainability is value driven, with a good history and credibility, it becomes an extra asset to the product and sells better. All these assets provoke a reaction of the competitors. Four different reactions can be seen: becoming more sustainable, copying and pasting some characteristics of the product, wait and see or just do nothing. For the selected cases, these reactions were seen one by one for all pioneers. There is no clear proof that the stimulus to become more sustainable is entirely driven by the pioneers. The case studies indicate though that they at least have some influence, one that cannot be neglected. In current society where sustainability is becoming more and more important, pioneers in sustainable entrepreneurship pave the way for other enterprises, incumbents as well as small companies and start-ups. By influencing the mass market through sustainable innovation, the sustainable innovation gets diffused. Socially responsible entrepreneurs often willingly share their business experiences with other aspiring entrepreneurs. Sustainable innovation means nothing without being diffused into the market and bought by consumers. Looking at how innovation is being diffused provides us with a closer look at how pioneers in sustainable entrepreneurship relate to other enterprises. Being a role model can be a priority and an important measure of success (Choi et al., 2008). The cases have also shown that the government can help in this sustainable business process, but government is not necessarily needed. These entrepreneurs are so much convinced of the need of a sustainable process that they will continue, with or without help. When looking back at the model by Hockerts and Wüstenhagen (2010), this article confirms that sustainability start ups influence market incumbents. Coming from or starting in a niche market, they gain market share and make incumbents aware of sustainability. Through this movement, the industry is transformed sustainably. The model is however just a part of the reality, and only when successful companies are being dealt with. Not all companies will be as successful to gain market share, some are willing and happy to stay in the niche market. Real pioneers will rather keep the lead compared with the incumbents, even if they are caught up like Ecover, there will still be a difference, but in small detail. Companies like Desso were never part of the niche sustainability market, but are still able to influence others on sustainability. We see that sustainable industry starts with so called Davids but is brought about by the interaction between Davids and Goliaths. status: publishe...|$|R
