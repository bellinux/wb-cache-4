5|$|Cicadas use {{a variety}} of {{strategies}} to evade predators. Large cicadas can fly rapidly to escape if disturbed. Many are extremely well camouflaged to evade predators such as birds that hunt by sight. As well as being coloured like tree bark, they are disruptively patterned to break up their outlines; their partly transparent <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> held over the body and pressed close to the substrate. The <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> antireflective, avoiding the typical shine of insect cuticle, which would break the cicada's camouflage. Some cicada species play dead when threatened.|$|E
5|$|In the Diptera (true flies), {{there is}} only one pair of {{functional}} wings, with the posterior pair of <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> reduced to halteres, which help the fly to sense its orientation and movement, as well as to improve balance by acting similar to gyroscopes. In Calyptratae, the very hindmost portion of the <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> modified into somewhat thickened flaps called calypters which cover the halteres.|$|E
5|$|The body {{is divided}} into a thorax of three {{segments}} and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> attached to {{the second and third}} thoracic segments. The tegmina, or first pair of <b>wings,</b> <b>are</b> tough and protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins.|$|E
50|$|The present castle {{is largely}} a 19th-century reconstruction, but {{a part of the}} north <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> still 15th century. One <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> {{inhabited}} by the present owners; another <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> a museum, open to the public.|$|R
50|$|The {{front and}} rear <b>wings</b> <b>were</b> fixed to a long, {{uncovered}} fuselage frame, with the front wing gently tapered. The top <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> strut-braced to the structure below. Side curtains between the two full-span <b>wings</b> <b>were</b> initially fitted.|$|R
50|$|The Georgian east <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> {{the oldest}} {{part of the}} house dating from 1745-46. A north <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> {{demolished}} in the early 19th century. The south and west <b>wings</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt 1953-60 to a sensitive Neo-Georgian design by Marshall Sisson.|$|R
5|$|The wings lie flat on {{the body}} and are very {{variable}} in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others. The fore <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> elytra made of tough chitin, acting as a protective shield for the soft {{parts of the body}} and in males, bear the stridulatory organs for the production of sound. The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under the fore wings. In many species, the <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> not adapted for flight.|$|E
5|$|Winged gods, other mythological creatures, {{and birds}} are {{frequently}} depicted on cylinder seals and steles from the 3rd millennium {{all the way}} to the Assyrians. Both two-winged and four-winged figures are known and the <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> most often extended to the side. Spread <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> part of one type of representation for Ishtar. However, the specific depiction of the hanging wings of the nude goddess may have evolved from what was originally a cape.|$|E
5|$|Wings: Two {{pairs of}} <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> present {{in almost all}} taxa. The wings have very few cross-veins.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is constructed in brick with stone dressings, and has slate roofs. Its plan {{consists of a}} central block and two wings. The central block is in Georgian style, the west <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> Neo-Georgian, and the east wing, which incorporates the chapel, is Gothic Revival. The windows in the central block and the west <b>wing</b> <b>are</b> sashes, and those in east <b>wing</b> <b>are</b> lancets. The slates {{on the roof of}} the east <b>wing</b> <b>are</b> in grey and purple bands. On the apex of the roof of this <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> a cross finial.|$|R
40|$|Three aeroelastically-tailored forward swept <b>wings</b> <b>were</b> optimized, {{manufactured}} {{and tested}} at the subsonic SWG wind-tunnel in Göttingen. The first flexible <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> used for static tests and material characterization, the second glass-fibre reinforced <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> designed for maximizing deflection while constraining the wing tip-twist {{and the third}} carbon-fibre composite <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> designed targeting minimization of mass. The design of the <b>wings</b> <b>was</b> performed using an in-house aeroelastic optimization framework. The three <b>wings</b> <b>were</b> then tested at the SWG subsonic wind-tunnel in Göttingen. The wind-tunnel tests for the second flexible <b>wing</b> <b>were</b> later complimented by ground-vibration tests and static load tests to evaluate its eigen frequencies, mode shapes and to measure the strains. These results are planned for use in updating the models. The work here thus presents a complete cycle of design, manufacturing and wind-tunnel testing of an optimized forward swept wing...|$|R

5|$|Besides {{providing}} the primary function of flight, wings also have secondary functions of self-defence, camouflage and thermoregulation. In some Lepidoptera families {{such as the}} Psychidae and Lymantriidae, the <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> reduced or even absent (often in the female but not the male).|$|E
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female adult red-backed fairywren may utilise the {{rodent-run}} display to distract predators from nests with young birds. The head, neck and tail are lowered, the <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> held out and the feathers are fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{with all}} insects, {{the anatomy of}} the termite thorax {{consists}} of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.|$|E
50|$|The boys' <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> {{located at}} Gupkar Road, Sonwar Bagh, Srinagar. The girls' <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> located at Shivpora, Srinagar.|$|R
50|$|The Millet Lagarde ML-10 was a one-off {{prototype}} of an experimental four-seat biplane. The upper <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> {{fixed to the}} cabin roof and the lower <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> fixed {{to the bottom of}} the cabin. The <b>wings</b> <b>were</b> heavily staggered so that the upper wing's trailing edge and lower <b>wing's</b> leading edge <b>were</b> vertically in line with each other.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> {{deployed}} on Saratoga {{until the}} ship was torpedoed in January 1942. Part of the <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> then deployed aboard USS Yorktown (CV-5) and helped cripple the Japanese carrier Soryu {{during the battle of}} Midway. The <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> also involved in the first carrier strikes against Tokyo.|$|R
5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; its small feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> angled back. It has a quicker, deeper wingbeat than do other loons.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this family}} have long, broad <b>wings,</b> <b>are</b> strong fliers and, rather surprisingly, given their size and weight, very capable soarers. The body tends to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved {{in the case of}} the ibises, {{straight}} and distinctively flattened in the spoonbills.|$|E
5|$|Paranota plus leg gene {{recruitment}} hypothesis: The fossil larvae of Coxoplectoptera provided {{important new}} {{clues to the}} disputed question of the evolutionary origin of insect wings. Before the larvae fossil discovery the paranotal-hypothesis and the leg-exite-hypothesis have been considered as incompatible alternative explanations, which have both been supported {{by a set of}} evidences from the fossil record, comparative morphology, developmental biology and genetics. The expression of leg genes in the ontogeny of the insect wing has been universally considered as conclusive evidence in favour of the leg-exite-hypothesis, which proposes that insect <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> derived from mobile leg appendages (exites). However, the larvae of Coxoplectoptera show that the abdominal gills of mayflies and their ancestors, which are generally considered as corresponding structures to insect wings, articulated within the dorsal tergite plates. This cannot be seen in modern mayfly larvae, because their abdominal tergites and sternites are fused to rings, without any traces left even in embryonic development. If larval gills and <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> corresponding ("serial homologous") structures and thus share the same evolutionary origin, the new results from Coxoplectoptera demonstrate that also <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> of tergal origin, as proposed by the classical paranotal-hypothesis. Staniczek, Bechly & Godunko (2011) therefore suggested a new hypothesis that could reconcile the apparently conflicting evidence from paleontology and developmental genetics: wings first originated as stiff outgrowths of tergal plates (paranota), and only later in evolution became mobile, articulated appendages through secondary recruiting of leg genes.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> {{added to}} the house in 1975 to hold exhibits. The <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> paid for with {{donations}} from John and Ruth West and the Rahr Foundation. Another <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> added in 1986 to display and store a permanent collection of American art donated by the Wests.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} {{from a combination}} of wood, styrofoam, aluminium and fiberglass. The semi-tapered <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> built from wood and styrofoam, covered with stress-bearing fiberglass. The <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> tapered outboard of the mid-span point. The <b>wing</b> spar <b>is</b> built up from 14 layers of fiberglass and epoxy resin at the root and is a box-style spar that occupies 40% of the wing chord. The <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> constructed in three pieces, a center-section and wing tips and features Schempp-Hirth dive brakes. The <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> 15% thick and employs a NACA 64(3)-615 laminar flow airfoil.|$|R
5|$|Part of the canonization of the Zhou yi bound it {{to a set}} of ten commentaries {{called the}} Ten Wings. The Ten <b>Wings</b> <b>are</b> of a much later {{provenance}} than the Zhou yi, and are the production of a different society. The Zhou yi was written in Early Old Chinese, while the Ten Wings were written in a predecessor to Middle Chinese. The specific origins of the Ten <b>Wings</b> <b>are</b> still a complete mystery to academics. Regardless of their historical relation to the text, the philosophical depth of the Ten Wings made the I Ching a perfect fit to Han period Confucian scholarship. The inclusion of the Ten Wings reflects a widespread recognition in ancient China, found in the Zuo zhuan and other pre-Han texts, that the I Ching was a rich moral and symbolic document useful for more than professional divination.|$|E
5|$|Some species, such as Gryllus assimilis, take off, fly, {{and land}} {{efficiently}} and well, while other species are clumsy fliers. In some species, the hind <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> shed, leaving wing stumps, usually after dispersal of the insect by flight. In other species, {{they may be}} pulled off and consumed by the cricket itself or by another individual, probably providing a nutritional boost.|$|E
5|$|The bee-eaters are morphologically {{a fairly}} uniform group. They share many {{features}} with related Coraciiformes {{such as the}} kingfishers and rollers, being large-headed (although less so than their relatives), short-necked, brightly plumaged and short-legged. Their wings may be rounded or pointed, with the wing shape closely correlated with the species' preferred foraging habitat and migratory tendencies. Shorter, rounder <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> found on species that are sedentary and make typically short foraging flights in denser forests and reed-beds. Those with more elongated <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> more migratory. All the bee-eaters are highly aerial; they take off strongly from perches, fly directly without undulations, {{and are able to}} change direction quickly, although they rarely hover.|$|E
50|$|Door handles to {{the east}} <b>wing</b> <b>are</b> a {{distinctive}} lever type while those to the west <b>wing</b> <b>are</b> plain, stainless steel knob-sets.|$|R
50|$|With {{the end of}} the Cold War in 1990, the <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> {{gradually}} phased down. In addition, the 1960s-era McDonnell RF-4C Phantoms {{were increasingly}} costing more and more to maintain. Tactical reconnaissance was being handled by other means, and the need for the <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> becoming less critical to USAFE planners. As a result, the RF-4Cs of the <b>wing</b> <b>were</b> sent to AMARC on 1 April 1991 and the wing's remaining tactical squadron <b>was</b> inactivated. The <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> inactivated on 31 July 1991.|$|R
50|$|An east <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> {{added as}} part of a WPA project in 1939 and a west <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> added on to the back in 1949.|$|R
5|$|The body of {{the male}} is black, except for the orange middle part of the abdomen. The <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> yellowish-translucent and the {{antennae}} are black. The front pair of legs have a yellowish-orange colour, the back pair is heavily thickened and is coloured black on the posterior splint and tarsus, while the femur is orange.|$|E
5|$|The juveniles’ {{markings}} {{follow a}} similar pattern to adult birds, but they are washed with a rusty brown {{on the head and}} upper breast, and the back and <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> mottled buff or brown with prominent white tips. The young birds’ eyes are brown.|$|E
5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} hard to see by other methods, such as by using a highly irregular outline. For example, the comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, is highly cryptic when its <b>wings</b> <b>are</b> closed, with cryptic colours, disruptive pattern, and irregular outer margins to the wings.|$|E
50|$|The {{main block}} and east <b>wing</b> <b>are</b> devoted to public and family space, while the west <b>wing</b> <b>is</b> entirely devoted to servant {{quarters}} and facilities.|$|R
5000|$|This small {{butterfly}} has slim, triangular wings. The upperside of the male's <b>wings</b> <b>is</b> mostly orange {{with the}} margins being dark brown. The {{underside of the}} male's <b>wings</b> <b>is</b> mainly yellow orange with the margins being dark brown. There is a yellow basal spot enclosed with brown. The upperside of the female's <b>wings</b> <b>is</b> dark brown with large, glassy spots near the forewing outer margin. The underside of the female's <b>wings</b> <b>is</b> a brownish-burgundy color with the hindwing having a white streak on the costal edge. The <b>wing</b> margins <b>are</b> broadly frosted. The wingspan measures [...] to [...] inches (35-41 mm).|$|R
50|$|Gordon {{made the}} changes to the property. The north <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> built in 1931 and {{expanded}} eight years later. Two decades later, in 1956, the gym was added. The kitchen <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> built in 1966, and three years later the garage on the north <b>wing</b> <b>was</b> added. The school remained active until the early 1980s.|$|R
