5|$|Aside {{from his}} career in hockey, Ross was {{interested}} in improving the game. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1927–28 season, the NHL adopted a new style of goal net created by Ross. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> molded into a B-shape, it was better designed to catch pucks and the net was used until 1984, when a modified version was adopted. He also improved the design of the puck. Ross' design had bevel edges, which prevented it bouncing too much, and used synthetic rubber, rather than the natural rubber previously in vogue. Along with New York Rangers coach Frank Boucher, Ross helped to create the red line, which was introduced to help speed up the game by removing the ability for defenders to pass the puck from the defensive to offensive zone; until 2006 it was against the rules of hockey to make a two line pass. More scoring chances resulted as teams could not simply send the puck down the ice with impunity. In order to help tell the red line and blue lines apart on television, Ross suggested that the red line be striped.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} World Championship Grand Prix in 1950, red flags {{have been shown}} in seventy races, with the latest one being at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix on 25 June 2017. Twenty-six were {{restarted}} on the first lap. Thirteen races were not restarted, nine because of rain and four due to accidents involving drivers. Five races were stopped due to incidents that resulted in fatalities: The 1975 Spanish Grand Prix was stopped on lap twenty-nine and not restarted after Rolf Stommelen's car crashed into a spectator area, killing five people. The 1978 Italian Grand Prix was red-flagged after a massive crash that ultimately contributed {{to the death of}} Ronnie Peterson. The 1982 Canadian Grand Prix was halted on the first lap after Riccardo Paletti was killed when his car collided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of Didier Pironi's Ferrari. The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was red-flagged on lap five following the fatal accident of Ayrton Senna, in which his car crashed into a wall at the Tamburello curve. The 2014 Japanese Grand Prix was red-flagged for a second time following a serious collision between Jules Bianchi and a recovery vehicle which would ultimately prove to be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars) are broad and long, extending {{to the front}} margins of the first upper molar (M1). Wilfredomys has even longer incisive foramina, extending between the molars, but the foramina are shorter in J.ossitenuis and J.pictipes. The palate itself is wide and short, with its back margin between the M3s. Oryzomyines like Oecomys and Oligoryzomys have longer palates, extending beyond the third molars. Fine openings (foramina) are present on the palate. The back margin of the palate is squared; J.anoblepas lacks a spine {{in the middle of}} the back margin, as is present in Rhipidomys. Wilfredomys has the back margin U-shaped instead and has a longer palate, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> margin behind the M3s.|$|E

5|$|The single known {{example of}} Argentodites is a blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4). It has {{a length of}} 4.15mm, height of 2.10mm, and width of 1.35mm. The crown is nearly complete, but the roots are largely missing. Kielan-Jaworowska {{considered}} two possible orientations of the tooth—one <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> margin nearly vertically, {{and the other with}} the margin inclined backwards—but preferred the former, which made for a more natural placement of the roots. Although the left and right sides of the tooth are almost identical, they believed the tooth is most likely a left p4, as this would make the lingual (inner) side the more convex one, as is usual in the p4 of cimolodontan multituberculates with a large p4.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Rosberg {{retained}} his lead ahead of Ricciardo, followed by Vettel and Räikkönen. Sergio Pérez gained two places and was fifth, while Esteban Gutiérrez damaged his front wing when he made contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of Nico Hülkenberg's car. Hamilton remained tenth until he overtook Kvyat for ninth place on lap four. One lap later, both Bottas and Hamilton seized an opportunity to overtake Max Verstappen, as he ran wide into turn two. As a reaction, Red Bull decided to change tyres on Verstappen's car on the following lap. Another lap later, Ricciardo followed suit. At Red Bull's sister team Toro Rosso, Daniil Kvyat retired on lap eight. On lap ten, Hamilton overtook Bottas for fourth place, but was more than twenty seconds behind teammate Rosberg. He went into the pit lane for a tyre change on lap 15. Force India reacted two laps later and brought Pérez in and he emerged back from the pit lane just ahead of Hamilton. Meanwhile, the order at the front was Rosberg, Vettel, Bottas, Ricciardo and Räikkönen. On lap 18, Räikkönen took fourth place by overtaking Ricciardo on the start/finish straight. Pérez moved ahead of Massa into seventh on lap 20, and Hamilton followed through one lap later, while Bottas pitted and returned to the track in ninth place.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{were long}} aware that Tursiops {{dolphins}} might consist {{of more than}} one species. Molecular genetics allowed much greater insight into this previously intractable problem. The IUCN acknowledges two species, although a third distinct species was described in 2011: the common bottlenose dolphin (T. truncatus) is found in most tropical to temperate oceans, and it has a grey color, with the shade of grey varying among populations, but it can be bluish-grey, brownish-grey, or even nearly black, and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the dorsal fin; the Black Sea bottlenose dolphin (T. t. ponticus), a subspecies of T. truncatus lives in the Black Sea; The Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. gillii or T. t. gillii), another subspecies of T. truncatus, lives in the Pacific, and has a black line from the eye to the forehead; the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (T. aduncus) lives in the waters around India, northern Australia, South China, the Red Sea, and the eastern coast of Africa, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> being dark-grey and the belly being lighter grey or nearly white with grey spots; the Burrunan dolphin (T. australis), found in the Port Phillip and Gippsland Lakes areas of Victoria, Australia, was described in September 2011 after research showed it was distinct from T. truncatus and T. aduncus, but is not considered a separate species by the IUCN.|$|E

25|$|Kotomitsuki was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, and his {{favourite}} {{grip on the}} mawashi was migi-yotsu, {{with his}} left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms (although he was also capable of fighting in the reverse position, hidari-yotsu). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri, the force out, followed by oshi-dashi (push out) and hataki-komi (slap down). He was fond of dashinage (pulling throws, both overarm and underarm), and {{was also one of the}} few rikishi to employ uchi-muso, a technique which involves tapping the opponent's inner thigh <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the hand to off-balance him, before twisting him down.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mixed}} doubles version of curling, a rule called a power play was {{introduced}} in the 2016-17 season. Each team can exercise the power play in one end per game, only when they have the hammer (throwing the last rock in an end). Instead of positioning the rock in the house on the center line, it is placed to a position straddling the edge of the eight-foot circle, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> edge of the stone touching the tee line. The opponent's guard stone is place in line with the stone {{in the house and the}} hack. The power play cannot be used in an extra end.|$|E

The bus then plowed into a Kennedy Fried Chicken restaurant {{at the corner of}} the intersection. The accident killed 3 people including the tour bus driver, and injured at least 17. The private charter bus company had been repeatedly cited for reckless driving. The charter driver was a former MTA bus driver, until he was fired in April 2015 after a crash in his personal automobile in which he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and leaving the scene of the crash.|$|E

While the wireless truck was able to continue {{the loss of the}} Breda's firepower was a setback to the unit. In addition a G1 Patrol vehicle wrecked its sump after hitting a rock and this too was stripped and abandoned. T1 Patrol's wireless truck separated from the column and parked in a field at Sidi Selim (about 12km south-east of Barce) to act as a rendezvous point after the attack; this truck was also to keep a constant radio watch for messages from Lt Col David Stirling's SAS unit operating that night against Benghazi ("Operation Bigamy").|$|E
