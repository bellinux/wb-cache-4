5|$|To {{support their}} {{categorization}} of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others, many critics {{refer to a}} set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode. The question of <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>the</b> set of noir's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy. For instance, critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion, but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings (e.g., Stranger on the Third Floor, The Big Sleep, Dark Passage, and The Dark Corner), while the tone of many other noir denouements is ambivalent. Some critics perceive classic noir's hallmark as a distinctive visual style. Others, observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs, instead emphasize plot and character type. Still others focus on mood and attitude. No survey of classic noir's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive. In the 1990s and 2000s, critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo-noir; once again, there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period.|$|E

Manufacturers and suppliers also provide informational publications, but because they market the substances, {{they are subject to}} monitoring and enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which polices claims by marketers. <b>What</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>the</b> difference between truthful and false claims is hotly debated and is a central controversy in this arena.|$|E

25|$|Symbols {{of death}} abound in The Wind Will Carry Us, with the scenery of the graveyard, the imminence {{of the old}} woman's passing, and the {{ancestors}} referred to early in the film by the character Farzad. Such devices prompt the viewer {{to reflect on the}} parameters of the afterlife and immaterial existence. The viewer is asked to consider <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>the</b> soul, and what happens to it after death. In discussing the film, Kiarostami said that he is the person who raises questions, rather than answers them.|$|E
25|$|Metaphysical naturalists do {{not believe}} in a soul or spirit, nor in ghosts, and when {{explaining}} <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>the</b> mind they rarely appeal to substance dualism. If one's mind, or rather one's identity and existence as a person, is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as ideas, theories, emotions, moral and personal values, or aesthetic response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is to say, all humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism calls into question the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{what the}} Bible is to Christianity and the Quran is to Islam, {{but like all}} major ancient Indian religions, there is no {{consensus}} among the different Buddhist traditions as to <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>the</b> scriptures or a common canon in Buddhism. The general belief among Buddhists is that the canonical corpus is vast. This corpus includes the ancient Sutras organized into Nikayas, itself the part of three basket of texts called the Tripitakas. Each Buddhist tradition has its own collection of texts, much of which is translation of ancient Pali and Sanskrit Buddhist texts of India. The Chinese Buddhist canon, for example, includes 2184 texts in 55 volumes, while the Tibetan canon comprises 1108 texts – all claimed to have been spoken by the Buddha – and another 3461 texts composed by Indian scholars revered in the Tibetan tradition. The Buddhist textual history has been vast; over 40,000 manuscripts mostly Buddhist, some non-Buddhist, were discovered in 1900 in the Dunhuang Chinese cave alone.|$|E

50|$|The precise {{definition}} of <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> an economy car has varied {{with time and}} place, based on the conditions prevailing at the time, such as fuel prices, disposable income of buyers, and cultural mores. In any given decade, there has generally been some rough global consensus on <b>what</b> <b>constituted</b> <b>the</b> minimum necessary requirements for a highway-worthy car, <b>constituting</b> <b>the</b> most economical car possible. However, whether that consensus could be a commercial success in any given country depended on local culture. Thus in any given decade, every country has had a rough national consensus on <b>what</b> <b>constituted</b> <b>the</b> minimum necessary requirements for the least expensive car that wasn't undesirable, that is, that had some commercially attractive amount of market demand, making it a mainstream economy car. In many countries at various times, mainstream economy and maximum economy have been one and the same.|$|R

25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>the</b> ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E
25|$|Morris Louis's {{painting}} Where 1960, {{was a major}} {{innovation that}} moved abstract expressionist painting forward {{in a new direction}} toward Color Field and Minimalism. Among Louis's major works are his various series of color field paintings. Some of his best known series' are the Unfurleds, the Veils, the Florals and the Stripes or Pillars. From 1929 to 1933, Louis studied at the Maryland Institute of Fine and Applied Arts (now Maryland Institute College of Art). He worked at various odd jobs to support himself while painting and in 1935 was president of the Baltimore Artists' Association. From 1936 to 1940, he lived in New York and worked in the easel division of the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. During this period, he knew Arshile Gorky, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jack Tworkov, returning to Baltimore in 1940. In 1948, he started to use Magna – oil-based acrylic paints. In 1952, Louis moved to Washington, D.C. Living in Washington, D.C., somewhat apart from the New York scene and working almost in isolation. He and a group of artists that included Kenneth Noland were central to the development of Color Field painting. The basic point about Louis's work and that of other Color Field painters, sometimes known as the Washington Color School in contrast to most of the other new approaches of the late 1950s and early 1960s, is that they greatly simplified the idea of <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>the</b> look of a finished painting.|$|E

500|$|In {{obscuring}} reality, truth becomes unclear. As {{literary critic}} Mireille Rosello notes, {{it is the}} President who decides what is true, denying any other opinion, even if other characters witness an event with their own eyes or ears. Unlike {{the characters in the}} novel, readers are aware that the characters are relying on a notion of truth or reality that no longer exists under the dictatorship of the President. [...] "Truth" [...] does not exist before the President puts it into words, and even at that, the only [...] "truth" [...] under dictatorial rule is the words the President is speaking at any given momentone cannot even safely repeat the President's versions of events.

500|$|Symbols {{of death}} proliferate {{throughout}} The Wind Will Carry Us with scenes {{set in a}} graveyard, the imminence of the old woman’s passing, and the ancestors that the character of Farzad mentions in an early scene.

[...] In the film’s opening sequence, Behzad tells Farzad that like people, cars have ghosts. This becomes the theme of the work and the subject of the film — they are waiting for the old woman to give up the ghost. The viewer is asked to consider <b>what</b> <b>constitutes</b> <b>the</b> soul, and what happens to the soul after death. In discussing the film, Kiarostami stated that his function is that of one who raises questions, rather than answers them. Kiarostami affirms that [...] the audience must decide for themselves.|$|E
