5|$|Experimental {{blending}} of Western and Malagasy musical elements was occurring simultaneously {{among a number}} of northwestern bands and musicians of Jaojoby's generation. Although no single individual can be credited with creating the modern salegy genre, Jaojoby ranks among the earliest originators of the nascent musical style. A desire for greater freedom to write songs and further develop the syncretic modern salegy style led Jaojoby to leave Los Matadores in 1975 for The Players, another regional band that was less well-established but more willing to take risks. The band was managed by a Chinese shopkeeper who provided them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> system and generator. The band toured northwestern Madagascar {{for the next four years}} with increasing success, recording two 45rpm singles and performing in Mahajanga, Diego-Suarez, and other towns and villages throughout the region before disbanding in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} music are {{traditionally}} associated with Marrakesh. Berber music is influenced by Andalusian classical music and typified by its oud accompaniment.

More recently, several Marrakesh female music groups have also risen to popularity.|$|E

5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound,</b> which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E

The same outcome repeated itself several times, with Nogueira taking several powerbombs and heavy punches every time his huge antagonist managed to power out of his submission attempts.

500|$|The {{music for}} Super Metroid was {{composed}} by Kenji Yamamoto and Minako Hamano, and uses 16-bit versions {{of music from}} previous games.

In addition to composing music, Yamamoto served as a sound programmer and created sound effects for the game. These simultaneous roles allowed him [...] "to produce distinct Metroid music <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> programmer’s ear, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> effect creator’s ear, and with the approach methodology and theory of a composer."
