Soldiers raid the farm, shoot Scotty and his mother, and burn the bodies. They learn that the soldiers have been ordered to shoot all civilians. The group repair an older patrol car in David's garage, and are ambushed by the infected family of Rory. After a struggle, Russell furiously shoots the infected multiple times. This greatly disturbs Judy, who argues with David about Russell's state of mind. On the road, they are spotted by an attack helicopter and drive into a car wash for cover.

50|$|In 1934, Erika Mathilda Blomqvist in Hällby outside Västerfärnebo {{was killed}} in a way that {{afterwards}} has been described as the perfect crime. This being because the police at first wrote off the incident as an accident. The gang drove a stolen car to the isolated cabin in which the woman lived, backed the car towards the house wall, whereafter the exhaust fumes from the car were led through a rubber <b>hose,</b> <b>inserted</b> in a hole in the cabin wall that the gang had drilled. When the victim was not moving, the felons broke into the house and looted it and set it on fire. The Police thought the woman was deceased in a self-caused arson, and the crime was not uncovered until the confession of the gang, following upon its arrest.|$|R
5000|$|As {{soon as the}} car {{comes to}} a halt, the first step, taken while the fourth tire changer assumes his position, is for a {{mechanic}} to activate the car's built-in pneumatic jacks. A pressurized air <b>hose</b> is <b>inserted</b> into a receiving nozzle {{at the rear of}} the car, under the rear wing. Previously, this device was inserted on the side of the car, but for safety reasons, the location was moved in the 2000s. At the same instant, another crew member begins the refueling process. A fueling <b>hose</b> is <b>inserted</b> into a socket (called the [...] "buckeye"), allowing a gravity-fed hose to refill the car's fuel tank.

50|$|The {{difference}} in expansion characteristics between rubber and braided stainless steel brake lines {{is a result}} of differences in hose construction. Where rubber hoses typically consist of a rubber inner <b>hose</b> <b>wrapped</b> in a textile reinforcement braid then covered in an additional rubber outer sheath, braided stainless steel hoses typically consist of a Teflon® or generic PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) inner <b>hose</b> <b>wrapped</b> in a braid consisting of stainless steel wire. The stainless wire braid more effectively resists expansion due to pressure inside the hose core. This improves brake system effectiveness by more directly transferring operator input (hydraulic pressure) to brake friction surfaces. While available without a coating, the stainless braid is typically coated or covered with a clear or colored material such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) to protect the wire and inner hose from the elements and chemicals, to protect the vehicle or machine from abrasion, and for an improved appearance. Coated braided stainless steel hoses have the same essential construction as rubber hoses in terms of an inner <b>hose</b> <b>wrapped</b> in a braid followed by an outer layer, but the different materials in the braided stainless steel hoses offer substantially different and arguably better characteristics. To more thoroughly explain why, it is helpful to understand the basics of a hydraulic brake system.|$|R
50|$|A heated hose {{consists}} of a flexible hose, through which the media is pumped. This hose determines the resistance against temperature and chemicals. A heating element is <b>wrapped</b> on the <b>hose</b> and then it is covered with insulation material. Possible insulation materials are Polyamid, steel wire, ore silicone. The heating element contains a heat sensor. Fittings and fixtures can vary with the application.|$|R
40|$|Coil pump is {{considered}} one of non-conventional water pumping devices which use non-conventional energy sources. It is a self supporting system for pumping water. The performance of coil pump under different operating parameters is the main objective concerned of present study. The parameters considered in the present study are submerged ratios, rotational speed and number of coils of the <b>wrapped</b> <b>hose.</b> The experimental results showed significant effects on the pump performance due to the variation in submerged ratio Sr and the pump rotational speed as well. The presence of air with water for submerged ratios 0 Sr 100 % gives the coil pump its pumping action. Increasing the submerged ratio increases the pump flow rate until it reaches its maximum depending on the pump rotational speed, then decreases to zero when the pump is fully immersed. Submerged ratio has a minor effect on the pump maximum static head, it is nearly constant but decreases drastically to zero when the pump submerged ratio reaches 100 %. Increasing the pump rotational speed increases water flow rate until it reaches its maximum depending on the working submerged ratio, then the discharge decreases by increasing the rotational speed. Meanwhile slight changes are obtained for the pump static head when the pump rotational speed changes. The number of pump coils is also one of most effective parameters on the coil pump performance. Increasing number of coils increases the pump head while pump discharge is nearly constant. Good agreement is obtained between the present experimental results and theoretical results developed by other investigators...|$|R
5000|$|To use {{a central}} vacuum, the vacuum hose {{is taken from}} storage and fitted with any needed {{cleaning}} accessories (such as a brush). The {{other end of the}} <b>hose</b> is <b>inserted</b> into a wall-mounted vacuum inlet, after opening the spring-loaded cover door. [...] In some designs, opening the door switches on the vacuum motor; in other designs, insertion of the metallic hose-end fitting bridges two electrical contacts, signaling the motor to turn on. Other alternative designs feature a remote on/off switch located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, which communicates either via a pair of wires embedded in the hose, or via wireless signaling.|$|R
50|$|Many {{other methods}} {{can be used}} to attach hoses or tubing, such as {{compression}} fittings (where a nylon or soft metal ferrule is compressed onto the hose by the tightening of the fitting), push-fit fittings (where the <b>hose</b> is <b>inserted</b> inside of a compression sleeve, designed such that force against the hose causes the sleeve to tighten), swage fittings (where a stiff collar is compressed onto the hose), clamp fittings (where two blocks are tightened onto the sides of the hose, often found on garden hoses), crimp banding (similar to worm gear banding but a crimp is used instead of a screw/thread), and a multitude of others. However, these devices are not typically referred to as hose clamps.|$|R
50|$|Another common add on is {{the sample}} box. This is a heavy duty rubber <b>hose</b> that is <b>inserted</b> {{at the end of}} the flow line and at the other end emplaced into the sample box itself.

50|$|The pneumofathometer hose has {{a smaller}} bore than the main {{breathing}} gas hose of the umbilical, {{but it is}} connected to the same gas supply at the gas panel, and {{can be used as a}} secondary route for surface supplied breathing gas for the diver if the main hose malfunctions. The open end of the pneumo <b>hose</b> can be <b>inserted</b> under the neck seal of the helmet or the face seal of a full-face mask, unless the helmet is sealed to the suit to prevent contamination by a hazardous environment. This is colloquially known as pneumo-breathing, and is a useful adjunct to the bailout set, as the gas supply is less limited. Pneumo-breathing may be used during the exit from a dive aborted after main gas hose failure as it allows the emergency gas supply to be conserved in case of a further failure.|$|R
50|$|Ayres confronted a vitally {{important}} design problem concerning {{the nature of}} the soil. Due to the formerly marshy condition of the soil and the existence of several submerged streams nearby, Ayres designed a structure that would stand on more than 18,000 pilings. However, water pressure from the submerged Tiber Creek would make it difficult to drive the piles. Ayres and his team devised a plan whereby a deep-sea diver descended into the underground Tiber Creek and drilled a hole 20 ft deep into the earth. A <b>hose</b> would be <b>inserted</b> into the hole, and water pumped from the earth until the water table dropped and the driving of the piles could be accomplished. The building's foundation was more than three feet thick in places in order to withstand the hydraulic pressure put on it by the submerged Tiber Creek. Water from the Tiber was utilized as an air conditioning system to cool the building.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Most {{epidemiological}} studies on tick-borne pathogens involve collection of ticks from the environment. An efficient collection method {{is essential for}} large sample pools. Our main aim was to evaluate the efficacy of a new method, where traditional flagging was enhanced {{by the use of}} CO 2 dispersed into the white flannel. The CO 2 was spread through a rubber <b>hose</b> network <b>inserted</b> into the flag blanket. The research was conducted in spring, in March-April 2011 in two locations from Cluj County, Romania. Methods The research was conducted in March-April 2011 in two locations from Cluj County, Romania. The flag to be tested contained a fine silicone rubber hose network which dispersed the CO 2 in the shaft. On each collection site n= 30 samplings were performed. Each sampling consisted in the simultaneous use of both flags (with and without CO 2) by two persons. The CO 2 concentration level on the flag canvas surface was measured. The efficacy of the method was determined by counting comparatively the total number of ticks and separate developmental stage count. Results Using the CO 2 improved flag, 2411 (59 %) Ixodes ricinus and 100 (53. 8 %) Dermacentor marginatus ticks were captured, while the CO 2 -free flag accounted for the collection of 1670 I. ricinus (41 %) and 86 (46. 2 %) D. marginatus ticks. The addition of CO 2 prompted a concentration difference {{on the surface of the}} flag ranging between 756. 5 and 1135. 0 [*]ppm with a mean value of 848. 9 [*]ppm. Conclusion The study showed that the CO 2 enhanced sweep flag increased the ability of I. ricinus (p[*] D. marginatus to be attracted to the flag blanket. </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{cornerstone}} of the first building to be constructed, the Internal Revenue building, was laid by Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon on May 25, 1929. While digging its foundation, workers uncovered a dock which was at least 100 years old. Indiana Limestone {{was used for the}} facing, and Tennessee marble for the columns. The sites of all the Triangle buildings had been established in their revised positions by May 1929, with two exceptions: The positions of the Justice and Archives buildings remained as originally planned (with Justice in the east), and the apex space remained unalloted. President (and former Commerce Secretary) Herbert Hoover laid the {{cornerstone of}} the Commerce building on June 10, 1929, using the same trowel President George Washington had used to lay the {{cornerstone of the}} U.S. Capitol. The construction contract for the Commerce building (set at $13.567 million) had been signed in March, and the contract for its limestone facade—according to at least one newspaper account, the largest stone contract in world history—was awarded in April. By then, the cost of the Commerce building had risen to $17.5 million. Due to the formerly marshy condition of the soil and several submerged streams nearby, more than 18,000 pilings had to be set to construct the Commerce building. Water pressure from the submerged Tiber Creek made it too difficult to drive the piles, so a deep-sea diver descended into the underground Tiber Creek and drilled a hole 20 feet (6.1 metres) deep into the earth. A <b>hose</b> was <b>inserted</b> into the hole, and water pumped from the earth until the water table dropped and the driving of the piles could be accomplished. The October 1929 stock market crash and subsequent Great Depression led newly elected President Herbert Hoover to increase spending on existing public works as a means of stimulating the economy. No funds had been authorized yet for the Archives, Independent Offices, Justice, or Labor buildings, and Hoover secured an additional $2.5 million a year for 10 years from Congress for this purpose. Work on the Justice and Independent Offices/Labor buildings now proceeded.|$|R
