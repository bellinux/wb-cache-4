25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, a {{representative}} for Kodak said Cosby had become [...] "synonymous with quality products and quality services". Ebony agreed, saying Cosby {{has the advantage}} of being able to be selective. Cosby said his belief in their product is an attribute, stating, [...] "if I presented a Bill Cosby who didn't care, their sales would stop right there on the screen. Obviously, I could never do that. Once I believe in the product I aim to sell it, and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do better than anybody".|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} seventh win {{of the season in}} front of 90,000 who attended the race. Johnson also earned $267,001 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I guess {{it could have been a}} statement we were sending. There was a lot of pressure. All week long, we wondered if we could step up like we did today. I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When I go home tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> need to do in qualifying trim so I can put my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. And I hope that the points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, no! You are mocking me! You {{know too}} well <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think!</b> <b>Is</b> not this my best hope of making him know me, and {{becoming}} his true and--and--" ...|$|R
5000|$|How should <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> I'll be, <b>I</b> who don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am? Be <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{of being}} so many things! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I don't--I mean I do--I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you, <b>I</b> mean. Let us go to papa,' responded Elfride, with {{somewhat}} of a flurried delivery.|$|R
2500|$|Backed up by {{a simple}} beat and minimal synth arrangement, Saporta sings about finding the girl he’s been missing: [...] "Girl, I’ve {{been all over the}} world looking for you / I’m known for taking <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> deserve, and you’re overdue." [...] Sabi, {{provides}} the chorus and the [...] "la-la-la-la-la" [...] melody that carries the song as Saporta sings [...] "You make me feel that…," [...] but never quite finishes the thought. According to Monica Herrera, a writer from Rolling Stone, the song has a riff that suggests Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass".|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, after this, do {{you know}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> think we had better kill the beasts first and take the {{pictures}} afterward!" ...|$|E
60|$|CLAIRE. I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> {{will never}} {{speak to him}} again. Your Majesty can keep him, as far as I am concerned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> {{anything}} now!" [...] Strether impatiently broke in: [...] "that is but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> DO <b>think!</b> <b>I</b> {{mean that}} originally, {{for her to}} have cared for him--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If I {{were his}} mother <b>I</b> know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> can {{put myself in}} her place--I'm not narrow-minded. I know {{perfectly}} well how she must regard such a question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's an {{adventure}} I didn't bargain for," [...] was Tom's comment. [...] "Do you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> think that cowboy sent {{us into this}} on purpose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They wouldn't {{believe it}} unless they saw it," [...] {{returned}} Whopper. [...] "Boys, {{do you know}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> {{think we ought to}} take those bears home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am positive. Boys, do {{you know}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> {{think he is a}} sharper, and imagines he has three green country boys with money to deal with." ...|$|E
60|$|It is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> But <b>I</b> am only a girl, {{the first}} that has {{examined}} this matter, and {{it may turn out}} that in my ignorance and inexperience I have not got it right.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> When <b>I</b> try to <b>think</b> {{on these things}} my mind gets confused. Only this am I sure of--that they are, they must be, the {{wonderful}} works of the Good Spirit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Roxy, [...] "I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> best to tell. <b>I</b> told Doctor Meritts, and he {{said there}} were more things in heaven and earth than folks knew about--and so I think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{more than}} you or I can tell. If {{you want to know}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>I</b> believe he paid her a great deal of {{attention}} and then behaved very badly to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Louise never {{speaks of}} these things to any living soul. I am only telling you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> am trying to save you pain--trying for my own sake as well as yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll see fast enough," [...] replied Hardwick. [...] "We {{have got}} you fast this time. Do you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> {{think you are}} the same fellow that I met in the lumber-yard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{you have}} found out, I am a frank old woman and not afraid to say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Now, <b>I</b> {{want to ask you}} a question. If you liked a man who was far from rich, would you marry him?" ...|$|R
50|$|Here I am, {{by reason}} drawn to this retreat,/At peace, at liberty,/Freedom, that wise divinity,/Whom all mortals desire, whose loss we all regret,/Is here {{the source of}} my felicity..../Study sustains me, and reason guides me with its light;/I speak <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> and <b>I</b> do as I will.|$|R

60|$|GEORGE. It makes a {{difference}} to me, and it makes some difference <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of myself. <b>I</b> seem to be learning a good many things this morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; I'll {{tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they stink of money, {{as the people}} say; but I'm not sure that they've got any all the same." ...|$|R
60|$|MISS HOWARD (comes over to {{his chair}} laughing). It's easy to see you've got Irish in you. Do you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> think you're a natural born kidder. All {{newspaper}} reporters are like that, I've heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it isn't that. It's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>I</b> {{leave it}} to you. If this land around here is worth three {{thousand}} an acre, {{why is it that}} government land, if it's any good, is waiting there, only a short way off, to be taken for the asking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then--that's all the same. She {{may be one}} {{of these}} young {{conceited}} democrats. Do you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> think she is very much like you in character. There is a smouldering fire of scorn in you. You are darkly self-sufficient, but I can see your very soul." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} sense of humour's {{got to do}} with it. I've got a good mind to take them down myself. If you want to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about them, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they're disgusting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You do talk, Athelny," [...] {{said his}} wife. [...] "I don't know what trouble they're {{likely to get}} into so long as they're steady.
