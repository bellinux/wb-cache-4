Seriously ill from AIDS at the time, Charleson died seven weeks after his last performance. Fellow actor and friend, Sir Ian McKellen, said that Charleson played Hamlet so well it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> rehearsed the role all his life, and the performance garnered other major accolades as well, some even calling it the definitive Hamlet performance.|$|E

Seriously ill from AIDS at the time, Charleson died eight weeks after his last performance. Fellow actor and friend, Sir Ian McKellen, said that Charleson played Hamlet so well it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> rehearsed the role all his life; McKellen called it [...] "the perfect Hamlet". The performance garnered other major accolades as well, some critics echoing McKellen in calling it the definitive Hamlet performance.|$|E
500|$|The Prince Regent was prostrated with grief, and {{was unable}} to attend his child's funeral. [...] Princess Caroline heard the news from a passing courier, and fainted in shock. [...] On recovering, she stated, [...] "England, that great country, has lost {{everything}} in losing my ever beloved daughter." [...] Even the Prince of Orange burst into tears at hearing the news, and his wife ordered the ladies of her court into mourning. [...] The greatest effect fell on Prince Leopold. [...] Stockmar wrote years later, [...] "November saw the ruin of this happy home, and the destruction at one blow of every hope and happiness of Prince Leopold. [...] He has never recovered the feeling of happiness which had blessed his short married life." [...] According to Holme, [...] "without Charlotte he was incomplete. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost his heart." ...|$|E
5000|$|These verses {{have been}} quoted to {{denounce}} killing, {{by using an}} abbreviated form such as, [...] "If anyone slays a person, it would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> slew the whole people: and if anyone saved a life, it would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> saved {{the life of the}} whole people". This verse {{is similar to that of}} one from the Talmud.|$|R

500|$|According to Huntford, {{the news}} of Scott's death meant that [...] "Amundsen the victor was eclipsed... by Scott the martyr". In the United Kingdom a myth quickly {{developed}} in which Scott was portrayed as one who had behaved nobly and played the game fairly. He had been defeated because, by contrast, Amundsen was a mere glory-seeker who had concealed his true intentions, had used dogs {{rather than relying on}} honest man-hauling and had slaughtered these same dogs for food. Furthermore, he was considered a [...] "professional" [...] which, in the mindset of upper-class Britain of that time, diminished anything he might have accomplished. This narrative was heavily reinforced with the publication of Scott's journals and his [...] "Message to the Public". [...] Huntford points out that [...] " [...] literary talent was his trump. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> reached out from his buried tent and taken revenge." [...] Even so, among explorers Amundsen's name continued to be respected. [...] In his account of the Terra Nova expedition written a few years later, Scott's comrade Apsley Cherry-Garrard wrote that the primary reason for Amundsen's success was [...] "the very remarkable qualities of the man", specifically his courage in choosing to discover a new route rather than follow the known path.|$|E
2500|$|According to Mordechai Eliyahu, {{former chief}} Rabbi of Israel, {{his meeting with}} Schneerson [...] "covered all {{sections}} of the Torah" [...] Eliyahu said [...] "The Rebbe jumped effortlessly from one Talmudic tractate to another, {{and from there to}} Kabbalah and then to Jewish law... It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> just finished studying these very topics from the holy books. The whole Torah was an open book in front of him".|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe {{supported}} George W. Bush as {{a political}} candidate and said he voted for him for president in 2004 {{because of what he}} called Bush's [...] "great decisiveness and willingness to fight." [...] (Bush apparently reciprocates the admiration, and is said to have read all of Wolfe's books, according to friends in 2005). [...] ) After his support of Bush was publicized in a New York Times interview, Wolfe said that the reaction in the literary world <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> said, [...] "I forgot to tell you—I'm a child molester." [...] Because of this incident, he sometimes wears an American flag pin on his suit, which he compared to [...] "holding up a cross to werewolves." ...|$|E
60|$|Leonard's quick, furtive {{glance at}} Ethel <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{suspected}} her {{of having been}} barely prevented from torturing him.|$|R
60|$|Isabel gave a long murmur, like a {{creature}} in pain; it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> pressing something that hurt her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Signora's nephew,' he explained, briefly, curtly, {{in a small}} voice. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> ashamed, or {{too deeply}} chagrined.|$|R
60|$|The old stern cast {{returned}} to Steele's face. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> suddenly remembered himself.|$|E

60|$|At the {{question}} Guidobaldo's brow grew dark. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> recalled some circumstance that had lain forgotten.|$|E
60|$|ARJILLAX. There goes a great spirit. What a {{sculptor}} he was! And now, nothing! It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had {{cut off his}} hands.|$|R
60|$|The Captain screwed {{his glass}} into his eye, and greeted Bernard {{in his usual}} fashion--that <b>is,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had parted with him overnight.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was always, you know, {{not quite}} here.... It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{a little more}} not quite here.... I can't believe it is over...." ...|$|R

60|$|Very frightful {{was it to}} see {{the change}} that came over him. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.|$|E
50|$|The Quran relates a {{slightly}} different version; as in the Bible, both offered sacrifice and Cain's was rejected; Cain threatens Abel, who points out that killing him would put Cain among the companions of the fire; Cain murders Abel, but regrets it. The Quran then draws a lesson: if any one slew a person... it would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> slew the whole mankind: and if any one saved a life, it would <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> saved {{the life of the}} whole mankind.|$|R
6000|$|... "By God! I am--American!" [...] he panted, and it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{called to}} the grave of his mother, over there on the dark, windy hill.|$|R
60|$|As he sat by {{the door}} and watched them file out, it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> a king abdicating a throne, and these his {{faithful}} subjects.|$|R
60|$|So all Joe's {{laborious}} {{hours were}} for naught! It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> come {{to borrow a}} dollar, and been offered a thousand before he could unfold his case....|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly he did {{a simple}} thing, but so uncharacteristic that it moved her. He shut his eyes. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> said: 'All right! I'm dead to the world!' ...|$|E
60|$|It was Steve. A subdued and furtive Steve. Kirk's heart leaped at {{the sight}} of him. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> found {{something}} solid to cling to in a shifting world.|$|E
60|$|Weston {{laughed in}} a rather curious fashion, and when <b>he</b> spoke it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> felt that an {{explanation}} of his attitude were due from him.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{national}} Muslim {{organizations and}} individual imams, such as Council on American–Islamic Relations, Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), and Islamic Circle of North America issued statements condemning {{the attack and}} offering sympathy for the victims. In a joint statement, CAIR and Muslim leaders in Baltimore quoted the Quran, saying, [...] "The Qur'an, the Muslim holy book, says: 'He who takes one life, it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has slain all of mankind.

60|$|She {{lifted her}} face to him, all shining and open. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> might enter {{straight}} into the source of her radiance. His face became a little distracted.|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lighted {{that match}} an hour ago, so slowly had the seconds passed, {{and with the}} thought of them as dead--burned to death through his act--came wildest terror.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{suddenly}} {{seen one}} of the boys from home, and Toby, uttering an exclamation of delight, ran up to the cage and put his hand through the wires.|$|E
60|$|This {{remarkable}} {{young woman}} had become soft and wonderful as April hills across which clouds are sweeping. Her face <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{never seen it}} before; her eyes bright with tears.|$|E
2500|$|... "As Hillel the Elder had stated, whosoever destroys a soul, it <b>is</b> {{considered}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> destroyed {{an entire}} world. And whosoever that saves a life, it <b>is</b> considered <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> saved an entire world." ...|$|R
