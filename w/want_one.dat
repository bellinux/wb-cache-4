25|$|An artist {{may prefer}} a medium that stays fluid for some time, may <b>want</b> <b>one</b> that dries hard, or may want a medium that remains {{somewhat}} sticky. If the medium dries hard the artist can build up layers of color, which will fuse {{together in a}} single firing. This can create unusual intensity or depth of color. If the medium remains sticky the artist can add to the design by dusting more color onto the surface, or can dust on an overglaze powder to create a high gloss surface.|$|E

500|$|Written by David A. Goodman, and {{directed}} by Dominic Polcino, series creator Seth MacFarlane {{came up with the}} idea for the episode while writing a pilot episode featuring two gay men. MacFarlane describes himself as [...] "incredibly passionate about [...] support for the gay community", and finds it to be [...] "infuriating and idiotic" [...] that two gay partners [...] "have to go through this fucking dog and pony act when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You <b>want</b> <b>one</b> room or two?'" ...|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{storyboard}} {{was written}} by Sherm Cohen and Antoine Guilbaud, though the story itself {{was made by the}} co-creators of the series. The song in the episode, [...] "Gitchee Gitchee Goo," [...] was the first song the series had and caused for Disney to <b>want</b> <b>one</b> in every episode. Despite the actual pilot being [...] "Rollercoaster," [...] the episode was broadcast to premiere the series, so a majority of the series' standard humor and plot devices had yet to be established (e.g. Perry and Doofenshmirtz have no involvement in the removal of the boys' evidence [...] and Candace's busting attempts in the A-plot are limited to two).|$|E
500|$|The Tagora was not {{greeted with}} much acclaim by the British {{motoring}} press.

Setright of Car magazine asked who could <b>want</b> <b>one</b> given the crowded market into which it came. Concluding a group test in Car, the Tagora {{was described as a}} [...] "problematic newcomer" [...] that did not exceed the standard set by the winner of the group test, the Volvo 244 GLE. However, Motor Sport [...] considered the Tagora a [...] "usefully effortless, uncomplicated, simple-to-drive and very comfortable car".|$|E
500|$|For his [...] "incredible take on what {{popular music}} means in today's world", Wainwright {{recruited}} Neil Tennant to advise him, act as {{executive producer of}} the album, and assist with the editing process. Parts of the album were recorded at Second Story and Legacy in New York City, Brooklyn Recording in Brooklyn, Saal 4 in Berlin, and Strongroom and Angel Studios in London. Wainwright had his sister Martha Wainwright, half-sister Lucy Wainwright Roche, and mother Kate McGarrigle appear on the album, along with father and son musicians Richard Thompson and Teddy Thompson. Marius de Vries, who produced both of Wainwright's previous albums (<b>Want</b> <b>One</b> and Want Two), worked on the album, as did longtime band members Jeff Hill, Jack Petruzelli, and Matt Johnson.|$|E

MacFarlane continued, [...] "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the shit out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?" ...|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle {{reported}} that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided {{it did not}} [...] "infringe on {{the integrity of the}} roster or of the season", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player. A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't <b>want</b> <b>one</b> day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me.

When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know." [...] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.|$|E
