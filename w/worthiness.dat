25|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), {{the largest}} {{denomination}} of the Latter Day Saint movement, priesthood is recognized only {{in men and}} boys, who are ordained to offices in the priesthood {{as a matter of}} course once they reach the age of 12, so long as they meet requirements of <b>worthiness.</b> There are no other requirements for ordination, although prior to 1978, the church did not ordain men or boys who were deemed to be of black African descent, based on the mid-19th century teachings of Brigham Young, which the church felt it could not abandon without a revelation from God. (See Black people and priesthood (LDS)). The doctrine was eliminated in 1978 and the church now allows all men to hold the priesthood, subject to <b>worthiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sagan's {{ability to}} convey his ideas allowed {{many people to}} {{understand}} the cosmos better—simultaneously emphasizing the value and <b>worthiness</b> of the human race, and the relative insignificance of the Earth {{in comparison to the}} Universe.

25|$|Therefore, to {{evaluate}} the real <b>worthiness</b> of an amount of money today after a given period of time, economic agents compound {{the amount of money}} at a given interest rate. Most actuarial calculations use the risk-free interest rate which corresponds the minimum guaranteed rate provided the bank's saving account, for example. If one wants to compare their change in purchasing power, then they should use the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation rate).|$|E

25|$|Gavaskar's {{arrival in}} England in 1971 for a three-Test series {{generated}} substantial publicity {{in light of}} his debut series. He was unable to maintain his performance, making only two half centuries. He was involved in controversy when taking a quick single from the bowling of John Snow. They collided and Gavaskar fell over. Snow was charged with deliberately barging into Gavaskar and was suspended. Gavaskar's 144 runs at the low average of 24, led some to question Gavaskar's <b>worthiness</b> in international cricket.|$|E
25|$|In tests {{against the}} Wer’wolf MKII, the Indian Army {{said that the}} MPV failed {{in most of the}} tests conducted, such as driving on steep terrain with {{occasional}} breakdowns, leaks and broken parts. During simulated IED bomb tests, the MPV failed since it destroyed the windows and the floor plates with the rear axles and hull having major damage. At one point, the MPV crew refused to participate in driving the vehicle in the snow as part of the snow test, not trusting its <b>worthiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2002, HOAC {{began the}} {{publication}} of a semi-annual academic journal, American Communist History. This marked a move for HOAC from its previous function of facilitating and chronicling academic publications in other venues to actually engaging in academic publication itself. American Communist History is a scholarly journal with the <b>worthiness</b> of submitted articles anonymously juried by recognized experts in the field prior to their acceptance for publication. Editor of the publication from its first issue through 2016 was Daniel J. Leab of Seton Hall University.|$|E
25|$|Expenditure for {{the works}} was {{approved}} by the Minister for Civil Aviation in October 1949. The whole of the QANTAS Empire Airways DC3 fleet servicing and maintenance, and certificates of air <b>worthiness,</b> were being carried out in Brisbane. Because of the congestion at Archerfield, QANTAS was obliged to occupy Hangar 10 with a lack of facilities or security. In November 1949, QANTAS were occupying the western end of hangar 7 adjoining hangar 10. The majority of the work to the two hangars was completed c. 1952.|$|E
25|$|Untener {{frequently}} {{observed that}} Jesus kept quite diverse company in his lifetime, including {{many people who}} were unwelcome in the synagogues of the time. Untener felt that modern Catholics should adopt this view in welcoming people into their own parishes. He was noted for his advocation of helping the poor, and his emphasis that needy people should be treated equally and not judged for their <b>worthiness</b> of help. He spoke out for women's rights in society and in the church, although never outright endorsing {{the ordination of women}} as priests.|$|E
25|$|CAA, the {{regulatory}} authority for maintaining aviation safety standards in Pakistan, faced harsh criticism in Pakistani media for allegedly compromising on safety standards. The corruption within CAA, due to politically motivated appointments, was {{alleged to be}} the prime reason for increase in frequency of technical faults, crash landings and catastrophic air accidents. The CAA, however, maintained {{that it did not}} issue any airline license or airworthiness certificate under political pressure, however it did announce that the Bhoja Air engineers were not qualified to issue the air <b>worthiness</b> certificate.|$|E
25|$|Adding to King Henry's {{troubles}} is the behaviour {{of his son}} and heir, the Prince of Wales. Hal (the future Henry V) has forsaken the Royal Court {{to waste}} his time in taverns with low companions. This makes him an object of scorn to the nobles and calls into question his royal <b>worthiness.</b> Hal's chief friend and foil in living the low life is Sir John Falstaff. Fat, old, drunk, and corrupt as he is, he has a charisma and a zest for life that captivates the Prince.|$|E
25|$|We {{believe it}} is the privilege, not only of some, but of all who are born again by the Spirit through faith in Christ as {{revealed}} in the Scriptures, to be assured of their salvation from the very day they take Him to be their Savior and that this assurance is not founded upon any fancied discovery of their own <b>worthiness</b> or fitness, but wholly upon the testimony of God in His written Word, exciting within His children filial love, gratitude, and obedience (Luke 10:20; 22:32; 2 Cor. 5:1, 6–8; 2 Tim. 1:12; Heb. 10:22; 1 John 5:13).|$|E
25|$|When {{the final}} {{assembly}} of the aircraft was completed, several days of bad weather conditions prevented the flight trials to be undertaken. On 27 May, however, the weather was fair and Caproni decided to make an attempt to fly the Ca.1. Tabacchi managed to have the aircraft take off at the first attempt; it then flew straight and level for a while, but, when the pilot tried to land the aircraft, his lack of experience caused a violent impact with the ground which heavily damaged the aircraft, even though Tabacchi was unscathed. The flight was considered a success, and it proved the <b>worthiness</b> of Caproni's first design.|$|E
25|$|While {{still in}} France, Caproni began {{designing}} his first engined aircraft. In June 1909, after {{going back to}} Italy, he made an attempt to collect the money he needed to build the machine in Alessandria; however, he didn't manage to convince the local investors of the <b>worthiness</b> of his projects. It was only in December, after spending {{a period of time}} in Belgium in order to complete his specialization in electrical engineering, that Caproni went back to his hometown, Arco, and was finally able to gather some collaborators, thanks to whom he would begin the construction of the experimental biplane that was going to become known as the Caproni Ca.1.|$|E
25|$|Caltrain {{plans to}} use lighter {{electric}} multiple units that do not comply with the US Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) crashworthiness standards, but instead comply with the International Union of Railways (UIC) standards, on the electrified lines. FRA granted Caltrain a waiver to operate these units, which were previously banned on mix-used lines with other FRA-compliant rolling stock due to concerns over crash <b>worthiness,</b> after Caltrain submitted simulation data showing UIC-compliant rolling stock performed no worse or even better than FRA-compliant rolling stock in crashes. Caltrain plans to retain their newer diesel-electric rolling stock for use on the Dumbarton Extension and service south of Tamien.|$|E
25|$|These {{interviews}} cover {{what the}} church believes {{to be the most}} important factors of personal morality and <b>worthiness,</b> including whether the person has a basic belief in key church doctrines such as the divinity of Jesus and the restoration; whether the person attends church meetings and supports the leadership of the LDS Church; whether the person affiliates with Mormon fundamentalists or other people considered by the church to be apostate; whether the person is honest and lives the law of chastity and the Word of Wisdom; whether the person abuses family members; whether the person pays tithing and any applicable spousal or child support; and whether the person has confessed to serious past sins.|$|E
25|$|Family honor (or honor) is an {{abstract}} concept involving the perceived quality of <b>worthiness</b> and respectability {{that affects the}} social standing and the self-evaluation {{of a group of}} related people, both corporately and individually. The family is viewed as the main source of honor and the community highly values the relationship between honor and the family. The conduct of family members reflects upon family honor and the way the family perceives itself, and is perceived by others. Family honor can be dependent upon many factors and areas that are affected by family honor include multiple aspects of lifestyle such as social status, religion, clothing, eating, education, job or career, ownership such as real estate, and marriage.|$|E
25|$|Using M-11 as a beacon, {{the heroes}} find the Yellow Claw, who reveals his true {{identity}} - Plan Chu, an almost immortal Mongol khan who claims he orchestrated {{each of his}} battles with Woo only to establish Woo's <b>worthiness</b> to marry Suwan and succeed him as khan. Chu created Atlas to put Woo again in the spotlight. Woo accepts his destiny, takes over Atlas hoping {{to turn it into}} a force for good, and the Yellow Claw, having found his heir, appears to commit suicide. They resurfaced in New York City, where the team, together with Spider-Man, defeated Temple of Atlas splinter cells still loyal to the Yellow Claw. They later worked as a resistance cell against the invasion of Earth by the shapeshifting alien race the Skrulls.|$|E
25|$|When Victorian attitudes {{took hold}} in England, studies {{with a live}} model became more {{restrictive}} {{than they had been}} in the prior century, limited to advanced classes of students that had already proved their <b>worthiness</b> by copying old master paintings and drawing from plaster casts. This is in part because many schools were publicly funded, so decisions were under the scrutiny of non-artists. Modeling was not respectable, and even less so for women. During the same period, the French art atelier system allowed any art student to work from life in a less formal atmosphere, and also admitted women as students. Live figure studies only returned to its classical status in art education throughout the England, Europe and the United States with the approach of the 20th Century.|$|E
25|$|Calvin took a {{mediating}} position between Luther and Zwingli {{regarding the}} sacrament of the Lord's Supper (also known as Communion). He held that Christ's body and blood are spiritually (rather than physically, as Luther insisted) conveyed to those who partake in faith. The people sat or knelt at a table to take communion. Calvin wished to have the Lord's Supper celebrated each Sunday, but was not allowed by the city council. Instead, it was celebrated every quarter, with an intense period of self-examination by the people beforehand. The determination of <b>worthiness</b> to receive the Lord's Supper was to be based upon trust in God alone for forgiveness of sin, repentance, and reconciliation with others, and the consistory was to keep watch to prevent flagrant, unrepentant offenders from partaking. Exclusion from the Lord's Supper was normally intended to be temporary, until the offender repented.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 Pew Center {{survey on}} Religion and Public Life {{indicates}} that 74 percent of U.S. Latter-day Saints church members lean towards the Republican Party. Some liberal members {{have stated that}} {{they feel that they}} have to defend their <b>worthiness</b> due to political differences. In recent decades, the Republican Party has consistently won a majority of the LDS vote in most national and state-level elections. As a result, Utah, a state with a majority LDS population, {{is also one of the}} most heavily Republican states in the country. However, Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic Senate Majority Leader from 2007 to 2014, became an LDS Church convert as a college student. James E. Faust (1920–2007), an apostle and member of the First Presidency, also identified himself as a Democrat prior to his full-time church service as a general authority (1972–2007).|$|E
25|$|The Revolution was a heel {{stable of}} younger wrestlers who felt slighted (both kayfabe and legitimate) by WCW management, believing they never {{gave them the}} chance to be stars, pushing older, more {{established}} wrestlers instead, despite their then-current questionable <b>worthiness</b> of their pushes. This led to the Revolution seceding from WCW, and forming their own nation, complete with a flag. This led to some friction being created between Benoit and leader, Douglas, who called into question Benoit's heart in the group, causing Benoit to quit the group, thus turning face, and having his own crusade against the top stars, winning the Television title one more time and the United States title from Jeff Jarrett in a ladder match. In October 1999 on Nitro in Kansas City, Missouri, Benoit wrestled Bret Hart as a tribute to Owen Hart, who had recently died due to an equipment malfunction. Hart defeated Benoit by submission, and the two received a standing ovation, and an embrace from guest ring announcer, Harley Race.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the BCS National Championship {{argued against}} the {{internal}} validity of a so-called national championship being {{awarded to the}} winner of a single postseason game. Critics lamented that the participants were selected based upon polls, computer rankings, popularity and human biases, and not by on-field competition, as in other major sports and all other levels of college football, which employed tournament-format championships. Often, the BCS system led to controversies in which multiple teams finished the season with identical records, and voters distinguished the <b>worthiness</b> of {{their participation in the}} BCS National Championship with no set of formal criteria or standards. The end of the 2010 season {{was one of the best}} examples of this. Without any objective criteria for evaluation of the teams, the BCS forced voters to impose their own standards and tiebreakers. Critics noted that the system inherently fostered selection bias, and therefore lacked both internal validity and external validity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{after the}} {{adoption}} of Islam, bidadari is equated with houri, the heavenly maiden mentioned in the Quran, in which God stated that the 'forbidden pearls' of heaven are for those men who have resisted temptation and borne life's trials. Islam spread in the Malay archipelago when Arabic traders came to trade spices with the Malays; at that time, Hinduism {{formed the basis of}} the Malay culture, but syncretism with the Islamic religion and culture spawned the idea of a Bidadari. It is usually seen as a prized offer to those who lived a lifestyle in service to and pleasing to God; after death, the Bidadari was the man's wife or wives, depending on what type of person he was. The <b>worthiness</b> {{of a man who was}} offered Bidadari depended upon his holiness: how often he prayed, how much he turned away from the 'outside world', and how little he heeded worldly desires.|$|E
