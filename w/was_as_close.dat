5|$|Cole {{once again}} found {{himself with a}} chance in the Bayern box, but keeper Oliver Kahn hurried out of his goal to punch the ball to safety. At the other end, Basler came close with another free kick before Alexander Zickler sent a shot just wide {{from the edge of}} the box. As half time approached, United winger Ryan Giggs, playing out of {{position}} on the right, sent a weak header towards Kahn from a Cole cross, but that <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as they were to come to a goal in the first half.|$|E
5|$|The Helles landing {{was made}} by the 29th Division (Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston). The {{division}} landed on five beaches in an arc about the tip of the peninsula, named 'S', 'V', 'W', 'X' and 'Y' Beaches from east to west. On 1 May, the 29th Indian Brigade (including the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles) landed, took and secured Sari Bair above the landing beaches and was joined by the 1st/5th and the 2nd/10th Gurkha battalions; the Zion Mule Corps landed at Helles on 27 April. At 'Y' Beach, during the first engagement, the First Battle of Krithia, the Allies landed unopposed and advanced inland. There were {{only a small number of}} defenders in the village but lacking orders to exploit the position, the 'Y' Beach commander withdrew his force to the beach. It <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as the Allies ever came to capturing the village as the Ottomans brought up a battalion of the 25th Regiment, checking any further movement.|$|E
5|$|The semi-final pitted United against Barcelona; {{the teams}} had not met since the group {{stage of the}} 1998–99 tournament, the last time United won it. The teams also had {{identical}} records going into the semi-final, each having won eight and drawn two of their 10 games, scoring 18 goals and conceding just five. The first leg at the Camp Nou saw United {{spend most of the}} game defending, while Barcelona tried to pass the ball around them. United were awarded a penalty in the first minute, but Ronaldo sent the ball wide, hitting the stanchion behind the goal. That <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as either team got to a goal in the first leg and it ended 0–0. The second leg at Old Trafford was a game of higher tempo, which United won 1–0 thanks to a goal from Paul Scholes after 14 minutes. This result increased United's consecutive home win record in the Champions League to 12 and ensured that they reached the final unbeaten.|$|E

5|$|Under Boyd's {{captaincy}} Birmingham {{reached the}} semifinals of the 1950–51 FA Cup, {{when they were}} defeated by the powerful Blackpool side of Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen only after a replay. They twice came close to winning promotion, missing out by three points in the 1950–51 season and then on goal average the following year. Boyd's performances were rewarded with selection for England B against Netherlands B, a match played {{in front of a}} crowd of 60,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, but this, and a selection as reserve for a Football League representative team in 1954, <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as he came to full international honours.|$|E
5|$|By 08:00, it {{was clear}} that despite his vessels speed, Stewart's plan was going to fail: the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even {{attempted}} to join his advance, deliberately checking their advance towards the French, falling far behind Windham. Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds, he had no option but to continue the attack: his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate. Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09:30, his shot repeatedly striking Windham as she approached. Stewart did not return fire, instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the inaccuracy of his gunnery. Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly, Stewart absorbed the French fire until he <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as he was able before unleashing his guns. The results were disappointing: the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship. The more manoeuvrable Manche now approached Windham at close range, and the two ships fired at one another for over an hour, Stewart still unsupported by his companions, who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range.|$|E
25|$|At this point, LA {{finally managed}} to respond with Vince Ferragamo's 32-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Preston Dennard, cutting the score to 24-7.

On the ensuing drive, Johnson rushed six times for 44 yards to set up Kasay's 40-yard field goal.

25|$|During the night, the French {{military}} gave authorisation to send {{its forces}} to Majorca, Spain; this <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to Algeria as possible without {{being accused of}} interfering in the situation. At 8pm, the Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale (GIGN) operatives boarded an Airbus A300 aircraft similar to F-GBEC, the aircraft on Flight 8969, at a military base in France. On the way to Majorca, the operatives familiarised themselves with the A300 and prepared for storming the aircraft. After the aircraft arrived at Palma de Mallorca Airport, the Algerian government insisted that French forces were not welcome in Algeria.|$|E
25|$|In the {{championship}} game, Tennessee {{was too much}} for Rutgers. The Lady Vols had an eleven-point lead at halftime, which Rutgers cut to seven, but that <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as they would get. Candace Parker scored 17 points, but Pat Summitt noted the contribution of their 5-foot 2-inch point guard Shannon Bobbitt, who hit two key three-pointers en route to scoring 13 points of her own. Tennessee won 59–46, bringing the seventh national championship to the school, and increasing the win total of Summitt to 947, which is 33 more than Bob Knight, the most victorious coach on the men's side.|$|E

25|$|The Colts {{took the}} opening kickoff and stormed down the field. James gained 39 {{yards on the}} first five plays of the drive, and then Manning {{finished}} it with a 31-yard touchdown pass to Stokley. Denver responded on their ensuing drive, advancing the ball 49 yards in 12 plays and taking 8:13 off the clock. Jason Elam capped off the drive with a 49-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3, but it <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as Denver would ever get {{for the rest of}} the game. After the kickoff, Harrison caught three passes for 70 yards, including a pass in which he made a diving catch around three Denver players. All of them thought Harrison was down by contact and started to leave the field, but no one had actually touched him, and Harrison got back up and ran 46 yards for a touchdown.|$|E

[...] She described Castlereagh as her [...] "dearest and best friend" [...] {{until his death}} in 1822, when she transferred her affections to the other great 19th-century Anglo-Irish peer, the Duke of Wellington. All social commentators of the time, however, agree that her marriage was happy; indeed, her husband <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> a friend of Wellington's as was his wife. Married to a politician, she was fascinated by politics and enjoyed success as a political hostess while exerting her energies to promote Tory causes. [...] However, while she was the dominant partner, her conservative outlook ensured her continued favour among her elderly Tory admirers. [...] During the early part of her marriage, her husband served as an Under-Secretary at the Treasury. Later, in 1823, he was given the Department of Woods and Forests, a position which gave him charge of the Royal parks and gardens. The subsequent access to the Royal family this allowed increased not only his status but also that of his wife.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{the musicians}} of OverClocked ReMix {{were chosen to}} handle the Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix soundtrack after Capcom U.S.A. {{associate}} producer Rey Jimenez heard the site's 2006 Super Street Fighter II Turbo tribute album Blood on the Asphalt. Entitled OC ReMix: Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix Official Soundtrack, the complete 66-track album was freely released at OverClocked ReMix. The album includes new arrangements, edited versions of Blood on the Asphalt tracks, and other prior remixes from the site. The remixers arranged the music based on knowledge of the Street Fighter II series alone, as the music for the game was completed before the visuals and gameplay. OC ReMix founder David [...] "djpretzel" [...] Lloyd directed the soundtrack and served as the organization's contact with Capcom [...] "to ensure that working with a large fan community <b>was</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as possible for Capcom to working with a single composer". Jimenez praised HD Remixs music as [...] "above and beyond our expectations" [...] and OC ReMix's efforts as [...] "one of the most rewarding aspects of working on SF HD Remix". Capcom's then-Vice-President of Strategic Planning & Business Development, Christian Svensson, described the soundtrack as [...] "impactful" [...] and claimed {{in an interview that}} in demos of the game the remixed music was praised before any other aspect. In its review of HD Remix, IGN commended OC ReMix's work as [...] "a great tribute to the original soundtrack". Other entities with favorable reviews of the soundtrack include Eurogamer, GameSpot, Official Xbox Magazine, and GamesRadar, as well as long-time game composer [...] "The Fat Man" [...] George Sanger, who referred to the Capcom-OC ReMix collaboration as [...] "Game Audio 2.0".|$|E
