5|$|The <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> was an aqueous {{homogeneous}} reactor, a type {{of nuclear}} reactor in which the nuclear fuel {{in the form of}} soluble uranium sulfate is dissolved in water. Uranium sulfate was chosen instead of uranium nitrate because sulfur's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen. The project was proposed by Bacher in April 1943 as part of an ongoing program of measuring critical masses in chain-reacting systems. He saw it also as a means of testing various materials in critical mass systems. T Division were opposed to the project, which was seen as a distraction from studies related to the form of chain reactions found in an atomic bomb, but Bacher prevailed on this point. Calculations related to the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> did take up an inordinate amount of T Division's time in 1943. The reactor theory developed by Fermi did not apply to the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler.</b>|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{building}} reactors in 1943. A group was created in Bacher's P Division, the P-7 (<b>Water</b> <b>Boiler)</b> Group, {{under the leadership of}} Donald Kerst, that included Charles P. Baker, Gerhart Friedlander, Lindsay Helmholtz, Marshall Holloway and Raemer Schreiber. Robert F. Christy from the T-1 Group provided support with the theoretical calculations, in particular, a calculation of the critical mass. He calculated that 600 grams of uranium-235 would form a critical mass in a tamper of infinite size. Initially it was planned to operate the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> at 10kW, but Fermi and Samuel K. Allison visited in September 1943, and went over the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive fission products would be created {{that would have to be}} chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> would only run at 1kW until more operating experience had been accumulated, and features needed for high power operation were shelved for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Chemists at the Los Alamos Laboratory {{developed}} {{methods of}} purifying uranium and plutonium, the latter a metal that only existed in microscopic quantities when Project Y began. Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler,</b> an aqueous homogeneous reactor, the third reactor {{in the world}} to become operational. It also researched the Super, a hydrogen bomb that would use a fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.|$|E

It was the first reactor to employ enriched uranium as a fuel, and required most of the world's meager supply at the time. A sufficient quantity of enriched uranium arrived at Los Alamos by April 1944, and the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> commenced operation in May. By the end of June it had achieved all of its design goals.|$|E
5|$|The Harrisburg Mitchell-Carnegie Library, {{located on}} Church Street {{south of the}} square and built with a grant from Andrew Carnegie, was built in 1908 and {{opened to the public}} in 1909. The {{building}} served the community until 2000 when the library was moved to a new building on north Main Street. During the 1937 flood, the library was used as a makeshift hospital until the <b>water</b> <b>boiler</b> burst. The building now serves as a church.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{facilities}} for medical research were limited, but some {{research was conducted}} into the effects of radiation, and the absorption and toxic effects of metals, particularly plutonium and beryllium, mainly {{as a result of}} accidents. The Health Group began conducting urine tests of laboratory workers in early 1945, and many of these revealed dangerous levels of plutonium. Work on the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> also occasionally exposed workers to dangerous fission products. There were 24 fatal accidents at Los Alamos between its opening in 1943 and September 1946. Most involved construction workers. Four scientists died, including Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin in criticality accidents involving the demon core.|$|E

The <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> group was headed by Donald W.

500|$|From 1942 to 1943, Schreiber was a {{researcher}} with the Purdue Research Foundation. He participated in early {{work for the}} Manhattan Project there using the university's cyclotron.

At Los Alamos, he worked on the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler,</b> an aqueous homogeneous reactor. The <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> group was headed by Donald W.

On {{completion}} of the planned series of experiments in June 1944, {{it was decided to}} rebuild it as a more powerful reactor. The original goal of 10kW power was discarded in favor of 5kW, which would keep the cooling requirements simple. It was estimated that it would have a neutron flux of 5 x 1010 neutrons per square centimeter per second. Water cooling was installed, along with additional control rods. This time uranium nitrate was used instead of uranium sulfate because the former could more easily be decontaminated.

500|$|In early 1943, Christy joined Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, {{where he}} became an American citizen in 1943 or 1944. Hans Bethe, the head of T (Theoretical) Division, {{detailed}} his physicists {{to assist with the}} projects at the laboratory. With his knowledge of reactors, Christy's assignment was to help Donald W. Kerst's <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> [...] group. The <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> was an aqueous homogeneous reactor intended as a laboratory instrument to test critical mass calculations and the effect of various tamper materials.

500|$|Christy also {{calculated}} {{the area that}} would become contaminated if an accidental explosion occurred. A site in Los Alamos Canyon was selected that was a safe distance from the township and downstream from the water supply. Known as Omega, it {{was approved by the}} Governing Board on 19 August 1943. The <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> was not simple to construct. The two halves of the [...] stainless steel sphere that was the boiler had to be arc welded because solder would be corroded by the uranium salt. The CM-7 (Miscellaneous Metallurgy) Group produced beryllia bricks for the Water Boiler's tamper in December 1943 and January 1944. They were hot pressed in graphite at [...] at [...] for 5 to 20 minutes. Some 53 bricks were made, shaped to fit around the boiler. The building at Omega Site was ready, if incomplete, by 1 February 1944, and the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> was fully assembled by 1 April. Sufficient enriched uranium had arrived by May to start it up, and it went critical on 9 May 1944. It was only the third reactor in the world to do so, the first two being the Chicago Pile-1 reactor at the Metallurgical Laboratory and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works. Improved cross-section measurements allowed Christy to refine his criticality estimate to 575 grams. In fact, only 565 grams were required. The accuracy of his prediction surprised Christy more than anyone.|$|E
500|$|After {{repeated}} slippages, {{the first}} shipment of slightly enriched uranium (13 to 15 percent uranium-235) arrived from Oak Ridge in March 1944. Shipments of {{highly enriched uranium}} commenced in June 1944. Criticality experiments and the <b>Water</b> <b>Boiler</b> had priority, so the metallurgists did not receive any until August 1944. [...] In the meantime, the CM Division experimented with uranium hydride. This was considered by T Division as a prospective active material. The idea was that the hydrogen's ability as a neutron moderator would compensate {{for the loss of}} efficiency, but, as Bethe later recalled, its efficiency was [...] "negligible or less, as Feynman would say", and the idea was dropped by August 1944.|$|E
