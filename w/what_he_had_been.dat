5|$|After the war ended, Christy {{accepted}} an assistant professorship at the University of Chicago, at {{a salary of}} $5,000 per annum, twice <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> making before the war. He moved back to Chicago in February 1946, but suitable housing {{was hard to find}} in the immediate post-war period, and Christy and his family shared a mansion with Edward Teller and his family.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{left his}} brother-in-law's home {{a year later}} and went {{to live and work}} on a sheep farm. The family he lived with were devout Seventh Day Adventists. During this time, he became {{convinced}} that their view of the Bible and its teachings were quite different than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> raised to understand, but he accepted their religion entirely.|$|E
5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen {{as something of a}} creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been publicising for a year, he was full of doubt and destroyed most of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> working on, including several other popes.|$|E

5|$|Local weavers {{specialised}} in {{the production}} of kersey, a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen fabric that was often used for military uniforms; by the 16thcentury Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England. In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth was hung outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a fulling mill. Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed account of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> told of the gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727.|$|E
5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 2012, Wilkie {{announced}} that he was withdrawing his support for the Gillard Government after it broke the agreement he had signed with Gillard to implement mandatory pre-commitment for all poker machines by 2014. He stated that he would support the government's alternative plan to trial pre-commitment in the ACT and require that pre-commitment technology be installed in all poker machines built from 2013, but that this fell short of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> promised in return for supporting the government. In response, Gillard and Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs Jenny Macklin argued that there was not enough support in the House of Representatives for Wilkie's preferred option for it to be passed, and that they had been advised it was technically unfeasible to implement mandatory commitment within the time frame he had specified.|$|E

5|$|Performing live again brought Como a {{new sense}} of enjoyment. In May 1974, he {{embarked}} on his first concert appearance outside of the United States, a show at the London Palladium for the Variety Club of Great Britain to aid children's charities. It was here where he discovered <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> missing when the audience cheered for ten minutes after he walked onstage. At the show's end, Como sat in a chair, delightedly chatting back and forth with his equally delighted fans. Perry returned to the United Kingdom in November for a Royal Variety Performance to benefit the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund with the Queen Mother in attendance. Como was invited to visit Buckingham Palace the day after the show. At first, the invitation did not extend to his associates traveling and working with him, and Como politely declined. When word reached the Palace regarding the reason for Perry's turning down the invitation, it was then extended to include all in the Como party and Como accepted this invitation. Soon after, he announced his first concert tour that began in the UK in the spring of 1975.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E
25|$|After Henry Cow's first album, Frith {{released}} Guitar Solos in 1974, {{his first}} solo album and a glimpse at <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> doing with his guitar.

It {{was recorded in}} four days, at the Kaleidophon Studios in London's Camden Town, without any overdubbing.|$|E

25|$|Once Samuel responded, the Lord {{told him}} that the wickedness of the sons of Eli had {{resulted}} in their dynasty being condemned to destruction. In the morning, Samuel was hesitant about reporting the message to Eli, but Eli asked him honestly to recount to him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> told by the Lord. Upon receiving the communication, Eli merely said that the Lord should do what seems right unto him.|$|E

25|$|Dick and Nicole's {{marriage}} {{breaks down}} when he becomes increasingly alcoholic and pines for Rosemary, {{who is now}} a successful Hollywood star. Nicole is becoming increasingly aware of her independence. She distances herself from Dick when his confidence and friendliness turns into sarcasm and rudeness towards everyone. His constant unhappiness over <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> and what he could have been fuels his alcoholism and Dick becomes increasingly embarrassing in social and familial situations. Nicole enters into an affair with Tommy Barban. Nicole divorces Dick and marries Barban.|$|E
25|$|Eli goes on {{to train}} Samuel. When Samuel hears God {{speaking}} to him, he at first thinks it is Eli; Eli, who doesn't hear God calling Samuel, eventually realizes the truth, and instructs Samuel on how to respond. Samuel is told that God's threat (which isn't elaborated further) {{will be carried out}} on Eli and his family, and that there is nothing {{that can be done to}} prevent it. Eli asks Samuel <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> told, insisting that he be told the whole truth, and so Samuel does; Eli reacts by saying that God will do as he judges best.|$|E

500|$|On November 20, 2007, Torres {{signed with}} the Chicago Cubs. In 2008, he engaged a private hitting {{instructor}} named Chris O'Leary to help him out. He began trying to model his swing after Albert Pujols, instead of merely {{trying to put the}} ball on the ground and run to first base, which is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> doing. He spent the entire season with the Iowa Cubs of the Pacific Coast League, batting [...]306 in 118 games with 11 home runs. He finished fifth in the league with 91 runs scored, tied for second in the league with 10 triples (tied with Trent Oeltjen and Nate Schierholtz behind Tim Raines, Jr.'s 13), and led the league with 29 stolen bases. However, the Cubs did not re-sign him and he once again filed for free agency following the season.|$|E
500|$|Frantz and Weymouth {{ended their}} holiday by {{purchasing}} an apartment above Compass Point Studios in Nassau, the Bahamas, where the band had recorded their second album More Songs About Buildings and Food. Byrne joined the duo and Harrison {{there in the}} spring of 1980. The band members realised that it had been solely up to Byrne to bear the creative burden of crafting songs even though the tracks were performed as a quartet. The conception of Remain in Light occurred partly because they tired of the notion of a singer leading a back-up band; the ideal they aimed for, according to Byrne, was [...] "sacrificing our egos for mutual cooperation". The frontman additionally wanted to escape [...] "the psychological paranoia and personal torment" [...] of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> writing and feeling in 1970s New York City. Instead of the band writing music to Byrne's lyrics, TalkingHeads performed instrumental jam sessions without words, using the Fear of Music song [...] "I Zimbra" [...] as a starting point.|$|E
