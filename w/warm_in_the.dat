5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, although this is mostly to <b>warm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E
5|$|The {{habitat of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis lies within the ravine {{at the base}} of the 167-foot-tall {{waterfall}} formed by Chittenango Creek as it flows north from its origin toward Oneida Lake. This north-south oriented ravine forms a deep gorge that is shaded or partially shaded throughout most of the growing season, resulting in a microclimate that stays relatively cool during the summer, and because of the creek flow and ice formations, is relatively <b>warm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter compared to the surrounding area. Spring thaws and periodic major rainfall events tend to remove vegetation from significant portions of the primary Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep <b>warm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E

5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling wines are produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite <b>warm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} study that {{suggests}} greening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> circumpolar high-latitude regions amplifies surface <b>warming</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing season (May-September) under enhanced greenhouse conditions. The investigation used a series of climate simulations with the Community Atmospheric Model version 3 -which incorporates a coupled, dynamic global vegetation model-with and without vegetation feedback, under both present and doubled CO 2 concentrations. Results indicate that climate warming and associated changes promote circumpolar greening with northward expansion and enhanced greenness of both the Arctic tundra and boreal forest regions. This leads to additional surface <b>warming</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-latitudes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing season, primarily through more absorption of incoming solar radiation. The resulting surface and tropospheric <b>warming</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-latitude and Arctic regions weakens prevailing tropospheric westerlies over 45 - 70 N, leading {{to the formation of}} anticyclonic pressure anomalies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Arctic regions.

25|$|The {{giant panda}} has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The {{rest of the}} animal's coat is white. Although {{scientists}} {{do not know why}} these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat.

The stronger the Hadley (Walker) circulation is, the greater <b>the</b> surface <b>warming</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central Pacific (CP) [eastern Pacific (EP) ]. The EP warming is associated with the Bjerknes feedback, while the CP warming is associated with the wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature feedback.
