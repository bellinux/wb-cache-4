5|$|In this episode, Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Detectives Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) {{inspect the}} case of an interracial couple who are shot dead in their car at Fairmount Park. This case leads them to many suspects, {{including}} one of the victim's parents, Al (Barry Shabaka Henley) and Laura (Brenda Pressley), both <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> hiding secrets about the couple's relationship.|$|E
25|$|Individual skill was {{generally}} on England's side, the dribbling of Kirke-Smith, Brockbank and Ottaway being very fine, while Welch, half-back, showed himself {{a safe and}} good kick. The Southrons, however, did not play to each other so well as their opponents, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> adepts in passing the ball.|$|E
25|$|Later, Mateo {{falls down}} a flight of stairs and is knocked unconscious. Christy tries to {{resuscitate}} him using CPR, although she is warned away from him by the other residents, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware that he is HIV-positive. The man's condition continues to deteriorate as Sarah's fetus develops. The baby is born prematurely and in poor health, and is in need of a blood transfusion. Johnny and Sarah are ultimately nervous not only about the baby's survival chances, but also of the skyrocketing hospital bills that will now need to be paid following the baby's delivery, causing Sarah to have a brief nervous breakdown and blame Johnny for Frankie's death, and tearfully berates him.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} town, the two swindlers then {{impersonate}} brothers of Peter Wilks, a recently deceased man of property. To match accounts of Wilks's brothers, the king attempts an English accent and the duke {{pretends to be}} a deaf-mute while starting to collect Wilks's inheritance. Huck decides that Wilks's three orphaned nieces, who treat Huck with kindness, do not deserve to be cheated thus and so he tries to retrieve for them the stolen inheritance. In a desperate moment, Huck is forced to hide the money in Wilks's coffin, which is abruptly buried the next morning. The arrival of two new men <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the real brothers throws everything into confusion, so that the townspeople decide to dig up the coffin {{in order to determine}} which are the true brothers, but, with everyone else distracted, Huck leaves for the raft, hoping to never see the duke and king again. Suddenly, though, the two villains return, much to Huck's despair. When Huck is finally able to get away a second time, he finds to his horror that the swindlers have sold Jim away to a family that intends to return him to his proper owner for the reward. Defying his conscience and accepting the negative religious consequences he expects for his actions—"All right, then, I'll go to hell!"—Huck resolves to free Jim once and for all.|$|E

500|$|It was {{not unusual}} in {{military}} establishments {{of the time that}} individuals passed over for promotion were expected to resign, so Arnold on March 12 wrote to Washington, offering his resignation, or alternatively asking for a court of inquiry. [...] Washington refused his offer to resign, and wrote to members of Congress in an attempt to correct the situation, noting that [...] "two or three other very good officers" [...] might be lost if they persisted in making politically motivated promotions. [...] After Washington wrote Arnold explaining to him that the rejection was due to how the Congress had allocated promotions to the states (and Connecticut already had its quota of major generals), Arnold persisted in seeking some sort of inquiry, and complained in a letter to General Gates that [...] "no gentleman who has any regard for his reputation will risk it with a body of men <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> governed by whim and caprice" [...] and that he felt [...] "the unmerited injury my countrymen have done me." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} theodicy was {{expanded}} mainly {{with the thought}} of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion. There is this ethical part of religion, including [...] "(1) soteriology and (2) theodicy. These mean, respectively, how people understand themselves {{to be able to be}} in a correct relationship with supernatural powers, and how to explain evil – or why bad things seem to happen to those <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good people". There is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class. [...] "Theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.... In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved." [...] Weber also writes that [...] "the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God... theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next." [...] Thus these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{difficult}} to describe the parties and politics of Judea in this period {{because of the lack}} of historical sources, but there seem to have been three important groups involved: the returnees from the exile who claimed the reconstruction with the support of Cyrus I; [...] "the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin"; and a third group, [...] "people of the land", <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> local opposition against the returnees building the Temple in Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Man Who Would Be King", a 2004 song {{written by}} Pete Doherty and Carl Barât of The Libertines, appears in their self-titled second album. The songwriters are known fans of Kipling and his work. It {{reflects}} on the story, as two friends – <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at the top – drift {{away from each other}} and begin to despise each other, mirroring the bandmates' turbulent relationship and eventual splitting of the band shortly after the album's release.|$|E

2500|$|What {{is left of}} Berossus' {{writings}} {{is useless}} for the reconstruction of Mesopotamian history. Of greater interest to scholars is his historiography, using as it did both Greek and Mesopotamian methods. The affinities between it and Hesiod, Herodotus, Manethon, and the Hebrew Bible (specifically, the Torah and Deuteronomistic History) as histories {{of the ancient world}} give us an idea about how ancient people viewed their world. Each begins with a fantastic creation story, followed by a mythical ancestral period, and then finally accounts of recent kings <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> historical, with no demarcations in between.
