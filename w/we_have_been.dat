5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mayors. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a King of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any Prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.|$|E

5|$|On 11 November 2015, Adewole was {{appointed}} as {{minister of health}} in Buhari's administration. He called for stakeholders in the health sector to collaborate enable the ministry achieve Buhari's health agenda. According to The Nation, Adewole said for the apex policy on health to be achieved, {{we need to work}} together and working together means we can make a huge difference. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> described as a generation that enjoyed better health when we were young than now and our aim is to bring back the health care system we enjoyed when we were young.|$|E
5|$|The battalions {{were then}} {{allocated}} {{positions on the}} eastern side of the perimeter, but by now they were battalions in name only. 156 Para had just 53 men under Major Geoffrey Powell, while 10 Para were only slightly better off with 60 men although all its battalion officers were missing. As a result, Captain Peter Barron of the brigade's anti-tank battery was given command of 10 Para. One of the official war photographers inside the perimeter wrote:"This is the fourth day of fighting and camera work is almost out of the question. All day <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> under shell, mortar and machine gun fire. We are completely surrounded and our perimeter is becoming smaller every hour, now it is a matter of fighting for our lives. If our land forces don't make contact with us soon then we've had it".|$|E

25|$|It {{is clear}} to just about {{everyone}} but the die-hard neoconservatives within this administration that shifting our focus away from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein was perhaps the biggest strategic blunder in our nation's history.

25|$|Habituation {{is shared}} across species {{and is the}} {{simplest}} form of learning. Here a person’s response to a stimulus weakens when it becomes familiar. For example, with drink driving advertising in New Zealand, a decade ago we saw cars smashing into each other as a scare tactic. The content of these adverts has become less and less shocking the more <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> exposed to them. We have now become so desensitised to them that a humour approach {{has to be taken}} and the latest example is the ‘Legend’ advert.|$|E

Ours, the {{scientists}} keep telling us, is a universe, which is disposable. You know it might be just this one anonymous glory of all things, this rich stone forest, this epic chant, this gaiety, this grand choiring shout of affirmation, which we choose when all our cities are dust, to stand intact, to mark where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> to testify to what we had it in us, to accomplish.|$|E

25|$|The {{similarities}} between China today and New York 150 years ago shouldn't {{come as a}} great surprise. Adulteration on such a scandalous scale occurs in societies with a toxic combination of characteristics: a fast-growing capitalist economy coupled with a government {{unable or unwilling to}} regulate the food supply. In such get-rich-quick societies, there is a huge temptation to tamper with food, particularly when margins are low. The rewards are instant, and it's not always easy for consumers to detect the difference between the pure and the doctored—particularly with a substance like milk, which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> taught to trust implicitly.|$|E
25|$|Fifth: the Arab governments' {{invitation}} {{to the people of}} Palestine to flee from it and seek refuge in adjacent Arab countries, after terror had spread among their ranks {{in the wake of the}} Deir Yassin event. This mass flight has benefited the Jews and the situation stabilized in their favor without effort.... Since 1948 <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> demanding the return of the refugees to their homeland, while it is we who constrained them to leave it. Between the invitation extended to the refugees and the request to the United Nations to decide upon their return, there elapsed only a few months.|$|E
25|$|From being a {{supporter}} of British membership of the Common Market in 1970 I {{have come to believe}} that the United Kingdom would be Better Off Out of the developing European Republic of the 21st century. We British have a thousand year history of self-government. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> free and democratic longer than any other nation. The European Union is too diverse, too bureaucratic, too corporatist and too centralist to be a functioning democracy. We are happy to trade with our European friends and the rest of the world – but we would prefer to govern ourselves.|$|E

A strongly constructed boat ran her bow against a gondola loaded with flour, and so much injured her as to render it necessary to transship the load. But no damage was done to the cargo.|$|E
