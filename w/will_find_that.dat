25|$|In contrast, {{people with}} {{negative}} self-views <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> {{the desire for}} self-verification and self-enhancement are competing. Consider people who see themselves as disorganized. Whereas their desire for self-enhancement will compel them to seek evidence that others perceive them as organized, their desire for self-verification will compel such individuals to seek evidence that others perceive them as disorganized. Self-verification strivings tend to prevail over self-enhancement strivings when people are certain of the self-concept and when they have extremely depressive self-views.|$|E

25|$|Where a {{principal}} can establish both a fiduciary duty and {{a breach of}} that duty, through violation of the above rules, the court <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the benefit gained by the fiduciary {{should be returned to}} the principal because it would be unconscionable to allow the fiduciary to retain the benefit by employing his strict common law legal rights. This will be the case, unless the fiduciary can show there was full disclosure of the conflict of interest or profit and that the principal fully accepted and freely consented to the fiduciary's course of action.|$|E
25|$|Suppose, for example, {{that one}} {{observer}} examines {{the properties of}} a hydrogen atom on Earth, the other—on the Moon (or any other place in the universe), the observer <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> their hydrogen atoms exhibit completely identical properties. Again, if one observer had examined a hydrogen atom today and the other—100 years ago (or {{any other time in}} the past or in the future), the two experiments would again produce completely identical results. The invariance of the properties of a hydrogen atom with respect to the time and place where these properties were investigated is called translation invariance.|$|E
25|$|This {{situation}} {{represents a}} conflict of interest and duty. Both X and Y hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest. By signing an individual contract and taking all the money, X has put personal interest above the fiduciary duty. Therefore, a court <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> X has breached his fiduciary duty. The judicial remedy here will be that X holds both the contract and the money in a constructive trust for the duo. Note, X will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both X and Y will receive a half share in the contract and the money.|$|E

25|$|While the {{measures}} of the internal angles in planar triangles always sum to 180°, a hyperbolic triangle has measures of angles that sum to less than 180°, and a spherical triangle has measures of angles that sum to more than 180°. A hyperbolic triangle {{can be obtained by}} drawing on a negatively curved surface, such as a saddle surface, and a spherical triangle can be obtained by drawing on a positively curved surface such as a sphere. Thus, if one draws a giant triangle {{on the surface of the}} Earth, one <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the sum of {{the measures}} of its angles is greater than 180°; in fact it will be between 180° and 540°. In particular it is possible to draw a triangle on a sphere such that the measure of each of its internal angles is equal to 90°, adding up to a total of 270°.|$|E
25|$|Even when {{a system}} is entirely {{isolated}} from external influences, its microstate is constantly changing. For instance, the particles in a gas are constantly moving, and thus occupy a different position at each moment of time; their momenta are also constantly changing as they collide with each other or with the container walls. Suppose we prepare the system in an artificially highly ordered equilibrium state. For instance, imagine dividing a container with a partition and placing a gas {{on one side of}} the partition, with a vacuum on the other side. If we remove the partition and watch the subsequent behavior of the gas, we <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> its microstate evolves according to some chaotic and unpredictable pattern, and that on average these microstates will correspond to a more disordered macrostate than before. It is possible, but extremely unlikely, for the gas molecules to bounce off one another in such a way that they remain in one half of the container. It is overwhelmingly probable for the gas to spread out to fill the container evenly, which is the new equilibrium macrostate of the system.|$|E

Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote {{that it was}} an [...] "unprecedented defeat on American turf", but that [...] "North Korea <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> their bullying edict will haunt them." [...] In the Capital and Gizmodo suggested the cancellation caused a Streisand effect, whereby the attempt to remove or censor a work has the unintended consequence of publicizing it more widely. In a press conference, U.S. President Barack Obama said that though he was sympathetic to Sony's need to protect employees, he thought Sony had [...] "made a mistake. We cannot have a society in which some dictator in some place can start imposing censorship in the United States. I wish they'd spoken to me first. I would have told them: do not get into the pattern in which you are intimidated." ...|$|E
500|$|Trotter {{returned}} to the United States in July 1919 to learn of ongoing race riots at major cities across the country. Postwar economic and social tensions had erupted, and blacks fought back against white violence {{in cities such as}} Chicago and Omaha. Trotter quickly supported active resistance to white-on-black violence, writing, [...] "Unless the white American behaves, he <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> in teaching our boys to fight for him he was starting something that he {{will not be able to}} stop." [...] His writings prompted calls in Congress for the censorship of the Negro press: South Carolina Congressman James F. Byrnes accused Trotter of [...] "doing his utmost to incite riots and bloodshed." [...] Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge gave Trotter a chance to testify during Senate deliberations on ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, which Lodge opposed on grounds other than Trotter's. Lodge's opposition was successful: the Senate never ratified the treaty.|$|E
500|$|As Rosas {{aged and}} his health declined, the {{question}} of who would succeed him became a growing concern among his supporters. His wife Encarnación had died in October 1838 after a long illness. Although devastated by his loss, Rosas exploited her death to raise support for his regime. Not long after, at the age of 47, he began an affair with his fifteen-year-old maid, María Eugenia Castro, with whom he had five illegitimate children. From his marriage to Encarnación, Rosas had two children: Juan Bautista Pedro and Manuela Robustiana. Rosas established a hereditary dictatorship, naming the children from his marriage as his successors, stating that [...] "hey are both worthy children of my beloved Encarnación, and if, God willing, I die, then you <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> they are capable of succeeding me." [...] It is unknown whether Rosas was a closet monarchist. Later during his exile, Rosas would declare that Princess Alice of the United Kingdom would be the ideal ruler for his country. Nonetheless, in public he stated that his regime was republican in nature.|$|E

500|$|Protagonist Alan Corday {{is a young}} engineer, and is kidnapped from a {{spaceport}} called [...] "New Chicago" [...] {{and taken}} aboard the interstellar trading starship Hound of Heaven. The ship is commanded by a charismatic leader named Captain Jocelyn, who tells Corday to use his skills to help the Hound of Heaven in its travels between Earth and space colonies in other star systems. On {{the first page of}} the book's prologue Hubbard cites [...] "the basic equation of mass and time.... AS MASS APPROACHES INFINITY, TIME APPROACHES ZERO", meaning that interstellar travelers at near light speed experience time relative to their environment, and when they return to their home star <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> decades or centuries may have passed. Six weeks of time aboard the ship amounts to roughly nine years experienced by those on Earth. Corday resists mingling with the culture aboard the starship, but when he returns home after travels with the Hound of Heaven he finds that his fiancee has aged and has trouble with her memory. Corday realizes his only home has become that of the starship. Captain Jocelyn is killed in an ambush on a dystopian Earth, and Corday takes command of the ship.|$|E
500|$|Themistocles {{died with}} his {{reputation}} in tatters, a traitor to the Athenian people; the [...] "saviour of Greece" [...] {{had turned into}} the enemy of liberty. However, his reputation in Athens was rehabilitated by Pericles in the 450sBC, {{and by the time}} Herodotus wrote his history, Themistocles was once again seen as a hero. Thucydides evidently held Themistocles in some esteem, and is uncharacteristically flattering in his praise for him (see above). Diodorus also extensively praises Themistocles, going as far as to offer a rationale for the length at which he discusses him: [...] "Now {{on the subject of the}} high merits of Themistocles, even if we have dwelt over-long on the subject in this digression, we believed it not seemly that we should leave his great ability unrecorded." [...] Indeed, Diodorus goes so far as to say that [...] "But if any man, putting envy aside, will estimate closely not only the man's natural gifts but also his achievements, he <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> on both counts Themistocles holds first place among all of whom we have record. Therefore one may well be amazed that the Athenians were willing to rid themselves of a man of such genius." [...] Since Diodorus's history includes such luminaries as Alexander the Great and Hannibal, this is high praise indeed. Plutarch offers a more nuanced view of Themistocles, with more of a critique of Themistocles's character. He does not detract from Themistocles's achievements, but also highlights his failings.|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} called The Return of the King [...] "bigger and better" [...] than The Two Towers. [...] "In The Two Towers {{the player}} would occasionally run into 10 or 15 enemies," [...] said lead game designer Chris Tremmel, [...] "in The Return of the King there are {{areas where the}} player faces up to 40 orcs [...] Fans familiar with The Two Towers <b>will</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the combat experience in The Return of the King feels familiar but much deeper." [...] Before creating levels, the developers would initially look at the script and determine what parts from the film to highlight in that particular level, and how to structure that event as a mission. They would then write in-depth level designs out on paper, going into details such as combat setup, special props and enemy types, all the while using the film as their main reference point. They would then create an animatic of the level, working out problems and fine-tuning design concepts. The levels would then be created in the game environment. The game is also graphically improved over The Two Towers. According to Neil Young, [...] "we've developed some new lighting techniques to allow the characters to look richer. We are pushing 2x the number of polys & 2x the texture density [...] we also stream our geometry and textures from the disc so the game has a much higher density of imagery." [...] Enemy AI was improved, and developers also {{spent a lot of}} time working on the sound of the game, which was THX certified.|$|E
