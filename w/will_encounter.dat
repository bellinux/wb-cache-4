5|$|The player assumes {{control of}} the protagonist, a teenage human girl. As the game follows a {{branching}} plot line with multiple endings, at various points during gameplay the player is allowed to make choices that determine which character's romance route the player <b>will</b> <b>encounter.</b> On weekdays, the player can also choose which classes to attend, which changes one of the protagonist's three stats depending on the activity chosen. Having certain stat values are required to obtain the good endings for each love interest and to otherwise advance along certain routes. There are thirteen (fourteen in the 2014 remake) endings in total: one ending {{for each of the}} main love interests, three extended endings for three of the love interests based on stat values, one ending for the gaiden-esque Torimi Café storyline, and one ending attained if the player fails to romance any character.|$|E

50|$|Phinilly is a fairy princess whom <b>Will</b> <b>encounters</b> {{during his}} travels. She {{lives in a}} secluded valley hidden from people, and after Will finds it and defeats her, she decides {{to go with him}} to learn more humans.|$|R
5|$|While {{visiting the}} region's cities, the player <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> special establishments called Gyms. Inside these {{buildings}} are Gym Leaders, {{each of whom}} the player must defeat in a Pokémon battle to obtain a total of eight Gym Badges. Once the badges are acquired, the player is given permission to enter the Indigo League, which consists of the best Pokémon trainers in the region. There the player will battle the Elite Four and finally the new Champion: the player's rival. Also, throughout the game, the player will have to battle {{against the forces of}} Team Rocket, a criminal organization that abuses Pokémon. They devise numerous plans for stealing rare Pokémon, which the player must foil.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} {{previous}} The Legend of Zelda games, solving puzzles and clearing dungeons remains a fundamental {{part of the}} gameplay. Progression through A Link Between Worlds is more open-ended than previous titles, {{with the possibility of}} tackling many of the game's dungeons in any order. Certain dungeon obstacles will require the use of the rented or purchased items. Towards the end of each dungeon, Link <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> a boss that must be defeated. A unique mechanic that the game introduces is Link's ability to merge onto walls and move horizontally along them. Link is presented as a mural when he is merged on a wall, and upon merging, the game's perspective shifts to a side view to follow Link around corners. While merged to a wall, Link's energy gauge will deplete. The mechanic can be used for traversing the environment, reaching seemingly inaccessible areas, and avoiding hazards. It {{plays a key role in}} solving many of the game's puzzles and dungeons. Wall merging is also used as a means for travelling between Hyrule and Lorule, via fissures that connect the two kingdoms.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero on the Good side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Will</b> <b>encounters</b> Hollywood superstar Anna Scott {{when she}} enters his shop. Minutes later, they collide {{in the street}} and his drink spills on her clothes. Will offers his house nearby for Anna to change. Before leaving, she impulsively kisses him and then asks him not to mention what just occurred.|$|R
50|$|A fiend whom <b>Will</b> <b>encounters</b> {{during his}} travels. She {{claims to be}} a masochist and lacks common sense, relying on Wil to help her discern right from wrong. She has {{incredible}} teleportation powers and is a leader to a group of monsters similar to her. She has a playful, almost chilldish personality which is darkly colored by her role as a fiend.|$|R
50|$|<b>Will</b> <b>encounters</b> Richard Burbage’s sister, Alice Burbage (Olivia DeJonge). Unimpressed, Alice {{demands that}} this “actor” pitch his play {{to her on}} the street while she looks out a second story window. Will reads a speech of King Edward’s from the final scene of the play to the {{captured}} French King John. Ironically, the scene in question is one that scholars do not identify as Shakespeare’s.|$|R
5|$|The {{other boys}} find Pi Pi, who informs them the park can be drained of the {{inundation}} if someone can swim through the pee {{to reach an}} emergency release valve. Kyle reluctantly agrees {{to do the job}} as he said {{at the start of the}} episode that he could hold his breath for the longest, but is horrified to learn he must drink some of the pee in order to offset the fluid pressure he <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> at the depths. Outside, an antidote that keeps the monkeys calm during yet another urination test is discovered: bananas. Back inside the park, Kyle reluctantly drinks a jarful of pee in preparation for his plunge into the flood. Just after he finishes the jar, helicopters arrive as part of the rescue mission, which made Kyle extremely furious for drinking pee for nothing. After escaping the pee-filled water park, Cartman reunites with his friends, and is glad that he isn't the last of the species and he declares that he will live up to the fullest. Kyle angrily says that he has to get his stomach pumped at the hospital. Stan reassures that it's only a little pee. Kyle angrily complains that bananas are more disgusting than pee. The water tester doles out bananas to the kids. The fire marshal tells them that they must eat their bananas immediately, but a police officer aims his gun at Kyle, saying that he must do it, or he'll be put down and Kyle yells in frustration.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{fishing boats}} are usually {{characteristic}} of the stretch of coast along which they operate. They evolve over time to meet the local conditions, such as the materials available locally for boat building, the type of sea conditions the boats <b>will</b> <b>encounter,</b> {{and the demands of}} the local fisheries.|$|E

25|$|In astrophysics, lambda {{represents}} {{the likelihood that}} a small body <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> a planet or a dwarf planet leading to a deflection of a significant magnitude. An object with a large value of lambda is expected to have cleared its neighborhood, satisfying the current definition of a planet.|$|E
25|$|This game {{takes place}} in a fictional solar system called the Lylat system, which is {{inhabited}} by humanlike animal races (e.g. foxes, frogs, dogs, birds, rabbits, apes). It contains the planets Corneria and Venom, representing good and evil, respectively. One can visit many other planets, asteroid belts, space stations, etc. while going through the course of the game. Which path the player chooses affects what places they <b>will</b> <b>encounter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its energy}} consumption, desalinating sea water is {{generally}} more costly than fresh water from rivers or groundwater, water recycling and water conservation. However, these alternatives {{are not always}} available and depletion of reserves is a critical problem worldwide. Currently, approximately 1% of the world's population is dependent on desalinated water to meet daily needs, but the UN expects that 14% of the world's population <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> water scarcity by 2025.|$|E

25|$|Historically, fly pattern types {{have evolved}} along with fly fishing itself and {{today there are}} {{generally}} recognized pattern types. However, none are absolute, as there is much crossover in patterns and pattern types. Typically the fly tyer <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> patterns classified as dry flies, wet flies, soft hackles, emergers, nymphs, terrestrials, bucktails and streamers, salmon (Atlantic) flies, steelhead and salmon (Pacific) flies, bass flies and bugs, poppers, panfish flies, saltwater flies, or pike flies. Even within these categories, there can be many sub-categories of imitative and non-imitative flies.|$|E
25|$|While {{both the}} mod and the remake use the first-person {{perspective}} common to other Source engine mods, {{there are no}} combat or other action-based sequences. Instead, the player guides Stanley, the game's protagonist, through a surreal environment while the narrator, voiced by British actor Kevan Brighting, delivers exposition. The player {{has the opportunity to}} make numerous decisions on which paths to take, and because at times the narrator says what Stanley will do next, the player can choose to ignore the narration and make a different choice. Every choice made by the player is commented on by the narrator, and depending on the choices the player makes, they <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> different endings to the game before it restarts.|$|E
25|$|Bloodbornes {{world of}} Yharnam {{is a large}} map full of areas that are {{connected}}. Some areas of Yharnam are not connected to the main locations and require the player to teleport there via the gravestones in the Hunter's Dream. Players are usually presented with multiple options when progressing through locations; usually there is a main path that the player uses to progress through the story. When traversing the main path, the player <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> paths that lead to completely different locations that are optional. Each path also eventually leads back to the central area the player started in. This provides players with shortcuts, useful for when they die or need to backtrack.|$|E

25|$|Coastal fishing {{villages are}} often {{somewhat}} isolated, and sited around a small natural harbour which provides {{safe haven for}} a village fleet of fishing boats. The village needs to provide a safe way of landing fish and securing boats {{when they are not}} in use. Fishing villages may operate from a beach, particularly around lakes. For example, around parts of Lake Malawi, each fishing village has its own beach. If a fisherman from outside the village lands fish on the beach, he gives some of the fish to the village headman. Village fishing boats are usually characteristic of the stretch of coast along which they operate. Traditional fishing boats evolve over time to meet the local conditions, such as the materials available locally for boat building, the type of sea conditions the boats <b>will</b> <b>encounter,</b> and the demands of the local fisheries.|$|E
25|$|Dungeons maps {{consist of}} {{connecting}} rooms and corridors. As the player explores the map, the player <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> chests or other devices which will, if opened or activated, summon monsters {{that must be}} defeated in order to progress in the dungeon path. At {{the end of each}} dungeon, there is a large room, which will usually have the boss enemy of the dungeon (sometimes escorted by a number of other enemies). Once the boss and its minions are defeated, a treasure room is opened, with the rewards for clearing the dungeon. The number of treasure chests inside the treasure room will be equal to the number of characters in the dungeon (at the time of dungeon creation). Players can thus explore the dungeons in teams. Some dungeons have special items called passes which allow harder (and sometimes easier) versions to be done. Some passes require a specific number of players to form the team.|$|E
25|$|As they {{approach}} {{the time when they}} are ready to migrate out to the sea the parr lose their camouflage bars and undergo a process of physiological changes which allows them to survive the shift from freshwater to saltwater. At this point salmon are called smolt. Smolt spend time in the brackish waters of the river estuary while their body chemistry adjusts their osmoregulation to cope with the higher salt levels they <b>will</b> <b>encounter</b> in the ocean. Smolt also grow the silvery scales which visually confuse ocean predators. When they have matured sufficiently in late spring, and are about 15 to 20 centimetres long, the smolt swim out of the rivers and into the sea. There they spend their first year as a post-smolt. Post-smolt form schools with other post-smolt, and set off to find deep-sea feeding grounds. They then spend up to four more years as adult ocean salmon while their full swimming ability and reproductive capacity develop.|$|E
