5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
25|$|A notable remark of {{hers was}} made to the English soprano Adelaide Kemble when they {{attended}} the late concert in London by the great Italian soprano Giuditta Pasta, who was clearly past her prime. Asked by Kemble <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the voice, she replied 'Ah! It is a ruin, but then so is Leonardo's Last Supper.|$|E
25|$|The {{exact nature}} of her {{relationship}} with her royal sister-in-law is not clear either, and there is no evidence as to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her other sister-in-law, Mary Boleyn, who had been at court with Jane since they were both teenagers. It is generally assumed that Jane was not overly fond of Anne, allegedly because of Jane's jealousy of her. Regardless, Jane plotted with Anne to banish one of the King's young unnamed mistresses from court in 1534. When the King discovered her involvement, Lady Rochford was herself exiled for a few months.|$|E
6000|$|... "That depends chiefly on you, Tito," [...] said Romola, taking fire slightly. It {{was not at}} all <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> saying, but we see a {{very little}} way before us in mutual speech.|$|R
60|$|Alan had an {{idea that}} that was not <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> saying, but as she had turned aside and was busying herself with the pails, there seemed nothing for him to do but to go.|$|R
60|$|Joan waited {{till the}} last of the {{congregation}} had disappeared, and then joined the little pew-opener who was waiting to close the doors. Joan asked her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the sermon, but Mary Stopperton, being a little deaf, had not heard it.|$|R
500|$|On 20 November 2013 M.I.A. {{appeared}} on The Colbert Report and {{was asked by}} host Stephen Colbert <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> America. Trying to be gentle, Maya ultimately responded with, [...] "Well you know, in my mind, there's no countries, you know it's like; we're all one, we all live on this planet." ...|$|E
500|$|Miranda Keyes was {{voiced by}} Julie Benz in Halo 2, but Bungie recast the role for Halo 3, ostensibly {{because they wanted}} someone with an accent. Despite not {{being a part of}} Halo 3, Benz said that she loved voiceover work and that it was pure chance she had become the voice of Keyes in the first place. When IGN asked Benz <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her character, she {{admitted}} she hadn't played Halo 2, even though Bungie had sent her [...] "like four copies of the game." [...] The character is voiced by Justis Bolding in Halo 3.|$|E
500|$|One early promo for 30 Rock portrayed Alec Baldwin mistakenly {{thinking}} {{he would meet}} Sorkin, and when asked on her [...] "Ask Tina" [...] space <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the criticism that 30 Rock received, Fey jokingly replied that {{people who did not}} like it were probably confusing it with Studio 60. However, none of 30 Rocks producers have given Studio 60 any serious criticism, positive or negative. In a November 1, 2006 interview, Fey said she had seen the first two episodes of Studio 60. When asked what her impressions were, she jokingly replied, [...] "I can't do impressions of Bradley Whitford and Matthew Perry." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{which the}} other sheep took heart and, deserting the {{numbered}} succession, came and sat about {{the fire in}} a big drawing-room and argued also. In particular there was Lady Sunderbund, a pretty fragile tall woman in the corner, richly jewelled, who sat with her pretty eyes watching and her lips compressed. <b>What</b> had <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it? <b>She</b> had said very little.|$|R
6000|$|... "And did not the usages of war {{justify his}} death, Henry?" [...] inquired Frances, {{speaking}} in a low voice, unwilling to abandon <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the cause <b>of</b> her country, and yet unable to suppress her feelings for the man.|$|R
60|$|I {{feared that}} Lucille heard her, and {{wondered}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> Our mode <b>of</b> life was widely {{different from that}} at Bonaventure and from {{what would have been}} for me possible had I not fallen into the hands of Lane.|$|R
2500|$|She donated all {{proceeds}} from the book to literacy charities. Now comfortable speaking in front of groups, she routinely spoke to promote issues she believed in and became famous for expressing {{a sense of humor}} and self-deprecating wit. During the 1984 presidential campaign, Barbara made headlines when she told the press that she could not say on television <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Vice-Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, but [...] "it rhymes with rich". She later apologized to Ferraro.|$|E
2500|$|When the Miniature Killer was {{discovered}} to be Natalie Davis, Grissom {{was the first}} to talk to her in the interrogation room after Brass suggested dripping bleach on himself until she spoke. Grissom went in alone, and attempted to get her to tell him where Sara was by complimenting her work and asking <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his miniature. When Sara's name was brought up following her kidnapping, Natalie became very angry, to the point that she had a hallucination of her slitting Grissom's throat with a razor, while she was actually falling into an unresponsive state in which she sang [...] "I've Got a Pain in My Sawdust" [...] to herself, leaving Sara's whereabouts unknown.|$|E
2500|$|The {{district}} {{soon began}} construction of drainage canals, and Disney {{built the first}} roads and the Magic Kingdom. The Contemporary Resort Hotel and Polynesian Village were also completed {{in time for the}} park's opening on October 1, 1971. The Palm and Magnolia golf courses near Magic Kingdom had opened a few weeks before, while Fort Wilderness opened a month later. 24 days after the park opened , Roy O. Disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as [...] "Walt Disney World" [...] in his brother's honor. In his own words: [...] "Everyone has heard of Ford cars. But have they all heard of Henry Ford, who started it all? Walt Disney World is in memory of the man who started it all, so people will know his name as long as Walt Disney World is here." [...] After the dedication, Roy Disney asked Walt's widow, Lillian, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Walt Disney World. According to biographer Bob Thomas, she responded, [...] "I think Walt would have approved." [...] Roy Disney died at age 78 on December 20, 1971, less than three months after the property opened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Apology! Mr. Denbigh," [...] cried Emily, with a color {{varying with}} every word she spoke, and {{trembling}} at <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the nearness <b>of</b> detection, [...] "you have no apology {{to make for}} your present debility; and surely, surely, least of all to me!" ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this was}} very {{pleasant}} to Mary. Cuthbert was now of course nothing to her, but it soothed her to hear his praises. He had been wicked in one respect, but in all others {{he seemed to have}} been <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him when he was a child, save that he developed a talent and the power of steady work, for which she had never given him credit, for on this head Ren√© was as emphatic as on other points.|$|R
60|$|They {{hardened}} {{themselves to}} the discussion, Mrs. Poynsett explaining <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the due <b>of</b> her eldest son, only that Cecil's jointure would diminish the amount at her disposal. Indeed, when she was once aroused, she attended the most fully; but when Miles found her apologizing for only affording him the little house in the village, he cried out with consternation.|$|R
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it. ' When they sent [...] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing. '" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll {{kill that}} d--n nigger {{if he did}} not deliver that letter," [...] said Clarke, jumping up in his excitement. [...] "I never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that. Good Heaven! <b>What</b> could <b>she</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> me? <b>She</b> would think I had gone away without a word. If she knew I really loved her she could not think so terribly of me." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} the Princess Jaqueline did <b>what</b> <b>she</b> should have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> sooner. <b>She</b> {{flew out of}} Dick's coat, and stung old King James on his royal nose. The king wakened, nearly crushed the princess (so {{dangerous}} is the practice of magic to the artist), and then leaped up, and saw Dick's blade flying through the air, glittering in the sun. The prince had disarmed him.|$|R
60|$|Lady de la Poer warmly {{kissed the}} child, and then {{remained}} {{a little while}} with the aunts, trying to remove <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw was the impression, that Kate had been complaining of severe treatment, and taking the opportunity of telling them <b>what</b> <b>she</b> herself <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the little girl. But though Aunt Barbara listened politely, she could not think that Lady de la Poer knew anything about the perverseness, heedlessness, ill-temper, disobedience, and rude ungainly ways, that were so tormenting. She said no word about them herself, because she would not expose her niece's faults; but when her friend talked Kate's bright candid conscientious character, her readiness, sense, and intelligence, she said to herself, and perhaps justly, that here was all the difference between at home and abroad, an authority and a stranger.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not need}} to say <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the advice the little villain gave.|$|E
60|$|Sophy looked {{excessively}} {{hurt and}} grieved, and in private asked her step-mother <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Genevieve's behaviour.|$|E

60|$|Five vast bloomers {{in under}} a minute I <b>What</b> could <b>she</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him? The sun ceased to shine. What {{sort of an}} utter {{outsider}} could she have considered him? An east wind sprang up. What kind of a Cockney bounder and cad could she have taken him for? The sea turned to an oily grey; and George, rising, strode back {{in the direction of}} his hotel in a mood that made him forget that he had brown boots on at all.|$|R
60|$|But Bradley {{had trouble}} {{in going to}} sleep that night, {{thinking}} about it. He was wondering <b>what</b> <b>She</b> would have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him in that disgraceful row. He tried to remember whether he swore or not. He felt, even in the darkness, her grave, sweet eyes fixed upon him in a sorrowful, disappointed way, and it made him groan and turn {{his face to the}} wall, to escape the picture of himself standing there in the wagon, with his coat off, shouting back at a band of rowdies.|$|R
6000|$|Indeed, {{her mind}} was more full of her {{accounts}} and the bad debts, and of the cheapest way of getting in her groceries than of anything else. As she walked back through the village she wondered whether Mrs. Somers and Miss Manners would send to her mother's for their brown sugar this summer. That would make it worth while {{to go to a}} better but more expensive place, and have in a larger stock; and Grace went on reckoning the risk all the time, and wondering whether the going to the working parties would secure the ladies' custom. In that case the time would not be wasted. It did not come into Grace's head whether <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> for the service of God she might be turning to the service of Mammon, if she only just endured it for the sake of standing well with the gentry. But then, was it not her duty to consider her shop and her mother's interest? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{knocking}} about," [...] he answered. [...] "Earning my living." [...] He {{was curious}} to discover <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Matthew, first of all.|$|E

2500|$|He {{had never}} held office but {{demonstrated}} energy, executive ability, and political astuteness. He consulted widely within his party, making the Liberal Lord Haldane the Lord Chancellor, and Philip Snowden Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took the foreign office himself. Besides himself, ten other cabinet members came from working class origins, a dramatic breakthrough in British history. His first priority was {{to undo the}} damage caused by the harsh 1919 Treaty of Versailles, by settling the reparations issue and coming to terms with Germany. The king noted in his diary, [...] "He wishes to do the right thing.... Today 23 years ago dear Grandmama died. I wonder <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a Labour Government!" ...|$|R
6000|$|On that night, however, {{when she}} was alone, she could console herself with {{thinking}} how right she had been. In that front bedroom, the door of which was opposite to her own, with closed shutters, in the terrible solemnity of lifeless humanity, was still lying the body of her aunt! <b>What</b> would <b>she</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> herself if at such a moment she could have listened to words of love, and promised herself as a wife while such an inmate was in the house? She little knew that he, within that same room, had pledged himself, to her who was now lying there waiting for her last removal--had pledged himself, just seven days since, to make the offer which, {{when he was talking}} to her, she was always half hoping and half fearing! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Marcia, Marcia! You hadn't ought to! It's ridiculous!" [...] she protested. But she {{suffered}} {{herself to be}} thrust out of the room, grateful for exile, in which she could collect her scattered wits and set herself to realize the fact that had dispersed them. It was decorous, also, for her to leave Marcia alone with Mr. Hubbard, far more so now than when he was merely company; she felt that, and she fumbled over the dressing she was sent about, and once she looked out of her chamber window at the office where Mr. Gaylord sat, and wondered <b>what</b> Mr. Gaylord (<b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him, and even dreamt of him, as Mr. Gaylord, and had never, in the most familiar moments, addressed him otherwise) would say! But she left {{the solution of the}} problem to him and Marcia; she was used to leaving them to the settlement of their own difficulties.|$|R
