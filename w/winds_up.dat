5|$|Although Fran passed {{near the}} Azores as a hurricane, winds {{on the islands}} only reached 45mph (75km/h) and no damage was recorded. On October12, a French ship {{encountered}} the storm, recording sustained winds of 40mph (65km/h) and an air pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg).

5|$|Late on August11, as Charley {{traveled}} {{south of}} Jamaica, it attained hurricane intensity, with winds reaching 75mph (120km/h).

The weakened Charley rapidly tracked northeast before dissipating on August15 near Long Island, New York.|$|E

5|$|On September19 and 20, Georges {{underwent}} {{a period of}} rapid intensification, in which winds increased by 45mph (85km/h) in a 24-hour span. At {{the end of this}} phase, Georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) and a barometric pressure of 937mbar (hPa; 27.68inHg), just below Category 5 status. At the time of peak intensity, a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm recorded flight-level <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to 168mph (270km/h) while dropsondes measured surface <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to 175mph (280km/h). One of the readings from a dropsonde, that was disregarded, recorded winds of 191mph (307km/h) in the lower-levels of the eyewall. This reading was disregarded by the hurricane hunters as it seemed too high and not representative of the actual intensity of Georges. The Hurricane Hunters also noted a large increase in the radius of tropical storm-force winds, prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Lesser Antilles. Around the time of peak intensity, the eye of Georges was roughly 35mi (55km) in diameter.|$|E
5|$|In late August, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa, developing into {{a tropical}} depression developed near Cape Verde on August28. It moved west-southwestward for two days before turning to the west. The depression is estimated to have intensified into a tropical storm on August31, and subsequently it turned to the west-northwest. On September2, the S.S. Umatilla reported <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to force12 on the Beaufort scale, or hurricane strength; the ship also reported very high seas and a rapidly decreasing pressure. Based on the report, the Miami Weather Bureau office initiated advisories on Hurricane Carol about 750miles (1200km) east-northeast of Barbados.|$|E
5|$|In the post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center {{identified}} {{an additional}} subtropical storm {{that had gone}} unnoticed {{during the course of}} the season. The storm formed on October 4 and was absorbed by a non-tropical low the next day after passing over the Azores, where Santa Maria Island reported sustained <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to 40mph (60km/h). The low that absorbed the storm would eventually become Hurricane Vince. At its peak, the storm had winds of 50mph (80km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 997mbar (hPa). No damages or casualties were reported.|$|E

40|$|I have {{my thesis}} {{dividend}} into two parts.

In the second part I made up an imaginary limited lability company (I couldn't get any real dates from the existing company because they are all subject of business secret) and tried to illustrate the process of <b>winding</b> <b>up</b> of the company with liquidation. I put emphasis on particular steps of liquidator and the formal standpoints of the liquidation process...|$|R

5|$|The {{hurricane}} prompted {{standard precautions}} in the Bahamas and Florida, {{although it did}} not affect the region. In North Carolina, winds and waves brushed the coast, while around New York City, heavy rainfall caused some flooding. Along Cape Cod and Nantucket, Able produced <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to 55mph (90km/h) and high waves, and across New England there were nine traffic fatalities. The hurricane killed 2people in Canada and caused over $1million in damage.|$|E
5|$|The second {{storm of}} the season was first {{identified}} on August 25 {{to the east of}} Florida as a tropical depression. Around this time, several ships were reporting <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to 25 mph (35 km/h) {{in the vicinity of the}} system. Traveling towards the northeast, the storm gradually intensified, attainting tropical storm status around 0600 UTC the next day. Several hours later, a ship recorded a pressure of 1010 mbar (hPa) while located in the vicinity of the system. The storm turned towards the west-northwest later that day and forward motion began to increase.|$|E

5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical depression, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued Public Storm Warning Signal #1 for Samar, Leyte, the Camotes Islands, Surigao del Norte, Siargao Island, and Dinagat Island as <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to 60km/h (37mph) were expected to affect those areas.

5|$|Late on September26, shear {{began to}} relax and deep {{convection}} redeveloped around the center of circulation and the forward motion of the storm began to increase. Several hours later, the storm made a sudden northwest jump due to a passing shortwave trough. By this time, Kyle was just below hurricane-status, with sustained <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to 70mph (110km/h). Continued organization led to the storm attaining hurricane intensity at 1200UTC on September27 while located about 345mi (555km) west of Bermuda. Upon attaining this intensity, the storm became embedded within an area strong, divergent, upper-level winds. Increasing in forward motion, the center of Kyle was located along the southwestern edge of the deep convection.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, Lin passed {{directly}} over Tonga with <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to 110km/h (70mph) and heavy rains. Initial reports of damage stated that only vegetation had been impacted. However, later reports stated that power lines had been knocked down by high winds {{and the heavy}} rains triggered minor flooding in Nuku'alofa. Some houses lost their rain gutters from the storm. Due to strong winds, officials were forced to shut down power stations in Tongatapu to protect the system. Most of the power lines in Tonga were either downed or damaged by the storm and numerous trees fell across the island. Several roads were also blocked by downed trees and billboards were broken. No one was injured by the storm but {{there were reports of}} significant crop losses.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues arising in {{cross-border}} or international insolvency is the local recognition and effect of concurrent foreign insolvency proceedings.

While crossing the northern Philippines, the two systems merged and became a single cyclone, retaining the name Lucille. During its passage of the country, <b>winds</b> <b>up</b> to 63km/h (39mph) were reported in Manila.
