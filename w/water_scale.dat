Based on the spectral analysis of the time series of <b>water</b> vapor <b>scale</b> height from 2006 to 2012, {{it is found that}} the <b>water</b> vapor <b>scale</b> height shows an annual and a semi-annual variation in time. So, the trigonometric functions with an annual and a semi-annual cycle are used to express the time variation of <b>water</b> vapor <b>scale</b> height. And then the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) data are used to fit the coefficients of the trigonometric functions at 1 &# 176;&# 215; 1 &# 176; grid points on a global scale. By these methods,a global <b>water</b> vapor <b>scale</b> height model GSH is firstly established, which considers both the time and geographic variations of <b>water</b> vapor <b>scale</b> height. By taking radiosonde data as reference, the GSH model has bias of - 0. 19 km and rootmean square error (RMSE) of 1. 81 km; by taking ECMWF data as reference, the GSH model has bias of 0. 04 km and RMSE of 1. 52 km. The GSH model shows a relatively even accuracy on a global scale, and could serve the study of GNSS meteorology and provide reference values of <b>water</b> vapor <b>scale</b> height for related meteorological researches...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of a vertically distributed source of buoyancy on the vertical stratification in a ventilated space, {{an important factor}} for determining indoor comfort when using displacement ventilation. A new theory describing the behaviour of this buoyancy source in a ventilated space was presented previous to this work, but experimental results were {{required in order to}} validate the theoretical and numerical modelling. The behaviour of this source of buoyancy on the stratification in a ventilated space is studied for a mechanically ventilated at steady-state and for a linearly stratified environment using salt water in a <b>water</b> <b>scale</b> model. The stratifications were measured using a traversing conductivity probe and then compared to theoretical predictions by numerically solving the plume equations for the new theory in Fortran. High quality measurements were produced, showing excellent repeatability for stratification measurements at steady-state with deviations of less than 1 %. Moreover, the linear stratifications had linear best fits up to R 2 = 0. 999 by using the double-bucket method. The theoretical predictions of the influence of the vertically distributed source correlate quantitatively with the mechanically ventilated experiments, showing good agreement to the strength of the ambient stratification, the position of the first front and the ventilation flow rate. The experimental results for the determination of the height of a horizontal intrusion of fluid into the linearly stratified environment were severely affected by the occurrence of gravity current at the ceiling of the ventilated space and comparisons to the new theory was not successful because of this. A two-layer stratification is observed where the upper layer had a weakly stratified density profile, instead of the multi-layer stratification predicted by previous researchers in their theoretical model. This discrepancy is due to smoothing and vertical turbulent mixing in the <b>water</b> <b>scale</b> model. It is recommended that the characteristic of the membrane that is used in the <b>water</b> <b>scale</b> model is investigated in relation to the gravity currents for future research. </p...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Contrary to usual mains-water practice, mixing {{in water}} storage tanks used in {{rainwater}} harvesting systems is undesirable because pathogen die-off {{can occur in}} the unmixed water prior to its extraction for use. The principal cause of mixing in these tanks is {{the momentum of the}} inflow during a rainfall event. We investigate the effect of inflow-jet configuration on the proportion of stored water in a tank which mixes with the slightly cooler inflow of rooftop <b>water.</b> <b>Scale</b> experiments are conducted which show that the non-dimensional height of the mixing front above the jet inlet is proportional to the inflow-jet densimetric Froude number for both single and multi-jet arrangements of various geometries. For each arrangement a coefficient of mixing is found. The results are then used to assess the level of mixing in full-scale rooftop rainwater harvesting storage tanks and determine whether residence time in such tanks is a viable strategy for pathogen reduction. For such applications, a radial manifold of jets outwardly directed from the tank centre is found to be the most promising...|$|E
