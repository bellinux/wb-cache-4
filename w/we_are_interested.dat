25|$|We live, they say, in The Information Age, yet {{almost none}} of the {{information}} we think we possess is true. Eskimos do not rub noses. The rickshaw was invented by an American. Joan of Arc was not French. Lenin was not Russian. The world is not solid, it is made of empty space and energy, and neither haggis, whisky, porridge, clan tartans or kilts are Scottish. So we stand, silent, on a peak in Darien a vast, rolling, teeming, untrodden territory before us. QI country. Whatever is interesting <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> in. Whatever is not interesting, we are even more interested in. Everything is interesting if looked at in the right way.

One-hundred thirteen participants completed an online survey about iPad use.
