5|$|Another one of Bowerman's pupils, Phil Knight, {{partnered with}} Bowerman and {{revolutionized}} the sport with {{the formation of}} the shoe company giant, Nike. Knight graduated from the University of Oregon in 1959 and went on to Stanford University for graduate school. There, he developed the idea to import Japanese running shoes to the American market. After earning his MBA from Stanford, he returned to the University of Oregon where he and Bowerman struck a handshake deal in 1964, each with a $500 investment into a company called Blue Ribbon Sports to import Japanese running shoes. In the late 1960s, Bowerman's pursuit of lighter shoes for his athletes led him to develop a sole by pouring rubber into his wife's <b>waffle</b> <b>iron,</b> inventing the modern running shoe. After Knight decided to rename the company Nike and develop its own shoes, Bowerman's invention became the prototype for the company. The shoe made its debut in the 1972 Olympic Trials at Hayward Field with Steve Prefontaine as one of the early endorsers. Although Bowerman retired from coaching in 1972, he remained on Nike's board until 1999. In that time, Nike exploded into a multibillion-dollar company.|$|E
25|$|Scandinavian style waffles, common {{throughout}} the Nordic countries, are thin, {{made in a}} heart-shaped <b>waffle</b> <b>iron.</b> The batter is similar to other varieties. The most common style are sweet, with whipped or sour cream and strawberry or raspberry jam, or berries, or simply sugar, on top.|$|E
25|$|Stroopwafels {{are thin}} waffles with a syrup filling. The stiff batter for the waffles {{is made from}} flour, butter, brown sugar, yeast, milk, and eggs. Medium-sized balls of batter are put on the <b>waffle</b> <b>iron.</b> When the waffle is baked {{and while it is}} still warm, it is cut into two halves. The warm filling, made from syrup is spread in between the waffle halves, which glues them together. They are popular in the Netherlands and Belgium and sold in pre-prepared {{packages}} in shops and markets.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>waffle</b> <b>irons</b> {{originated in}} the Low Countries around the 14th century. These <b>waffle</b> <b>irons</b> were constructed of two hinged iron plates connected to two long, wooden handles. The plates were often made to imprint elaborate patterns on the waffle, including coat of arms, landscapes, or religious symbols. The waffles would be baked over the hearth fire.|$|R
50|$|Traditional <b>waffle</b> <b>irons</b> are {{attached}} to tongs with wooden handles and are held over an open flame, or set on a stove. Most modern <b>waffle</b> <b>irons</b> are self-contained tabletop electrical appliances, heated by an electric heating element controlled by an internal thermostat. Professional waffle makers are usually made of cast iron whereas domestic models are often teflon coated. Many have a light that goes off when the iron is at the set temperature. Most modern <b>waffle</b> <b>irons</b> - particularly cast aluminum ones - are coated with a non-stick coating (e.g. teflon) to prevent the waffles from sticking to them. Cast-iron waffle makers are usually not coated and require seasoning like a cast-iron frying pan.|$|R

500|$|The waffle-iron filter is {{a variant}} of the corrugated-waveguide filter. [...] It has similar {{properties}} to that filter with the additional advantage that spurious TE20 and TE30 modes are suppressed. [...] In the waffle-iron filter, channels are cut through the ridges longitudinally down the filter. [...] This leaves a matrix of teeth protruding internally from the top and bottom surfaces of the waveguide. [...] This pattern of teeth resembles a <b>waffle</b> <b>iron,</b> hence the name of the filter.|$|E

2500|$|A waffle is a dish {{made from}} leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are {{patterned}} {{to give a}} characteristic size, shape and surface impression. There are many variations based {{on the type of}} <b>waffle</b> <b>iron</b> and recipe used. Waffles are eaten throughout the world, particularly in Belgium, which has over a dozen regional varieties. [...] Waffles may be made fresh or simply heated after having been commercially precooked and frozen.|$|E

50|$|Conventional planar control fins {{are shaped}} like {{miniature}} wings. By contrast, grid fins are a lattice of smaller aerodynamic surfaces arranged within a box. Their appearance has sometimes {{led them to}} be compared to potato mashers or <b>waffle</b> <b>irons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Toastmaster is a {{brand name}} for home appliances. It was {{originally}} (1921) {{the name of one}} of the world's first automatic electric toasters for home use, the Toastmaster Model 1-A-1. Since then the Toastmaster brand has been used {{on a wide range of}} small kitchen appliances, such as coffee makers, <b>waffle</b> <b>irons,</b> toasters, and blenders.|$|R
2500|$|Modern culinary writers {{distinguish}} between three general regional forms of Dutch cuisine. The {{regions in the}} northeast of the Netherlands, roughly the provinces of Groningen, Friesland, Drenthe, Overijssel and Gelderland north of the great rivers are the least populated area of the Netherlands. The late (18th century) introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats. The relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of game and husbandry, though dishes near the coastal regions of Friesland, Groningen and the parts of Overijssel bordering the IJsselmeer also include {{a large amount of}} fish. The various dried sausages, belonging to the metworst-family of Dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste. Also smoked sausages are common, of which (Gelderse) rookworst is the most renowned. The sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy. Larger sausages are often eaten alongside stamppot, hutspot or zuurkool (sauerkraut); whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a street food. The provinces are also home to hard textured rye bread, pastries and cookies, the latter heavily spiced with ginger or succade or contain small bits of meat. Various kinds of Kruidkoek (such as [...] ), [...] and [...] (small savory pancakes cooked in a <b>waffle</b> <b>iron)</b> are considered typical. Notable characteristics of Fries roggebrood (Frisian rye bread) is its long baking time (up to 20 hours), resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour. In terms of alcoholic beverages, the region is renowned for its many bitters (such as Beerenburg) and other high-proof liquors rather than beer, which is, apart from Jenever, typical {{for the rest of the}} country. As a coastal region, Friesland is home to low-lying grasslands, and thus has a cheese production in common with the Western cuisine. Friese Nagelkaas (Friesian Clove) is a notable example.|$|E

50|$|In Sweden {{the heart}} shaped <b>waffle</b> <b>iron</b> {{is the most}} common, but didn't come into {{existence}} until the 19th century. Since the 17th century Swedes were creating waffles over a fire with a <b>waffle</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|E
50|$|Griswold {{began making}} tobacco cutters in 1883. In 1884 Matthew Griswold {{patented}} and manufactured a wheeled spittoon. Over {{the years that}} followed the company added products such as kettles, Dutch ovens, roasters, a grid iron and other various pots and pans. Cast-iron stovetop <b>waffle</b> <b>irons</b> were one of the company's earliest and most successful products, manufactured into the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|Other {{appliances}} like pocket watches, <b>waffle</b> <b>irons,</b> sandwich toasters, krumkake irons, and the George Foreman Grill {{have long}} utilised a clamshell design; {{a very similar}} concept is used in racing and road legal cars, like the Ford GT40 and Ferrari Enzo, where the whole rear end can be lifted to access the engine compartment and suspension system.|$|R
50|$|Cast-iron {{cookware}} {{is valued}} for its heat retention properties, {{and can be}} produced and formed with a relatively low level of technology. Seasoning is used to protect bare cast iron from rust {{and to create a}} non-stick surface. Types of bare cast-iron cookware include panini presses, <b>waffle</b> <b>irons,</b> crepe makers, dutch ovens, frying pans, deep fryers, tetsubin, woks, potjies, karahi, flattop grills and griddles.|$|R
5000|$|In 1911, General Electric {{produced}} a prototype electric <b>waffle</b> <b>iron,</b> although production {{did not begin}} until around 1918. [...] Later, as the <b>waffle</b> <b>iron</b> became more prevalent, designers worked on making the appliance more attractive on the countertop.|$|E

In 1887 the company was reorganized and chartered as the Griswold Manufacturing Company.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the military production there was a smaller and varied production for civilian purposes. Moss Jernverk manufactured anvils, saw blades, saucepots, <b>waffle</b> <b>irons</b> and more. The iron work also made specially designed products; an example was an oven for producing sugar for a sugar refinery in Fredrikshald (Halden) in the 1750s. In the 19th century clothes iron were also produced. During Bernt Anker's time iron for drums was a major product, being also exported.|$|R
50|$|The Nevyansk Mechanical Plant, one of {{the older}} plants in the Yekaterinburg area, {{produced}} artillery shells and aircraft bombs for the military. During World War II, it produced a peak of a million howitzer shells a month, or 50 percent of the Red Army's needs. Today it produces industrial equipment, including presses of various kinds, and domestic fixtures such as furnaces, electric stove burners, and <b>waffle</b> <b>irons.</b> The plant reportedly ended all its military production during 1992.|$|R

50|$|Some small {{appliances}} perform {{the same or}} similar function as their larger counterparts. For example, a toaster oven is a small appliance that performs a similar function as an oven. Small appliances often have a home version and a commercial version, for example <b>waffle</b> <b>irons,</b> food processors, and blenders. The commercial, or industrial, version {{is designed to be}} used nearly continuously in a restaurant or other similar setting. Commercial appliances are typically connected to a more powerful electrical outlet, are larger and stronger, have more user-serviceable parts, and cost significantly more.|$|R
50|$|Small {{appliances}} {{are typically}} small household electrical machines,also very useful and easily carried and installed.
