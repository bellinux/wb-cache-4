25|$|As the President of India, I {{had lots}} of {{experiences}} that were full of pain and helplessness. There were occasions <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do nothing for people and for the nation. These experiences have pained me a lot. They have depressed me a lot. I have agonised because {{of the limitations of}} power. Power and the helplessness surrounding it are a peculiar tragedy, in fact.|$|E
500|$|Windle {{retired after}} the Games, noting that [...] "I have swum {{to that point}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly lift myself out of the water. I have seen John Konrads to that point also. I would always give 110%. There is no {{substitute}} for hard and honest work". Windle was usually regarded as the fittest and hardest-working member of the Australian swimming team. In retirement, Windle stayed in the United States for a few more years, working for Allis-Chalmers, an agricultural equipment corporation. He returned home after being transferred to the Australian division of the firm's operations. Windle was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1987 and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990.|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} later, he {{continued}} {{talking about the}} hosting gig at an interview for Playboy. There he said he told a producer, [...] "I don't know why you hired me, because you haven't given me anything. I just don't think this stuff's going to be good". He also said he felt [...] "kind of trapped in that material" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no way out". He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch. When Vilanch intimated that the busy actor appeared less than fully committed to the job, Franco posted a photo {{of the two of them}} together graffiti-ed saying [...] "James Fucked up the oscars. Trust me, I KNOW comedy. I mean, come on, I write for Bette Midler". Franco explained to Playboy that [...] "I personally do not do my best thinking when I'm angry. Before Twitter, I always had that buffer period <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> actually think and decide, Is this worth it? ... For me Twitter is a dangerous thing".|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I have lately {{been down}} yonder,’ said Mr. Grewgious, rearranging his skirts; ‘and {{that was what}} <b>I</b> {{referred}} to, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell you you are expected.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then with a shock, {{the ecstasy}} turned to agony and rage. I {{struggled}} to free myself but seemed only {{to increase the}} passion of the steps <b>I</b> moved to. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> shrieked <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only echo the notes of the rhythm.|$|R
6000|$|But {{my words}} were all unheeded, [...] Though I told the grave M.D. That the {{treatment}} really needed [...] Was {{a dip in}} open sea That was lapping just below me, [...] Smooth as silver, white as snow, And it took three men to throw me [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not go.|$|R
500|$|By May, Perot {{was leading}} presidential polls in both Texas and California. The Bush and Clinton campaigns became {{concerned}} about a candidacy, and publicly wondered if Perot could continue to [...] "play by his own rules". They attempted to downgrade Perot from his [...] "folk hero status" [...] {{to that of a}} politician, by highlighting his [...] "alleged character flaws". Meanwhile, Perot focused on sharpening his political positions as he promised. He hired John P. White, who served as a budget official under President Jimmy Carter, to work on his budget platform. Meanwhile, petition drives in every state reported that they had secured enough signatures to place Perot on the Election Day ballot. Speculation arose in the media that Perot would split the electoral college and force the United States House of Representatives to decide the presidency. Around this time, Hal Riney, who had worked on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign and was known for the [...] "Morning in America" [...] ad, was hired as advertising consultant. When Riney revealed the cost of advertisements during a meeting, Perot reportedly [...] "flipped out", and asked [...] "Why would I spend that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go on the 'Today' show for free?" [...] Riney produced several ads during the campaign that never aired.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} songs written for the album was [...] "Angel". McLachlan said that writing the song was easy, [...] "a real joyous occasion." [...] It was {{inspired}} by articles that she read in Rolling Stone about musicians who turned to heroin {{to cope with the}} pressures of the music industry and subsequently overdosed. She said that she identified with the feelings that might lead someone to use heroin: [...] "I've been in that place where you're so fucked up and you're so lost that you don't know who you are anymore, and you're miserable—and here's this escape route. I've never done heroin, but I've done plenty of other things to escape." [...] She said that the song is about [...] "trying not to take responsibility for other people's shit and trying to love yourself at the same time." [...] Another song that she found easy to write was [...] "Building a Mystery", co-written with her regular collaborator, Canadian musician and producer Pierre Marchand. Marchand heard her playing a guitar riff and suggested adding some lyrics that he had already written. They came up {{with the rest of the}} lyrics together, according to McLachlan, [...] "pretty darn quickly." [...] When the album was finished, McLachlan commented, [...] "I was so happy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> let it go. I didn't give it another thought when it was done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Campese further wrote that, [...] "In the World Cup {{match against}} South Africa, I kicked the ball {{three or four}} times <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have run. Maybe I was worried my speed was going, and that was {{affecting}} my confidence, especially to counterattack." ...|$|E
6000|$|Consider then, {{and judge}} {{me in this}} light; <b>I</b> told you <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not write; You said the same; and are you discontent With laws, to which you gave your own assent? [...] 30 Nay worse, to ask for verse at such a time! D' ye think me good for nothing but to rhyme? ...|$|R
60|$|Then with a shock, {{the ecstasy}} turned to agony and rage. I {{struggled}} to free myself but seemed only {{to increase the}} passion of the steps <b>I</b> moved to. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> shrieked <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only echo the notes of the rhythm. At last, with a movement of uncontrollable frenzy I broke back to consciousness and awoke.|$|R
60|$|The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. I did not {{retire to}} rest till late, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> did, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not sleep. He {{returned}} after midnight, and, {{instead of going}} to bed, shut himself into the room beneath. I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and descended. It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings.|$|R
2500|$|On August 24, 2011, Jobs {{announced}} his resignation as Apple's CEO, {{writing to the}} board, [...] "I have always said if there ever came a day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple's CEO, I {{would be the first}} to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come." [...] Jobs became chairman of the board and named Tim Cook as his successor as CEO. Jobs continued to work for Apple until the day before his death six weeks later.|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd {{graduated}} from high school when he was 15 and began studies at New York University, but left {{at the end of his}} sophomore year. [...] "All around me I could see the way the Depression was affecting everyone; for my family, for people in business like my father, it was a terrible time," [...] he wrote. [...] "I just wasn't going to stay in college, paying tuition to get a degree to be a lawyer, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see lawyers that had become taxi drivers." [...] Lloyd's father died in 1945, at age 55, [...] "broken by the world that he was living in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peel {{wrote that}} [...] "The Festive 50 {{dates back to}} what was doubtless a crisp September morning in the early-to-mid Seventies, when John Walters and I were musing on life in his uniquely squalid office. In our waggish way, we decided to mock the enthusiasm of the Radio 1 {{management}} of the time for programmes with alliterative titles. Content, we felt, was of less importance than a snappy Radio Times billing. In {{the course of our}} historic meeting we had, I imagine, some fine reasons for dismissing the idea of a Festive 40 and going instead for a Festive 50, a decision that was to ruin my Decembers for years to come, condemning me to night after night at home with a ledger, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have been out and about having fun, fun, fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I loved you; because, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{first saw}} you I saw {{the only man}} that was my master, and <b>I</b> rebelled; because, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help but love you, I knew I never had loved before, and I would wipe out with one stroke all the past that rose in {{judgment}} against me; because I would not have you ever confronted with one endearing word of mine that was not meant for you." ...|$|R
40|$|I LOOKED {{at myself}} in the mirror. 2 ̆ 2 Today, Susie, {{you are going to be}} beautiful/ 2 ̆ 7 It was really a rather {{doubtful}} hope. A round, baby-fat face stared back. Silver clippies held curls away from my face, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> smiled <b>I</b> <b>could</b> blind somebody if the sun hit my braces right. But I had decided. Today I was going to be beautiful [...] ...|$|R
60|$|Instantly {{the figure}} reappeared, {{and making a}} wide circuit, began to head me off. I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as <b>when</b> <b>I</b> rose, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary. From trunk to trunk the {{creature}} flitted like a deer, running manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping almost double as it ran. Yet a man it was, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> no longer be in doubt about that.|$|R
2500|$|Cao Cao then wrote a {{memorial}} to Emperor Xian: [...] "Army Libationer Guo Jia {{had served in the}} military for 11 years. There would be a discussion whenever we faced difficult situations, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not decide on what to do, {{he was the one who}} helped me arrive at my decisions. He has made great contributions in the pacification of the Empire. It is unfortunate that he died early and did not manage to complete his task. We should not forget his contributions. I suggest that his family be granted an additional 800 taxable households under their control, making it a total of 1,000 households." [...] The Wei Shu (魏書) recorded a longer memorial written by Cao Cao to Emperor Xian, requesting for Guo Jia to be honoured. Guo Jia was granted the posthumous title [...] "Marquis Zhen" [...] (貞侯), which literally means [...] "chaste marquis".|$|E
2500|$|Casanova gambled {{throughout}} his adult life, {{winning and losing}} large sums. He was tutored by professionals, and he was [...] "instructed in those wise maxims without which games of chance ruin those who participate in them". He was not above occasionally cheating and at times even teamed with professional gamblers for his own profit. Casanova claims that he was [...] "relaxed and smiling when I lost, and I won without covetousness". However, when outrageously duped himself, he could act violently, sometimes calling for a duel. Casanova admits {{that he was not}} disciplined enough to be a professional gambler: [...] "I had neither prudence enough to leave off when fortune was adverse, nor sufficient control over myself when I had won." [...] Nor did he like being considered as a professional gambler: [...] "Nothing could ever be adduced by professional gamblers that I was of their infernal clique." [...] Although Casanova at times used gambling tactically and shrewdly—for making quick money, for flirting, making connections, acting gallantly, or proving himself a gentleman among his social superiors—his practice also could be compulsive and reckless, especially during the euphoria of a new sexual affair. [...] "Why did I gamble when I felt the losses so keenly? What made me gamble was avarice. I loved to spend, and my heart bled <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not do it with money won at cards." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> answer {{he did not}} say them: [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> let {{him know}} How I would like to join in his {{journeys}} [...] Seldom he wished to go.

6000|$|... "Oh, he did, and mouths too. But {{from the}} beginning, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a child, I {{have known that}} he was dangerous, and I have thought that he would pass on and forget me after a while.

6000|$|... "There {{was a time}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> really <b>could</b> paint a bit. Not much, it's true, {{but enough}} to get along with. Well, I'm going to start it again in earnest now, and if I don't make good, well, there's always Hank's offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Looking for work!" [...] snorted Mrs. Wilkins with contempt; [...] "we women never 'ave much {{difficulty}} in finding it, I've noticed. There are times <b>when</b> <b>I</b> feel <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do with losing {{it for a}} day." ...|$|R

Ah, if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> [...] only make your dear heart ache one little minute of each day [...] as mine does every day and all day long, it might lead you [...] to show pity to your poor lonely one.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Miss Schuyler, [...] "though {{there was}} a time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wished <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> You can't help being pretty, but it ought to make you careful when you see another of them going that way again." ...|$|R

5000|$|Every day at {{the studio}} it was a lottery as to who would turn up and what - if any - {{positive}} contribution they would make when they did.

Then again, so did Andrew (Oldham) and just gave up on it. There were times <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done, too.|$|R
