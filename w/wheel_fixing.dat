25|$|Two <b>wheels</b> <b>fixed</b> to {{the same}} axle turn {{at the same speed}} as a vehicle goes around curves. This either forces one to slip, if possible, to balance the {{apparent}} distance covered, or creates uncomfortable and mechanically stressful wheel hop. To prevent this the wheels are allowed to turn at different speeds using a mechanical or hydraulic differential. This allows one driveshaft to independently drive two output shafts, axles that go from the differential to the wheel, at different speeds.|$|R

50|$|A {{positioning}} goniometer or goniometric {{stage is}} a device used to rotate an object precisely about a fixed axis in space. It {{is similar to}} a linear stage, however, rather than moving linearly with respect to its base, the stage platform rotates partially about a fixed axis above the mounting surface of the platform. Positioning goniometers typically use a worm drive with a partial worm <b>wheel</b> <b>fixed</b> to the underside of the stage platform meshing with a worm in the base.

5000|$|A {{rhumb line}} can be contrasted with a great circle, which is the path of {{shortest}} distance between two points {{on the surface of}} a sphere. On a great circle, the bearing to the destination point does not remain constant. If one were to drive a car along a great circle one would hold the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>fixed,</b> but to follow a rhumb line one would have to turn the wheel, turning it more sharply as the poles are approached. In other words, a great circle is locally [...] "straight" [...] with zero geodesic curvature, whereas a rhumb line has non-zero geodesic curvature.|$|R

25|$|A {{classical}} hunting oscillation is a swaying {{motion of}} a railway vehicle (often called truck hunting) {{caused by the}} coning action on which the directional stability of an adhesion railway depends. It arises from the interaction of adhesion forces and inertial forces. At low speed, adhesion dominates but, as the speed increases, the adhesion forces and inertial forces become comparable in magnitude and the oscillation begins at a critical speed. Above this speed, the motion can be violent, damaging track and wheels and potentially causing derailment. The problem does not occur on systems with a differential because the action depends on both wheels of a wheelset rotating at the same angular rate, although differentials tend to be rare, and conventional trains have their <b>wheels</b> <b>fixed</b> to the axles in pairs instead.|$|R
50|$|Adoption {{for greater}} volume {{assembly}} would require several modifications (or simplifications) to be performed. The novel, but ultimately troublesome in maintenance stratified charge ignition was removed, {{replaced by a}} standard ZMZ-402 engine. Another change was {{the location of the}} fuel tank and spare wheel. The original GAZ-24 had its tank under the boot, and the <b>wheel</b> <b>fixed</b> inside it, occupying a generous cargo volume. For the GAZ-3102, the fuel tank was moved behind the rear seat, and the spare took its place. Not only did this increase safety, but also ease of access at the petrol station (the hatch was located just below and slightly behind the C-pillar). For economical reasons, the GAZ-31029 retained the original configuration and in unifying the stamping forms, the 3102 was fitted with the older layout.|$|R

Firstly, it is pre-sented the kinematic models of the four common types of <b>wheels</b> (<b>fixed,</b> centered orientable, castor and Swedish) a classification of wheeled mobile robots. Afterwards, it is proposed a kinematic control scheme with three nested loops: dynamic, kinematic and planning. In particular, it is studied in depth the kinematic loop through the position control and the inverse kinematics of wheels. It is also studied indi-rectly the planning loop through the characterization of the references that each type of mobile robot can track with no error. Finally, the kinematic control proposed is applied to an industrial forklift in simu-lation and in a real situation.

50|$|A {{positioning}} goniometer or goniometric {{stage is}} a device used to rotate an object precisely (within a small angular range) about a fixed axis in space. Its appearance {{is similar to}} that of a linear stage. However, rather than moving linearly with respect to its base, the stage platform rotates partially about a fixed axis above the mounting surface of the platform. The distance of the center of rotation from the platform mounting surface is often chosen so that two different goniometer models may be stacked in an X-Y configuration and both stages will rotate about the same point. Positioning goniometers typically use a worm drive with a partial worm <b>wheel</b> <b>fixed</b> to the underside of the stage platform meshing with a worm in the base. The worm may be rotated manually or by a motor as in automated positioning systems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A {{three-dimensional}} {{dynamic model}} for simulating various motions of full vehicle is presented. The model has 16 independent {{degrees of freedom}} (DOF) consisting of three kinds of components; a vehicle body of 6 DOF, 4 independent suspensions equipped at {{every corner of the}} body, and 4 tire models linked with each suspension. The dynamic equations are represented in six coordinate frames such as world fixed coordinate, vehicle fixed coordinate, and four <b>wheel</b> <b>fixed</b> coordinate frames. Then these lead to the approximated prediction model of vehicle posture. Both lateral and longitudinal dynamics can be computed simultaneously under the conditions of which various inputs including steering command, driving torque, gravity, rolling resistance of tire, aerodynamic resistance, etc. are considered. It is shown through simulations that the proposed 3 D model can be useful for precise design and performance analysis of an...|$|R
