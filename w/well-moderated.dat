50|$|The General Assembly {{encompasses}} all 193 Members of the United Nations, posing {{this unique}} forum at the deliberative, policymaking, and representative {{core of the}} UN. Established under the original 1945 Charter of the UN, the GA was conceived alongside {{the birth of the}} UN and captures the all-encompassing spirit of multilateral discussion that motivated the formation of its parent international organization. Because of the organ’s inclusiveness, and therefore far-reaching influence, GA resolutions have often taken on the role of landmark documents reflecting UN commitment to international issues and serving as a manifesto for solving these issues. At WorldMUN, the GA is distinguished by <b>well-moderated,</b> fluid debate; passionate delegates; and necessarily intense and productive caucusing to forge broad alliances to sustain innovative draft resolutions.|$|E
30|$|A {{retrospective}} {{review of}} the prospectively maintained database at Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, China, was conducted. Three hundred seventy-one (331 males) HCC patients treated with LT between 2001 and 2011 were enrolled. The mean age of patients in our sample was 48  years (range 16 – 65  years). All HCC diagnoses were based on histology results. The mean follow-up time was 32.43  months (range 0.03 – 146.60  months). The follow-up included alpha-fetoprotein and an ultrasound one to four times each month, and a thoracic-abdominal computer tomography scan every 3.0 – 6.0  months during the first 2.0  years and annually thereafter. Patients with HCC fulfilling Hangzhou criteria (Xu et al. 2016) (tumour burden ≤ 8  cm regardless of AFP and differentiation, or tumour burden > 8  cm but AFP ≤ 400  ng/mL and <b>well-moderate</b> differentiation) who received LT {{were included in the}} study. Although this study included patients using Hangzhou criteria rather than Milan criteria as previous studies (Fuks et al. 2012; Sala et al. 2004; Ferrer-Fabrega et al. 2016), stratification analysis using Milan criteria was conducted. The exclusion criteria were (1) had undergone LT more than once; (2) had living donors or split-liver donors; (3) diagnosed with other malignancies in addition to HCC (cholangiocarcinoma, carcinoma of gallbladder, or mixed carcinoma); (4) had transplantation without recurrence after liver resection for HCC; (5) had tumor thrombosis of the main trunk of blood vessel (portal vein and hepatic vein); or (6) had missing pathology data.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Radiomics {{has shown}} great promise to use {{quantifiable}} imaging characteristics {{to predict the}} behavior and prognosis of neoplasms. This is the first study to evaluate whether radiomic texture analysis can predict outcomes in gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GEJAC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Materials and Methods: Pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT images of 146 patients with stage II-III GEJAC were reviewed (2009 – 2011), and randomly split into training and validation groups at a 1 : 1 ratio stratified with baseline clinical characteristics. Whole-tumor texture was assessed using quantitative image features based on intensity, shape, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix. The relevant pretreatment texture features, {{in addition to the}} significant baseline clinical features to predict survival, were identified using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model with stepwise variable selection in the training sample and verified in the validation sample, to facilitate the proposal of a multi-point index for standard patient pre-treatment risk classification. Results: Of the factors identified in the training cohort independently associated with OS, only shape compactness (p =  0. 04) and pathologic grade differentiation (PDG) (p =  0. 02) were confirmed in the validation sample. Using both parameters, we created a 3 -point risk classification index: low-risk (<b>well-moderate</b> PDG and high compactness), medium-risk (poor PDG or low compactness), and high-risk (poor PDG and low compactness). The risk index showed a strong negative association with postoperative pathologic complete response (pCR) (p =  0. 04). Median OS for the high-, medium-, and low-risk groups were 23, 51, and ≥ 72  months, respectively (p <  0. 01). Similar results were seen with progression-free survival (respective 5 -year rates of 15 %, 30 %, and 63 %). Conclusion: Radiomic texture analysis can be used to stratify patients with GEJAC receiving trimodality therapy based on prognosis. The risk scoring system based on shape compactness and PDG shows a great potential for pre-treatment risk classification to guide surgical resection in locally advanced disease. Though in need of greater validation, these hypothesis-generating data could provide a unique platform of personalized oncologic care...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Myelin {{transcription}} factor 1 (MYT 1) and its homologue MYT 1 -like (MYT 1 L) {{are the two}} main members of MYT/NZF family {{transcription factor}}s, which are highly related, share {{a high degree of}} identity and show similar regulatory functions in neural development. There are evidences from several cytology experiments showing that MYT 1 is associated with carcinoma. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we genotyped 944 surgically resected gastric cancer patients by the SNaPshot method to explore the association of MYT 1 L rs 17039396 polymorphism with survival of gastric cancer in a Chinese population. We found that cardia cancer patients carrying MYT 1 L rs 17039396 GG genotype survived for a significantly shorter time than those carrying the GA genotype. This significance was enhanced in the dominant model (GG vs. GA/AA, log-rank P =  0. 001), suggesting a potential protect role of the variant A allele. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that the AG/GG genotypes were associated with a significantly decreased risk of death from gastric cancer (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)  =  0. 57, 95 % confidence interval (CI)  =  0. 40 - 0. 81). Stratification analyses further showed that such protective effect was statistically significant in subgroups of patients with tumor size ≤ 5 cm (adjusted HR =  0. 34, 95 %CI =  0. 19 - 0. 64), <b>well-moderate</b> gastric cancer (adjusted HR =  0. 59, 95 %CI =  0. 35 - 0. 98), no lymph-node metastasis (adjusted HR =  0. 49, 95 %CI =  0. 31 - 0. 76), no distant metastasis (adjusted HR =  0. 59, 95 %CI =  0. 41 - 0. 84). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, these data represents the first demonstration that MYT 1 L rs 17039396 variants could indentified as a favorable prognostic indicator for gastric cancer, particularly among the cardia gastric cancer. Further validation in other larger studies with different ethnic populations and functional evaluations are needed...|$|R
