5|$|More broadly, one {{hallmark}} of the 1950s {{was the beginning of}} European integration—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, economically, and militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his presidency, Houphouët-Boigny {{maintained}} {{a close relationship}} with France, a policy known as Françafrique, and he built a close friendship with Jacques Foccart, the chief adviser on African policy in the de Gaulle and Pompidou governments. He aided the conspirators who ousted Kwame Nkrumah from power in Ghana in 1966, took part in the failed coup against Mathieu Kérékou in Benin in 1977, and was suspected of involvement in the 1987 coup that removed Thomas Sankara from power in Burkina Faso. Houphouët-Boigny {{maintained a}} strong anti-communist foreign policy, which resulted in, among other things, severing diplomatic relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> in 1969 (after first establishing relations in 1967) and refusing to recognise the People's Republic of China until 1983. He provided assistance to UNITA, a United States-supported, anti-communist rebel movement in Angola. In 1986 he re-established relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> shortly before the fall of its confederation.|$|E
5|$|By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had {{disengaged}} from Yemen. South Yemen {{formed a}} connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b> In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power {{was given to}} Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along {{the border between the}} states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} World War II to {{his death}} in April 1985, Enver Hoxha pursued a style of {{politics}} informed by hardline Stalinism as well as elements of Maoism. He broke <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> after Nikita Khrushchev embarked on his reformist Khrushchev Thaw, withdrew Albania from the Warsaw Pact in 1968 in protest of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, and broke with the People's Republic of China after U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, when Syria was a French mandate, it was {{proposed}} {{to build a}} dam in the Euphrates near the Syro–Turkish border. After Syria became independent in 1946, the feasibility of this proposal was re-investigated, but the plan was not carried out. In 1957, the Syrian government reached an agreement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> for technical and financial aid {{for the construction of}} a dam in the Euphrates. Syria, as part of the United Arab Republic (UAR), signed an agreement with West Germany in 1960 for a loan to finance the construction of the dam. After Syria left the UAR in 1961, a new agreement about the financing of the dam was reached <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> in 1965. A special government department was created in 1961 to oversee the construction of the dam. In the early 1960s Swedish geomorphologist Åke Sundborg worked as advisor in the dam project with the task of estimating the amount and fate of sediments that would enter into the dam. Sundborg developed for this purpose a mathematical model on the prognosed growth of a river delta in the dam.|$|E
5|$|International {{recognition}} {{of the new government}} did not prove to be difficult. The Western powers were not pleased with the Third Seimas when it ratified the non-aggression treaty <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> in September. They were looking for a government that would change the priorities of Lithuanian foreign policy. It was therefore not surprising that the British Daily Telegraph, the French Le Matin, and the United States' New York Times wrote that the coup was expected to curtail the move towards friendly relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> and normalize relations with Poland; the anti-democratic and unconstitutional nature of the coup was not emphasized. The Western press reported the news calmly, or assessed it as a positive development in the Lithuanian struggle against Bolshevism. International diplomatic opinion held that a strong authoritarian leader would provide internal stability, and that even during the earlier years of the republic Lithuania had not been genuinely democratic, since many essential freedoms were curtailed under martial law.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|Relations with France were {{important}} after World War I {{and in the}} 1920s, as France {{played a leading role}} in the new European security arrangements. In the 1930s France started to fear the rise of Nazi Germany and initiated a rapprochement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> which strained Franco-Finnish relations. However, during the Winter War France was one of the most important suppliers of military materiel.|$|E
5|$|The Germans reaffirmed their {{alliance}} with Italy and signed non-aggression pacts with Denmark, Estonia and Latvia whilst trade links were formalised with Romania, Norway and Sweden. Hitler's foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop arranged in negotiations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> a non-aggression pact, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which {{was signed in}} August 1939. The treaty also contained secret protocols dividing Poland and the Baltic states into German and Soviet spheres of influence.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} {{changed after}} {{the outbreak of}} World War II. Poland was invaded in September 1939. Great Britain became involved, {{and a series of}} German victories in Denmark, Norway, and the Netherlands during spring 1940 were alarming. Britain was clearly threatened and its leadership discussed the possibility of an alliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b> Under the circumstances, direct British confrontation over the Baltic issue was difficult.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the Polish-Romanian Alliance (part of the Little Entente), Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of appeasement evident in those countries' signing of the Locarno Treaties. Piłsudski therefore aimed also to maintain good relations <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> and Germany; hence Poland signed non-aggression pacts with both its powerful neighbors: the 1932 Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and the 1934 German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. The two treaties were meant to strengthen Poland's position {{in the eyes of}} its allies and neighbors.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 32 nations sent athletes to Cortina d'Ampezzo.

Korea, Liechtenstein, and Turkey returned after having missed the 1952 Winter Olympics, while Argentina, Denmark, New Zealand, and Portugal did not compete at these Games, after having participated in the previous edition. Athletes from West Germany (FRG) and East Germany (GDR) competed together as the United Team of Germany, an arrangement that would continue for the following two Olympiads.|$|E

5|$|After Blake's funeral, Manhattan {{is accused}} on {{national}} television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues.

5|$|Alves and Van-Dunem {{planned to}} arrest Neto on 21 May before {{he arrived at}} a meeting of the Central Committee and before the {{commission}} released its report on the activities of the Nitistas. However, the MPLA changed the location of the meeting shortly before its scheduled start, throwing the plotters' plans into disarray, but Alves attended the meeting and faced the commission anyway. The commission released its report, accusing him of factionalism. Alves fought back, denouncing Neto for not aligning Angola <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union.</b> After twelve hours of debate, the party voted 26 to 6 to dismiss Alves and Van-Dunem from their positions.|$|E
5|$|By 1986, Angola {{began to}} assume a more {{central role in the}} Cold War, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> Cuba and other Eastern bloc nations {{enhancing}} support for the MPLA government, and American conservatives beginning to elevate their support for Savimbi's UNITA. Savimbi developed close relations with influential American conservatives, who saw Savimbi as a key ally in the U.S. effort to oppose and rollback Soviet-backed, undemocratic governments around the world. The conflict quickly escalated, with both Washington and Moscow seeing it as a critical strategic conflict in the Cold War.|$|E
