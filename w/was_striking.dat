5|$|The {{passage of}} the Mint Act was {{followed}} by the establishment in Philadelphia of the Mint, which by 1793 <b>was</b> <b>striking</b> cents and half cents. Coinage of precious metal pieces was delayed; Congress had required that the assayer and chief coiner each post a security bond of $10,000, a huge sum in those days. In 1794, Congress lowered the chief coiner's bond to $5,000 and the assayer's to $1,000, and President Washington's appointees to those positions were able to qualify and take office. Silver coinage began that year.|$|E
5|$|Cotes' {{ship was}} fit only to sail with the wind, {{and the captain}} urged his men to make greater efforts to repair their ship before Uranie {{could come up with}} them again. So engrossed was the British crew with their repairs that it was not until 16:00 that it was {{realised}} that the French frigate was no longer holding station within sight, and had completely disappeared. This led some on the British ship to assume that Uranie had sunk, although in fact the ship had simply turned away {{in an effort to make}} it back to Rochefort to repair the damage suffered in the engagement. Also apparent were a number of sails in the distance. These rapidly approached and were revealed to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unable to manoeuvre his ship or respond to the new arrivals, which were soon identified as French vessels wearing false flags. The leading frigate pulled up close to Thames and fired a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes immediately hailed the French, announcing that he was in no position to fight them due to the damage his ship had suffered and that he <b>was</b> <b>striking</b> his flag.|$|E
5|$|The Bicentennial dollars {{were the}} first of the three {{denominations}} to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975. The silver pieces were struck at San Francisco beginning on April 23, 1975. The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar <b>was</b> <b>striking</b> indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. Brooks called a halt in production to allow Gasparro to modify the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II. The first Bicentennial dollars were released into circulation on October 13, 1975. Over 220 million were struck. The Bicentennial design was not used after 1976; sets of silver clad Bicentennial coins were sold by the Mint until sales were finally closed at the end of 1986.|$|E

5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint <b>was</b> <b>striking</b> the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for the melting pot above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of major dams along its route, the Colorado River fed one of the largest desert estuaries in the world. Spread across the northernmost end of the Gulf of California, the Colorado River delta’s vast riparian, freshwater, brackish, and tidal wetlands once covered 7,810km² (1,930,000 acres) and supported a large population of plant, bird, aquatic, and terrestrial life. Because most of the river’s flow reached the delta at that time, its freshwater, silt, and nutrients helped create and sustain a complex system of estuarial wetlands that provided feeding and nesting grounds for birds, and spawning habitat for fish and marine mammals. In contrast to the surrounding Sonoran Desert, the Colorado River delta’s abundance <b>was</b> <b>striking.</b>|$|E
25|$|While most fighters utilize ground-and-pound statically, by way {{of holding}} their opponents down and mauling them with short strikes from the top position, a few fighters manage to utilize it {{dynamically}} by striking their opponents while changing positions, thus not allowing their opponents to settle once they take them down. Cain Velasquez {{is one of the}} most devastating ground strikers in MMA. He attacks his opponents on the ground while transitioning between positions. Whether he's moving from mount to back mount or from turtle to side control, he is constantly landing shots. Fedor Emelianenko, considered the greatest master of ground-and-pound in MMA history, was the first to demonstrate this dynamic style of striking in transition. He <b>was</b> <b>striking</b> his opponents on the ground while passing guard or while his opponents were attempting to recover guard.|$|E
25|$|The very swift moving tornado {{at times}} {{exhibited}} an unusual appearance due partially to {{its size and}} the probable low cloud base of its parent thunderstorm. The tornado was frequently described by witnesses as an amorphous rolling fog or boiling clouds on the ground, and fooled normally weather-wise farm owners (in addition to people in general) who did not sense the danger until the storm was upon them. The condensation funnel was also reportedly sometimes wrapped in copious dust and debris, making it obscured and less recognizable. The parent supercell apparently transitioned to a high-precipitation (HP) variety {{by the time it}} <b>was</b> <b>striking</b> West Frankfort, meaning that the tornado wasn't readily visible, as it was often shrouded in heavy rain and hail. The rural death toll of 65 in Hamilton and White counties in southeastern Illinois is unprecedented. The tornado killed at least twenty farm owners in southeastern Illinois and southwestern Indiana, more than the combined total of the next four deadliest tornadoes {{in the history of the}} U.S.|$|E

He had coincidentally auditioned for Clark Kent in the television series Smallville, but lost to Tom Welling. [...] Routh had also met director Joseph [...] "McG" [...] Nichol for the role during pre-production of [...] Dana Reeve, wife of Christopher Reeve, believed Routh's physical resemblance to her late husband <b>was</b> <b>striking.</b> To obtain the muscular physique to play Superman convincingly, Routh underwent a strict bodybuilding exercise regimen.

500|$|Madonna's first live {{performance}} of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] {{was at the}} 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. She started the performance by descending from a flight of stairs, wearing a pin-striped suit and a monocle. Later she removed the coat to reveal her bustier, and together with her backup singers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory, performed a dance routine called voguing. Ian Inglis, author of Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time noted that the historical importance of Madonna's performance at the Video Music Awards {{was due to the}} televisual venue. Inglis explained that since Madonna's performance <b>was</b> <b>striking</b> primarily as a high-energy, provocatively choreographed, dance production number, it went on to highlight the 'TV' part of MTV, and in a way heralded her and the network as a cultural arbiter.|$|E

500|$|Scott and Zelda {{quickly became}} celebrities of New York, {{as much for}} their wild {{behavior}} as {{for the success of}} This Side of Paradise. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness. Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square. Another example of their behavior was when Dorothy Parker first met them, as Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, [...] "They did both look as though they had just stepped out of the sun; their youth <b>was</b> <b>striking.</b> Everyone wanted to meet him." [...] Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, {{in the pages of the}} New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—enfants terribles of the Jazz Age.|$|E
500|$|While Typhoon Ida <b>was</b> <b>striking</b> Japan, it {{produced}} heavy rainfall that reached [...] on Mount Amagi on the Izu Peninsula. In {{the capital city}} of Tokyo, the storm dropped almost 430mm (17in) of rainfall, which was the highest daily total since record-keeping began in 1876. Across the country, the rains caused flooding along the Kano, Merugo, and Arakawa rivers; the flooding of the Kano River destroyed to villages along the Izu Peninsula. The rains resulted in at least 1,900 landslides, including 786 in the Tokyo area. There was a storm tide of [...] in Chiba, which flooded 120,000 acres of rice fields.

500|$|Richards' {{passion for}} poetry and {{literary}} studies again stood out on Strange Bird. John D. Luerssen of Rolling Stone said [...] "poetry aficionado Richards puts his own literary stamp" [...] on the album, and James Christopher Monger of Allmusic said the album contained [...] "pastoral beauty, labyrinthine arrangements, and breathtaking prose". Pitchfork Media's Joe Tangari described the album as [...] "so stuffed with ideas and instruments that it's wont to rupture {{from time to}} time". This was both a positive and negative criticism; Tangari complained that at times [...] "there is a surplus of sound", but {{also said that the}} combination of the first two tracks—"The Vineyard" [...] ("slow beauty") and [...] "This Train Will Be Taking No Passengers" [...] ("a wailing rockabilly psych raver")—was an excellent set-up. Derek Miller of Stylus Magazine called the opening trio—the third song being the [...] "simple acoustic guitar and arcing piano" [...] of [...] "Little Wonder"—bewildering, and that the album remained consistently as such throughout. PopMatters' Zeth Lundy described Richards' wordplay as frenzied, and said the [...] "refined, worldly wit" [...] on Strange Bird <b>was</b> <b>striking.</b>|$|E
