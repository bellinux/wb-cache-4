5|$|The {{resulting}} 0.021572 is positive, so one <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{the euro}} is trading at a 0.021572 or 2.16% premium {{against the dollar}} for delivery in 30 days. Conversely, {{if one were to}} work this example in euro terms rather than dollar terms, the perspective would be reversed and one <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the dollar is trading at a discount against the Euro.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} celebrity of sorts at Michigan. He was {{mentioned}} in several issues of Time magazine, and his wedding was even {{announced in the}} magazine. In addition, his time at Michigan defined an era {{in a way that}} became a permanent reference because his contemporaries <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> they were at Michigan in the Chappuis years. In 1988, he was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The First Triumvirate did {{not approve}} {{the use of the}} flag created in Rosario, but Belgrano was {{initially}} unaware of that. He had the flag blessed by the priest Juan Ignacio de Gorriti at Salta, on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. When he found out the flag was not approved, he put it away. When asked, he <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he was keeping it for a great victory.|$|E
5000|$|Using possessive forms {{like that}} is the Lamborghini of Patrick instead {{of the use of}} an {{apostrophe}} to indicate possession. <b>Saying</b> <b>that</b> Lamborghini is Patrick's is a marked improvement, and a native English speaker <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that's</b> Patrick's Lamborghini.|$|R

5|$|In May 1945, when Nazi Germany surrendered, and {{the initial}} {{motivation}} for the crash atomic bomb project dissipated as {{it was discovered that}} the German nuclear energy project was years behind, Wilson raised the question of whether they should continue with their work. News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. In later life, when interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary The Day After Trinity (1980), Wilson <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he should have strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany, and regretted not doing so to some extent.|$|E
25|$|Whereas legal {{positivism}} <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a law can be unjust {{without it}} being any less a law, a natural law jurisprudence <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{there is something}} legally deficient about an unjust norm. Legal interpretivism, famously defended in the English-speaking world by Ronald Dworkin, claims to have a position different from both natural law and positivism.|$|E

At the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference, Burgess said he favored covering fewer Americans with health insurance. Burgess said, “If the numbers drop, I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that’s</b> a good thing, because we’ve restored personal liberty in this country.” ...|$|R

Kellerman states that [...] "when a Swede says something like Jay-Z <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that's</b> automatically funny. It's still white here, but in Sweden, it's funnier.

25|$|The {{fact that}} anybody <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{impeachment}} {{is off the}} table {{when we have a}} president who has been so egregious in his violations of our constitution, a president who asserts a unitary executive power, that is absolutely chilling.|$|E
25|$|Thomist ethics {{hold that}} it is {{necessary}} to observe both circumstances and intention to determine an action's moral value, and therefore Aquinas cannot be said to be strictly either a deontologicalist or a consequentialist. Rather, he <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> an action is morally good if it fulfills God's antecedent will.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, the Gemara {{suggested}} that both teachings were {{in accord with}} the Rabbis. In the first case, the synagogue referred to has a dwelling, and then even the Rabbis <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it would be subject to house plagues. In the other case, the synagogue referred to has no dwelling, and so would not be subject to house plagues.|$|E
25|$|Conservative Judaism {{has always}} been premised on the total embrace of {{critical}} inquiry and science. More than being compatible with Conservative Judaism, I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it is a mitzvah {{to learn about the}} world and the way it works {{to the best of our}} abilities, since that is to marvel with awe at God's handiwork. To not do so is sinful.|$|E
25|$|In a work by Lê Quý Đôn called Phủ biên tạp lục (1776), many Nha Trang-related {{names were}} mentioned, such as đầm Nha Trang, dinh Nha Trang, nguồn Nha Trang, and đèo Nha Trang.

25|$|In conclusion, I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> however {{great the}} {{scientific}} {{importance of this}} discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, {{and that it will}} continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} of text {{as belonging to}} the triple tradition (or for that matter, double tradition) is not always definitive, depending rather {{on the degree of}} similarity demanded. For example, Matthew and Mark report the cursing of the fig tree, clearly a single incident, despite some substantial differences of wording and content. Searching Luke, however, we find only the parable of the barren fig tree, in a different point of the narrative. Some <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Luke has extensively adapted an element of the triple tradition, while others would regard it as a distinct pericope.|$|E
25|$|Some Canadian Members of Parliament saw the {{movement}} to entrench a charter as contrary to the British model of Parliamentary supremacy. Others <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) has now limited British parliamentary power {{to a greater degree}} than the Canadian Charter limited the power of the Canadian Parliament and provincial legislatures. Hogg has speculated that the British adopted the Human Rights Act 1998, which allows the ECHR to be enforced directly in domestic courts, partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian Charter.|$|E

25|$|A summability method M is regular if it {{agrees with}} the actual limit on all {{convergent}} series. Such a result is called an Abelian theorem for M, from the prototypical Abel's theorem. More interesting, and in general more subtle, are partial converse results, called tauberian theorems, from a prototype proved by Alfred Tauber. Here partial converse means that if M sums the series Σ, and some side-condition holds, then Σ was convergent in the first place; without any side-condition such a result <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> M only summed convergent series (making it useless as a summation method for divergent series).|$|E
25|$|Survivors have {{testified that}} the {{transmission}} of the HIV virus was a deliberate act by talking about how the men, before they raped them, <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{they were not going}} to kill them directly but rather give them a slow death from AIDS. Two-thirds of a sample of 1,200 Rwandan genocide widows tested positive for HIV, and the infection rates in rural areas more than doubled after the genocide. There is no data on the number of victims who died from AIDS after 1994 who had contracted the disease from having been raped during the genocide.|$|E
25|$|However, {{concerning}} the legend that cats could speak, {{it has been}} pointed out {{that it may have}} arisen because humans would misinterpret the cat's meowing as human language, and for this reason some <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the cat is not a type of yōkai. In 1992 (Heisei 4), in the Yomiuri newspaper, there was an article that argued that when people thought they had heard a cat speak, upon listening a second time, they realized that it was simply the cat's meowing and that it was only coincidence that it resembled a word in human language.|$|E
