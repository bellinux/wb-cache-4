2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered,</b> <b>the</b> place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E

50|$|This book, {{written by}} the empress, is capable of being an example to generations. It is not that I {{do not know the}} will of heaven and mourn uselessly, but now, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> palace, <b>I</b> can no longer hear her {{corrective}} words. I have lost a wonderful help, and I cannot forget her.|$|R
60|$|Sir John was dozing, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> room. He roused {{himself at}} the sight of me.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> room, I found Miss Halcombe and {{an elderly}} lady {{seated at the}} luncheon-table.|$|E
60|$|Such was {{the strange}} {{domestic}} position of this interesting creature, {{at the time}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> house.|$|E
60|$|The armory at {{the first}} floor was vacant <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> it, <b>the</b> last of the Okarians having fled into the courtyard, so none saw me {{continue}} down the spiral toward the corridor beneath.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} tools that systems {{engineers}} use in today's space programs. In {{my time in}} the Commercial Crew Program I sought to improve one of the vital tools for the verification and validation team. This was my main project but {{only a small part}} of what I have done in the department. I have also had the chance to learn from the best and see actual hardware, this real world experience will help me be a better aerospace engineer <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> workforce. <b>I</b> look forward to seeing the Commercial Crew Program progress to launch...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> it, <b>the</b> follies of {{the world}} {{abandoned}} me at the door. I felt no inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings. My mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> hall, an Officer on the {{platform}} was engaged in offering up an extempore prayer.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> bedchamber, {{and softly}} {{approached}} the bedside by the dim flicker of the night-lamp, {{my wife was}} asleep.|$|E
60|$|It {{was five}} minutes past nine <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> great salon {{of the hotel}} and looked round for Lord Langerdale.|$|E
6000|$|I next {{went into}} a store a few doors farther up <b>the</b> street. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>I</b> {{approached}} <b>the</b> [...] "floor-walker," [...] and handing him my sample, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! Be it so. But do {{not think}} I am the man to suffer myself {{to be sent to}} the gallows upon such paltry {{evidence}} as satisfies that lady. If any accuser comes to bleat of a trail of blood reaching to my door, and of certain words I spoke yesterday in anger, I will take my trial--but it shall be trial by battle upon the body of my accuser. That is my right, and I will have every ounce of it. Do you doubt how God will pronounce? I call upon him solemnly to pronounce between me and such an one. If I am guilty of this thing may He wither my arm <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> lists." ...|$|R
60|$|So now <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> {{bedroom with}} the tray, {{on my arm}} is that badge of pride, the towel; and I {{approach}} with prim steps to inform Madam that breakfast is ready, and she puts on the society manner and addresses me as ‘Sir,’ and asks with cruel sarcasm for what purpose (except to boast) I carry the towel, and I say ‘Is there anything more I can do for Madam?’ and Madam replies {{that there is one}} more thing I can do, and that is, eat her breakfast for her. But of this I take no notice, for my object is to fire her with the spirit of the game, so that she eats unwittingly.|$|R
60|$|Leslie started <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> room, {{but seeing}} only me, {{he leaned forward}} again, resting his arms on his knees, looking in the fire.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> cave, Bludger fell a-trembling {{so violently}} {{that he could}} not speak. He seemed in the utmost alarm, his face quite ashen with terror.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] I answered, [...] "or I {{should have}} gone without my breakfast. You have no {{placards}} posted to that effect, nor was I so informed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can imagine}} what agony <b>I</b> felt <b>when,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> open space, <b>I</b> saw a surging mass of Sepoys, and no sign of any of you; and how I cursed my own folly, and what delight I felt, as on cutting our way through we found that you were still on your feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|My touch {{seemed to}} have the same effect on her which the sound of my voice had {{produced}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> room. After she had said the word which called me a coward, after she had made the avowal which branded me as a thief--while her hand lay in mine I was her master still! ...|$|R
60|$|She drew herself away half-frightened, half-confused--certainly not offended, and, apparently, {{not very}} likely to faint--which was more than I could have said of her <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> room. Before she had {{time to reflect on}} the peril and awkwardness of our position, I pressed the first {{necessary}} questions on her rapidly, one after the other.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have met}} somewhere (perhaps in my {{historical}} reading) with the expression: [...] "A chain of events." [...] Was I {{at the beginning}} of that chain, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> railway carriage on my journey home? ...|$|E
60|$|I nodded, {{and left}} her on the pretext of a summons from another table. Something in Guest's look {{had told me that}} he wished to speak to me. He was taking off his {{overcoat}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> office.|$|E
60|$|I had waited, {{surprised}} by my first {{view of the}} woman writing in my book. Having answered her to this effect, I asked {{what she had done}} or dreamed of doing at the later moment <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> summer-house.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{expected}} a city {{as beautiful as}} it was grand, of an imposing appearance, where you saw only superb streets, and palaces of marble and gold. Instead, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> by <b>the</b> Faubourg Saint-Marceau, I saw only narrow, dirty and foul-smelling streets, and villainous black houses, {{with an air of}} unhealthiness; beggars, poverty; wagons-drivers, menders of old garments; and vendors of tea and old hats." ...|$|R
60|$|All at once I {{seemed to}} be acting without reason, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> at last <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> grounds of the deserted caravansary, there were no evidences to justify my suspicions.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> Napoleon <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Po Valley {{during some}} of his {{brightest}} campaigns (1796 and 1800, culminating in the historical Battle of Marengo), he found an advanced country and made it into his Kingdom of Italy. With Napoleon's final defeat the Austrians came back, but they were no more welcome. In the west,in Piedmont, the Savoy dynasty would emerge {{to serve as a}} springboard for Italian unification.|$|R
60|$|Naturally I am kind-hearted, and so I {{found it}} beyond {{me to leave}} even this hateful and repulsive thing alone in a strange and hostile world. The result was that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> iron mole I took her with me.|$|E
60|$|The two {{old friends}} and {{partners}} were {{waiting for me to}} join them at their early German supper. Specimens of Mr. Engelman's flowers adorned the table in honor of my arrival. He presented me with a rose from the nosegay <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> hold, {{the stench}} of which was almost overpowering, I could see nothing in the dim light, but I could hear the wild {{clattering}} of hoofs on wooden floors, the little shrieks of irrepressible fury, and the deep firmly uttered command--such as:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The breakfast-room {{proved to}} be empty <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>entered</b> it <b>the</b> next morning. It {{was the first time}} in my {{experience}} that I had failed to find Mr. Keller established at the table. He had hitherto set the example of early rising to his partner and to myself. I had barely noticed his absence, when Mr. Engelman followed me into the room with a grave and anxious face, which proclaimed that something was amiss.|$|R
5000|$|In his autobiographical reminiscences on {{his school}} days, Warren Burton recounted that he [...] "was {{three years and}} a half old <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> Old School-house as an abecedarian".Many young {{children}} were simply sent along with other siblings {{in order to get}} them out of their mothers' way. Noah Webster's early school dictionary contains the following entry for abecedarian: A-be-ce-da'-ri-an, n. One who teaches or is learning the alphabet.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> {{church and}} closed the heavy door behind me, the sense of {{darkness}} and loneliness in all their horror enfolded me round. The great church seemed a living mystery, and served as an almost terrible background to thoughts and remembrances of unutterable gloom. My adventurous life has had its own schooling to endurance and upholding one's courage in trying times; but it has its contra in fulness of memory.|$|R
