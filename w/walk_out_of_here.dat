[...] After one year at Wagner, Siedlecki spent seven years at Lafayette and served as both defensive and offensive coordinator. [...] Siedlecki and Harvard head coach Tim Murphy were roommates as assistant coaches at Lafayette.|$|R

[...] I began to be of the same mind; so we went out together, and I carried him a way which none knew but myself, and where the trees were so thick set, as that it was not easy to see through the thicket of leaves, and far harder to see in than to see out; when coming {{to the edge of the}} wood I saw Atkins, and his tawny savage wife, sitting under the shade of a bush, very eager in discourse.

[...] However, the nominating convention and the political discussions and maneuvering before it generated considerable controversy within the party. At issue was the apportionment of delegates and the method used to determine how many delegates each state received. The group Greens for Democracy and Independence, inspired by the principles in Peter Camejos Avocado Declaration (in part a response to Naders declaration not to seek the Green nomination), arose and became an organizing group for Greens disaffected with the internal policies and procedures of the GPUS, and sought reforms.|$|E

It was her first national team training camp since June 2006, when she trained with the U-21 before tearing her ACL. Of her first few days at camp, Harris stated: [...] I was very nervous at the beginning. I was very stiff, to say the least. But you know what? This is an opportunity of a lifetime and I feel I'm playing well, and all I can ask for is to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> knowing that I did what I was supposed to do. As far as what happens next, it's out of my control. I am {{just going to keep}} doing what I have been doing, training hard, and improving every day. [...] On September 7, 2010, United States women's national team head coach Pia Sundhage named a 30-player roster for two matches against China in October. The roster would then be narrowed down to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament. The players would take part in a training camp before the two matches starting on September 20. Although Harris was not one of the four goalkeepers on this preliminary roster, she was called into camp on September 23 to replace Hope Solo, who was recovering from a shoulder surgery. She was then named to the 24-player roster for the team's second match against China on October 6 in Philadelphia, although she did not dress for the match. She was not named to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament, but she did travel with the team to train.|$|E
5000|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, praised the episode for containing [...] "a memorable guest character in the French waiter Monsieur Lacosse, two great slapstick sequences involving the same, and displays Principal Skinner [...] - [...] pursuing Bart across the mountains like 'a non-giving-up school guy', and confessing {{that in some ways}} he's [...] "a small man; a petty, small man" [...] - [...] in particularly fine form." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought Freddy Quimby [...] "may well be the most unpleasant character to grace the series [...] - [...] in an amusing way, though Freddy’s edginess makes him less amusing than his uncle. It’s rather startling to see Skinner so rapidly resume his dislike of Bart after the last episode, though. It’s fun to see his superhuman powers in the pursuit of Bart, and the mystery aspects of the show help make it a very good one. Add to that Homer on jury duty for even more entertainment."Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A for its [...] "excellent bits thrown together to make this one, joke for joke, one of the season's funniest". In 2007, Patrick Enright of MSNBC called it his tenth favorite episode of the show. He said it was a perfect example of the show's [...] "hilarious randomness" [...] because of jokes such as Homer singing the Meow Mix cat food jingle, and the scene in which Homer discovers that if the jury’s deadlocked, they will be sequestered in a luxury hotel. Homer justifies his decision to be the lone dissenting voice by saying, [...] "I’m only doing what I think is right. I believe Freddy Quimby should <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> a free hotel (when he should have said a 'free man')." ...|$|E
