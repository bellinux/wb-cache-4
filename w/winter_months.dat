5|$|The true {{number of}} cases of carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is unknown, since many non-lethal exposures go undetected. From the available data, carbon monoxide poisoning is {{the most common cause of}} injury and death due to poisoning worldwide. Poisoning is typically more common during the <b>winter</b> <b>months.</b> This is due to increased domestic use of gas furnaces, gas or kerosene space heaters, and kitchen stoves during the <b>winter</b> <b>months,</b> which if faulty and/or used without adequate ventilation, may produce excessive carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide detection and poisoning also increases during power outages, when electric heating and cooking appliances become inoperative and residents may temporarily resort to fuel-burning space heaters, stoves, and grills (some of which are safe only for outdoor use but nonetheless are errantly burned indoors).|$|E

5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging from and defending. Frequently, territory sizes, normally , are correlated with the abundance of rain and resources in a region; smaller territories occur where insects and resources are plentiful.

White-winged fairywrens occupy much larger territories than other fairywren species.|$|E

5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to winter {{closures}} due to lake effect caused by snowsquall, which can create sudden whiteout conditions along the Lake Huron shoreline.

5|$|In {{partnership}} with the goddess Brìghde, the Cailleach {{is seen as a}} seasonal deity or spirit, ruling the <b>winter</b> <b>months</b> between Samhainn (1 November or first day of winter) and Bealltainn (1 May or first day of summer), while Brìghde rules the summer months between Bealltainn and Samhainn. Some interpretations have the Cailleach and Brìghde as two faces of the same goddess, while others describe the Cailleach as turning to stone on Bealltainn and reverting to humanoid form on Samhainn in time to rule over the <b>winter</b> <b>months.</b> Depending on local climate, the transfer of power between the winter goddess and the summer goddess is celebrated any time between Là Fhèill Brìghde (1 February) at the earliest, Latha na Cailliche (25 March), or Bealltainn (1 May) at the latest, and the local festivals marking the arrival of the first signs of spring may be named after either the Cailleach or Brìghde.|$|E
