25|$|Maharlika – Members of the Tagalog warrior class {{known as}} maharlika {{had the same}} rights and {{responsibilities}} as the timawa, but {{in times of war}} they were bound to serve their datu in battle. They had to arm themselves at their own expense, but they did get to keep the loot they won – or stole, depending on which side of the transaction you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> Although they were partly related to the nobility, the maharlikas were technically less free than the timawas because they could not leave a datu’s service without first hosting a large public feast and paying the datu between 6 and 18 pesos in gold – a large sum in those days.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Corbyn {{signed an}} Early Day Motion {{calling for the}} {{decriminalisation}} of cannabis. Despite having never smoked cannabis himself, Corbyn said in the 2015 Labour leadership election [...] "we should be adult and grown up and decriminalise cannabis". Later, in the 2016 Labour leadership election, Corbyn called for the decriminalisation of cannabis for medicinal purposes, but said that he wouldn't support legalising recreational drugs. He said about them that he wanted people to be [...] "educated away from" [...] taking drugs, and further stated that he [...] "would also <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> supporting {{people who want to}} get out of the drugs trade in other parts of the world because there is the horrors of the drugs war that's going on in Central America".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked by}} reporters after the 2011 ALDS {{if he had}} {{considered}} {{that he might have}} played for the final time with the Yankees, Posada said, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it like that. We lost, and we'll see what happens in the off-season." [...] As the interview session went on, he eventually became emotional and left the clubhouse area to compose himself. Girardi said, [...] "This guy, {{when you look at what}} he did in this series, he was awesome. He's had a tremendous career, and I'm sure he's going to continue to play, and I don't know what's going to happen." [...] Girardi added, [...] "But you talk about being proud of players — what he went through this year and what he gave us in the postseason, I don't think there's a prouder moment that I've had of Jorge." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{had dropped}} his head again, {{as if he}} did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|E
60|$|Bessie (Almost hysterical; laughs). Why, Captain Hagberd, {{perhaps your}} son won't even <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me--when he comes home.|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [stopping {{to examine}} the great stone]. Just a moment, Mr Doyle: I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this stone. It must be Finian's die-cast.|$|E
60|$|It now {{required}} deliberation on Venters's part {{to persist in}} his unconcern and to keep <b>at</b> work. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her, <b>to</b> volley questions at her.|$|R
6000|$|Satisfied so far, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the cipher next. She {{handed it}} to him with a stipulation: [...] "Yours, Jemmy, on the day when you marry me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rohmer said he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> [...] "thoughts {{rather than}} actions", dealing [...] "less with {{what people do}} than {{what is going on}} in their minds while they are doing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose,' {{returned}} the lady, 'as nobody but yourself can <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a steam package, without {{wanting to go}} a-boarding of it, can they! Booby!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He doesn't mind," [...] she replied. [...] "Let {{that stuff}} {{alone for a}} time. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> you. You're fine, Dick, {{but what does it}} all mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Among all {{the idle}} {{people who have}} come here, at one time or another, to see this house," [...] the woman said, [...] "only two have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the garden." ...|$|R

60|$|The sunrise {{found the}} bishop {{with his head}} and {{shoulders}} {{out of the window}} trying to see that blackbird. He just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. He was persuaded it was a quite exceptional blackbird.|$|R

6000|$|... "'My {{wife will}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the place to-morrow,' I replied; 'that is, {{if it does}} not rain: for she says she does not want to see it first in bad weather.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{need not}} stay any longer," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> your farm for myself, Mr. Crockford, and I thought it only right {{that you should}} have early notice of my {{intention}} to ask you to vacate the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not matter?" [...] said Adam, gravely. [...] "You {{seemed very}} frightened about it. I'll hold it till you're {{ready to take}} it," [...] he added, quietly closing his hand over it, that she might not think he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it again.|$|R
60|$|This mood of extremity, {{when she}} lay staring into eternity, utterly suspended, and {{conscious}} of everything, {{to the last}} limits, passed and left her uneasy. She had lain so long motionless. She moved, she became self-conscious. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, <b>to</b> see him.|$|R

5000|$|Arunachalam {{has said}} he has never taken a course in {{information}} science, but [...] "simply developed a natural flair for some aspects of information science, largely focused {{on the needs of}} students of science seeking information for research, and those <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> and 'evaluate' performance in scientific research." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] he said. [...] "I am, however, {{inclined}} to think you saved my life. The man probably saw your hand go up and {{that made him a}} trifle too precipitate.

60|$|Anna {{glanced at}} the strange youth again. She felt him waiting there for her to notice him. He was {{hovering}} {{on the edge of}} her consciousness, ready to come in. She did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him. She was antagonistic to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not wish}} her to tell me anything. I only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her.

6000|$|... "It is not," [...] Davies agreed.

Then, you see, I knew Miss Winter and heard she was at your camp." ...|$|R
60|$|With Verona {{he sounded}} fatherly again, and firm. He consoled Tinka, who satisfactorily pointed the {{excitement}} of the hour by wailing. He ordered early breakfast, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the newspaper, and felt somehow heroic and useful in not <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it. But there were still crawling and totally unheroic hours of waiting before Dr. Patten returned.|$|R
