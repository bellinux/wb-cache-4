2500|$|In the 1970s, cricket and {{baseball}} bat manufacturers began experimenting with lightweight steel alloys {{as a replacement}} for the traditional willow or ash bat. [...] Hockey stick designers followed suit in the early 1980s, introducing first a single piece all-aluminium stick. [...] This design was not popular, as the stiff aluminium did not have the proper [...] "feel", and so a design featuring an aluminium shaft and a removable, replaceable <b>wooden</b> <b>blade</b> was tried. [...] This became very popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s, challenging the prevalence of the traditional wooden stick for the first time.|$|E
2500|$|Smyth {{played in}} the style of a power forward, {{depending}} largely on his size and strength to contribute offensively. By positioning himself in front of the net, he earned most of his goals by tipping pucks in past the goaltender or scoring on rebounds. Relying heavily on force and determination, he did not possess particularly good shooting skills, stickhandling or skating skills. He had been known to use a two-piece stick (composite shaft with <b>wooden</b> <b>blade)</b> with a flat blade, both of which are trends which have largely gone out of date during or before Smyth's career. As a result, his success was predicated less on skill, but more on force and determination. When the Oilers drafted him out of junior, it was said that General Manager Glen Sather was looking for someone with [...] "lots of guts." [...] Smyth was also known as a leader, having served as captain for Canada's World Championship teams on six occasions, as well as an alternate captain on all of the teams he played with in the NHL.|$|E
2500|$|Z'EV and Einst√ºrzende Neubauten {{made several}} {{percussion}} instruments out of trash. No Wave artist Glenn Branca began building 3rd bridge zithers {{with an additional}} movable bridge positioned on the just intoned knotted positions of the harmonic series. Hans Reichel (Born 1949) is a German improvisational guitarist, luthier, and inventor. Reichel has constructed and built several variations of guitars and basses, most of them featuring multiple fretboards and unique positioning of pickups {{as well as the}} same indirect playing technique as Branca's instruments. The resulting sounds exceed the range of conventional tuning and add interesting effects, from odd overtones to metallic noises. Later he invented his Daxophone, where he's most famous for. His Daxophone consists of a single <b>wooden</b> <b>blade</b> fixed in a block containing a contact microphone. Normally, it is played by bowing the free end, {{but it can also be}} struck or plucked, which propagates sound in the same way a ruler halfway off a table does. These vibrations then continue to the wooden-block base, which in turn is amplified by the contact microphone(s) therein. A wide range of voice-like timbres can be produced, depending on the shape of the instrument, the type of wood, where it is bowed, and where along its length it is stopped with a separate block of wood (fretted on one side) called the [...] "dax." ...|$|E

So he clung to the handle till it was wrenched from him. Indeed he did more, for seeing that the crocodile had bitten the <b>wooden</b> <b>blade</b> in two and, having dropped it, was still advancing towards the slope where it was accustomed to be fed, he leapt into the water and struck it in the eye with his little fist. Feeling the pain of the blow the monster snapped at him, and catching him by the hand began to sink back into deep water, dragging the lad after it.|$|E

Launched in 1860, it was a side-wheel paddle steamer of 245 feet long with a 40-foot beam, displacing 1050 tons. It was equipped with a 1,357 horsepower, single cylinder, vertical-beam engine powered by two 32 ton boilers. It had two side-wheels 32 feet in diameter with 8 foot buckets (the <b>wooden</b> <b>blades</b> of a paddle wheel). It could carry 1,000 passengers and 700 tons of cargo at great speed.
