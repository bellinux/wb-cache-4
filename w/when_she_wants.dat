25|$|Ethel lives above Doctor Legg's (Leonard Fenton) {{surgery and}} works as the cleaner in the pub. She is {{somewhat}} of a troublemaker and often spreads the most insane rumours about and gets her words mixed up with hilarious consequences. She is famous for her questionable ability to read-palms and tea-leaves, once even earning a living from it. After Lou's death in 1988 Ethel and Dot become an inseparable double-act and although the two argue constantly, they actually depend on each other a great deal. Despite the fact that Ethel appears totally barmy, she can be quite astute <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> and she is always the first {{to point out the}} malicious ways of Dot's villainous son, Nick Cotton (John Altman). Ethel is never afraid to stand up to Nick, even kneeing him in the groin once when he attempts to mug her. She also correctly figures out that Nick is trying to poison Dot to get her money, and she refuses to back down, despite Dot falling out with her because of her accusations. Following several falls and a broken hip, Ethel is persuaded to move out of her residence above the surgery and into sheltered housing in 1988. Although she is strongly opposed to this initially, she eventually comes to enjoy her new home, though she would continue to show up in Albert Square regularly.|$|E

Both Bell and Geoff Peterson appeared with Ferguson during the five Late Late Show' episodes filmed in France.|$|E

500|$|Max was genetically {{engineered}} and carried to term {{by a woman}} who was not permitted to meet her. She was created for a secret government supersoldier program called Manticore, then located in Gillette, Wyoming. As with almost all Manticore's soldiers, Max has a barcode on the nape of her neck, with her identifying number sequence (332960073452). She is an X5 model and is thus referred to as X5-452.

She can see in the dark, can zoom in with her eyes to view distant objects, does not need to sleep and has a photographic memory.

In the opening credits, Harrison was billed under the tag [...] "introducing Linda Harrison"; although she had appeared in three previous films. Zanuck wanted to draw attention to Harrison because he felt the role would catapult her to stardom. Harrison impressed audiences with her hourglass figure, long dark hair, and large brown eyes, which, in the absence of spoken dialogue, did most of her acting, though some critics were unimpressed. Renata Adler of the New York Times dismissed Harrison as “Heston's Neanderthal flower girl. She wiggles her hips <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> to say something." [...] The success of Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels, an animated cartoon series, a live-action TV series, a [...] "reboot" [...] by Tim Burton, and three prequels to the original film.

Lou's house was also the meeting place for the family Sunday teas. Ham, or tinned salmon salad. Bread and butter. Jelly and tinned cream. And, tea...the changing face of the area (especially the immigrants) is a constant source of fear to her, but then she doesn't go out much. She prefers to be at home, or on a trip down memory lane: day trips to Southend – the Kursal, Rossi's ice-cream and a plate of cockles; one wonderful week's holiday in a caravan in Clacton; fruit picking in Essex; Christmas; weddings; street parties...She has a soft spot for her son, Pete..."
