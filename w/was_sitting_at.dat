Amira sustained a slight injury in his cheek {{as a result of the}} attack. He was killed on 2 February 2011 in Rishon Letzion, presumably by the Abergil organization which, according to police sources, continued to operate while the two Abergil brothers were extradited and awaiting trial in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{most heavily}} {{promoted}} feud {{going into the}} event was between Bam Bam Bigelow and Lawrence Taylor. At Royal Rumble 1995, Bigelow teamed with Tatanka {{in the final round}} of a tournament for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Bigelow was pinned {{at the end of the}} match, which led to the crowd heckling him. He responded by pushing NFL player Lawrence Taylor, who <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> ringside. Bigelow refused to apologize and instead challenged Taylor to a wrestling match. Taylor agreed and trained with WWF World Heavyweight Champion Diesel to prepare for the match. The storyline between Bigelow and Taylor brought the WWF much mainstream exposure, as the match was discussed by several news outlets.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2013–14 season, the club decided to dedicate the number 12 shirt to the fans by not registering it to a player and having it listed as 'Glory Fans' when the squad is announced on match days. Alistair Edwards was sacked as Manager on 17 December 2013, and replaced on an interim basis by Kenny Lowe. Many fans blamed Jacob Burns for the sacking of Alistair Edwards (with rumours of him being the leader of the uprising against Edwards).

Eli blessed her and she returned home. Subsequently Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to Samuel.|$|E
25|$|In the 2013 NBA draft on June 27, the Suns {{selected}} Ukrainian center Alex Len {{from the}} Maryland with their 5th pick and power forward Alex Oriakhi from the Missouri with their 57th pick. In addition, they traded their 30th pick to the Golden State Warriors for shooting guards Archie Goodwin from the Kentucky (who was selected one pick earlier) and Malcolm Lee {{on the same}} day. On July 2, 2013, the Suns agreed to a trade involving the Los Angeles Clippers and the Milwaukee Bucks, in which they gave up Jared Dudley to the Clippers and a 2014 second-round pick to the Bucks in exchange for point guard Eric Bledsoe and small forward Caron Butler, both of whom last played for the Clippers. The Suns also agreed to trade Luis Scola to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Gerald Green, Miles Plumlee, and a 2014 top-14-protected first-round pick on July 27. The Suns later traded Butler to the Bucks for center Viacheslav Kravtsov and point guard Ish Smith on August 29. In addition, the Suns waived one of their biggest signings from last season, Michael Beasley, on September 3, 2013. Finally, before the 2013–14 NBA season began, the Suns traded center Marcin Gortat, along with guards Shannon Brown, Kendall Marshall (whom the team drafted a year earlier), and Malcolm Lee, to the Washington Wizards for veteran forward-center Emeka Okafor and a top-12-protected 2014 first-round draft pick. The Suns were predicted to have a league-worst 16-66 season. The Suns' season proved opposite. Phoenix began the season 16–10. Eric Bledsoe (a main reason to the early success) went down against the Los Angeles Clippers with a torn meniscus, which occurred when the Suns were 19–11 on the season. Bledsoe missed 33 games due to the injury and the Suns went 17–16 during his absence. Phoenix went over 0.500 during that period thanks to consistent play from Gerald Green, Markieff and Marcus Morris, Channing Frye and Miles Plumlee. This was being led by a breakout season by Goran Dragić, who led Phoenix to a 36–27 record while Bledsoe was out, which set Phoenix up for a strong playoff push, which nearly had Dragić {{on the brink of}} an All-Star selection. Phoenix was in a tight playoff race with the Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks and coincidentally the three teams faced one another in the last week of the regular season. Before these teams faced off, Phoenix <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> 47–32 while Dallas and Memphis were both 48–32. Phoenix lost against both Memphis and Dallas and beat Sacramento Kings to finish the season 48–34, Dallas beat Phoenix and lost to Memphis to finish 49–33, and Memphis beat both Phoenix and Dallas to finish 50–32. This resulted in Memphis finishing with the 7th seed, Dallas finishing with the 8th seed and Phoenix finishing with the 9th seed. This was an upset for the Suns, who were making a push for the playoffs in a competitive Western Conference.|$|E

500|$|Gary Rydstrom and {{his team}} at Skywalker Sound were hired for the film's sound production. Like Howard, Rydstrom {{employed}} different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, {{he felt that the}} Atlanteans should have a [...] "more organic" [...] sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the side of a highway recording one day when a semi-truck drove by at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic, and that is what is heard within the film. Rydstrom created the harmonic chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his finger along the edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through water with a water pick.|$|E
500|$|The scholar Leslie Hotson {{discovered}} in 1925 the coroner's report on Marlowe's {{death in the}} Public Record Office which gave fuller details. Marlowe had spent all day in a house owned by the widow Eleanor Bull, along with three men, Ingram Frizer, Nicholas Skeres and Robert Poley. Witnesses testified that Frizer and Marlowe had earlier argued over the bill, exchanging [...] "divers malicious words." [...] Later, while Frizer <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> a table between the other two and Marlowe was lying behind him on a couch, Marlowe snatched Frizer's dagger and began attacking him. In the ensuing struggle, according to the coroner's report, Marlowe was accidentally stabbed above the right eye, killing him instantly. The jury concluded that Frizer acted in self-defence, and within a month he was pardoned. Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Deptford, on 1 June 1593.|$|E
500|$|Around 1918, {{the leaders}} of the Italian Communists and Anarchists in the United States settled {{themselves}} in New Kensington. The group was guided by the ideas of Carlo Tresca, a union organizer for Industrial Workers of the World, [...] which were recorded first, in his newspaper La Plebe, or The Worker, and later in his anti-fascist paper, Il Martello (which translates to [...] "the hammer"). The Italian Communists and Anarchists harassed members of the Catholic Church. Italians who did go the church were made to feel inferior and many became too intimidated to go to church at all. At St. Peter's, one priest was shot through a window while he <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> his desk. Another priest was threatened that if he did not leave New Kensington he would be killed. In 1918, there were only thirteen families who attended Mass at St. Peter on Sunday. This continued for several years until Carlo Tresca moved from New Kensington to New York City in 1925.|$|E

It's gonna be me and you." [...] Silva immediately {{jumped to his feet}} and made his way into the ring. He was now face-to-face with Jackson, who continued by saying, [...] "You have my belt, you're keeping it warm for me." [...] Silva responded by yelling [...] "MY BELT!" [...] and giving Jackson a forceful shove. Jackson, visibly upset, advanced towards Silva as dozens of Pride officials intervened. Jackson stood still as he was surrounded by officials, while Silva had to be constantly restrained from charging at Jackson. Jackson later stated that he was instructed by Pride executives to make these comments. He added that Silva's shove infuriated him, and he was ready to fight Silva immediately.|$|E
500|$|On August 27, 1964, Kemper's grandmother, Maude Matilda Hughey Kemper (1897–1964), <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> {{the kitchen}} table when she and Kemper had an argument. Enraged by the argument, Kemper stormed off and grabbed the [...]22 caliber rifle which his {{grandfather}} had given him for hunting.

Some accounts allege that Maude Kemper additionally suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife. He then dragged her body out of the kitchen and into her bedroom. When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (1892–1964), came home from grocery shopping, Kemper went outside and fatally shot him in the driveway. He was unsure of what to do next and so phoned his mother, who urged him to contact the local police. Kemper then called the police and waited for them to take him into custody.|$|E
500|$|Although Oswald {{could be}} {{interpreted}} as a martyr for his death in battle, Bede puts a clear emphasis on Oswald being saintly as a king. Bede does not focus on his martyrdom as being primary to his sainthoodindeed, it has been noted that Bede never uses the word [...] "martyr" [...] in reference to Oswald. Bede's portrayal of Oswald stands out as unusual as a king regarded as saintly for his life while ruling, in contrast to a king who gives up the kingship in favour of religious life, or who is venerated because of the manner of his death. Bede recounts Oswald's generosity to the poor and to strangers, and tells a story highlighting this characteristic: on one occasion, at Easter, Oswald <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> dinner with Aidan, and had [...] "a silver dish full of dainties before him", when a servant, whom Oswald [...] "had appointed to relieve the poor", came in and told Oswald that a crowd of the poor were in the streets begging alms from the king. Oswald, according to Bede, then immediately had his food given to the poor and even had the dish broken up and distributed. Aidan was greatly impressed and seized Oswald's right hand, stating: [...] "May this hand never perish." [...] Accordingly, Bede reports that the hand and arm remained uncorrupted after Oswald's death.|$|E

500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E
500|$|The next morning, Conkling then {{submitted}} {{a resolution that}} bound every delegate in the hall to support the party's nominee. Conkling said that [...] "no man should hold his seat here who is not ready so to agree." [...] A voice vote was called, and the resolution received nearly unanimous delegate support. However, about {{a dozen or so}} delegates answered [...] "no". Conkling was shocked. He asked, [...] " [...] at a Republican convention would vote 'no' on such a resolution?" [...] He then demanded a roll call to identify the dissenters. Most of the dissenters chose not to declare their disagreement in front of the thousands of spectators at the [...] "Glass Palace". Only three delegates, all from West Virginia, voted [...] "no" [...] to the resolution, and were showered with a [...] "storm of hisses." [...] Conkling then issued another resolution to strip the three West Virginians of their votes and squash their voices at the convention. The West Virginians revolted against Conkling's resolution, and heavily criticized him for his motion. James Garfield, who <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>at</b> the Ohio delegation, stood up and tried to settle the matter. He stated that the convention would be making a big mistake if they approved Conkling's motion, and he asked the delegates for their time in order to state his case. Garfield argued that the three West Virginians should not [...] "be disenfranchised because they thought it was not the time to make such an expression [...]" [...] He stated that [...] "there never can be a convention...that shall bind my vote against my will on any question whatever." [...] Garfield had won the crowd over with his speech. Conkling did not particularly enjoy the situation. He scribbled a note to Garfield which read, [...] "New York requests that Ohio's real candidate and dark horse come forward...R.C." ...|$|E
