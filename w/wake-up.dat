40|$|Sensing in {{smartphones}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of energy and leads to quick depletion of the battery. Most of the existing solutions to overcome the short battery lifetime caused by periodic sensing are personalized. They tend to learn and predict the user activities. Thus, fewer samples are required to recognize user state and sensing intervals can be extended. However, such methods require a training phase and any change in the user pattern causes a need for a new training phase. Therefore, in addition to personalized learning methods, we also need user-agnostic techniques that guarantee instant energy savings independently of the context to be recognized. In this thesis a user-agnostic method that seeks to provide energy efficiency in sensing is proposed. Our approach is based on the observation that an energy overhead occurs every time the CPU is woken up to perform a sensor sampling task. Hence, our goal is to decrease the number of CPU <b>wake-ups</b> incurred due to periodic sampling by combining multiple sensing actions into one joint activity. Our contribution is a mechanism that batches the execution of periodic tasks. BASS (BAtch Scheduler for Sensing) uses the greatest common divisor of the time intervals defined for the sensor sampling tasks. It also introduces a flexibility factor that implies the time delay tolerance regarding the execution of a task. Moreover, our tool implements a detection method for CPU <b>wake-ups</b> caused by any other application or the user. Based on the above, BASS applies batch scheduling to execute the sensor sampling tasks in batches and result in fewer CPU <b>wake-ups.</b> We evaluated our mechanism using a sensing application for monitoring patients that suffer from Rheumatic Arthritis. We conducted a number of experiments on an HTC Sensation phone, which showed that the efficient exploit of CPU <b>wake-ups</b> cuts down the energy consumption in mobile sensing. The BASS tool achieved an average power reduction of up to 44 % and 18 % in laboratory and real-world experiments respectively, in our application scenario, without compromising sensing time accuracy.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis {{activity}} and to determine associations of various covariates (gender, sleep-wake rhythm, demographic, academic, life style and health-related characteristics) with altered daily salivary cortisol profiles in late adolescence. Materials and methods: The total analytic sample consisted of 903 Croatian secondary school students aged 18 - 21 years (median 19 years). Salivary cortisol was sampled at home at three time points over the course of one week and its concentrations were measured by using the enzyme immunoassay. Results: In comparison to males, female students had a higher cortisol awakening response (CAR) (median 4. 69, IQR 10. 46 and median 3. 03, IQR 8. 94, respectively; P < 0. 001), a steeper (“healthier”) diurnal cortisol slope (DCS) (median 0. 51, IQR 0. 55 and median 0. 44, IQR 0. 51, respectively; P = 0. 001), and a greater area under curve with respect to ground (AUCG) (median 206. 79, IQR 111. 78 and median 191. 46, IQR 104. 18, respectively; P < 0. 001). Those students who <b>woke-up</b> earlier and were awake longer, had a higher CAR (P < 0. 001), a flatter (“less healthy”) DCS (P < 0. 001), and a greater AUCG (P < 0. 001), than students who <b>woke-up</b> later and were awake shorter. Less consistent but still significant predictors of salivary cortisol indexes were age, school behaviour, friendship, diet healthiness and drug abuse. Conclusion: Gender and sleep-wake up rhythm were major determinants of the altered daily salivary cortisol profiles in late adolescence. The predictive power of other covariates, although less clear, has a potential for identifying vulnerable subgroups such as male drug users and females without a best friend...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Intelligent environments (IE) {{leverage}} {{embedded processing}} and wireless communication to assist users {{in a variety}} of ways. Applications rely on low power consumption for longer lifetimes, though different applications require different Qualityof-Service (QoS) requirements from the MAC layer. Until now, low power has come at the cost of other QoS parameters such as latency or packet loss. This paper presents WoR-MAC, a wireless MAC protocol which allows pre-existing protocols to be combined with remote multi-node <b>wake-ups.</b> The protocols are embedded into Wake-on-Radio (WoR) frames, allowing nodes to sleep during periods of low activity and be woken asynchronously with a single short RF signal. After waking, nodes begin communication using the embedded MAC protocol. Once the nodes have been woken, they maintain the QoS of the original MAC, with greatly reduced power consumption. The results indicate that WoR-MAC maintains packet loss characteristics of CSMA-CA and TDMA, as well as latency after accounting for the duty cycle and collaborative parameter estimation, while reducing power consumption by up to 49 %, very close to the lower bound given by the duty-cycle.

While its main assets are modularity {{and the very}} fact it is becoming a de facto standard, {{the evolution of the}} SystemC framework (from version 0. 9 to version 2. 0. 1) suggests the environment is particularly geared toward increasing the framework functionalities rather than improving simulation speed.

By the middle of 1953, director Wilfred Jackson had recorded the dialogue, assembled a story reel, and was to commence for preliminary animation work where Princess Aurora and Prince Phillip were {{to meet in the}} forest and dance, though Walt Disney decided to throw out the sequence delaying the film from its initial 1955 release date. For a number of months, Jackson, Ted Sears, and two story writers underwent a rewrite of the story, which received a lukewarm response from Disney. During the story rewriting process, the story writers felt the original fairy tale's second act felt bizarre and with the <b>wake-up</b> kiss serving as a climactic moment, they decided to concentrate on the first half finding strength in the romance. However, they felt little romance was developed between the strange prince and the princess that the storyboard artists worked out an elaborate sequence in which the king organized a treasure hunt. The idea was eventually dropped when it became too drawn out and drifted from the central storyline. Instead, it was written that Prince Phillip and Princess Aurora would meet in the forest by random chance while Princess Aurora renamed Briar Rose was conversing with the forest animals. Additionally, because the original Perrault tale had the curse last one hundred years, the writers decided to shorten it a few hours with the time spent for Prince Phillip to battle the goons, overcome several obstacles, and fight off against Maleficent transformed into a dragon.|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{sensor network}} {{has been gaining}} ground in {{applications}} involving remote surveillance and date collection. However, there are still barriers to overcome to deploy these applications in large scale, {{one of which is}} the limited network lifetime. Extending network lifetime is challenging in that wireless sensor networks are built out of error-prone and short-lived wireless sensor nodes. In order to extend the network lifetime beyond an individual node’s lifetime, a common practice is to deploy a large array of sensor nodes, and have only a minimal set of nodes active performing duties while others stay in sleep mode to conserve energy. With this rationale, random node failures, either in active nodes or in redundant nodes, can seriously disrupt system operations. To address this issue, we proposed two node scheduling schemes to meet requirements from different applications: R-Sentry, a gang-based scheduling algorithm that attempts to bound the service loss time stemming from random node failures by coordinating the schedules among redundant nodes; and P-Sentry, a light-weight algorithm that keeps a certain number of redundant nodes always active while the others in deep sleep in an attempt to reduce the overhead caused by frequent <b>wake-ups.</b> Like any other network, wireless sensor network is also subject to attacks from adversaries.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Poor sleep {{quality in}} {{pregnancy}} is frequent. A treatment with sedatives is problematic due to {{possible adverse effects}} for mother and embryo/foetus. In the present study, we investigated the sedative effect of Bryophyllum pinnatum, a phytotherapeutic medication used in anthroposophic medicine. In previous clinical studies on its tocolytic effect, B. pinnatum showed a good risk/benefit ratio for mother and child. A recent analysis of the prescribing pattern for B. pinnatum in a network of anthroposophic physicians revealed sleep disorders {{as one of the}} most frequent diagnoses for which these preparations are prescribed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, multi-centre, observational study, pregnant women suffering from sleep problems were treated with B. pinnatum (350 mg tablets, 50 % leaf press juice, Weleda AG, Arlesheim, dosage at physician's consideration). Sleep quality, daily sleepiness and fatigue were assessed with the aid of standardised questionnaires, at the beginning of the treatment and after 2 weeks. Possible adverse drug reactions perceived by the patients during the treatment were recorded. RESULTS: The number of <b>wake-ups,</b> as well as the subjective quality of sleep was significantly improved at the end of the treatment with B. pinnatum. The Epworth Sleeping Scale decreased, indicating a decrease of the tiredness during the day. There was, however, no evidence for prolongation of the sleep duration, reduction in the time to fall asleep, as well as change in the Fatigue Severity Scale after B. pinnatum. No serious adverse drug reactions were detected. CONCLUSION: B. pinnatum is a suitable treatment of sleep problems in pregnancy.
