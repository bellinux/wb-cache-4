5|$|In {{reaction}} to left-wing and Basque separatist violence, the government passed a new anti-terrorist law on 26 August 1975. Sympathising <b>with</b> <b>terrorists</b> would now carry a penalty {{of up to}} 12 years imprisonment. The law re-established military tribunals, empowered to order executions of those they found guilty of terrorism against the state. It extended the time that suspects could be held for interrogation from 3 to 5 days, with an option of up to 19 days with judicial approval. In response, the European Parliament debated a motion proposed by the Confederation of the Socialist Parties of the European Community condemning the new law as an infringement {{of human rights and}} calling for the suspension of relations between the EEC and Spain.|$|E

25|$|SDLP leader John Hume, MP, {{identified}} {{the possibility that}} a negotiated settlement might be possible and began secret talks with Adams in 1988. These discussions led to unofficial contacts with the British Northern Ireland Office under the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke, and with the government of the Republic under Charles Haughey– although both governments maintained in public that they would not negotiate <b>with</b> <b>terrorists.</b> These talks provided the groundwork for what was later to be the Belfast Agreement, preceded by the milestone Downing Street Declaration and the Joint Framework Document.|$|E

25|$|While {{the diplomats}} were {{reviewing}} their options the Egyptian foreign minister Abdel Meguid telephoned {{and asked them}} to report to his office. There he proposed a new offer – the hostages would be released if the four governments promised not to pursue the hijackers. The ambassadors told him that they could not commit to that without consulting with their governments. Meguid loaned each an office and telephone. He demanded an answer in twenty minutes, the ambassadors ignored his deadline and began discussing the matter with their governments. The American and British ambassadors informed Meguid that their governments refused, repeating their policies of not negotiating <b>with</b> <b>terrorists.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jonathan's {{administration}} was heavily criticized for {{its failure to}} bring back the over 200 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram. Many demonstrations called for the government to be more responsive; Jonathan asked that demonstrators focus on blaming Boko Haram itself for the abductions. Jonathan initially denied that there had been any abduction at all, but then later signaled his government would do a prisoner release in exchange for the kidnapped girls. Discussions then took place in Paris with foreign ministers from France, Britain, the United States and Israel, where he agreed no deals should be struck <b>with</b> <b>terrorists.</b> He then called off the exchange at the last minute on 24 May 2014. This about-turn reportedly enraged Boko Haram leaders.|$|E
25|$|Publicly the Christian Democrats {{had refused}} to {{negotiate}} <b>with</b> <b>terrorists,</b> but privately leading politicians {{and members of the}} secret services visited Cutolo in prison and asked him to negotiate with imprisoned members of the Red Brigades. A large ransom was paid to win Cirillo’s release. In return, Cutolo allegedly asked for a slackening of police operations against the Camorra, for control over the tendering of building contracts in Campania (a lucrative venture since Campania was hit by a devastating earthquake in November 1980) and for a reduction of his own sentence – as well as new psychiatric test to show that he is not responsible for his actions. Both these last concessions were granted.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Sciascia {{was elected}} for the Radical Party in the House of Deputies {{and become a}} member of the {{committee}} of the House for the investigation into Moro's kidnapping, which stated that there was a certain amount of negligence on the part of the Christian Democrat Party in their stance that the state was bigger than a person, and that they would not swap Moro for 13 political prisoners, even though Moro himself had stated that the swapping of innocent people for political prisoners was a valid option in negotiations <b>with</b> <b>terrorists.</b> However, senior members of the party disagreed with this stance and were of the view that Moro had been drugged and tortured to utter these words. Out of this experience, Sciascia wrote an important book.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1910s Merezhkovsky {{moved to the}} left side of the Russian {{cultural}} spectrum, finding among his closest associates the esers Ilya Fondaminsky and, notably, Boris Savinkov. The latter was trying to receive from Merezhkovsky some religious and philosophical justification for his own terrorist ideology, but also had another, more down to Earth axe to grind, that of getting his first novel published. This he did, with Merezhkovsky's assistance – to strike the most unusual debut of the 1910 Russian literary season. In 1911 Merezhkovsky was officially accused of having links <b>with</b> <b>terrorists.</b> Pending trial (which included the case of Pavel Pervy play) the writer stayed in Europe, then crossed the border in 1912 only to have several chapters of Alexander the First novel confiscated. He avoided being arrested and in September, along with Pirozhkov, the publisher, was acquitted.|$|E
25|$|The first {{diplomatic}} {{contact with}} China {{was made in}} the 1970s, with full diplomatic relations established in the 1990s. Since then the two countries have been major players in strengthening the ASEAN–China relationship. Singapore and the United States share a long-standing close relationship, in particular in defence, the economy, health, and education. The United States was Singapore's third largest trading partner in 2010, behind China (2nd) and Malaysia (1st). The two countries have a free-trade agreement, and Singapore views its relationship with the United States as an important counterbalance to China's influence. A Strategic Framework Agreement between the two, signed in 2005, formalises security and defence co-operation. Singapore has pushed regional counter-terrorism initiatives, with a strong resolve to deal <b>with</b> <b>terrorists</b> inside its borders. To this end it has given support to the US-led coalition to fight terrorism, with bilateral co-operation in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation initiatives, and joint military exercises.|$|E

The main suspect admitted to causing the deaths and injuries, but denied that they constituted murder <b>with</b> <b>terrorist</b> intent. The motive of the attack was still unclear according to NBI. Investigators cancelled the remand hearing of one of the five originally arrested and cleared him from any charges. NBI was at the time investigating the case in cooperation with Europol and Interpol and focusing on background issues, such as whether the attack was conducted in isolation or whether an organization guided the suspects, as well as trying to locate the sixth suspect outside of Finland. The suspects' ages range from 18 to 28. According to the German media, the main suspect and two of the other suspects had previously stayed in Germany and committed crimes under several different identities.|$|R
