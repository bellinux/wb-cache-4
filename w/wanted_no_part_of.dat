He had read The Well and {{considered it a}} fine book, not at all obscene; he <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> suppressing it. On 19 October he released the seized copies for delivery to Leopold Hill's premises, where the Metropolitan Police were waiting with a search warrant. Hill and Cape were summoned to appear at Bow Street Magistrates' Court to show cause why the book should not be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Although the Maritime {{leaders were}} swayed by the {{arguments}} of the Canadians, many ordinary residents of the Maritimes <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> this larger confederation for fear that their interests and concerns would be ignored in a wider national union. Many politicians who supported confederation, such as Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley (New Brunswick's best-known Father of Confederation), found themselves without a seat after the next election; nevertheless, backers of the wider confederation eventually prevailed.|$|E
25|$|On 10 February 1975, the Provisional IRA and British {{government}} {{entered into}} a truce and restarted negotiations. The IRA agreed to halt attacks on the British security forces, and the security forces mostly ended its raids and searches. However, there were dissenters on both sides. Some Provisionals <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the truce, while British commanders resented being told to stop their operations against the IRA just when—they claimed—they had the Provisionals on the run. The security forces boosted their intelligence offensive during the truce and thoroughly infiltrated the IRA.|$|E

In October 1913 Seely sent him to report on the police in Belfast and Dublin.|$|E
25|$|Coburn {{endorsed}} conservative {{activist and}} former diplomat Alan Keyes in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries. Coburn retired from Congress in 2001, fulfilling his pledge to serve {{no more than}} three terms in the House. His congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney Brad Carson defeated a Republican endorsed by Coburn. After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote Breach of Trust, with ghostwriter John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the Contract With America and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were already out of office {{at the time of the}} book's publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker Dennis Hastert) remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Coburn's return to politics.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons for the {{separation}} from Providence was dissension over admitting Samuel Gorton and his Warwick friends to equal rights in Providence. [...] After being evicted from other places, Gorton attempted {{to join in the}} Providence government, but the Pawtuxet settlers <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> him or his followers. [...] One cause of dissatisfaction was Gorton's treatment of the Indians. [...] Arnold felt a strong affinity towards the Narragansett people, having acquired their language, and he accused Gorton and the other Warwick settlers of showing injustice to the Indians in a long letter to Governor John Winthrop of Massachusetts in 1648.|$|E

500|$|Henry Wise Wood {{declined}} to seek re-election as UFA President at its 1931 convention, {{and was replaced}} by Robert Gardiner. [...] In contrast to Wood, Gardiner was firmly entrenched on the progressive movement's left-wing. [...] He denounced Brownlee's approach to economic policy, saying that his austerity only exacerbated the problem of underconsumption. [...] Under Gardiner, the UFA moved increasingly to the left, well {{out of step with the}} Brownlee government, and passed resolutions calling for the nationalization of land, radio broadcasting, and hydroelectricity, along with the cancellation of interest payments as long as the price of agricultural commodities was less than the cost of their production. [...] In 1932, prominent UFA members—including MP William Irvine—attended the founding convention of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in Calgary. [...] This new federal party advocated socialism and considered itself a partnership between farmers and labourers; Brownlee <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its policies.|$|E
500|$|After the Democratic convention, Bryan had {{returned}} triumphantly to Lincoln, making speeches along the way. [...] At home, {{he took a}} short rest, and was visited by Senator Jones to discuss plans for the campaign. [...] Bryan {{was not interested in}} campaign organization; what he wanted from the DNC was enough money to conduct a national tour by train. [...] The campaign, as it proved, was badly organized: This was Jones' first national campaign, and the party structure in many states was either only newly in the control of silver forces, or in gold states <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the national ticket. [...] With little money, poor organization, and a hostile press, Bryan was his campaign's most important asset, and he wanted to reach the voters by traveling to them. [...] According to Stanley Jones in his study of the 1896 campaign, [...] "Bryan expected that he alone, carrying to the people the message of free silver, would win the election for his party." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1970, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} Jackie Gleason in How Do I Love Thee?. During filming in {{the summer}} of 1969, O'Hara was involved in an accident on set with Gleason when he tripped on a Cyclone wire fence, falling heavily on her hand which was resting on it. She later required orthopedic surgery to correct the injury. Though she got on well with Gleason, O'Hara remarked that it was a [...] "terrible film. The script was awful, and the director couldn't fix it". The film was poorly received critically, with The Guardian calling it [...] "the most mawkish film of the year/decade/era". In October of that year she made her last film with Wayne in Big Jake (1971), shot on location in Durango, Mexico. Director Budd Boetticher cast O'Hara as he believed that she and Wayne had chemistry which was [...] "head and shoulders" [...] over those of other leading actresses at the time. After Big Jake, O'Hara retired from the industry. In 1972 she professed to strongly disapprove of the way Hollywood was going, [...] "making dirty pictures", and she <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it. That year she was asked to give a speech at the Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony for John Ford, which was the last occasion she saw him before his death.|$|E

We'd already weathered plenty of controversy over GTA III and Vice City - we were no strangers to it - but Manhunt felt different. With GTA, we always had the excuse that the gameplay was untethered - you never had to hurt anybody that wasn't a [...] "bad guy" [...] in one of the missions. You could play completely ethically if you wanted, and the game was parody anyway, so lighten up." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the 1960 season, the American League {{announced}} plans to put a team in Los Angeles.

[...] However, when Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley got wind of these developments, he threatened to scuttle the whole deal by invoking his exclusive rights to operate a major league team in southern California. [...] In truth, O'Malley <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> competing against an expansion team owned by a master promoter such as Veeck, {{even if he was}} only a minority partner. [...] Greenberg wouldn't budge and pulled out of the running for what became the Los Angeles Angels (now the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim). [...] Greenberg later became a successful investment banker, briefly returning to baseball as a minority partner with Veeck when the latter repurchased the White Sox in 1975.|$|E

2500|$|With Irish Home Rule {{about to}} become law in 1914, the Cabinet were contemplating some form of {{military}} action against the Ulster Volunteers (UVF) who <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it, and who were seen by many officers as loyal British subjects. In response to the King's request for his views (the King had also written to the Prime Minister), French wrote (25 September 1913) that the army would obey [...] "the absolute commands of the King", but he warned that some might think [...] "that they were best serving their King and country either by refusing to march against the Ulstermen or by openly joining their ranks" [...] although he stressed {{that he wanted to}} act firmly against dissidents within the army. In December 1913, in his memorandum [...] "Position of the Army with Regard to the Situation in Ulster", French recommended that Captain Spender, who was openly assisting the UVF, be cashiered [...] "pour decourager les autres".|$|E

Ulster loyalist paramilitaries, fearing {{they were about to}} be forsaken by the British government and forced into a united Ireland, increased their attacks on Roman Catholics and nationalists. Loyalist fears were partially grounded in fact as Secret Intelligence Service officer Michael Oatley had engaged in negotiations with a member of the IRA Army Council during which [...] "structures of disengagement" [...] from Ireland were discussed. This had meant a possible withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland. Loyalists killed 120 Catholics in 1975, the vast majority civilians. They hoped to force the IRA to retaliate in kind and thus hasten an end to the truce.|$|E

2500|$|The lack of {{features}} in the release version of the game became a point of contention, with many players using the Steam and GOG.com review pages, along with Metacritic reviews, to give it poor ratings. Sean Murray received {{a great deal of}} online criticism from players, including accusations of lying. A Reddit user temporarily took down the documented list of removed features after he received messages that congratulated him on [...] "really sticking it to these 'dirtbag' devs", which was not his intention in publishing the list; he <b>wanted</b> <b>no</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the anger towards Hello Games.

The Hello Games' Twitter account had been hacked into in October 2016 and used to post the message [...] "No Man’s Sky was a mistake" [...] among other tweets before the companies regained control of it, leading to confusion and additional drama within the community. Users sought refunds for the game via both Sony and Valve outside of the normal time allowance for claiming such refunds by their policies, citing the numerous bugs within the game and/or the lack {{of features}}, and while some players claim to have received such refunds, both companies have reemphasised their refund policies in response to the volume of refund requests.|$|E
