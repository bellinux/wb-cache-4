25|$|In February–March 1994, {{detailed}} {{reports from}} the Canadian embassy in Kigali meant that the Canadian government {{was one of the}} best informed nations in the world about the coming Rwandan genocide. The foreign minister André Ouellet claimed that he nor anyone else in the Cabinet ever saw the reports from Rwanda. On April 6, 1994, the Rwandan genocide began. The government in Ottawa was apparently kept well-informed about what was happening by diplomats and Canadian Forces serving as UN peacekeepers, but the genocide was not considered to be a major problem for Canada, with the Chrétien government taking the view that other powers would stop the genocide. The government first insisted in April 1994 that there was only a civil war in Rwanda, and once it become clear that genocide had begun, on May 2, 1994, Ouellet, speaking for the government in the House of Commons promised humanitarian aid and expressed the hope that the Organization for African Unity <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to stop the genocide. In 2010, the Canadian government apologized to the people of Rwanda for indifference to the genocide of 1994.|$|E

It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R.

500|$|The suits were {{eradicated}} when Take-Two petitioned U.S. District Court, SD FL {{to block}} the impending lawsuit, {{on the grounds that}} video games purchased for private entertainment could not be considered public nuisances. The following day, Thompson wrote on his website [...] "I have been praying, literally, that Take-Two and its lawyers <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> so stupid, that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take-Two.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in {{trying to figure out who}} <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. I understood why CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, Alvin Plantinga {{presented}} {{a version of}} the free will defence which, he argued, demonstrated that the existence of an omnipotent benevolent God and of evil are not inconsistent. He believed that, unless it could be shown that the two are not inconsistent, they would be necessarily contradictory. To do this, Plantinga believed that a [...] "possible state of affairs" [...] must be proposed which, if actual, would make God's existence and the existence of evil consistent. He argued that a third proposition– that evil {{is the result of the}} actions of free, rational, fallible human beings– allows the existence of God and evil to be consistent. Plantinga supported this argument by claiming that there are some things that an omnipotent God could not do, yet remain omnipotent– for example, if an omnipotent God has necessary existence, he could not create a world in which he does not exist. For this reason, Plantinga argued that an omnipotent God could not create any universe that he chooses, as Leibniz had proposed. He suggested that, even in a world where humans have free will, their actions may be so predictable that God could not create a world where they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> unpredictable. Finally, he argued that if every moral agent freely makes at least one bad moral decision in any possible universe, God cannot create a universe where there is human freedom and no evil. Plantinga maintained that the existence of an omnipotent, benevolent God and the existence of evil are not inconsistent.|$|E

500|$|Alyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress {{said that}} {{although}} {{it is common to}} see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos —exemplifying Rihanna's [...] "Man Down"— the public is aware of Spears's vulnerability, explaining that [...] "we believe she really would choose a guy who <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> like this to her." [...] Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him, the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal. She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for [...] "I Wanna Go". The video received comparisons to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love", which was released two days after [...] "Criminal", on October 19, 2011. Among the similarities, critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country; both contain scenes of sex, violence and crime; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears's boyfriend ("Would you try smiling just once?") a subtle dig at the press. She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call [...] "her every smile plastered on or conservator-mandated", and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident. According to her, that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal: it could be seen as him luring her into her life, but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun.|$|E

He just couldn't deal with success. He'd had an unhappy childhood that warped him a little and gave him a sour outlook on life. He had no close friends."

On December 3, 2015, the younger Rodgers had heroics of his own, catching a Hail Mary from Aaron Rodgers with no time left to help them beat the Detroit Lions 27–23. The Hail Mary was quickly coined as [...] "The Miracle in Motown". After the game Richard Rodgers II admitted thinking about The Play his father was part of stating [...] "It's a really special moment for him and I was kind of thinking on the play before, when Aaron got the facemask, I was kind of thinking we <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> like that.

2500|$|Several sources {{suggested}} possible {{motives for}} Wong's attack, including feelings of being [...] "degraded and disrespected" [...] for his poor English language skills, depression over losing his job, and difficulty in finding work in New York. A {{few years before}} the killings, he had worked as an engineer at Endicott Interconnect Technologies, a high-tech electronics company. In 2004, the company laid off five percent of its workforce. A coworker from that time said of him, [...] "He was quiet—not a violent person" [...] and [...] "I can't believe he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> like this". Press TV noted that Taliban leader Baituallah Mehsud {{claimed responsibility for the}} shootings, stating, [...] "They were my men. I gave them orders in reaction to US drone attacks."
