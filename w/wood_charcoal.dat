Women who are exposed to indoor coal smoke have about twice the risk and a number of the by-products of burning biomass are known or suspected carcinogens. This risk affects about 2.4billion people globally, and is believed to account for 1.5% of lung cancer deaths.|$|E

50|$|Until {{electric}} rice cookers {{came into}} common {{use in the}} 20th century, rice in Japan was cooked in a kamado, a traditional stove heated by <b>wood</b> or <b>charcoal.</b> Because regulating {{the heat of a}} <b>wood</b> or <b>charcoal</b> fire is more difficult, a layer of rice {{at the bottom of the}} pot would often be slightly burned during cooking; this layer, called okoge, was not discarded, but was eaten with vegetables or moistened with water, soup, or tea.|$|R
30|$|Elemental {{contents}} as {{percentages of}} carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N) for <b>wood</b> and <b>charcoal</b> were determined using a CHN analyzer (Perkin Elmer model 2400). The oxygen (O) content was calculated {{using the following}} equation: O (%) =  100  − (C + H + N + ash). The proximate analysis, including moisture, ash, and volatile matter (VM) contents in both <b>wood</b> and <b>charcoal,</b> were determined according to ASTM D 1762 [34]. Fixed C content was calculated by subtracting the contents of moisture, ash, and VM from 100.|$|R

25|$|Haiti also {{suffers from}} severe {{environmental}} degradation. Deforestation is rampant in Haiti; today less than 4 percent of Haiti’s forests remain, {{and in many}} places the soil has eroded {{right down to the}} bedrock. Haitians burn <b>wood</b> <b>charcoal</b> for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, Haitians have created an illegal market for coal on the Dominican side. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal.|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{of biomass}} fuels (<b>wood</b> and <b>charcoal)</b> for cooking {{releases}} smoke that contains health damaging pollutants. Women {{and children are}} the most affected. Exposure to biomass smoke is associated with acute respiratory infections (ARI). This study investigated the prevalence of ARI potentially caused by smoke from <b>wood</b> and <b>charcoal</b> stoves in Western Sierra Leone, as these two fuels are the predominant fuel types used for cooking. A cross sectional study was conducted for 520 women age 15 – 45 years; and 520 children under 5 years of age in homes that burn <b>wood</b> and <b>charcoal.</b> A questionnaire assessing demographic, household and exposure characteristics and ARI was administered to every woman who further gave information for the child. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) was continuously monitored in fifteen homes. ARI prevalence revealed 32 % and 24 % for women, 64 % and 44 % for children in homes with <b>wood</b> and <b>charcoal</b> stoves, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders for each group, the odds ratio of having suffered from ARI was similar for women, but remained large for children in homes with wood stoves relative to charcoal stoves (OR = 1. 14, 95 %CI: 0. 71 – 1. 82) and (OR = 2. 03, 95 %CI: 1. 31 – 3. 13), respectively. ARI prevalence was higher for children in homes with wood stoves compared with homes with charcoal stoves, but ARI prevalence for both types of fuels is higher compared with reported prevalence elsewhere. To achieve a reduction in ARI would require switching from <b>wood</b> and <b>charcoal</b> to cleaner fuels...|$|R

25|$|For {{the most}} {{powerful}} black powder, meal powder, a <b>wood</b> <b>charcoal,</b> is used. The best wood for the purpose is Pacific willow, but others such as alder or buckthorn can be used. In Great Britain between the 15th and 19th centuries charcoal from alder buckthorn was greatly prized for gunpowder manufacture; cottonwood {{was used by the}} American Confederate States. The ingredients are reduced in particle size and mixed as intimately as possible. Originally, this was with a mortar-and-pestle or a similarly operating stamping-mill, using copper, bronze or other non-sparking materials, until supplanted by the rotating ball mill principle with non-sparking bronze or lead. Historically, a marble or limestone edge runner mill, running on a limestone bed, was used in Great Britain; however, by the mid 19th century this had changed to either an iron-shod stone wheel or a cast iron wheel running on an iron bed. The mix was dampened with alcohol or water during grinding to prevent accidental ignition. This also helps the extremely soluble saltpeter to mix into the microscopic nooks and crannies of the very high surface-area charcoal.|$|E
500|$|Three factors {{threaten}} ring-tailed lemurs. First {{and foremost}} is habitat destruction. [...] Starting nearly 2,000years {{ago with the}} introduction of humans to the island, forests have been cleared to produce pasture and agricultural land. Extraction of hardwoods for fuel and lumber, as well mining and overgrazing, have also taken their toll. [...] Today, it is estimated that 90% of Madagascar's original forest cover has been lost. Rising populations have created even greater demand in the southwest portion of the island for fuel <b>wood,</b> <b>charcoal,</b> and lumber. Fires from the clearing of grasslands, as well as slash-and-burn agriculture destroy forests. [...] Another threat to the species is harvesting either for food (bush meat) or pets. Finally, periodic drought common to southern Madagascar can impact populations already in decline. [...] In 1991 and 1992, for example, a severe drought caused an abnormally high mortality rate among infants and females at the Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve. [...] Two years later, the population had declined by 31% and took nearly four years to start to recover.|$|E
