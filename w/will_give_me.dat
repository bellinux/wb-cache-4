2500|$|Hawking has {{estimated}} that he studied about a thousand hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, {{and he decided to}} answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) necessary. Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the oral to describe his future plans, he said, [...] "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> a First." [...] He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners [...] "were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves". After receiving a first-class BA (Hons.) degree in natural science and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.|$|E

Ingraham accepted his apology: [...] "Ed Schultz said something about me on his show that was not all that nice, to say the least. It was pretty crude. He apologized, and I accept his apology. It seemed heartfelt, {{it seemed like he}} really wished he hadn't said it and I accept that apology." [...] MSNBC issued a statement saying that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave over the matter. Schultz ended his radio show on May 23, 2014. He stated on MSNBC, [...] "This change <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> more flexibility to be on the road, to do the kind of shows I want to do here for The Ed Show here on MSNBC.

2500|$|In 1784, when Penniman was 24, she {{was living}} {{with her mother and}} step-father, Mr. Wall, in Westminster. He was {{probably}} attempting to recover some of the lost possessions of the family. But Brush’s vast acres had been sequestered to the state; even his library and furniture had been scattered. Gen. Ethan Allen, who had frequent occasion to visit Westminster, fell a victim to Penniman's charms. Gen. Allen was at this time a widower of 47, with three or four children. On February 16th, Gen. Allen entered Margaret’s apartment, and found Penniman in a morning gown, standing on a chair, arranging china on the shelves of a china-closet. After a few words of greeting, he said to her, “Fanny, if we are ever to be married, now is the time, for I am on my way to Arlington." [...] “Very well,” she replied, “if you <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> time to get my josie.” In a very short time she was ready, and together they entered the breakfast-room where a group of judges were sitting. Chief-Justice Robinson was asked by Allen to perform the ceremony. To Robinson’s astonished question “When?” the answer was “Now.” The judge suggested that {{it was a matter of}} importance which required due consideration, to which Allen replied, implying that with such a bride long consideration was unnecessary. The ceremony was performed, interrupted at one point by Allen, who when called upon to promise “agreeable to the law of God,” exclaimed after a glance out the window, [...] "The law of God as written in the Book of Nature? Yes, go on." [...] The ceremony concluded, the bride’s trunk and guitar-case were placed in the sleigh and they left for their home in Arlington.|$|E
