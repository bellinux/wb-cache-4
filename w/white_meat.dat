5|$|The company sells {{slightly}} {{different versions of}} the sandwich between international markets, using <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E
25|$|Striped bass has <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> {{with a mild}} {{flavor and}} a medium texture. It is {{extremely}} versatile in {{that it can be}} pan-seared, grilled, steamed, poached, roasted, broiled, sautéed, and deep fried (including batter-frying). The flesh can also be eaten raw or pickled.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{analysis}} of the FAO the overall consumption for <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> between 1990 and 2009 has dramatically increased. For example, poultry meat has increased by 76.6% per kilo per capita and pig meat by 19.7%. However, on the contrary, bovine meat has decreased from /capita in 1990 to /capita in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Turkeys {{are usually}} baked or roasted in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the {{remainder}} of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is necessary because the dark meat requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment than the <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> (which is very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills prior to serving.|$|E
25|$|Chicken McNuggets – {{introduced}} in 1983 {{as a replacement}} for the McChicken, these are small chicken chunks served with dipping sauces of barbecue, sweet n' sour, honey, and hot mustard. Available in 4, 6, 10 (originally 9), or 20 pieces. Up until 2003, they were a combination of white and dark meat, now they are made with only <b>white</b> <b>meat.</b> In 2011, five new dipping sauces were introduced and added to the line-up: sweet chilli, honey mustard, spicy buffalo, and creamy ranch. With the addition of these new dipping sauces, McDonald's began phasing out the Hot Mustard sauce, and by February 2014, it had been discontinued in most U.S. markets.|$|E
25|$|Snack Wrap – a wrap {{made with}} <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> chicken breast (crispy or grilled), lettuce, {{shredded}} Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese, and a sauce (Spicy Buffalo, Ranch, Honey mustard, Chipotle barbecue, or Salsa Roja, the breakfast {{sauce on the}} McSkillet), wrapped in a soft flour tortilla. It was launched on July 1, 2006. Chipotle BBQ is the most recent flavor. Available in the United States, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Brazil. There is also a Mac Snack Wrap which features the fixings of the Big Mac, but without the bun and wrapped in a tortilla shell, and uses one half {{of a piece of}} quarter meat.|$|E
50|$|Mexican cuisine {{is known}} for its {{blending}} of Indigenous and European cultures, and to a lesser extent, African and Asian. The cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. Traditionally, the main Mexican ingredients consisted of maize, beans, both red and <b>white</b> <b>meats,</b> potatoes, tomatoes, seafood, chili peppers, squash, nuts, avocados and various herbs native to Mexico.|$|R
50|$|Seafood {{and fish}} were important, {{not least because}} they could be eaten during Lent and Fridays, unlike meat. Red meats were {{preferable}} to <b>white</b> <b>meats,</b> and amongst the former beef was the most favoured. Pigs were eaten primarily by the poor, especially during winter, because of their ease in rearing. Poultry was widely enjoyed, particularly by the clergy, who were permitted to eat 'two-legged' but not 'four-legged' meat.|$|R
50|$|The shoal bass has <b>white,</b> flaky <b>meat,</b> {{which tends}} to be drier {{than that of a}} largemouth or spotted bass.|$|R
25|$|White wine is {{also used}} as a wetting agent for slow cooking. In this type of dish it {{combines}} {{the flexibility of the}} meat and balances the fat from the sauce. It plays this role in the case of cabbage, baeckeoffe or risotto, and in the gravy in the preparation of <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> as in osso buco or Blanquette de veau (veal stew), Chicken with morels and its variants, Chicken à la comtoise and Yellow Coq au vin, rabbit or with charcuterie such as Diots and tripe. It {{can also be used to}} prepare fish and seafood dishes such as pôchouse with Burgundy wine, monkfish stew, Flounder stew, mussels in white wine, or a Seafood Pot-au-feu.|$|E
25|$|McChicken – a mildly spicy chicken sandwich, {{offered in}} a spicier variant as the Hot n' Spicy in some markets. Made from 100% ground <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> chicken, mayonnaise, and {{shredded}} lettuce, on a toasted bun. A full-size version {{was introduced in}} 1980, later removed, and reintroduced in 1988. In some markets, it is not spicy, and in others, a cajun spiced version is also offered. It {{remains one of the}} biggest sellers, just behind the Big Mac. The larger sandwich was replaced with the Crispy Chicken Deluxe in 1996, and brought back in 1998 in the current smaller size, and marketed as the Cajun (Style) McChicken. In Australia, the average serving size for a McChicken is 185grams. In Canada, it remains a full-size sandwich, while the US' smaller version is sold as the Junior Chicken.|$|E
25|$|At mealtimes {{very dry}} wines with little {{minerals}} are recommended with oysters and seafood: their acidity reveals the salinity of the shellfish. The most fragrant wines go well with shellfish, fish, or poached <b>white</b> <b>meat.</b> For stews the acidity {{of white wine}} counterbalances the weight of fat. If the sauce is well balanced with an intense ingredient (lemon juice or mustard) a more opulent wine can be recommended: sweet or dry wine aged in barrels. Sweet wines either just sweet or fortified are a good option for exotic dishes with sweet spices (dishes with cinnamon, vanilla etc.). Fortified white wines are recommended with foie gras. Sparkling wines can be taken {{at any time during}} the meal, their diversity allows this. A choice of sparkling wine also allows the retention of the same wine from the beginning to the end of the meal.|$|E
50|$|Cooking {{requires}} applying heat {{to a food}} which usually, {{though not}} always, chemically changes the molecules, thus changing its flavor, texture, appearance, and nutritional properties. Cooking certain proteins, such as egg <b>whites,</b> <b>meats,</b> and fish, denatures the protein, causing it to firm. There is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at Homo erectus campsites dating from 420,000 years ago. Boiling {{as a means of}} cooking requires a container, and has been practiced at least since the 10th millennium BC with the introduction of pottery.|$|R
50|$|<b>White</b> crab <b>meat</b> {{comes from}} the claws and legs of the crab and while {{predominantly}} white in colour {{it does have a}} naturally occurring red/brown tinge throughout. White crab is very low in fat and particularly high in protein, it has a delicate, sweet flavour, a sweet aroma and a naturally flaky texture. <b>White</b> crab <b>meat</b> is versatile and while it is consumed largely in sandwiches, it can be used in pastas, risottos, and salads as well as a canape topping.|$|R

500|$|Generally, {{chickens}} are not fried whole; instead, {{the chicken}} is divided into its constituent pieces. The two <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> sections are the breast and the wing {{from the front of}} the chicken, while the dark meat sections are the thigh and leg or [...] "drumstick", are from the rear of the chicken. These pieces are usually subdivided into the wings, the breasts (the wishbone is often cut out first in home cooking), the legs, and the thighs. The ribs are sometimes left on the breast, but commercially they and the back are usually discarded.|$|E
500|$|Around {{one third}} of the weight of an adult edible crab is meat, of which one third is <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> from the claws (see declawing of crabs), and two thirds is brown meat from the body. As food, male edible crabs are {{referred}} to as cocks and females as hens. Cocks have more sweet white meat; hens have more rich brown meat. Dishes include [...] (crab meat arranged in the cleaned shell, sometimes with decoration of other foodstuffs), soups such as bisque or bouillabaisse, pâtés, mousses and hot soufflés.|$|E
500|$|Homarus gammarus is {{traditionally}} [...] "highly esteemed" [...] as a foodstuff and was mentioned in [...] "The Crabfish" [...] a seventeenth century English folk song. It may fetch very high prices {{and may be}} sold fresh, frozen, canned or powdered. Both the claws and the abdomen of H.gammarus contain [...] "excellent" [...] <b>white</b> <b>meat,</b> {{and most of the}} contents of the cephalothorax are edible. The exceptions are the gastric mill and the [...] "sand vein" [...] (gut). The price of H.gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H.americanus, and the European species is considered to be more flavored.|$|E
50|$|The white wine, vinho branco, {{made from}} locally-grown Moscatel grapes, has a fresh taste, unique clarity, and golden shades. Odors include that of {{semi-sweet}} citric fruits like the grapefruit. These characteristics are noticed visually {{and on the}} palate, where the wine combines harmoniously with the alcohol content. The white also has a subtle, residual sweetness to be enjoyed with appetizers or with fish, shellfish, <b>white</b> <b>meats,</b> or Chã's goat cheese. This elegant wine is best served at a temperature of 10 °C and can be saved for 2-3 years if stored correctly.|$|R

500|$|For this reason, {{pork and}} <b>white</b> <b>meat</b> were {{more common than}} beef and thick fatty strips of salted bacon (or rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages. The {{practice}} of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike {{the practice of the}} Maasai) was common and black pudding, made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the [...] "breakfast roll".|$|E

500|$|In many {{international}} markets, BK offers {{products or}} condiments that fit local tastes. For example, in Canada, BK offers poutine gravy and vinegar for its French fries, and peri-peri sauce is {{available as a}} sandwich topping in the United Kingdom. Hungry Jack's, Burger King's Australian franchise, offers the [...] "Aussie burger" [...] with fried egg, beetroot, and other Australian flavors. In Asian markets, dark-meat chicken is preferred over <b>white</b> <b>meat,</b> and poultry products sold in these markets often are advertised as such. One of the more regionally differentiated lines of products is the company's dessert offerings. In the United States, BK offers several desserts, including Otis Spunkmeyer chocolate-chip cookies, apple pie slices, Hershey's Sundae pie slices (a type of chocolate creme pie), and a rotating pie {{as part of its}} dessert menu. Internationally the company sells turnovers, tortas, Cini-Minis, muffins, brownies, and vanilla soft-serve ice cream in cones and sundaes. In most markets where BK sells ice cream, it also sells a mix-in dessert under various names. Some of these international dessert products differ from the domestic products in terms of preparation; an example is the pies sold in Asian countries that are fried, turnover-style, instead of the deep-dish tart style associated with American sweet-filled pies.|$|E
