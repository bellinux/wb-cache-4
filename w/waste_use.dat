40|$|ABSTRACT The {{composition}} of organic waste (OW) {{and its effect}} on soil processes may change soil fertility and electrical conductivity (EC). The side effects of <b>waste</b> <b>use</b> in crop fertilization are poorly understood for Brazilian soils. This study examined the effect of the addition of 15 different organic wastes to Oxisols and a Neosol on pH, base saturation, EC, cation exchange capacity (CEC at pH 7), and the availability of Al, macro (P, K, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and S) and micronutrients (B, Fe 2 +, Mn 2 +, Cu 2 + and Zn 2 +). Soil samples (150 g) were treated with chicken, pig, horse, cattle, and quail manures, sewage sludge 1 and 2, eucalyptus sawdust, plant substrate, coconut fiber, pine bark, coffee husk, peat, limed compost, and biochar. Wastes were added considering a fixed amount of C (2 g kg- 1), which resulted in waste rates ranging from 2. 5 to 25. 6 Mg ha- 1. The soil-waste mixtures were incubated for 330 days in laboratory conditions. The waste liming or acidification values were soil-dependent. The use of some manures and compost increased the pH to levels above of those considered adequate for plant growth. The soil EC was slightly increased in the Neosol and in the medium textured Oxisol, but it was sharply changed (from 195 to 394 µS cm- 1) by the addition of organic wastes in the clayey Oxisol, although the EC values were below the range considered safe for plant growth. Changes in the soil availability of P, K+, Ca 2 + and Zn 2 + were highly related to the inputs of these nutrients by the wastes, and other factors in soil changed due to <b>waste</b> <b>use.</b> Organic <b>waste</b> <b>use</b> simultaneously affects different soil fertility attributes; thus, in addition to the target nutrient added to the soil, the soil acidity buffering capacity and the waste liming and agronomic value {{must be taken into account}} in the waste rate definition...|$|E

40|$|One way {{to manage}} swine waste is to spread it on {{agricultural}} land, but few swine producers have enough land to which to apply all the waste generated by their operation. Crop producers wishing to use swine waste {{on their land}} must address {{issues such as the}} cost of transporting liquid waste and the limits on <b>waste</b> <b>use</b> imposed by food safety certification requirements. Composting can help address these concerns. Processing the liquid waste by composting it eliminates the need to transport and apply liquids.

Soil NPK, main point altitude, latitude and longitude, fertilizer cost last cropping, and fertilizer cost with the used of NPK map were gathered and evaluated through multiple linear regression and comparison of sum.

It was shown that C 4 -dicarboxylic acids enhanced activity of surfactant biosynthesis enzymes. Cultivation on mixture of substrates resulted in increased surfactants quantity. Searching for {{the ways to}} process waste has become very topical today. Biotechnology {{is one of the}} most environmentally attractive methods, which has the ability to solve the problem of waste utilization and to produce the valuable microbial products, for example biosurfactants. Due to their physico-chemical properties, the use of microbial surfactants have been proposed for various industrial applications, as additives in foods, cosmetics and detergent formulations [1, p. 427, 4, p. 478]. In the food industry, the most useful property is the ability to form stable emulsions, which improves the texture and creaminess of dairy products. Biosurfactants are also used to retard staling, solubilise flavour oils and improve organoleptic properties in bakery and ice cream formulations and as fat stabilisers during cooking of fats.

40|$|Biodiesel from used {{cooking oil}} (UCO) {{is one of}} the most {{sustainable}} solutions to replace conventional fossil fuels in the transport sector. It can achieve greenhouse gas savings up to 88 % and at the same time reducing the disposal of a polluting waste. In addition, it does not provoke potential negative impacts that conventional biofuels may eventually cause linked to the use of arable land. For this reason, most policy frameworks favor its consumption. This is the case of the EU policy that double-counters the use of residue and <b>waste</b> <b>use</b> to achieve the renewable energy target in the transport sector. According to different sources, biodiesel produced from UCO could replace around 1. 5 %– 1. 8 % of the EU- 27 diesel consumption. This paper presents an in-depth thermoeconomic analysis of the UCO biodiesel life cycle to understand its cost formation process. It calculates the ExROI value (exergy return on investment) and renewability factor, and it demonstrates that thermoeconomics is a useful tool to assess life cycles of renewable energy systems.

40|$|Bioprocessing {{applications}} are gaining {{importance in the}} traditional chemical industries. With environmental, political, and economical concerns growing, research efforts have recently focused on the substitution of petroleum-derived transportation fuels and materials. As possible products and feedstocks are being investigated, {{it is important to}} ensure the new processes are also sustainable. There are several aspects to developing sustainable processes: minimize <b>waste,</b> <b>use</b> environmentally-benign chemicals, find renewable feedstocks, and limit the number of processing steps. This thesis examines ways to enhance the sustainability of bioprocesses. Novel, alternative solvent systems are studied and applied to a variety of bioprocesses. Downstream processing steps and waste can be minimized by designing systems that combine reactions and separations into one process unit. This is accomplished by designing new reactor systems and by replacing currently used solvents. Additional studies, involving analytical techniques that reduce the use of organic solvents, are tested and applied to industrial problems. Finally, new solvent systems are examined for potential processes using renewable carbohydrate feedstock. Ph. D.

Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has processed {sup 238 }PuO{sub 2 } fuel into heat sources for space and terrestrial uses {{for the past several}} decades. The 88 -year half-life of {sup 238 }Pu and thermal power of approximately 0. 6 watts/gram make this isotope ideal for missions requiring many years of dependable service in inaccessible locations. However, the same characteristic which makes {sup 238 }Pu attractive for heat source applications, the high Curie content (17 Ci/gram versus 0. 06 Ci/gram for 239 {sup Pu}), makes disposal of {sup 238 }Pu-contaminated waste difficult.

40|$|International @ AIR+SGI:AGFInternational audienceEnvironment {{friendly}} chemistry {{plays an}} important role in the design of novel catalysts. One of the ways to satisfy the requirements for this purpose such as decrease of <b>waste,</b> <b>use</b> of materials with low toxicity, reduction of assistant materials or minimum energy consumption, is the use of nanoreactors or microreactors. In this sense, microencapsulation method has been recently recognized as an useful alternative strategy to immobilize metal catalyst onto polymers. The microencapsulation refers to the incorporation of an active substance in a shell or a matrix of a carrier component. The resulting catalysts can be separated from a reaction mixture by simple filtration and recycled, which makes them suitable from green chemistry. Gold based catalysts have been shown to be active in the liquid phase selective oxidation of glycerol, reaction of high industrial interest due to the increasing expansion of the biodiesel production. The microencapsulation of gold particles could offer a solution to problems associated with catalytic activity, selectivity and stability. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the effect of different suspension agents for the preparation of poly(urea-formaldehyde) microparticles containing gold. Furthermore, the influence of the morphological and physical properties of resulted microparticles for the oxidation of glycerol reaction was also evaluated...|$|E
