5|$|The London and Southwestern Railway (LSWR) became {{interested}} in using Cannon Street as a terminus, as it <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> connection between Waterloo and the City.|$|E
5|$|Between June 1990 and 1998, Highway401 and Interstate75 {{were used}} for a pilot project named Advantage I-75 to test the {{reliability}} and versatility of an automated tracking system for transport trucks. Termed MACS for Mainline Automated Clearance System, it <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> truck to travel from Florida to Ontario without a second inspection.|$|E
5|$|By 14November, {{the concept}} had been {{approved}} by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. Following the announcement, Wam stated that NSB would continue to operate the service, and use the Timetoget concept. An internal document the newspaper Varden received access to showed that NSB needed to calm down the heated discussions with the labor unions, and that their negativity to Timetoget was a tactical move to satisfy the labor unions. Minister of Transport, Terje Moe Gustavsen from the Labour Party, stated in a meeting with two parliamentarians from Telemark, that he <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> new private company, without NSB ownership, to operate the line.|$|E

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E
5|$|Most gliders do {{not have}} engines or at least engines that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> {{take-off}} under their own power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice {{for the type of}} launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised {{his future}} {{publication}} of Swift's collected works in four volumes in the Dublin Journal. However, this edition led to controversy, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had publication rights, under English copyright law, {{to many of}} the works included in Faulkner's edition. The English, in 1735, attempted to pass a law that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> copyright holder to prohibit works that may violate their copyright, but this law failed to pass through Parliament.|$|E
50|$|At the Rump Session of CRYPTO 2006, Christian Rechberger and Christophe De Cannière {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} a collision attack on SHA-1 that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>an</b> attacker to select at least parts of the message.|$|R
5000|$|Originally named LanFan Technologies, {{the company}} was founded in February 1986 when Dana Doggett began {{exploring}} {{the concept of a}} software application that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>an</b> instructor to leverage a local area network to teach using technology.|$|R
25|$|The {{broadcast}} {{frequency of the}} microwave downlink (if used) would require isolating the SBSP systems away from other satellites. GEO space is already well used and it is considered unlikely the ITU <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>an</b> SPS to be launched.|$|R
5|$|Peierls {{knew the}} {{importance}} {{of the size of the}} critical mass that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} {{the next month}} in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP {{to form a new}} Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> Democrat to win the presidency.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lunar {{missions}} (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a free return trajectory, keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit, which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> return to Earth {{in case the}} SM engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion. Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change, which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI, and eliminated the free-return option.|$|E

5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
5|$|A {{bill was}} {{introduced}} into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> casino in Prince George's County. The two likely spots were National Harbor or Rosecroft. The bill passed the Senate, but the House did not vote on it. The bill was passed and signed by the Governor in August 2012 to allow a casino in Prince George's County, which was passed via referendum in November 2012. After one season of live racing, Penn National and Cloverleaf reached an agreement to extend live racing at Rosecroft {{for the next two}} years. The only exception is if National Harbor becomes the location for the Prince George's County casino.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941, {{following}} {{the construction of}} the central north–south Stuart Highway, the federal government announced its decision to build the east–west highway between Norseman and Port Augusta. A northerly route, close to the Trans-Australian Railway, had been considered, but extensive limestone outcrops made it impractical. Taking a route east from Norseman, with some detours around limestone ridges, <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> road to be formed quickly and easily. With a war in the Pacific seemingly imminent, construction soon began, in July 1941. The Army was responsible for fuel, food, and communications, while the state government departments of Main Roads (Western Australia) and Highways (South Australia) managed the actual construction.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{preferred}} route known as 'Alignment B' it has provision a stop at Renwick Road on the London, Tilbury & Southend Railway if it is needed in the future. This <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>an</b> interchange between the London Overground and c2c services..|$|R

5|$|On February 24, 2016, the MTA {{allocated}} $66 {{million to}} speed up the construction of the first phase so that it could open in December. However, by June, the project was not being built at a rate that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> December 2016 completion. Concerns about the line's timely opening persisted through October and November, with key systems such as elevators, escalators, and fire alarms not having been tested. The third rail was energized and test trains began running through the new line on October 9, 2016, with weights to simulate rush hour loads; non-revenue Q trains, taken out of service at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, started running through the subway in November 2016.|$|E
5|$|The formula {{was enacted}} as law {{to limit the}} weight-to-length ratio of a {{commercial}} motor vehicle (CMV). The formula is necessary to prevent the concentrated weight on a truck's axle from producing stress on bridge members (possibly causing a bridge collapse). In simplified form, this is analogous to a person walking on thin ice. When standing upright, a person's weight is concentrated {{at the bottom of}} their feet, funneling all of their weight into a small area. When lying down, a person's weight is distributed over a much larger area. This difference in weight distribution <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body weight while standing up. For an overweight truck to comply with the formula, more axles must be added, the distance between axles must be increased, or weight must be removed.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should be abolished because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
50|$|Hagen {{developed}} analytical {{techniques that}} <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>an</b> examination {{and analysis of}} various types of DNA damage. He {{was among the first}} German radiation biologists to become aware of the important role of DNA repair in endpoints such as mutagenesis, aberration formation, cell death, and carcinogenesis.|$|R
50|$|The SR-47 is an {{outgrowth}} of the Colt M4 Carbine's SOPMOD system. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, SOCOM placed a proposal through DARPA for <b>a</b> system that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>an</b> M16 rifle or M4 carbine to fire 7.62x39mm ammo fed from common or standard-issue Kalashnikov magazines.|$|R
25|$|The current North River Tunnels <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> {{maximum of}} 24 one-way {{crossings}} per hour; the Gateway proposal <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>an</b> additional 25 trains per hour. In May 2014 Amtrak C.E.O. Joseph Boardman told the Regional Plan Association {{that there was}} something less than 20 years before {{one or both of the}} tunnels would have to be shut down.|$|R
5|$|President Carlos Menem {{sought a}} {{constitutional}} amendment to allow his re-election, and Alfonsín opposed it. The victory in the 1993 midterm elections strengthened the PJ, which approved the bill in the Senate. Menem proposed a referendum on the amendment, to force the radical deputies to support it. He also proposed a bill for a law that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> constitutional amendment with a simple majority of the Congress. As a result, Alfonsín made the Pact of Olivos with him. With this agreement, the UCR would support Menem's proposal, but with further amendments that would reduce presidential power. The Council of Magistrates of the Nation reduced the influence of the executive power over the judiciary, the city of Buenos Aires would become an autonomous territory allowed to elect its own mayor, and the presidential term of office would be reduced to four years. The presidential elections would include the two-round system, and the electoral college would be abolished. Alfonsín was elected to the constituent assembly that worked for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. A faction of the UCR, led by Fernando delaRúa, opposed the pact, but the party as a whole supported Alfonsín. The UCR got only 19% of the vote in the elections, attaining third position in the 1995 presidential elections behind the Frepaso, when Menem was re-elected. Alfonsín resigned the presidency of the party in that year.|$|E

30|$|Conclusion There {{is a need}} {{of adults}} PICRD at Amiens University Hospital.
