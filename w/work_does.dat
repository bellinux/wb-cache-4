5|$|His Dwie drogi (Two ways, 1959) {{about the}} January Uprising of the 1860s {{represent}} the latest historical period he has tackled. His other popular historical books include Trzej kronikarze, (Three chroniclers; 1964), {{a book about}} three medieval chroniclers of Polish history (Thietmar of Merseburg, Gallus Anonymus and Wincenty Kadłubek), in which he discusses the Polish society through ages; and Ostatnia z rodu (Last of the Family; 1965) about the last queen of the Jagiellon dynasty, Anna Jagiellonka. His Rozważania o wojnie domowej (1978; Thoughts on Civil War) were the last book he has finished; unlike majority of his other works, this book is ostensibly about the civil war (Chouannerie) in Brittany, France. This <b>work</b> <b>does</b> however contains numerous arguments applicable to more modern Polish history; arguments that Jasienica thought {{would not be allowed}} by the censors if the book discussed Polish history.|$|E

40|$|During walking, muscles must perform {{positive}} work {{to replace the}} energy lost from the body at each step, even if the average speed is constant and the terrain level. Young children have immature and irregular walk, but {{little is known about}} the effect of this walking pattern on the muscular external <b>work</b> <b>done.</b> Our objective was to measure using force platforms and the method of Cavagna (J Appl Physiol 39 : 174 - 179, 1975) the amount of muscular external <b>work</b> <b>done</b> by 1 -year-old-, 4 -year-old children and adults during walking. We were interested to quantify the approximation made by measuring only the positive external <b>work</b> <b>done</b> and assuming it reflects the external <b>work</b> <b>done.</b> After having confirmed that young children were not able to walk at a constant average speed over a complete number of steps, we showed the effect of the selection of trials by measuring the external <b>work</b> <b>done</b> assuming the amount of positive <b>work</b> <b>done</b> is equal to the negative <b>work</b> <b>done</b> (supposing there is no acceleration or deceleration over a complete number of steps). We observed that even if young subjects were not able to walk at a constant lateral speed over a complete number of steps, the amount of <b>work</b> <b>done</b> to maintain the center of mass movements in the transversal plane is not more than 10 % of the external positive <b>work</b> <b>done.</b> This observational study points out that the measurement of external work, a good summary indicator for the gait mechanics, may be interpreted precociously when the population studied walked irregularly...|$|R
25|$|The Principles of Quantum Mechanics (1930): This book summarises {{the ideas}} of quantum {{mechanics}} using the modern formalism that was largely developed by Dirac himself.

25|$|Meditations are {{reflective}} thought poems. Like the Montage and the Series subgenres, Meditations can {{be somewhat}} fragmented, yet their connectivity {{is what makes}} the long poem a coherent and cohesive idea. This subgenre is based on meditations (or thoughts). Wallace Stevens believes, as do other writers in this genre, that the <b>work</b> <b>does</b> not rely on the use of multiple voices.|$|E
25|$|Such {{statements}} of the first law for closed systems assert the existence of internal energy {{as a function of}} state defined in terms of adiabatic work. Thus heat is not defined calorimetrically or as due to temperature difference. It is defined as a residual difference between change of internal energy and work done on the system, when that <b>work</b> <b>does</b> not account for the whole of the change of internal energy and the system is not adiabatically isolated.|$|E

25|$|Generally, the {{well-being}} {{of those who are}} employed is higher than those who are unemployed. Employment itself may not increase subjective well-being, but facilitates activities that do (such as supporting a family, philanthropy, and education). While <b>work</b> <b>does</b> increase well-being through providing income, income level is not as indicative of subjective well-being as other benefits related to employment. Feelings of autonomy and mastery, found in higher levels in the employed than unemployed, are stronger predictors of subjective well-being than wealth.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, Cao Yu {{completed}} {{the writing of}} his fifth play, Peking Man, considered his most profound and successful work. Set in Peking (today Beijing) as its name implies, and in the then present, surprisingly the <b>work</b> <b>does</b> not allude to the war with Japan at all, but chronicles {{the history of a}} well-heeled family that is incapable of surviving and adapting to social changes which are destroying the traditional world and culture in which they live. The title of the work is an allusion to the so-called Peking Man, the proto-human who inhabited the north of China several hundred thousand years ago. Cao Yu's recurrent themes are present, emphasizing the inability of traditional families to adapt themselves to modern society and its customs and ways.|$|E
25|$|Unkei's Miroku Butsu {{is in the}} {{tradition}} of previous Buddha figures, including those of his father and ultimately Tori Busshi. Like the works of those sculptors, the Buddha is depicted as seated and backed by an intricate halo. However, Unkei's work features further strides toward realism. Crystal inlays cause the eyes to shine, and details are carved deeply and in new detail. Furthermore, Unkei's <b>work</b> <b>does</b> not follow the canon of proportions established by Jōchō in the Heian period. Unkei's figure instead has a long torso that does not match the distance between the figures knees (a style used by sculptors for the preceding 150 years). Despite this, Unkei's Buddha does not look unbalanced or unwieldy. Rather, it is a lifelike Buddha who seems kind and empathic. In essence, Unkei created a new style of sculpture.|$|E
25|$|Ruiz’s <b>work</b> <b>does</b> {{focus on}} race issues, {{considering}} she calls for “an essential Latin ‘difference,’ believing Latinos to be culturally and morally superior,” but her work also encompasses political issues. She warns against U.S. expansionism and corporate monopolies. For instance, in both her novels, she feminizes the male characters in order “to depict the subordinated status of those ‘handicapped’ by societal constraints”. These male characters are hurt by forces of decay and corruption. For example, in Squatter and the Don, the Californio men are victim to both illnesses and land loss {{because of the}} government. This novel centers on {{the corruption of the}} United States government due to the combination of capitalism with democracy. Ruiz paints the enemy here not to be the squatters, but the railroad barons. Even the Alamars and the Darrells, who in the end foster true love and marriage despite race, fall victim to the railroad barons.|$|E

25|$|Subsequently in July and August 2007, Dembski {{played a}} central role in the {{formation}} of the Evolutionary Informatics Lab (EIL), cofounded with Baylor University Engineering Professor Robert J. Marks II. According to Baylor administration, the EIL website hosted at Baylor was deleted because it violated university policy forbidding professors from creating the impression that their personal views represent Baylor as an institution. Dembski says the website was removed because it dealt with intelligent design. Baylor said they would permit Marks to repost his website on their server, provided a 108-word disclaimer accompany any intelligent design-advancing research to make clear that the <b>work</b> <b>does</b> not represent the university's position. The site now resides on a third-party server and still contains the material advancing intelligent design.

500|$|Dickinson left {{no formal}} {{statement}} of her aesthetic intentions and, {{because of the}} variety of her themes, her <b>work</b> <b>does</b> not fit conveniently into any one genre.

40|$|Based on a Hamiltonian {{description}} {{we present}} a rigorous derivation of the transient state work fluctuation theorem and the Jarzynski equality for a classical harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to a harmonic heat bath, which is dragged by an external agent. Coupling with the bath makes the dynamics dissipative. Since we do not assume anything about the spectral nature of the harmonic bath the derivation is not restricted only to the Ohmic bath, rather it is more general, for a non-Ohmic bath. We also derive expressions of the average <b>work</b> <b>done</b> and the variance of the <b>work</b> <b>done</b> {{in terms of the}} two-time correlation function of the fluctuations of the position of the harmonic oscillator. In the case of an Ohmic bath, we use these relations to evaluate the average <b>work</b> <b>done</b> and the variance of the <b>work</b> <b>done</b> analytically and verify the transient state work fluctuation theorem quantitatively.
