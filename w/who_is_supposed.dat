5|$|In 2006, Parker {{played the}} male lead in Rome & Jewel, a hip-hop take on Romeo and Juliet that got mothballed and re-released in 2008. Parker's title character, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> {{to be the}} modern day Romeo, was a Compton youth with both {{tenderness}} and toughness. Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The New York Times. In 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency that was new to him but very familiar to the audience.|$|E
5|$|An {{interpretation}} of {{the story about the}} Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E

5|$|In Act I, the Shard-bearer's story resumes {{after the}} defeat of the King of Shadows. The player awakens alone in an {{underground}} barrow in Rashemen, where he meets Safiya, a Red Wizard of Thay. The player follows Safiya to the Veil Theater in the nearby town of Mulsantir, hoping to find Lienna, an acquaintance of Safiya’s mother, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to provide the player with some much-needed answers. Unfortunately, the player finds that the theater has been attacked by Red Wizards, and Lienna has been killed. At the back of the theater, the player finds a portal to the Plane of Shadow, a dark reflection of the Prime Material Plane, where he defeats the Red Wizards who murdered Lienna. Upon returning to the Prime Material Plane, the player finds that the spirit-god Okku has besieged Mulsantir, demanding the player’s blood. The player confronts Okku and defeats his spirit army. At the end of the battle, the player learns that he has become a spirit-eater, an accursed being who must feed upon feys and elementals (and sometimes mortal souls) in order to survive.|$|E

The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, {{we will not be able}} to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in Being and Time or why he left it unfinished.|$|E

A 93 oz (2.9kg) silver chain dating to 500–800 was found just to the south of Torvean in 1983. A church or a monk's cell is thought to have been established by early Celtic monks on St Michael's Mount, a mound close to the river, now the site of the Old High Church and graveyard. The castle is said to have been built by Máel Coluim III (Malcolm III) of Scotland, after he had razed to the ground the castle in which Mac Bethad mac Findláich (Macbeth) had, according to much later tradition, murdered Máel Coluim's father Donnchad (Duncan I), and which stood on a hill around 1km to the north-east.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the work}} is widely {{thought to have been}} painted from life, the {{identity}} of the model is subject to much speculation. In contemporary Spain it was acceptable for artists to employ male nude models for studies; however, the use of female nude models was frowned upon. The painting {{is believed to have been}} executed during one of Velázquez's visits to Rome, and Prater has observed that in Rome the artist [...] "did indeed lead a life of considerable personal liberty that would have been consistent with the notion of using a live nude female model". It has been claimed that the painting depicts a mistress Velázquez is known to have had while in Italy, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to have borne his child. Others have claimed that the model is the same as in Coronation of the Virgin and Las Hilanderas, both in the Museo del Prado, and other works.|$|E

When Nina was cast in Harold's play, Mission Erinsborough, alongside Jack, she realised that she liked him too and they begin an affair. Peter Mattessi of The Age said their love [...] "bubbled until it almost erupted". Nina broke up with Taj so she could be with Jack, but before Jack could break up with his girlfriend Lori Lee (Michelle Ang), she was paralysed during an accident. Jack became torn over whether to leave Lori and be with Nina. Both Lori and Taj found out about Nina and Jack, so Nina decided to remain single, but eventually she and Jack began their relationship properly. When Nina told Jack {{that she was not}} ready to consummate their relationship, Jack cheated on her with Edwina Valdez (Lucia Smyrk). Taj told Nina about Jack's cheating and she broke up with him. She later kissed Connor in front of Jack to make him jealous. Jay Bunyan commented, [...] "Jack gets really angry, especially with Connor, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to be his mate. He threatens to tell Nina about Connor getting Lori pregnant, as a way of getting back at him." [...] Nina became confused about her love life and was unsure whether she still had feelings for Jack.

Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who had been waging a citywide campaign against graffiti that had resulted in over 300 citations during the year, was angry and criticized Bono for defacing a San Francisco landmark. She said, [...] "I am disappointed that a rock star <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>supposed</b> to be a role model for young people chose to vandalize the work of another artist. The unfortunate incident marred an otherwise wonderful rock concert." [...] Bono was issued a citation for misdemeanor malicious mischief. [...] U2 manager Paul McGuinness said, [...] "This is clearly not an act of vandalism. This act was clearly in the spirit of the artwork itself." [...] The numerous callers to Ronn Owens' radio talk show on KGO-AM were evenly split, with younger listeners defending the singer's action and older ones not. [...] Bono soon apologized, saying [...] "I really do regret it. It was dumb." [...] The singer explained that he thought that he was honoring the artist's work and that the artist had agreed, but later Bono realized that the city owned the fountain.
