5|$|In 2003, paleontologists Simon R. Harris, David J. Gower, and Mark Wilkinson {{examined}} previous phylogenetic {{studies of}} aetosaurs and criticized the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> used certain characters to produce cladograms. They concluded that only three hypotheses of aetosaur relationships {{from previous studies}} were still true: that Aetosaurus is the most basal aetosaur, that Aetosauroides is the sister taxon of Stagonolepis robertsoni, and that Longosuchus and Desmatosuchus are {{more closely related to}} each other than either is to Neoaetosauroides. They also went on to correct the trees from all previous analyses.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} brought to greater public {{attention}} in 1992 by a CBC television docu-drama, The Valour and the Horror, which {{made a number of}} controversial claims about senior leadership in the Second World War and devoted one of its three episodes to the Black Watch attack on Verrières Ridge. The episode raised a spirited debate among the historical and veterans' communities and led to calls for apologies from the producers and an official investigation by the CBC Ombudsman into the veracity of the claims and the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were presented.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other parties}} sought to be {{involved}} in the case as amici curiae, Amnesty International (represented by former Federal Court Justice Ron Merkel), and the Victorian human rights advocacy group the Human Rights Law Resource Centre. However both their applications were rejected, because they could not assist the court in a <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> could not otherwise be assisted, and their submissions were largely subsumed into submissions made by Lasry in any event.|$|E

5|$|SI {{has become}} the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both {{everyday}} commerce and science. The change to SI {{had little effect on}} everyday life in countries that used the metric system – the metre, kilogram, litre and second remained unchanged as did the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were used – most of the changes only affected measurements in the workplace. The CGPM has a role of recommending changes, but no formal role in the enforcement of such changes—another inter-governmental organisation, the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) provides a forum for harmonisation of national standards and legislation in respect of metrology.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Millionaires {{basic set}} {{is a direct}} {{adaptation}} of the British version's set design, which was conceived by Andy Walmsley. Paul Smith's original licensing agreement for the U.S. Millionaire required that the show's set design, along with all {{other elements of the}} show's on-air presentation (musical score, lighting system, host's wardrobe, etc.), adhere faithfully to the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were presented in the British version; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show, making Walmsley's Millionaire set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history. The original version of the U.S. Millionaires set cost $200,000 to construct. The U.S. Millionaires production design is handled by George Allison, whose predecessors have included David Weller and Jim Fenhagen.|$|E
5|$|The {{tape loops}} were played on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the tapes were used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The tapes were made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were laid over the music.|$|E

5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E
5|$|Roberts' riding {{style in}} which he forced the motorcycle's rear wheel to break {{traction}} to steer around a corner, essentially riding on paved surfaces {{as if they were}} dirt tracks, changed the way Grand Prix motorcycles were ridden. From 1983 to 1999, every 500cc world championship was won by a rider with a dirt track racing background. Roberts' cornering method of hanging off the motorcycles with his knee extended forced him to use duct tape as knee pads, and eventually led to the introduction of purpose-built knee pucks used by all motorcycle road racers today. His battles with the Grand Prix establishment eventually led to the adoption of stricter safety standards for Grand Prix race organizers. He {{was one of the first}} riders to challenge the FIM over the way they treated competitors and helped improve prize money as well as the professionalism of the sport. It was not until Roberts planned his rival race series in 1980 that the FIM was forced to change the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> dealt with motorcycle racers.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Sam and Max {{were created in}} Purcell's youth; Purcell's younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around {{the idea of a}} dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other's names, shoot at each other and mock the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother's to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve's birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.|$|E
40|$|Political {{justification}} figures {{prominently in}} contemporary political theory, notably in models of deliberative democracy. This article articulates and defends the essential role of partisanship in this process. Four dimensions of justification are examined in detail: the constituency to which political justifications are offered, the circumstances <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are developed, the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are made inclusive, and the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> are made persuasive. In each case, {{the role of}} partisanship is probed and affirmed. Partisanship, we conclude, is indispensable {{to the kind of}} political justification needed to make the exercise of collective authority responsive to normative concerns...|$|R

5|$|North Korean {{troops had}} the {{advantage}} of planning the invasion in advance and organizing a pre-set logistics network, but they were not able to keep this logistics network running efficiently. Their largest disadvantage was the successful large-scale UN interdiction effort, as North Korean supplies and supply lines were subjected to UN bombing raids. This effort was not successful in stopping the North Korean supplies, and the North Koreans have also been praised by historians for the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> were able to maintain a supply network {{in the face of a}} massive bombing campaign. However, the North Koreans did suffer reduced supply because of this, and inefficiencies in transporting supplies from railroads to individual units negated the railroads' advantage. North Korean forces, though initially successful, were unable to counter UN forces with effective air defense, and were also unable to conduct successful interdiction of their own. This meant their supply network limited the combat actions that they could undertake; logistics could not keep up with units on the offensive, and North Korean units went almost completely unsupported during key engagements, reducing their ability to fight effectively. North Korean logistical inefficiency prevented them from overwhelming UN units in the Pusan Perimeter and enabled the defending UN troops to hold on long enough for a counterattack to be launched at Inchon. This landing, coming behind North Korean lines, had the effect of collapsing the North Korean front and ultimately ended the battle around Pusan in September.|$|E

40|$|As psychoanalysts {{engage with}} our {{patients}} in exploring their lives, we learn {{a great deal}} about the <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> express their own agency, and also about <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>they</b> respond to being the object of other people. But because of the particular history of psychoanalytic theorizing, we are more familiar with interpreting the patient's activity - the drives and wishes - than we are with dealing with the inevitable reversals between activity and passivity that characterize every life. This problem is explored by drawing parallels between clinical material and Sophocles' tragic rendering of the life of Oedipus the King...|$|R
