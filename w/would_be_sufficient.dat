5|$|Keeping the old {{systems and}} {{converting}} them to encrypted systems was also considered. This {{was estimated to}} cost NOK500 million to install, but could not be guaranteed to work satisfactorily. In particular, encryption would delay communications, {{which would be a}} problem for urgent communications. It was also uncertain whether the level of encryption <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to allow the network to be considered closed and allow personal information to be transmitted.|$|E
5|$|Although the weapon's {{designers}} {{thought that}} simply bringing {{a critical mass}} together <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient,</b> Serber suggested that the design should also include an initiator. A polonium-210-beryllium initiator was chosen because polonium 210 has a 140-day half life, which allowed it to be stockpiled, {{and it could be}} obtained from naturally occurring ores from Port Hope, Ontario. Oppenheimer requested that it also be manufactured in the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee or, when they became available, the reactors at the Hanford Site.|$|E

5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the {{community}} of Narrowsburg, New York, several miles upstream, requested that Pennsylvania Department of Transportation replace the 102-year-old structure. It had already had its weight limits reduced. The same year, an engineering firm in Millburn, New Jersey reported replacing the bridge would cost about $6.16 million, while keeping it would cost even more and raise its life expectancy {{by no more than}} 15 years. The Upper Delaware Council said that the 8 ton (7.2 tonne) limit on the bridge was inadequate for service trucks and emergency vehicles. The Shohola Township supervisors support maintaining the existing bridge, but the Lumberland Town Board was not convinced that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient.</b>|$|E
5|$|William Edward Forster, Chief Secretary for Ireland made {{it clear}} in a {{communication}} with the proprietor of the Dublin Daily Express {{that he would not}} allow an armed expedition of hundreds of men, as the committee was planning, and that 50 unarmed men <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to harvest the crops. He said that the government would consider it their duty to protect this group. On 10 November 1880, the relief expedition consisting of one contingent from County Cavan and one from County Monaghan left for County Mayo. Additional troops had already arrived in County Mayo to protect the expedition.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{continued}} with his career. In March 1938 {{he was called}} to readiness with 604 Squadron during the Munich crisis. At this time the squadron was flying the Hawker Demon. He was displeased when they converted to the Bristol Blenheim. The machines were fitted with a tray of four 303 Browning machine guns to give forward-facing firepower. As a long-range fighter it was of dubious value. The German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 could, and would, expose the frailties of the aircraft which was originally intended as a bomber. However, Cunningham {{was told by the}} Air Ministry that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> in the night fighter role, which is where they intended to use this variant. On 20 April 1938, John returned to de Havilland test-flying de Havilland Moth Minors.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} final round of games, both teams were equal on points with Spain, with Scotland ahead thanks to a {{superior}} goal difference; however, Spain's final game at home to Iceland was scheduled to be played two weeks after Wales and Scotland had played each other. With this in mind, a draw for Scotland <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to virtually guarantee second place in Group 7 and advance at the very least through to the two legged play-off against the winner of the Oceania qualifying tournament, while a win would likely see them top the group and qualify automatically. For Wales, anything less than a win would virtually end their hopes of qualification.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the Nuclear Posture Review study {{determined}} that, of the 18 Ohio SSBNs the U.S. Navy {{would be}} operating in total, 14 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> for the strategic {{needs of the}} U.S. The {{decision was made to}} convert four Ohio-class boats into SSGNs capable of conducting conventional land attack and special operations. As a result, the four oldest boats of the class—Ohio, Michigan, Florida, and Georgia—progressively entered the conversion process in late 2002 and were returned to active service by 2008. The boats could thereafter carry 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 66 special operations personnel, among other capabilities and upgrades. The cost to refit the four boats was around US$1billion (2008 dollars) per vessel.|$|E

5|$|In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the {{director}} of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{it was decided}} to upgrade the Røa and Sognsvann Lines to metro standard. This would allow them to use T1000 stock. Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to operate the {{services}} on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines, that would retain an overhead wire. The development costs for the T2000 were in part subsidized by the government, as the high-tech product from Strømmens Verksted (by then part of the ABB Group) and AEG was seen as a future export product. The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995. The same year, the metro started operating all services through the city center, connecting the western and eastern networks.|$|E
5|$|Jacobsen quotes textual {{evidence}} that the Akkadian word eššebu (owl) corresponds to the Sumerian word ninna, and that the Sumerian Dnin-ninna (Divine lady ninna) corresponds to the Akkadian Ishtar. The Sumerian ninna can also be translated as the Akkadian kilili, {{which is also a}} name or epithet for Ishtar. Inanna/Ishtar as harlot or goddess of harlots was a well known theme in Mesopotamian mythology and in one text, Inanna is called kar-kid (harlot) and ab-ba--šú, which in Akkadian would be rendered kilili. Thus {{there appears to be a}} cluster of metaphors linking prostitute and owl and the goddess Inanna/Ishtar; this could match the most enigmatic component of the relief to a well known aspect of Ishtar. Jacobsen concludes that this link <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to explain talons and wings, and adds that nudity could indicate the relief was originally the house-altar of a bordello.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{was later}} {{introduced}} {{to amend the}} type of data collected and stored in the National Register of Electors. On 17 May 2007, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Jennifer Stoddart appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs regarding Bill C-31, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Public Service Employment Act submitting a letter in which she criticised the proposed changes to the Elections Act. One of the problems was the inclusion of an elector's date of birth in the voter lists sent to polling stations on election day for use by polling clerks and scrutineers; Stoddart stated that verification of an elector's birth year <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient.</b> The second problem she raised was inclusion of the date of birth in the voter lists sent to each candidate for all electoral districts in Canada, and also to all political parties.|$|E
5|$|Minister of Local Government and Regional Development, Gunnar Berge, {{stated in}} January 1995 {{that he was}} {{concerned}} that the post-Olympic use funds were being used up too quickly and that money was being used for unsuitable projects. However, he rejected that the state should take control over the venues or the money. After one year, Lillehammer Olympiapark had used NOK32 of 146 million, while the company Olympia Utvikling/Troll Park had used NOK14 of 95 million. For the Lillehammer companies, {{this meant that the}} fund was estimated to run out after ten instead of twenty years. In contrast, Hamar Olympiske Anlegg had only used the fund's yield. LOOC criticized the post-Olympic use companies, stating that they were too bureaucratic, that their combined 100 employees were too many, and that one or two companies <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient.</b>|$|E
5|$|Not long after, {{the legend}} continues, {{a group of}} Sakalava (or, by some accounts, Vazimba) warriors were {{preparing}} to attack a village north of Alasora called Ambohipeno. Ralambo announced that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to throw a rotten egg at the warriors, and Kelimalaza {{would take care of}} the rest. According to oral history, the egg was thrown and hit a warrior in the head, killing him on contact; his corpse fell onto another warrior and killed him, and this corpse fell onto another and so forth, until the warriors had all been destroyed, forevermore confirming the power of Kelimalaza as the protector of the kingdom {{in the minds of the}} Merina populace. Similarly, at the besieged Imerina village of Ambohimanambola, invoking Kelimalaza was said to have produced a massive hailstorm that wiped out the enemy warriors.|$|E

5|$|The USAAF {{assessed}} {{that the}} firebombing campaign had been highly successful, {{and noted that}} American losses during these attacks were much lower than those incurred during day precision raids. Accordingly, the Joint Target Group (JTG), which was the Washington, D.C.-based organisation responsible for developing strategies for the air campaign against Japan, developed plans for a two-stage campaign against 22 Japanese cities. The JTG also recommended that precision bombing attacks on particularly important industrial facilities continue in parallel to the area raids, however. While this campaign was intended to form part of preparations for the Allied invasion of Japan, LeMay and some members of Arnold's staff believed that it alone <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to force the country's surrender.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the War in the Vendée {{and peace}} with Spain, {{substantial}} French forces were made available for the operation, to be led by General Hoche and scheduled for the end of October 1796. Hoche was a successful military commander, who had defeated the Vendée Royalists and been subsequently engaged in planning the Cornish invasion. A body of veteran soldiers and the entire French Atlantic Fleet were placed at his disposal, based in the major Atlantic seaport of Brest. The number of soldiers earmarked for the invasion is uncertain: the French Directory suggested 25,000 men would be required, the Irish delegates insisting that 15,000 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient.</b> Estimates of the number of soldiers eventually embarked range between 13,500 and 20,000.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing number}} of people, among them Captain William Rooke Creswell, the {{director}} of the Commonwealth Naval Forces, demanded an autonomous Australian navy, financed and controlled by Australia. In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sufficient.</b> Deakin was not impressed with the Admiralty, and in 1908 invited the United States Great White Fleet to visit Australia. The visit prompted public enthusiasm for a modern navy and led to the order of two 700-ton s, a purchase that angered the British. The surge in German naval construction in 1909 led the Australian admiralty to change its position on an Australian navy, which resulted in the Naval Defence Act of 1910 being passed which created the Australian navy.|$|E
