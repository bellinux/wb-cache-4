25|$|An {{outstanding}} {{example of}} the free-blowing technique is the Portland Vase, which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment {{was carried out by}} Gudenrath and Whitehouse with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered {{on the end of the}} blowpipe and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot <b>white</b> <b>glass.</b> Inflation occurred when the glassworker blew the molten glass into a sphere which was then stretched or elongated into a vase with a layer of <b>white</b> <b>glass</b> overlying the blue body.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1995-1996, a series of large storms {{exacerbated}} the ongoing deterioration of the wood structure. The 100-mph winds blew out 30,000 fogged <b>white</b> <b>glass</b> panes in the conservatory, shattered the <b>white</b> <b>glass</b> dome, and weakened the structure. In addition, 15 percent of the plant collection was lost due to exposure to the cold, wintry air and flying glass. After covering the holes with tarp and plywood and bringing in heaters, the conservatory contemplated farming out hundreds of plants to other institutions while the building was repaired. Some specimens however were too big or too old to move. The most challenging plant was the 112-year-old Brazilian philodendron that inhabited the shattered dome. A greenhouse was built to house the philodendron and other plants during renovation and afterwards used for expansion and keeping more exotic plants.|$|E

25|$|The 15thcentury Minster {{dedicated}} to St. John the Baptist did not achieve cathedral status {{when a new}} diocese was being considered for the West Riding (Wakefield Parish Church became the cathedral in 1888 and was extensively altered and enlarged). Minster Status was conferred on the Parish Church in a ceremony on 22 November 2009. There {{is a collection of}} rare Commonwealth <b>white</b> <b>glass</b> as well as a series of Victorian windows. Another feature is the complete array of Jacobean box pews. The pair of Gothic organ cases by John Oldrid Scott now house the four-manual instrument by Harrison & Harrison. The belfry holds fourteen bells and an Angelus.|$|E
25|$|The 1920s and 1930s were {{years of}} {{economic}} austerity. Many of Northern Ireland's traditional industries, notably linen and shipbuilding, were in recession. This {{contributed to the}} already high level of unemployment. Serious rioting broke out in 1932 in Belfast in protest at the inadequate nature and level of relief for the unemployed {{and the threat of}} rioting was ever present. In response to the growth of motorised transport the RUC Traffic Branch was formed on 1 January 1930. In 1936 the police depot at Enniskillen was formally opened and an £800,000 scheme to create a network of 196 police barracks throughout Northern Ireland by rationalizing or repairing the 224 premises inherited from the RIC was under way. In May 1937 a new <b>white</b> <b>glass</b> lamp with the RUC crest went up {{for the first time to}} replace the RIC crest still on many stations. About the same time the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Belfast was significantly expanded, with a detective head constable being appointed to head the CID force in each of the five Belfast police districts. There was sporadic Irish Republican Army activity in the 1930s.|$|E

[...] The panels were then shipped by truck to Chicago. The glass is <b>white</b> <b>glass,</b> rather than the usual green glass that results from iron impurities. This has the tradeoff of increased image clarity, but greater dirt visibility. Each block is [...] with glass thin enough to avoid image distortion. On each block, {{one of the six}} faces is polished, and the other five surfaces are textured.|$|E

500|$|According to Safdie, the {{building}} [...] "is by definition the physical symbol {{of peace in}} the capital's skyline" [...] and needed to convey the spirit of peace. [...] Safdie stated: [...] "I'm not one who believes in overt symbolism, but my sense of a building dedicated to peace {{was a sense of}} the lightness of being,...It should be a serene building. It should not be an aggressive building. It should be full of light." [...] Safdie achieved this by designing a glass curtain wall facing the Lincoln Memorial and a billowing glass ceiling. [...] The ceiling is one of {{the building}} elements in common with Safdie's design for the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Israel. [...] The [...] thick roof is made of 1,482 <b>white</b> <b>glass</b> panels and supported by steel frames while the interior of the roof is covered by a translucent plastic film. [...] It is opaque and white during the day and glows at night.|$|E
2500|$|They had ways of {{depicting}} rays {{of light}} that {{they put into practice}} ten years before most of their rivals attempted such dramatic atmospheric effects in the 1870s. The thing that makes these [...] "special effects" [...] of Clayton and Bell the more remarkable is that they were achieved with little resource to painted glass and flashed glass and without the multi-coloured Favrile glass used by Louis Comfort Tiffany studios and the Aesthetic designers of the United States. In fact, they used little more than radiating bands of red, yellow and <b>white</b> <b>glass</b> coupled with a formalised style of cloud painting that had been used by ancient stained glass and panel painters. The effects achieved by apparently simple means are often of overwhelming impact. A renowned example that is reproduced in various books on the topic of stained glass is the Last Judgement window of St Mary’s church, Hanley Castle, Worcestershire, dating from 1860.|$|E
2500|$|The {{other type}} of {{external}} frame which recently was proposed, is made from composite plastic which is not flexible like current backpack straps and also {{it is a kind}} of material that can be shaped like human spine curvature. In this type of backpack, load directly transfers to the shoulders through the non-flexible straps. This non-flexible structure diminishes the momentum at lumbar region of the back. Strap curvature is shaped close to spine curvature and there are two flexible drawstrings to prevent backpack movement in transverse plane. The straps of this backpack are wide enough to distribute the pressure on shoulders and also a <b>white</b> <b>glass</b> wool layer is added to the internal part of them to absorb dynamic forces, which could be produced through walking. This backpack type is an experimental sample that need further options to be prepared for [...] usage. One of the benefits of backpack with external frame is preventing the spine to incline forward during walking that would be helpful in preventing damage of long term backpack carrying.|$|E

2500|$|York Minster also {{contains}} {{much of its}} original glass including important narrative windows of the Norman period, the famous [...] "Five Sister" [...] windows, the 14th-century west window and 15th-century east window. The [...] "Five Sisters", although repaired countless times so that they now contain a spider's web of lead, still reveal their delicate pattern of simple geometric shapes enhanced by grisaille painting. They were the style of window which was most easily imitated by early 19th-century plumber-glaziers. The east and west windows of York are outstanding examples because in each case they are huge, intact, at their original location and by a known craftsman. The west window, designed in about 1340 by Master Robert, contains tiers of saints and stories of Christ and the Virgin Mary, each surmounted by a delicate Gothic canopy in white and yellow-stain, against a red background. The highly ornate tracery lights are filled with floral motifs. <b>White</b> <b>glass</b> stone borders surround each panel, making it appear to float in its frame. The east window of 1405 was glazed by John Thornton and is the largest intact medieval window in the world. It presents a narrative in sequential panels of the Creation, the Fall of Man, the Redemption, the Apocalypse, the Last Judgment and the Glory of God.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, {{the nave}} and chancel are {{separated}} by a round-headed double chancel arch which {{was to have been}} flanked by niches—an unrealised aspect of Goodhart-Rendel's plan. [...] The double arch—"the interior's most powerful feature"—was intended to support both the vaulted roof and the organ, although the present organ stands in the north transept. [...] It came from St Catharine's College, Cambridge in 1974. [...] The aisles are narrower and less substantial than those in Blomfield's church. [...] The interior walls are mostly of stone coated with plaster and render, and the panelled chancel ceiling is painted. [...] The chancel has a stone floor. [...] Fittings include a 19th-century square-bowled font on a carved marble base, a lectern of the same era, chandeliers and an octagonal pulpit. [...] The stained glass, featuring much <b>white</b> <b>glass,</b> was all designed by Joseph Ledger in 1952, apart from some [...] "colourful" [...] angels in the baptistery which were provided by a Miss Thompson. [...] These were similar to some of the windows in the old church. [...] Ledger met Goodhart-Rendel while in his 20s and became the architect's favoured stained glass designer. [...] He later became a noted ceramicist. [...] The church has a 16th-century painting of the Adoration of Jesus by Ortolano Ferrarese. [...] Many internal fittings, such as the lectern, choir stalls and fixtures from the Lady chapel, came from Blomfield's church.|$|E

The façade which makes up the primary component of the building is the milky <b>white</b> fritted <b>glass</b> which has been laminated. The aesthetics of the material gives a visual metaphor of a sail. It is inspired by the tiling of the Sydney Opera House, which is 800 metres (less than half a mile) to the north. Terracotta tiles makes up much of the lower section of the building to contrast the <b>white</b> dominated <b>glass</b> cladding. It also reconciles the orange-clad lobby and the residential complex.|$|R
