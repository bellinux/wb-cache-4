25|$|When David {{heard that}} God had blessed Obed-Edom {{because of the}} Ark, David brought the Ark to Jerusalem with joy. When those who bore the Ark had gone six paces, they sacrificed an ox and a fatling. The Israelites brought up the Ark with {{shouting}} {{and the sound of}} the horn, and David danced with all his might girded with a linen ephod. As the Ark came into the city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out the <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> David leaping and dancing, and she despised him in her heart.|$|E
500|$|Terrance Kean, {{who lived}} in a nearby {{apartment}} building, heard the noise of loud jet engines, glanced out his <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a [...] "very, very large passenger jet". He watched [...] "it just plow right {{into the side of the}} Pentagon. The nose penetrated into the portico. And then it sort of disappeared, and there was fire and smoke everywhere." [...] Tim Timmerman, who is a pilot himself, noticed American Airlines markings on the aircraft as he saw it hit the Pentagon. Other drivers on Washington Boulevard, Interstate 395, and Columbia Pike witnessed the crash, as did people in Pentagon City, Crystal City, and other nearby locations.|$|E
500|$|By chance, Johnson {{and three}} of his men, Lieutenant Daniel Toler and Sergeants Love and Miller, were still awake and {{discussing}} tactics. [...] Mexican troops {{had been told that}} the house where Johnson was quartered was one of their targets, yet a lamp burned in the window, signalling that this was the home of a loyalist. [...] Out of an abundance of caution, a group of troops knocked on the door. [...] Before the Texians could open the door, they heard the gunfire from the town square. [...] Toler looked out a <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> uniformed troops on the porch. [...] Without opening the door, he told the soldiers, in Spanish, that there were no troops there, but he would open the door momentarily. [...] The fighting moved into the street, and soldiers who had been guarding {{the back door of the}} house rushed around to the front. [...] Johnson, Toler, Love, and Miller dashed out the back door and escaped.|$|E
60|$|Soon Job Haskers {{came from}} the Hall with a small packet in his hand. The boys watched from some side <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> him leap into the cutter. He took up the reins.|$|R

500|$|A.G. Gaston, who {{was appalled}} {{at the idea of}} using children, {{was on the phone with}} white {{attorney}} David Vann trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. [...] When Gaston looked out the <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the children being hit with high-pressure water, he said, [...] "Lawyer Vann, I can't talk to you now or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them", and hung up the phone. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. [...] To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, [...] "Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{the trial}} had {{received}} national attention, Brownsville officials were expecting {{a large crowd}} of spectators and reporters in the courtroom. In order to accommodate them, the trial was moved from the 357th State District Court to the 197th State District courtroom. On February 25, 1994, the jury examined the evidence from the bullet remains, the motel records, and photos of Fischer's corpse. His brother Eric took the stand and described what he saw and heard the morning his brother was killed. He said {{when he heard the}} two gunshots, he looked through the <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> a white car driving away. A member of the Cuellar organization, Victor Moreno, testified in court and helped investigators connect the murder to members of the criminal group. He stated that Olivarez, Puentes Pizaña, and Palomares worked for Cuellar and were behind the murder. He also said he spoke with Garza about [...] "a murder" [...] in Brownsville, and claimed to have been with Cuellar when Palomares called him to tell him about the murder of [...] "a boy" [...] in Brownsville. Moreno allegedly gave money to Garza to but the gun in Dallas on Cuellar's behalf. After the purchase, Moreno gave the gun to Cuellar, who then reportedly gave it to the assassins. The defense stated that even if, for argument's sake, Moreno's testimony was true it was inadmissible because he was not involved in the murder. However, the court concluded that he was integral to the process that led to Fischer's murder, and admitted his testimony citing a co-conspirator hearsay exception.|$|E
2500|$|At a later time, a famine {{struck the}} land of Israel and Isaac moved his family, upon God's command, to Gerar, which was ruled by Abimelech, king of the Philistines. Like Abraham before him, who called Sarah his [...] "sister" [...] rather than his [...] "wife" [...] so that the Egyptians would not kill him and take his wife, Isaac told the people of Gerar that Rebecca was his sister. She was not molested, but one day Abimelech looked through the <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Isaac [...] "sporting" [...] (a {{euphemism}} for sexual play) with her. Abimelech called Isaac on his lie, and then warned others not to touch Rebecca. Eventually Isaac parted from Abimelech in peace.|$|E
5000|$|Between 8:00 and 8:30 a.m., while Taylor was herding Clark and Ponsano to {{the back}} of the restaurant, another {{employee}} of Cajun's, Viola Kaglear, arrived for work. She recognized Taylor's car in the front of the building. When no one responded to her knocking on the front door, Kaglear looked into the front <b>windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Taylor <b>and</b> Clark going into the storeroom. She waited a few minutes, went to the rear of the building, and looked through a two-way peep hole in the back door where she <b>saw</b> Taylor exit <b>and</b> return to the storeroom.|$|R
5000|$|I {{looked out}} my <b>window</b> <b>and</b> I <b>saw</b> this plane, this jet, an American Airlines jet, coming. And I thought, 'This doesn't add up, it's really low.' <b>And</b> I <b>saw</b> it. I {{mean it was}} like a cruise missile with wings. It went right there and slammed right into the Pentagon.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Hegan {{had arrived in}} an automobile. The honk of it came in through the open <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> they <b>saw,</b> it stop {{alongside}} the big red machine. In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.|$|R
2500|$|By 1971, Knievel {{realized}} that the U.S. government would never allow him to jump the Grand Canyon. To keep his fans interested, Knievel considered several other stunts that might match the publicity {{that would have been}} generated by jumping the canyon. Ideas included jumping across the Mississippi River, jumping from one skyscraper to another in New York City, and jumping over 13 cars inside the Houston Astrodome. While flying back to Butte from a performance tour, Knievel looked out the <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the Snake River Canyon. After finding a location just east of Twin Falls, Idaho, that was wide enough, deep enough, and on private property, Knievel leased [...] for $35,000 to stage his jump. He set the date for Labor Day (September 4), 1972.|$|E
2500|$|Jene Newsome {{was serving}} as an {{aircraft}} armament system craftsman when the Rapid City Police Department called her at Ellsworth Air Force Base seeking to determine the whereabouts of her wife, who was wanted on theft charges in Fairbanks, Alaska. Newsome refused to leave work immediately to help the officers in their search, and they saw her Iowa marriage license in her home. Whether the officers entered the home or looked through a <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the license sitting {{on the kitchen table}} is unclear. After several phone calls from the officers, Newsome arrived home to find officer Jeremy Stauffacher, detective Tom Garinger, and her wife inside her home. Four days after Hudson's arrest, the police reported the marriage license to the Air Force via a fax headed [...] "FYI." [...] Newsome's wife was later reported released on bail and facing one felony and three misdemeanor theft charges.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 April 1998, Mayall {{was injured}} after {{crashing}} a quad bike {{near his home}} in Devon. Mayall's daughter Bonnie and her cousin had asked him to take them for a ride on the bike—a Christmas gift from his wife—but he refused because there was already a spit of rain falling, indicating further rain, and he went on out alone. Mayall remembered nothing about the accident. His mind remained [...] "a total blank." [...] His wife Barbara looked out of the <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> him lying on the ground trapped beneath the quad, apparently turned over on top of him. Mayall tells the story that his wife believed it was just his silly joking and she initially left him for a few minutes. But Mayall was airlifted to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital, with two haematomas and a fractured skull. During the following 96 hours, he was kept sedated to prevent movement which could cause pressure on his brain. His family was warned that he could die or have brain damage. He was in a coma for several days. After five days doctors felt it safe to bring Mayall back to consciousness.|$|E
60|$|Left {{alone in}} the turret-room, Edgar Caswall {{carefully}} locked the door and hung a handkerchief over the keyhole. Next, he inspected the <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> {{that they were not}} overlooked from any angle of the main building. Then he carefully examined the trunk, going over it with a magnifying glass. He found it intact: the steel bands were flawless; the whole trunk was compact. After sitting opposite to it for some time, and the shades of evening beginning to melt into darkness, he gave up the task and went to his bedroom, after locking the door of the turret-room behind him and taking away the key.|$|R
60|$|Jonas's {{exposition}} {{of the plan}} of his school was here interrupted by the farmer's wife, who, as {{she sat at the}} end of the settle towards the fire, had her face somewhat turned towards the <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> she <b>saw</b> a light at a distance near the horizon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hang it," [...] says Clive, turning very red, [...] "I {{wanted to}} pass just under her <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> if I <b>saw</b> her, {{not to see}} her: and that's what I did." ...|$|R
2500|$|Other songs express emotions, such as [...] "Come On Write Me", which expresses vulnerability, {{something}} Van Peebles {{later said}} was absent from modern recordings by African American males. Van Peebles wrote [...] "Eyes On The Rabbit" [...] as a joke, {{inspired by the}} piano player's wife, who he described as [...] "sappy". Van Peebles said, [...] "I'm going to write the sappiest song I can." [...] Van Peebles rehearsed the song at the piano player's house, where the saxophonist and his wife, and the pianist and his wife stayed inside and watched Van Peebles playing the song outside. Van Peebles {{walked over to the}} <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> that none of them laughed at the song. He initially thought they didn't want to laugh at him, but realized that all of them were crying, and the song had a different emotional impact than he had intended. One of the watchers congratulated Van Peebles on the song, but Van Peebles explained that the song was a joke, angering him and his girlfriend, who wanted to beat Van Peebles up. Van Peebles backed off by claiming that the song wasn't a joke.|$|E
2500|$|... "Orinoco Flow" [...] was {{the final}} track written for the album, {{but it was one}} that Enya {{recalled}} was difficult to work on, which involved several breaks from recording before coming back to it several weeks after. She later pointed out the absence of deadlines to complete the album, as granted in her contract with Warner, which allowed the song to be developed {{over a period of time}} until [...] "we were able at the end to listen to it and say 'this is good'". It originated from a riff she had developed after Nicky suggested to play a melody in five different octaves; they left the arrangement as it was, until they realised the album needed one more track. The song developed around the initial riff, itself becoming part of the chorus hook. An earlier version of the song contained no middle eight and had the line [...] "Sail away..." [...] after every line which Dickens later said, [...] "drove me crazy", but recognised its potential if it was worked on. Its pizzicato introduction, which has been compared to Andy Williams' 1963 single [...] "Can't Get Used to Losing You", was the genesis of Roma's inspiration for the song's lyrics after she had heard the introduction as she looked out of the studio <b>window</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> her children skipping. Dickins and Cullum are referenced in the lyrics in the lines: [...] "We can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel. We can sigh, say goodbye, Ross and his dependencies", the latter being a reference to the region of Antarctica known as Ross Dependency. Dickins only found out about it after the album had been pressed which embarrassed him at first and initially wanted it changed, but soon warmed to it after the single went to number one. [...] "All these years later", he said, [...] "if I hear that line ... I can't help smiling." ...|$|E

In the next block Mrs. Dr. Westlake was gaping from her porch. Carol said with an embarrassed quaver: ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly a {{detonation}} {{shook the}} building. Maxwell, leaping from his couch, {{ran along the}} veranda and burst, breathless, into Niven's room. Bright moonlight streamed in through the <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> the sick man lying propped up on one elbow, with a pistol smoking in his hand. Niven appeared perfectly sane, and his voice was steady when he spoke.|$|R
60|$|When he {{was gone}} Tess stood at the <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> {{presently}} <b>saw</b> his form crossing the great stone bridge which conducted to the mill premises. He sank behind it, crossed the railway beyond, and disappeared. Then, without a sigh, she {{turned her attention to}} the room, and began clearing the table and setting it in order.|$|R
60|$|Those feet {{released}} {{him from his}} rigor. He turned towards the <b>window,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> it starred and broken.|$|E

60|$|Jimmy {{knew how}} one {{pulled out the}} bars, but they baffled him and he knocked down the crossed supports. In {{front of the house}} he stopped, for a {{flickering}} light shone from the <b>window</b> <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> Margaret sewing by the fire. His broken boots and torn clothes embarrassed him, but he braced {{up and went to the}} door.|$|R
60|$|The lamps {{were just}} lit, but the {{curtains}} were not drawn. 'Now look,' said Gillis, stopping {{in front of}} the drawing-room <b>window.</b> Georgina looked <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> Georgie Porgie <b>and</b> the Bride.|$|R
60|$|Once at night, when Gertrude withdrew to her {{chamber and}} before seeking her pillow, {{prepared}} to retire as a preliminary to disrobing--in other words, {{before going to}} bed, she flung wide the casement (opened the <b>window)</b> <b>and</b> perceived (<b>saw)</b> the face of Lord Ronald.

6000|$|... "My {{mind was}} {{instantly}} filled with suspicion. I rushed upstairs {{to make sure}} that she was not in the house. As I did so I happened to glance {{out of one of the}} upper <b>windows,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> the maid with whom I had just been speaking running across the field in the direction of the cottage. Then of course I saw exactly what it all meant. My wife had gone over there, and had asked the servant to call her if I should return. Tingling with anger, I rushed down and hurried across, determined to end the matter once <b>and</b> forever. I <b>saw</b> my wife <b>and</b> the maid hurrying back along the lane, but I did not stop to speak with them. In the cottage lay the secret which was casting a shadow over my life. I vowed that, come what might, it should be a secret no longer. I did not even knock when I reached it, but turned the handle and rushed into the passage.|$|R
