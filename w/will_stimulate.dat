5|$|The female tammar can {{conceive}} {{shortly after}} giving birth. Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains dormant {{for nearly a}} year. For {{the first half of}} the year, the presence of the joey in the pouch prevents the blastocyst from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half <b>will</b> <b>stimulate</b> the blastocyst's development. However, after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{pacemakers}} {{usually have}} multiple functions. The most basic form monitors the heart's native electrical rhythm. When the pacemaker does not detect a heartbeat within a normal beat-to-beat time period, it <b>will</b> <b>stimulate</b> the ventricle {{of the heart}} with a short low voltage pulse. This sensing and stimulating activity continues on a beat by beat basis.|$|E

5000|$|The WSE {{has proven}} to be an {{important}} finding for word recognition models, and specifically is supported by Rumelhart and McClelland's interactive-activation model of word recognition. According to this model, when a reader is presented with a word, each letter in parallel <b>will</b> either <b>stimulate</b> or inhibit different feature detectors (e.g. a curved shape for [...] "C", horizontal and vertical bars for [...] "H", etc.). Those feature detectors <b>will</b> then <b>stimulate</b> or inhibit different letter detectors, which <b>will</b> finally <b>stimulate</b> or inhibit different word detectors. Each activated connection would carry a different weight, and thus the word [...] "WORK" [...] in the example would be activated more than any other word (and therefore recognized by a reader).|$|R

25|$|The first {{criticism}} is that, following Say's {{law and the}} related circle of ideas, if demand slackens, prices will fall (barring government intervention), and the resulting lower price <b>will</b> <b>stimulate</b> demand (though at lower profit or cost – possibly even lower wages). This criticism in turn has been questioned by New Keynesian economists, who reject Say's law and instead point to evidence of sticky prices as a reason why prices do not fall in recession; this remains a debated point.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibody}} {{therapy is}} a form of immunotherapy that uses monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to bind monospecifically to certain cells or proteins. The objective is that this treatment <b>will</b> <b>stimulate</b> the patient's immune system to attack those cells. Alternatively, in radioimmunotherapy a radioactive dose localizes a target cell line, delivering lethal chemical doses. More recently antibodies have been used to bind to molecules involved in T-cell regulation to remove inhibitory pathways that block T-cell responses. This is known as immune checkpoint therapy.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{forms of}} {{nitrogen}} {{are most often}} of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds <b>will</b> <b>stimulate</b> plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N2, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on microbial nitrogen fixation to convert N2 into other forms such as nitrates. However, {{there is a limit}} to how much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a limiting nutrient. This is also the case with increased levels of phosphorus. However, because phosphorus is generally much less soluble than nitrogen, it is leached from the soil at a much slower rate than nitrogen. Consequently, phosphorus is much more important as a limiting nutrient in aquatic systems.|$|E

500|$|Baroreceptors are stretch receptors {{located in}} the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, {{including}} pulmonary vessels and {{the right side of}} the heart itself. Baroreceptors fire at a rate determined by how much they are stretched, which is influenced by blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation [...] As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation. There is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase heart rate. The opposite is also true. Chemoreceptors present in the carotid body or adjacent to the aorta in an aortic body respond to the blood's oxygen, carbon dioxide levels. Low oxygen or high carbon dioxide <b>will</b> <b>stimulate</b> firing of the receptors.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was against}} Derby County at the newly built Pride Park Stadium. They were awarded a penalty {{kick in the}} first half after Patrick Vieira was fouled by Lee Carsley; Wright hit the penalty, which ricocheted off the goal crossbar. Two goals by Paulo Wanchope and a late strike by Dean Sturridge {{condemned}} Arsenal to their first defeat of the league season. Arsenal played Manchester United on 9 November 1997 and needed a win to stay one point behind the league leaders. Wenger admitted in his pre-match comments that a second successive defeat would make it [...] "difficult" [...] for them to catch Manchester United, but not [...] "impossible". Striker Nicolas Anelka, standing in for Bergkamp, scored his first goal for Arsenal and Vieira added a second, leaving goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel rattled. Although Teddy Sheringham scored twice for Manchester United to level the score, midfielder David Platt headed into the far corner with seven minutes left of the match to score the winner for Arsenal. Wenger said of the win: [...] "This result is good for the English game because it <b>will</b> <b>stimulate</b> interest in the Premier League" [...] and opposing manager Alex Ferguson half agreed: [...] "A one-horse race is not good for the game." [...] Arsenal failed to capitalise on the result, losing to Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool, in a period where the team were depleted due to injuries.|$|E

2500|$|Ambient conditions, such as lighting, {{temperature}} and music, are {{also part of}} the overall retail environment. It is common for a retail store to play music that relates to their target market. Studies have found that [...] "positively valenced music <b>will</b> <b>stimulate</b> more thoughts and feeling than negatively valenced music", hence, positively valenced music will make the waiting time feel longer to the customer than negatively valenced music. In a retail store, for example, changing the background music to a quicker tempo may influence the consumer to move through the space at a quicker pace, thereby improving traffic flow. Evidence also suggests that playing music reduces the negative effects of waiting since it serves as a distraction. Jewellery stores like Michael Hill have dim lighting with a view to fostering a sense of intimacy.|$|E

2500|$|The JG {{introduces}} no relative wage {{effects and}} the rising demand per se does not necessarily invoke inflationary pressures because by definition it is satisfying the net savings desire {{of the private sector}} (see Mitchell and Muysken, 2008 for more details). Additionally, in today’s demand constrained economies, firms are likely to increase capacity utilisation to meet the higher sales volumes. Given that the demand impulse is less than required in the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) economy, it is clear that if there were any demand-pull inflation it would be lower under the JG. There are no new problems faced by employers who wish to hire labour to meet the higher sales levels. Any initial rise in demand <b>will</b> <b>stimulate</b> private sector employment growth while reducing JG employment and spending. [...] However, these demand pressures are unlikely to lead to accelerating inflation while the JG pool contains workers employable by the private sector.|$|E
