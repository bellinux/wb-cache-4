25|$|Climate {{change was}} {{referred}} to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until {{the publication of his}} work The Politics of Climate Change in 2009. Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it will be too late. For <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E

Persuading the Athenians to take this course was undoubtedly {{one of the highlights of}} Themistocles's career. As Holland has it: [...] "What precise heights of oratory he attained, what stirring and memorable phrases he pronounced, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing...only by the effect it had on the assembly can we gauge what surely must have been its electric and vivifying quality—for Themistocles' audacious proposals, when put to the vote, were ratified. The Athenian people, facing the gravest moment of peril in their history, committed themselves once and for all to the alien element of the sea, and put their faith in a man whose ambitions many had long profoundly dreaded." [...] His proposals accepted, Themistocles issued orders for the women and children of Athens to be sent to the city of Troezen, safely inside the Peloponnesus. He was then able to travel to a meeting of the Allies, at which he proposed his strategy; with the Athenian fleet fully committed to the defence of Greece, the other Allies accepted his proposals.|$|E

This was necessary to maximize ecological validity but means that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of knowing whether participants answered accurately and <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to compel them to answer rapidly. While this provided us with valuable insight into real-world processes, future work should complement naturalistic research (like the present study) with experimental designs that could shed light on processes, mediations, and causal mechanisms.|$|R

Mass preventive treatment is therefore currently recommended for the group as a whole whereas in fact this group is highly heterogeneous and needs differentiation. This thesis is an effort to identify groups of patients sharing a certain risk and its underlying pathological substrates which can be influenced. These are key insights to enable more effective and efficient personalized treatment of patients...|$|R

40|$|More than 40 {{years have}} passed since Ed Salpeter and others {{predicted}} that the carbon/oxygen cores of the coolest white dwarf stars in our Galaxy will theoretically crystallize. This effect has a dramatic impact on the calculated ages of cool white dwarfs, but until recently <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> of testing the theory. In 1992, pulsations were discovered in the massive potentially crystallized white dwarf BPM 37093, and in 1999 the theoretical effects of crystallization on the pulsation modes were determined. Observations from two Whole Earth Telescope campaigns in 1998 and 1999, combined with a new model-fitting method using a genetic algorithm, are now giving us the first glimpse inside of a crystallized star.

Our deepest thanks goes to all the authors for providing the interesting and humorous contributions. We wish {{all of you to}} enjoy the Colloquium.

50|$|Similarly, we get {{a preview}} of the Mahamudra {{experience}} when we receive the pointing-out instructions from our guru. They give us a glimpse or flash experience of Mahamudra. They {{give us a sense of}} direction and motivate us to go further; however, it is up to us to extend our exploration so that we eventually come to a genuine realization of Mahamudra. Without this flash experience, <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to be exposed to the nature of Mind so directly, so nakedly. That flash is a transmission of the lineage, a wonderful blessing through which we are introduced to the deeper experience and realization of the Mahamudra path. This shows how necessary it is to rely on the lineage transmission and to be connected to a genuine lineage master. Without the pure and genuine lineage, without a qualified lineage master, <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> to experience such a preview, such a flash experience.|$|R
30|$|We {{could not}} {{calculate}} the diffusion coefficient of cobalt using diffusion profiles because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> {{to determine the}} time length of the cobalt diffusion penetration into {{the bulk of the}} alloy, which is obviously comparable with the time of martensitic transformation. It should be considered that the mechanism of transfer of cobalt atoms is connected with actual structural f.c.c. - h.c.p. - f.c.c. restructuring and related resulting stress field due to changes in the size and volume of crystals that turn. The increase of penetration depth under repeated cycles indicated the possibility of accumulation of internal stresses that consistently stimulated further diffusion of cobalt atoms. Obviously, this mechanism of moving substitution atoms can be considered mainly athermal. Previously, it was shown that an athermal mechanism of substitution and interstitial atom mass transfer was realized by explosive kinetics of γ-α transformation in iron alloys [8, 9].|$|R

50|$|The {{difficulties}} {{here were}} met by radically different proof techniques, taking much more care about proofs by contradiction.
