5|$|Anyone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> {{studied the}} history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

She is a dancer dreaming of the big time, but is reduced to working in a strip club to make ends meet. Although the story is a suspenseful crime thriller, their doomed romance is at the heart of the film. At the time, Miller was 29 years old to Pacino's 53. Casting for Gail proved {{difficult}} because of the character's striptease scenes. The character needed someone who was both a talented dancer and actor.|$|E

In 1990, at age 18, he was the youngest player in the NHL. Currently, at age 45, he is the oldest player in the NHL, and is the oldest player to record a hat trick. On January 27, 2017, in a ceremony during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Jágr was part of the second group of players to be named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.|$|E
25|$|United Artists {{broke from}} this tradition. It was solely a {{distribution}} company, offering independent film producers {{access to its}} own screens {{as well as the}} rental of temporarily unbooked cinemas owned by other companies. Pickford and Fairbanks produced and shot their films after 1920 at the jointly owned Pickford-Fairbanks studio on Santa Monica Boulevard. The producers who signed with UA were true independents, producing, creating and controlling their work to an unprecedented degree. As a co-founder, as well as the producer and star of her own films, Pickford became the most powerful woman <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> worked in Hollywood. By 1930, Pickford's acting career had largely faded. After retiring three years later, however, she continued to produce films for United Artists. She and Chaplin remained partners in the company for decades. Chaplin left the company in 1955, and Pickford followed suit in 1956, selling her remaining shares for three million dollars.|$|E

25|$|In his What About Those Who Have Never Heard? Sanders tells a {{story about}} a college student who {{rejected}} Christianity because, he claimed, it “damns to hell all those who never hear about Jesus.” Sanders replied that though some Christians held that position there are several other views which have been affirmed by Christians throughout history. In his book, No Other Name, he discusses a range of views affirmed by Christians. Sanders coined the term “restrictivism” for the view that Christian salvation is possible only for those who have heard about the gospel of Jesus and put their faith in Jesus prior to their death. Those who die without knowing about Jesus cannot inherit eternal life. The second view he discusses is universalism (or apokatastasis) according to which every human <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> lived will be redeemed. Between these polar views are what Sanders calls the “wider hope” and he spends the most time on two views in this category. One is what he calls eschatological evangelization or postmortem salvation. In this view if a person dies without having heard of Jesus then he or she will encounter Jesus after death and be provided an opportunity to put their faith in Jesus. The final position Sanders covers is the one he affirms: inclusivism. The unevangelized are saved by the work of Jesus if they respond in faith to God based on the revelation they have available.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, DC Comics {{launched}} its All Star imprint—an ongoing series of comics designed to pair the company's most iconic characters {{with the most}} acclaimed writers and artists in the industry.

50|$|Now, if {{we assume}} that the number of humans who will ever be born equals N1, the {{probability}} that X is amongst the first 60 billion humans <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> lived is of course 100%. However, if the number of humans who will ever be born equals N2, then the probability that X is amongst the first 60 billion humans <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> lived is only 1%. Since X is in fact amongst the first 60 billion humans <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> lived, this means that the total number of humans who will ever be born {{is more likely to be}} much closer to 60 billion than to 6,000 billion. In essence the DA therefore suggests that human extinction is more likely to occur sooner rather than later.|$|R

Nevertheless, he was also described as [...] "possibly the most distinguished man <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> worn a herald's tabard."

500|$|The Hills was {{moderately}} {{well received}} among critics. The series' first season holds {{a score of}} 52 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews", based on eight reviews. Robert Abele of LA Weekly complimented the program for being [...] "insanely watchable", while Varietys Brian Lowry criticized the storylines as being [...] "as old as they come". The second season garnered more favorable feedback, with Virginia Heffnernan of The New York Times opining that Conrad [...] "now registers as charm". After the falling-out between Conrad and Montag in the third season, Heffernan also commented that The Hills [...] "is more convincing than Friends and just about any other comedy about female relationships because — as anyone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> been a young woman knows — undying friendships die".|$|E

[...] Writing for Los Angeles Times, Denise Martin was complimentary {{of the fact that}} the conflict was [...] "unsullied" [...] despite the extensive media coverage it received before the season began, and added that it was [...] "better than anything you'd get on All My Children." [...] Furthemore, Conrad's delivery of the titular line [...] "You know what you did!"

His requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens. These would be a test of his theory: previously aspects such as coloration {{of plants and animals}} had often been regarded as having no adaptive function.

We were also treated to some excellent scenes, shot in Moscow, as the pesky Russians were established as the villains of the series."
