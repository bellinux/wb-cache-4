500|$|According to one suggestion, gumbo is a reinterpretation of {{traditional}} African cooking. [...] West Africans used the vegetable okra {{as a base}} for many dishes, including soups, often pairing okra with meat and shrimp, <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper</b> as seasonings. In Louisiana, the dish was modified to include ingredients introduced by other cultural groups. Surviving records indicate that by 1764 African slaves in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.|$|E
500|$|The {{recipe for}} a Cornish pasty, as defined by its {{protected}} status, includes diced or minced beef, onion, potato and swede in rough chunks along with some [...] "light peppery" [...] seasoning.

The use of carrot in a traditional Cornish pasty is frowned upon, though it does appear regularly in recipes.|$|E

60|$|This afternoon, {{when they}} were {{satisfied}} that all was well within their refuge, Joe laid aside his rifle, and, whistling softly, began to prepare supper. The back part of the cave permitted him to stand erect, and was large enough for comparative comfort. There was a neat, little stone fireplace, and several cooking utensils and gourds. From time to time Wetzel had brought these things. A pile of wood and a bundle of pine cones lay in one corner. Haunches of dried beef, bear and buffalo meat hung from pegs; a bag of parched corn, another of dried apples lay on a rocky shelf. Nearby hung a powder-horn filled <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper.</b> In the cleft back of the cave was a spring of clear, cold water.|$|E

60|$|Where {{they have}} no crops to lose, the people are thankful for a fall of locusts. In Al-Hijaz the flights are uncertain; during {{the last five years}} Al-Madinah has seen but few. They are {{prepared}} for eating by boiling in salt water and drying four or five days in the sun: a “wet” locust to an Arab is as a snail to a Briton. The head is plucked off, the stomach drawn, the wings and the prickly part of the legs are plucked, and the insect is ready for the table. Locusts are never eaten with sweet things, which would be nauseous: the dish is always “hot,” <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pepper,</b> or onions fried in clarified butter, when it tastes nearly as well as a plate of stale shrimps.|$|E
