2500|$|Much like Columbus Day, Thanksgiving is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} a [...] "national day of mourning", as a celebration of the cultural genocide and conquest of Native Americans by colonists. Thanksgiving has long carried a distinct resonance for Native Americans, who see the holiday as an embellished story of [...] "Pilgrims and Natives looking past their differences" [...] to break bread. Professor Dan Brook of the University of California, Berkeley condemns the [...] "cultural and political amnesia" [...] of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving: [...] "We do not have to feel guilty, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> to feel something." [...] Professor Robert Jensen of the University of Texas at Austin is somewhat harsher: [...] "One indication of moral progress in the United States would be the replacement of Thanksgiving Day and its self-indulgent family feasting with a National Day of Atonement accompanied by a self-reflective collective fasting." [...] Some of the controversy regarding Thanksgiving have been used to justify the Christmas creep (the act of putting up Christmas decorations before Thanksgiving).|$|E

He said [...] "When I was involved and worked for Gearheart Australia and we were shooting wells in 1983 and 1984, we worked alongside Halliburton to complete those jobs." [...] He went on to describe the process of fracking as he had witnessed it at the time, before discussing water issues: [...] "There is a lot of concern, obviously, about possible contamination—whether it is groundwater contamination or freshwater contamination—and the last thing oil companies want (the last thing anyone wants) is shooting off site because when you are shooting oil and gas, {{you do not want to}} shoot water... There has been a lot of emotion, and I concur with the member for Waite's comments that, yes, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> to get on with the job, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> to be careful, and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>need</b> to make sure we have the appropriate environmental management and the appropriate water management. But I can assure you—and I know very much from experience—the last thing people want to do is make a mistake in these jobs."He concluded his presentation by supporting the expansion of the practise in South Australia by saying:"We do have to make sure that the process is operated effectively and we certainly cannot have a process where hydraulic fracturing is taken out of the equation, because it is certainly a big part of making sure that the economy of this state gets going."In June 2015, Pederick went on a fracking fact-finding trip to the USA with fellow South Australian politicians Troy Bell, Mark Parnell and John Darley, and farmer David Smith.|$|E

The characteristic class approach to curvature invariants was a particular reason to make a theory, to prove a general Gauss-Bonnet theorem.|$|E
