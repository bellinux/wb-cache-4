METHODS: Of 3710 workers in a French region included in a surveillance network for musculoskeletal disorders (2002 - 2005), 2332 completed a follow-up questionnaire in 2007 - 2009 (Cosali cohort). The questionnaires included questions on musculoskeletal symptoms, and personal and occupational exposure. Incident cases of KP in 2007 - 2009 (i. e. with KP at follow-up but not at baseline) were dichotomized into chronic KP (> 30 days in the previous year) and other KP. Associations between incident KP and personal and occupational factors at baseline were studied separately according to sex using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 1616 respondents without KP at baseline, 122 (7. 5 %) reported chronic KP and 243 (15. 0 %) reported other KP. The incidence rate of chronic KP was estimated at 19. 6 per 1000 worker-years (95 % CI: 16. 3 - 23. 5). After adjustment for age and body mass index, significant associations were found between incident chronic KP and handling loads > 4 kg [odds ratio (OR) 2. 1 (1. 2 - 3. 6) for men, OR 2. 3 (1. 1 - 5. 0) for women] and kneeling > 2 h a day for men [OR 1. 8 (1. 0 - 3. 0) ].

METHODS: From 3710 <b>workers,</b> <b>representative</b> of a French region`s working population, trained occupational physicians diagnosed a total of 142 cases of RCS among men and 132 among women between 2002 - 2005. Diagnoses were established by standardized physical examination while personal factors and work exposure were assessed by self-administered questionnaires. Statistical associations between RCS and personal and work-related factors were analyzed for each gender using logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: The personal risk factors for RCS were age [odds ratio (OR) for 1 -year increment 1. 07, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 05 - 1. 09, among men and 1. 08, 95 % CI 1. 06 - 1. 10, among women] and diabetes mellitus (OR 2. 9, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 8. 6, among women).

40|$|Changing {{industrial}} relations are affecting {{the role of}} <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> around Europe. <b>Worker</b> <b>representatives</b> more and more are negotiating with management {{on behalf of the}} employees, and act as a mediator between management and their co-workers. This challenging position is still mostly occupied by men, with {{only a small percentage of}} <b>worker</b> <b>representatives</b> being female, although participation of women would contribute to more social innovations, according to Dean (2006). One reason might be, that female representatives act differently in negotiations, do get involved less in tough bargaining, and perceive less support in the organisation for this demanding role. Therefore we hypothesized: a.) 	Female representatives are more accommodating in conflicts with management, compared with men. b.) 	Accommodating behaviour is related with less perceived job resources (autonomy and social support), especially for women. In this study we approach different theoretical frameworks to analyze the differences in the behaviour of women in their position in the union and in their role as negotiators. We explore the experience of work by male and female <b>worker</b> <b>representatives,</b> focusing on the relation between the perceived job resources (autonomy and social support) and the behaviour in organizational conflicts. We focus on accommodating (giving in) behaviour, which we see as detrimental to their position and the holding of power inside the organizations. To investigate these issues we analyze a sample of 1938 shop stewards, both male and female, from four European countries (Spain, Belgium, Holland and Denmark). Using multiple regression for testing our hypotheses, we arrive at the conclusion that female representatives perceive autonomy and social support differently than male. This differentiation is only significant in countries where women posses less power positions (Spain and Belgium). Consequently, the conflict management behaviour of male and female is affected differently. We explore interventions to promote women in the role as <b>worker</b> <b>representatives,</b> as trade unions seem to be still male – dominated organisations. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} (CTS) {{is a major}} health problem among workers. The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the risk factors for CTS in workers of a large French working population. Methods: A total of 3, 710 <b>workers</b> <b>representative</b> of a French region’s working population were randomly included in the study between 2002 and 2005. A total of 134 cases of CTS were diagnosed by 83 trained occupational physicians performing a standardized physical examination that strictly applied the methodology and clinical tests of the ‘Criteria document for evaluation of the work-relatedness of upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders’ (2001). Individual factors and work exposure were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire. Statistical associations between CTS and individual and work-related factors were analyzed using logistic regression modeling.   Results: The personal risk factors for CTS were age (Odd Ratios (OR) up to 3. 5 [95 % CI 2. 2 - 3. 1] after 50 years), female gender (OR= 2. 2 [1. 5 - 3. 2]) and obesity (OR= 1. 9 [1. 1 - 3. 2]). The work-related risk factors were the high repetitiveness of the task (≥ 4 h/day) without recovery period (OR= 1. 7 [1. 0 - 3. 0]), use of vibrating hand tools (≥ 4 h/day) (OR= 1. 8 [1. 1 - 2. 9]), sustained or repeated wrist deviation (≥ 2 h/day) combined with high perceived physical demand (OR= 1. 8 [1. 1 - 2. 9]), high psychological demand of the task (OR= 1. 5 [1. 0 – 2. 1]) and low social support from colleagues (OR= 1. 5 [1. 0 – 2. 3]). Three factors related to the work organization were associated with CTS: paced work dependant on quantified targets (OR= 1. 5 [1. 0 - 2. 3]), frequent changes of job/task during the week (OR= 1. 5 [1. 0 - 2. 8]) and work with colleagues in flexible employment (OR= 1. 6 [1. 1 - 2. 3]). Discussion: Personal and work-related physical, psychosocial and organizational factors were associated with CTS.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) has evolved rapidly {{over the past}} few decades as one of the most flexible tools in medical research and diagnostic imaging. MRI facilities are important sources of multiple exposure to electromagnetic fields for both patients and health-care staff, due to the presence of electromagnetic fields of multiple frequency ranges, different temporal variations, and field strengths. Due to the increasing use and technological advancements of MRI systems, clearer insights into exposure assessment and a better understanding of possible harmful effects due to long-term exposures are highly needed. In the present exploratory study, exposure assessment and biomonitoring of MRI workers at the Radio-diagnostics Unit of the National Cancer Institute of Naples “Pascale Foundation” (Naples, Italy) have been carried out. In particular, exposure to the MRI static magnetic field (SMF) has been evaluated by means of personal monitoring, while an application tool has been developed to provide an estimate of motion-induced, time-varying electric fields. Measurement results have highlighted a high day-to-day and worker-to-worker variability of the exposure to the SMF, which strongly depends on the characteristics of the environment and on personal behaviors, and the developed application tool can be adopted as an easy-to-use tool for rapid and qualitative evaluation of motion-induced, time-varying electric field exposure. Regarding biomonitoring, the 24 workers of the Radio-diagnostics Unit were enrolled to evaluate both spontaneous and mitomycin C-induced chromosomal fragility in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, by means of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. The study subjects were 12 MRI <b>workers,</b> <b>representative</b> of different professional categories, as the exposed group, and 12 workers with no MRI exposure history, as the reference group. The results show a high worker-to-worker variability for both field exposure assessment and biomonitoring, as well as several critical issues and practicalities to be faced with in this type of investigations. The procedures for risk assessment and biomonitoring proposed here can be used to inform future research in this field, which will require a refinement of exposure assessment methods and an enlargement of the number of subjects enrolled in the biomonitoring study to gain robust statistics and reliable results...|$|E

Methods Cross-sectional study (2002 - 2005) : 3, 710 <b>workers</b> <b>representative</b> of a French region’s working population were examined by occupational physicians using a standardized physical examination(3). Personal factors and work exposures were assessed by self-administered questionnaire. Prospective study (2007 - 2010) : 1, 611 workers were re-examined. Statistical associations between CTS and personal and work-related factors were analyzed for each gender using logistic regression modeling. Results Cross sectional (CS) study: CTS were diagnosed in 89 women and 67 men. JR between several workstations on various days of the week (≥ 1 /week) was highly associated with CTS in men (OR= 2. 45, 95 % CI 1. 41 - 4. 24) (but not in women), after adjustment on personal, biomechanical and psychosocial risk factors. Prospective study: CTS were diagnosed in 21 men and 38 women. No significant association was observed with JR. Discussion JR between several workstations was highly associated with CTS (in men) in the CS study. The follow up did not confirm this result and, even more, showed an unsignificant trend for an opposite effect of JR. This inconsistency could be explained by methodological reasons (selection bias, statistical modeling, lack of statistical power, etc.). Nevertheless, JR could have several effects depending of the organization of the rotation between jobs and the jobs characteristics. JR is expected to increase the variability of wrist movements and to decrease the mechanical load(1). Moreover, JR is often associated with higher numbers of actions performed during the time cycle (job enlargement), which increases the favorable effect of JR in industrial and meat processing workers. The impact of JR could be less favorable in workers of the service industry exposed to less standardized work. In particular, JR increases the task complexity and the number of actions to learn. In lack of training, workers can be insufficiently skilled to cope with all dimensions of the tasks, leading them to adopt unsafe working techniques that may increase the risk of CTS. JR without adequate training may therefore be less effective than expected. The occurrence of opposite effects of JR could explain our conflicting results. Conclusions JR could have contradictory effects in the regional workforce. More quantitative and qualitative studies are needed to better understand the impact of the various forms of JR on CTS...|$|E
