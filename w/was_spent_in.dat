5|$|As {{his father}} was playing for the Chicago Blackhawks, Hull's early life <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> Illinois, and he first played {{organized}} hockey in the Chicago area {{at the age of}} four. He and his brothers often skated with the Black Hawks where they watched their father play. The family moved back to Canada when Bobby signed with the original Winnipeg Jets in 1972. Brett moved to Vancouver with his mother and two youngest siblings shortly before his parents' acrimonious divorce in 1979. Hull was not close to his father following the breakup, though the two spoke periodically.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} he was 6 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died, while his father and brother were {{continuously}} active in the Roman military, commanding armies in Germania and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> the absence of his near relatives. During the Jewish-Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as city prefect of Rome; or possibly even Marcus Cocceius Nerva, a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.|$|E

5|$|During the evening, the 14th RWF {{launched}} a minor trench raid. On 8 July, {{this was supposed}} to develop into an attack on the southern tip of the wood. While the division prepared to launch a battalion-sized attack, XV Corps commander Lieutenant General Henry Horne ordered a smaller attack by a platoon. The day <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> confusion; conflicting orders were issued and Horne travelled to the division to clarify his intentions. In the end, no attack was launched.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's youth <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> a Florence {{that was}} ornamented by {{the works of}} these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with gold leaf, {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Alberti's treatise De Pictura were to {{have a profound effect on}} younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.|$|E

5|$|Olds was {{promoted}} to brigadier general after returning from Vietnam but did not hold another major command. The remainder of his career <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> non-operational positions, as Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy and as an official in the Air Force Inspector General's Office. His inability to rise higher as a general officer is attributed to both his maverick views and his penchant for drinking.|$|E
5|$|Shooting of Rashomon {{began on}} July 7, 1950, and, after {{extensive}} location {{work in the}} primeval forest of Nara, wrapped on August 17. Just one week <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> hurried post-production, hampered by a studio fire, and the finished film premiered at Tokyo's Imperial Theatre on August 25, expanding nationwide the following day. The movie was met by lukewarm reviews, with many critics puzzled by its unique theme and treatment, but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for Daiei.|$|E

5|$|The {{first ten}} months of Nayyouf's {{sentence}} were served in Sednaya Prison outside Damascus. While at Sednaya, Nayyouf tried {{to organize a}} prisoner revolt. He was moved to Palmyra prison near Tadmur. In 1993, Nayyouf went on a thirteen-day hunger strike at Palmyra in order to protest the torture of prisoners. While at Palmyra, Nayyouf was able to pass evidence that the prisoners were being tortured to the press outside, which led to another transfer to Mezzeh prison, a military prison outside Damascus. Most of his ten-year sentence <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> solitary confinement in Mezzeh.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the regiment's time, when not on expeditions, <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> fatigue duty building fortifications around Suffolk.

This was exacerbated by antagonistic feelings between the civilians of occupied Suffolk and the enlisted men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} out of {{commission}} from 1903 to 1906, Yorktown hosted Secretary of the Navy Victor H. Metcalf on board when he greeted the Great White Fleet on its arrival in San Francisco in May 1907. Over the next five years, most of Yorktowns time <b>was</b> <b>spent</b> <b>in</b> sealing patrols in Alaska and duty in Latin American ports. From July 1912, Yorktown was out of commission for alterations, but resumed duties off the Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran coasts beginning in April 1913. Through World War I, Yorktown continued in the same role, until she departed for the East Coast of the United States in April 1918. She served an escort for one convoy headed to Halifax in August, and remained in coastal escort duties in the east until January 1919. After arrival at San Diego in February, she was decommissioned for the final time in June 1919; she was sold in 1921 to an Oakland firm and broken up that same year.|$|E
