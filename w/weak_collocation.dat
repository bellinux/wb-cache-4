40|$|Advantages {{of dealing}} with {{acoustic}} wave equations by high-order methods are their enhanced accuracy {{and the possibility of}} using fewer points per minimum wavelength. On the other hand, they require a more sophisticated mathematical theory. A numerical treatment by spectral <b>weak</b> <b>collocation</b> approximation is presented. Numerical aspects concerning stability, convergence and time-advancing schemes are discussed. Absorbing boundary conditions are introduced to fit realistic physical situations with a suitable mathematical description...|$|E
40|$|A weak Legendre {{spectral}} method is {{developed for the}} solution of the primitive variable formulation of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, in general two-dimensional and axisymmetric geometries. A semi-implicit projection method is utilized for the temporal approximation and for decoupling the velocity field from the pressure field. A series of elliptic boundary value problems arises from the above procedure, each of which is spatially discretized by a <b>weak</b> <b>collocation</b> method in multiple nonoverlapping subdomains. In particular, a modified variational formulation of the partial differential equations is presented which leads, after discretization, to a weak multidomain approximation of the corresponding problems. A weak formalism for the influence matrix technique is also developed, which is consistent with the spatial discretization scheme and successfully separate the equations for the internal nodes from the ones governing the interface unknowns. A method of dealing with the singularity problem faced by the weak formulation at axisymmetric problems is proposed, while a combination of direct methods is studied for tackling effectively the linear algebraic systems resulting from the full discretization. Exponential convergence is demonstrated for a plethora of Stokes and Navier-Stokes simulations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|A multidomain Legendre pseudospectral {{method is}} {{developed}} for the solution of linear hyperbolic initial boundary value problems, with mixed boundary conditions, in general two-dimensional and axisymmetric geometries. A <b>weak</b> <b>collocation</b> spectral method is utilized for the spatial approximation of a generic wave evolution equation over multiple nonoverlapping subdomains. The system of ordinary differential equations that stems from the above procedure is integrated in time by implicit as well as explicit high order temporal approximation algorithms. The weak formalism of the influence matrix method is combined with the implicit approximation. so as to efficiently solve the coupled system of linear equations after the full discretization, while a novel technique for avoiding the amplification of roundoff error at high temporal resolution simulations with the implicit temporal integration methods. is also studied. An innovative method {{for the treatment of}} Dirichlet boundary conditions is proposed, {{in order to avoid the}} order reduction which usually arises with the utilization of the explicit time integrator. Furthermore, appropriate modifications are reported. for dealing with the pole singularity problem faced by the weak formulation of axisymmetric problems. Finally. numerical simulations of a variety of wave problems on curvilinear geometries and unstructured subdomain configuration: are presented in order to assess the capabilities of the proposed methodology in handling efficiently general hyperbolic differential operators.

40|$|A {{numerical}} methodology {{is presented}} for the coupled aerodynamic and aeroacoustic analysis of time dependent laminar viscous flows in general two-dimensional geometries. The overall procedure is constituted firstly by {{the solution of}} the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and secondly by the solution of a linear evolution equation of second order in space and time which originates from Lighthill's acoustic analogy. A semi-implicit projection method is utilized for the time integration of the incompressible Navier-Stokes system, while a choice between a second order implicit Newmark scheme and a fourth order explicit Runge-Kutta-Nystrom method is offered for the temporal discretization of the wave equation. The multidomain <b>weak</b> Legendre <b>collocation</b> spectral method on quadrilateral subdomain topologies is employed for the spatial approximation of both the fluid dynamic and the acoustic problems. A specific pulsating internal flow inside a plane constricted channel is selected as a representative application for the assessment of the capabilities of the proposed discrete algorithm. Numerous results are presented and discussed, so as to thoroughly demonstrate the behavior of the numerical procedure. (C) 2007 The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B. V.
