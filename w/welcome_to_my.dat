[...] Love It to Death launched Ezrin's own production career, which went on to include prominent albums such as Aerosmith's Get Your Wings (1974), Kiss's Destroyer (1976), and Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979).|$|E
500|$|The kernel, the soul—let us {{go further}} {{and say the}} substance, the bulk, the actual and {{valuable}} material of all human utterances—is plagiarism ... Don't pirate my editions; do plunder my visions. The {{name of the game}} is Give All. You, reader, are <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> stories. They were never mine in the first place, but I gave them to you.The essay was included in his 2011 collection, The Ecstasy of Influence: Nonfictions, Etc.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed!" [...] {{answered}} the Red Rogue, mockingly. [...] "I wouldn't deceive any {{one for the}} world. But, if you don't believe me, you are <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> search <b>my</b> castle." ...|$|R
500|$|... "I'm {{very proud}} of the book and I'm very {{disappointed}} at Madonna's reaction. I think the problem is that she wants control over everything – that's one of the themes of the book, and secondly she seems to be almost disowning her past at the moment. She's reinventing herself as an upper-class, English aristocrat, and the former vegetarian who now goes hunting, fishing and shooting. My door's always open – Madonna's <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> house for a cup of tea.|$|E
500|$|On October 27, 2005, Hastert {{became the}} first Speaker to author a blog. On [...] "Speaker's Journal" [...] on his {{official}} House website, Hastert wrote in his first post: [...] "This is Denny Hastert and <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> blog. This is new to me. I can’t say I’m much of a techie. I {{guess you could say}} my office is teaching the old guy new tricks. But I'm excited. This is the future. And it is a new way for us to get our message out." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Haunted" [...] {{along with}} a medley of songs from her fifth studio album. It served as the second song of the set and it featured the singer dressed in a jeweled bodysuit. After concluding with [...] "Mine" [...] she announced [...] "MTV, <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> world" [...] and performed [...] "Haunted" [...] surrounded by smoke on stage. As she sang the song, Beyoncé was surrounded by dancers wearing bustiers, sleeves and face cages by fashion label Chromat. Nadeska Alexis of MTV News stated that {{the performance of the}} song was among the [...] "most soul-baring of the night".|$|E
6000|$|Bless my life!' said Mr Pecksniff, looking up, and {{gradually}} exchanging his abstracted face {{for one of}} joyful recognition. 'Here already! Martin, my dear boy, I am delighted <b>to</b> <b>welcome</b> you <b>to</b> <b>my</b> poor house!' ...|$|R

500|$|Also, some direct {{allusions to}} death, killing actions, and violent expressions, {{as well as}} {{offensive}} words {{have been replaced by}} softer expressions. For example, after Edgar, Locke and Terra flee on chocobos from Figaro Castle, Kefka orders two Magitek Armored soldiers to chase them by shouting [...] "Go! KILL THEM!", in the Japanese version. It was translated as [...] "Go! Get them!" [...] Also, when Imperial Troopers burn Figaro Castle, and Edgar claims Terra is not hidden inside the castle, Kefka replies [...] "then you can burn to death" [...] in the Japanese version, which was replaced in the English version by [...] "Then <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> barbecue!". Similarly, as Magitek soldiers watch Edgar and his guests escape on Chocobos, one swears in Japanese, [...] "Son of a bitch!", which was translated by Ted Woolsey as [...] "Son of a submariner!". The localization also featured changes to several names, such as [...] "Tina" [...] being changed to [...] "Terra". Finally, dialogue text files had to be shortened due to the limited data storage space available on the game cartridge's read-only memory. As a result, additional changes were rendered to dialogue in order to compress it into the available space.|$|E
500|$|The BBC used viral {{promotion}} on the EastEnders homepage {{to further}} develop {{the character of}} Danielle. A new section named Danielle's Diary was launched, encompassing events in the show from 6 October 2008 onwards, written in diary style from Danielle's point of view. Insight was given into the character's thoughts and feelings on the events surrounding her each week, beginning with the introduction: [...] "Bit new to all this. Need some way to clear my head though. Can't really talk to Stace. Or Callum. Or anyone. Maybe if I write it all down, my head won't explode... Anyway, <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> life in Walford." [...] In this manner, viewers were {{able to keep up}} with the character during her temporary absence from the show in February 2009, when she returned home to Telford following her abortion: [...] "Back in Dawley. Feels strange to be away from Stacey... away from R away from Ronnie. Been sleeping a lot – so tired. When I was younger I never dreamt that I’d go through all of this. Stace keeps ringing, but I can’t speak to anyone. I can’t even listen to my voicemail", and were privy to Danielle's internal worries about her relationship with Ronnie: [...] "It's like I scare R. It was as though she scared herself, as she actually admitted that she cared. For about ten seconds I felt close to her again. Like watching the sun appear from behind a cloud... feeling the warmth across your skin again. But, then it disappears as another cloud sweeps over it." [...] The final entry, dated minutes before Danielle's on-screen death, reads: [...] "All I ever wanted was for mum to look at me with love in her eyes. To call me her baby. To tell me she loved me. I have to leave now. I have to go back to Telford. Goodbye Walford." [...] After the character had been killed off, the diary format gave way to a wall of memorial messages, supposedly penned by other EastEnders characters, including Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield), Callum and Stacey.|$|E

2500|$|A 2005 Dutch {{documentary}} about Johnston for the TV series R.A.M. was followed in 2006 by The Devil and Daniel Johnston. Jeff Feuerzeig's documentary, {{four years in}} the making, collated some of the vast amount of recorded material Johnston (and in some case, others) had produced over the years to portray his life and music. The film won high praise, receiving the Director's Award at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. The film also inspired more interest in Johnston's work, and increased his prestige as a touring artist. In 2006, Johnston's label, Eternal Yip Eye Music, released his first greatest-hits compilation, <b>Welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> World. He appeared as musical guest on The Henry Rollins Show, performing [...] "Mask" [...] and [...] "Care Less" [...] (the latter was exclusive to the Internet).|$|E
2500|$|As a singer, Martin {{copied the}} styles of Harry Mills (of the Mills Brothers), Bing Crosby, and Perry Como until he {{developed}} {{his own and}} could hold his own in duets with Sinatra and Crosby. Like Sinatra, he could not read music, but he recorded more than 100 albums and 600 songs. His signature tune, [...] "Everybody Loves Somebody", knocked the Beatles' [...] "A Hard Day's Night" [...] off {{number one in the}} United States in 1964. This was followed by [...] "The Door is Still Open to My Heart", which reached number six that year. Elvis Presley was said to have been influenced by Martin, and patterned [...] "Love Me Tender" [...] after his style. Martin, like Elvis, was influenced by country music. By 1965, some of Martin's albums, such as Dean [...] "Tex" [...] Martin Rides Again, Houston, <b>Welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>My</b> World, and Gentle on My Mind, were composed of country and western songs by artists such as Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, and Buck Owens.

The final album of his recording career was 1983's The Nashville Sessions.|$|E

5000|$|At Skepticon IV (2011) {{the event}} {{featured}} {{a tour of}} a nearby creationist museum, two full days of lectures detailing science-related topics, and a performance by Atheist Evangelist Brother Sam Singleton. A local gelato shop owner took offense to Singleton’s performance and posted a sign in the store window which read [...] "Skepticon is NOT <b>welcomed</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> Christian Business." [...] The resulting internet reaction had {{a negative impact on}} the store’s user ratings on a number of consumer satisfaction websites. [...] Three days later the shop owner posted an apology on the website Reddit. Concern over whether the sign violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 earned the incident the nickname “gelato-gate”.|$|R
