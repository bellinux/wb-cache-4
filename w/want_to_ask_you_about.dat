60|$|SIBYL. Yes; {{and we all}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> a {{great many}} other things besides.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> my husband's case," [...] Mrs. Trevennack began, trembling. And {{the great}} specialist, all attention, {{leaned forward and}} listened to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> Harney. Isn't {{there some}} place around here {{where we might}} hide the prisoners? A cave, or {{something}} like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! You think so? When I saw you I didn't {{know why}} you were here. I was glad when you spoke to me because {{this is exactly what}} I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> for. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if you ever meet Captain Anthony--by any chance--anywhere--you are a sailor too, are you not?--that you, would never mention--never--that--that you had seen me over there." ...|$|R
60|$|JOB ARTHUR. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Mr. Gerald Barlow, why {{you have}} given {{occasion}} for this present trouble.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jimmy, I've been {{thinking}} it over. There's something I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> Do you {{admit that you}} behaved abominably five years ago?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} ready," [...] the girl said; [...] "but I {{wish you would}} have stopped, {{there are so many}} things I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> and these Yankee papers, which are all we see now, are full of lies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> the man we rescued in the woods, Ruth," [...] he said. [...] "Probably {{you know}} him. His name is Stevenson, {{although}} {{he said he}} was usually called Uncle Barney by all who knew him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter," [...] said Poirot, not betraying {{any sign of}} disappointment. [...] "Now I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> {{something}} else. There is a saucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp's room with some coco in it. Did she have that every night?" ...|$|E
60|$|COKESON. But we don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be unreasonable. He's quite downhearted. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> let him {{run about}} with the others.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I--er--no, thank <b>you.</b> I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question. What is your candid {{opinion of}} those verses Mr Wells was reading just now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, what we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> specially, Johnson, {{was whether}} {{you can tell us}} what the {{servants}} at the Hall thought about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that he's a poet, of course," [...] said Cassandra. [...] "But I {{must confess}} that I knew that before, so it isn't fair. I've got your {{manuscript}} with me," [...] she went on, disregarding Mr. Peyton in a shameless way. [...] "I've got {{all sorts of}} things I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it." ...|$|E
60|$|Wait a moment, Timothy, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> your children. What do {{you hear}} from Minnie? I always took an {{interest}} in her, you know,--especially {{when she was in the}} tool packing department of the shops, and I had her in my Bible class. I appreciated your letting her come,--an Irishman and a Catholic as you are.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I'm betraying a {{confidence}} in admitting it. Anyway, I felt that one ought {{to help him}} for the family's sake, lest he get into worse trouble; and I could afford the loan. Since I married I've been making some money. But I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> this Harding. What kind of fellow is he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{but look}} here. I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> one question. What {{sort of a}} time did you have in that scratch game tonight?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Mr. Burton," [...] he said, [...] "what {{you think}} of your surroundings--of the {{restaurant}} and your neighbors on every side?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Jenney said {{something}} else that--that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> about," [...] she went on, breathing more deeply. [...] "It {{was about the}} railroad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Marx, father," [...] I began. [...] "Everything {{concerning}} him is {{so utterly}} mysterious, especially his going away so suddenly. Apart from {{the fear of}} his having used some sort of foul play towards Hart--or Francis--I can't help thinking {{that there is something}} else wrong with him. You trust him thoroughly, I suppose?" [...] I added hesitatingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt Clara says I am spoiling my hands, but I don't care, for I've {{had such}} good times with Aunt Plenty, and I {{think she has}} enjoyed {{it as much as}} I have. Only one thing {{troubles}} me, uncle, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it," [...] said Rose, as they paced up and down the hall in the twilight, the bandaged hand very carefully laid on Dr. Alec's arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so, Ralph. Of {{course it}} is a long story; but I must tell you at once that there is nothing very {{exciting}} in it, and that it differed little from that of others who have been prisoners among the Moors, save that I was strangely fortunate, and suffered no hardships whatever. And now I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> clothes. Have my things been sold, or are they still in the store?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Passmore, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> some questions," [...] said Roger. [...] "Do {{you know}} an elderly gentleman {{here by the}} name of Fordham?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you {{are quite}} a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will get on whether your {{relations}} notice you or not. There was something I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> Have you ever heard anything from your father's kinsfolk, the Eyres?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Lord Wolfenden," [...] she said, {{drawing her}} fingers slowly {{away from his}} {{lingering}} clasp, [...] "does this locket belong to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{you put it}} off, Bertrand?" [...] she begged. [...] "It is {{five weeks}} since I have seen you. Every day I have hoped that you would run up, {{if it was only}} for an hour. Bertrand dear, don't go to this dinner. Can't we have {{something}} here, and go for a walk in the country before my train goes, or sit in your study and talk? There are so many things I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> our future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} a letter about Ovid, from {{a friend of mine}} in Canada. There is an allusion to him of the {{complimentary}} sort, which I don't altogether understand. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it--but I can't spare the time to go a-visiting. So much the better for me--I hate conversation, and I like work. You have got your carriage--and your fine friends are out of town. If you want a drive, come to me, and bring your last letters from Ovid with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{gave him}} a {{pleading}} look that seemed to say: “Please be very simple—very simple indeed.” Then she glanced about her as {{if there had been}} other people in the room; she didn’t wish to appear closeted with him or to have come on purpose. There she was at any rate, and she proceeded. “When my son told me he should ask you to come down I was very glad. I mean of course we were delighted—” And she paused a moment. But she next went on: “I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Mrs. Headway.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Professor {{spoke up}} like a man," [...] she agreed, [...] "but, Laura, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> something. Did you notice his servant--that man Craig?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Croup," [...] said he, [...] "I {{heard you}} swear once, and I never heard anybody swear better, {{and with more}} conscience. You did that {{swearing}} for me, and now I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> if you {{will be willing to}} swear for me again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed!" [...] exclaimed Patsy Doyle. [...] "I'm {{just crazy}} over this motion picture {{business}} and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> girls a thousand questions about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{something}} going on in Monte Carlo," [...] Lady Hunterleys went on, [...] "which I cannot understand. Mr. Draconmeyer knows about it, I believe, although he is not personally concerned in it. But he will tell me nothing. I only know that for some reason or other your presence here {{seems to be an}} annoyance to certain people. Why it should be I don't know, but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it. Will you tell me the truth? Are you sure that you did not come here to spy upon me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The same! You do not {{suppose that}} Ned pays me compliments. He never {{did such a}} thing in his life. No: I first {{discovered}} his talent in that direction at Palermo, where I surprised him in an animated discourse with the dark-eyed daughter of an innkeeper there. That was the first conversation in Italian I succeeded in following. A week later I could understand the language almost as well as he. However, dont let us waste the whole afternoon talking stuff. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> your mother. I should greatly like to call upon her; but she has never made me any sign since my marriage; and Mrs. Leith Fairfax tells me that she never allows my name to be mentioned to her. I thought she was fond of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, I suppose that's his boat, out there, now." [...] Mrs. Maynard {{pointed to}} a little craft just coming to anchor inside the reef. [...] "He said {{he wanted me to}} take a sail with him, this morning; and he said he would come up and ask you, too. I do hope you'll go, Grace. It's just as calm; and he always has a man with him to help sail the boat, so there is n't the least danger." [...] Grace looked at her in silent sorrow, and Mrs. Maynard went on with {{sympathetic}} seriousness: [...] "Oh! there's one thing I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> Grace: I don't like to have any concealments from you." [...] Grace did not speak, but she permitted Mrs. Maynard to proceed: [...] "Barlow recommended it, and he's lived here a great while. His brother took it, and he had the regular old New England consumption. I thought I shouldn't like to try it without your knowing it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question. During {{the whole}} of that conversation, did Booth in any way suggest that that child had been sold?' Borner replied:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Well, we won't go into that,' {{said his}} earlship, 'an' I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question. I suppose you {{represent}} {{the middle class}} in your country?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not altogether," [...] Mr. Jarvis admitted. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth," [...] he went on, confidentially, [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a {{question}} or two." ...|$|R
