She moved into Tracy's house for this period, and was {{with him when he}} died on June 10, 1967. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral. It was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star. In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, [...] "I honestly don't know. I can only say that I could never have left him." [...] She claimed to not know how he felt about her and that they [...] "just passed twenty-seven years [...] together in what <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> absolute bliss." ...|$|E
500|$|As War Secretary, Benjamin was {{responsible}} for a territory stretching from Virginia to Texas. [...] It was his job, with Davis looking over his shoulder, to supervise the Confederate Army and to feed, supply, and arm it—in a nascent country with almost no arms manufacturers. [...] Accordingly, Benjamin saw his job as closely tied to foreign affairs, as the Confederacy was dependent on imports to supply its troops. Davis had determined on a [...] "defensive war" [...] strategy—the Confederacy would await invasion by the North, then seek to defeat its armies until Lincoln tired of sending them. Davis and Benjamin worked together closely, and as Davis {{came to realize that}} his subordinate was loyal both to the Confederacy and to Davis personally, he returned complete trust in Benjamin. [...] Varina Davis wrote, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a curious spectacle, the steady approximation to a thorough friendliness of the President and his War Minister. [...] It was a very gradual rapprochement, but all the more solid for that reason." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 1911 Heseltine {{learned that}} Thomas Beecham was {{to conduct an}} all-Delius concert at London's Queen's Hall on the 16th of that month, at which the {{composer}} would be present, and his Songs of Sunset would be given its first performance. Colin Taylor, a sympathetic Eton piano tutor, secured permission from the school for Heseltine to attend the event. Prior to this, his mother had contrived to meet Delius in her London home; as a consequence, during the concert intermission Heseltine {{was introduced to the}} composer. The next day he wrote Delius a long appreciative letter: [...] "I cannot adequately express in words the intense pleasure it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to hear such perfect performances of such perfect music". He told his mother that [...] "Friday evening was the most perfectly happy evening I have ever spent, and I shall never forget it". Delius became the first strong formative influence of Heseltine's compositional career, and although the initial adulation was later modified, a friendship began that would largely endure for the remainder of Heseltine's life.|$|E

[...] To be sure, this kind of work <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a great mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' [...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art. [...] I expect that it will contain some fairly new things." ...|$|E

Disney's Michael Eisner explains, [...] "Estelle Getty made our three women into girls. And that <b>was,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> what made it seem like {{it could be a}} contemporary, young show." [...] As surprising as it may sound, Estelle Getty continuously battled her stage fright. During an interview in 1988, Getty commented on her phobia and expressed how working with major stars, such as Arthur and White, made her even more nervous. At times, she even froze on camera while filming.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2015, {{during a}} video conference {{to promote the}} {{documentary}} Terminal F about Edward Snowden, Bolivia's ambassador to Russia, María Luisa Ramos Urzagaste, accused Assange of putting the life of Bolivian president Evo Morales at risk by intentionally providing the United States with false rumours that Snowden was on the president's plane when it was forced to land in Vienna in July 2013. [...] "It is possible that in this wide-ranging game that you began my president did not play a crucial role, but what you did was not important to my president, but it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and the citizens of our country. And I have faith that when you planned this game you took into consideration the consequences", the ambassador told Assange. Assange stated that the plan [...] "was not completely honest, but we did consider that the final result would have justified our actions. We weren't expecting this outcome. The result {{was caused by the}} United States' intervention. We can only regret what happened." [...] Later, in an interview with Democracy Now!, Assange explained the story of the grounding of Morales' plane, saying that after the United States cancelled Snowden's passport, WikiLeaks thought about other strategies to take him to Latin America, and they considered private presidential jets of those countries which offered support. The appointed jet was that of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, but Assange stated that [...] "our code language that we used deliberately swapped the presidential jet that we were considering for the Bolivian jet [...] and in some of our communications, we deliberately spoke about that on open lines to lawyers in the United States. And we didn’t think much more of it. [...] We didn’t think this was anything more than just distracting." [...] Eventually, the plan was not pursued and, under Assange's advice, Snowden sought asylum in Russia.|$|E
