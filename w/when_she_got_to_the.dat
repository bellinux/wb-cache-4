500|$|After leaving Versailles, neither Jourdain nor Moberly {{mentioned}} the incident {{to one another}} until a week later. Moberly wrote a letter about the trip to her sister and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> afternoon of the Versailles incident, she asked Jourdain if she thought the Petit Trianon was haunted. Jourdain {{told her that she}} thought it was. Three months later in Oxford, [...] they compared their notes, then decided to write separate accounts of what happened and research the history of the Trianon. In doing so, they found that on 10 August 1792, the Tuileries palace in Paris was besieged, the king's Swiss guards were massacred and the monarchy itself was abolished six weeks later.|$|E

There they grabbed her and raped her in a house. There were fifteen girls raped {{and then they were}} riddled with bullets. Afterward, they were buried by the people, in a clandestine cemetery." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Phial of Dread {{was one of}} Ludlow's {{earliest}} magazine stories, {{published in}} October 1859. It is written as the journal of a chemist who is visited in his laboratory by the insane daughter of an acquaintance, who felt herself pursued by Death. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lab, she immediately sought out some chemical with which she could kill herself: ...|$|E

6000|$|We <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work on {{the letter}} again, and of course {{did not have to}} strike out the passage about the wound. Joan was in fine spirits; but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> sending {{messages}} to this, that, and the other playmate and friend, it brought our village and the Fairy Tree and the flowery plain and the browsing sheep and all the peaceful beauty of our old humble home-place back, and the familiar names began to tremble on her lips; and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Haumette and Little Mengette it was no use, her voice broke and she couldn't go on. She waited a moment, then said: ...|$|R
60|$|While {{she talked}} of his son, Mr. Weston's {{attention}} was chained; but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Maple Grove, he could recollect {{that there were}} ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.|$|R
2500|$|Case-law {{where this}} test applies {{includes}} McLoughlin v O'Brian [...] AC 410, {{in which the}} husband and children of the claimant {{were involved in a}} car accident that was caused by the negligence of the defendant. The claimant found out about the accident an hour later and, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital two hours later, one child had already died. She saw her husband and children suffering and suffered shock, depression and a change of personality. The court established a spectrum of proximity; a pedestrian should be able to withstand seeing the accidents that occur in everyday life, but a family member of the victims will inevitably suffer greater emotional harm. Nonetheless, simply seeing the aftermath of the accident and not witnessing it is insufficient proximity. Similarly, seeing a video of the accident is insufficient.|$|E

6000|$|The widow unwillingly got up {{to fetch}} her guest. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, she turned round, and said, [...] "And is there a notice, as you calls it, to be sarved on Miss Lynch?" ...|$|E

50|$|Hilde Rake {{was working}} in Berlin as a clerk at the Reich Insurance Institute for Clerical Workers <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> know Hans Coppi, who had only just been {{released}} from prison.

60|$|The girl heeded {{not these}} words, but kept on her way. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> a {{turn in the}} road, however, she looked back mournfully, as though in doubt whether to return and cast herself upon his breast, and bid him trust in her; but pride overcame her, and she {{resisted}} the impulse.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a cold-blooded}} barbarian it is! Don't hit a woman when she's down. Can't we do anything? She was simply {{dropping}} with starvation.

5000|$|On {{the train}} journey, Kate was shown holding the book A Children's Treasury of Milligan, {{and read the}} poem [...] "On the Ning Nang Nong" [...] to her older sister, Laura.

6000|$|His {{grandmother}} smiled,--for Caleb {{had evidently}} got bewildered, in his drowsiness, {{so that he}} had not a very distinct recollection of the story.

6000|$|... "For {{several days}} we were entertained with {{depositions}} about boats 'smelling a bar.' Why did the Afton then, {{after she had}} come up smelling {{so close to the}} long pier sheer off so strangely. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre of the very nose she was smelling she seemed suddenly to have lost her sense of smell and to have flanked over to the short pier." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office {{she asked}} for the luggage that she had left there on the Saturday {{as well as the}} trunk left on the morning just lapsed. All were put in the boat, and she herself followed. Quickly as these things had been done, the whole proceeding, nevertheless, had been almost {{automatic}} on Baptista's part, ere she had come to any definite conclusion on her course.|$|E
60|$|And now {{she began}} {{wondering}} what <b>she</b> should do <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Dorfield, if {{the little man}} also left the train at that station. Such an act on his part would prove that her suspicions were correct, in which case she would lead him straight to her grandfather, whom she would thus deliver into {{the power of his}} merciless enemies.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> the parlor, {{she heard}} some one {{coughing}} in a fat voice; and there sat Mr. Jackson himself.|$|R
60|$|The next forenoon Miss Octavia got off {{the train}} at the Arundel station with a very grim face. There had been an unusually severe frost for the time of year. All along the road Miss Octavia had seen gardens frosted and spoiled. She knew what <b>she</b> should see <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> her own--the dahlia stalks {{drooping}} and black and limp, the nasturtiums and balsams and poppies and pansies all withered and ruined.|$|R

60|$|The {{girl who}} had {{conducted}} the party through the garden now began {{to lead the way}} back again, and they all followed her. As she walked along, the girl began to gather flowers from the beds and borders, and finally made quite a pretty bouquet. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate, and was ready to open it, she presented this bouquet in a very polite and graceful manner to Allie. Rollo took some money from his pocket, and put it into her hand; and then she opened the gate, and let them all out.|$|E
60|$|She strayed absorbedly on, {{over the}} brooks. She {{wanted to go}} to the mill-pond above. The big mill-house was deserted, save for a {{labourer}} and his wife who lived in the kitchen. So she passed through the empty farm-yard and through the wilderness of a garden, and mounted the bank by the sluice. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top, to see the old, velvety surface of the pond before her, she noticed a man on the bank, tinkering with a punt. It was Birkin sawing and hammering away.|$|E
2500|$|Fans, {{aware that}} Miranda Montgomery, Bianca's first child, {{who was the}} result of rapist Michael Cambias, speculated Zach Slater as the child's {{biological}} father; Zach was Michael's older brother. Fans theorized that Bianca wanted a baby closely related to Miranda and asked Zach to father the child. If Bianca were already pregnant <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Pine Valley, then Zach could have [...] "donated" [...] last time Bianca was in town, even though the timing within the series was off.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with The New York Times, she said: “One of the first songs we learn in kindergarten is ‘The Communist Party is closer to me than my mother.’” <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Canada, her mother encouraged her to explore alternate view points. “My mother showed {{me a lot of}} things that aren’t shown in China, like the Tiananmen massacre, Falun Gong persecution, and the Tibetan issue,” Lin said. “I felt so deceived. I felt like my life was in a smear campaign for 13 years.” ...|$|R
5000|$|King {{attributes}} {{the beginning of}} Sprout Up, founded in 2009, to not one, but two big [...] "thank you's." [...] The first came from two parents, who were astonished to see their developmentally disabled son overcome his fear of waves at a summer surf camp because of King. The second unforgettable [...] "thank you" [...] came from an inspired 2nd grade girl, for whom the highlight of each school week was King's science lesson, especially <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> [...] "dance" [...] like a bumblebee or nurture her own seed to grow tall and strong.|$|R
60|$|After a while, {{finding that}} nothing more happened, she decided on {{going into the}} garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, she found she had {{forgotten}} the little golden key, and when {{she went back to}} the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.|$|E
60|$|The Queen, quite delighted, {{thanked the}} Fairy gratefully, and begged {{her to take}} charge of the little Delicia and bring her up as her own daughter. This she agreed to do, and then they shut the basket and lowered it carefully, baby and all, to the ground {{at the foot of the}} tower. The Fairy then changed herself back into the form of a mouse, and this delayed her a few seconds, after which she ran nimbly down the straw rope, but only to find <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom that the baby had disappeared.|$|E
6000|$|A {{great many}} women have made the ascent of Mont Blanc. An English girl, Miss Stratton, {{conceived}} the daring idea, {{two or three years}} ago, of attempting the ascent in the middle of winter. She tried it--and she succeeded. Moreover, she froze two of her fingers on the way up, {{she fell in love with}} her guide on the summit, and she married him <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom again. There is nothing in romance, in the way of a striking [...] "situation," [...] which can beat this love scene in midheaven on an isolated ice-crest with the thermometer at zero and an Artic gale blowing.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> upstairs <b>to</b> Elizabeth-Jane's {{room the}} latter {{had taken off}} her out-door things, and was resting over a book. Lucetta found in a moment {{that she had not}} yet learnt the news.|$|R

50|$|Cooper {{began her}} {{professional}} career in 2007. She first started playing senior international tournaments <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> round '1/32' in the Scottish Open 2003 with her doubles partner in November 2003. Since {{then she had}} entered many other competitions building up to quarter and semi final stages. More recently she had become the winner of women's doubles {{for the first time}} in November 2008 in the Scottish Open, exactly 5 years after her first start there. Cooper then went on to win the Welsh International doubles and mixed Doubles titles one week after her Scottish Open success in December 2008.|$|R
