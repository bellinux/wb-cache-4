50|$|Originally, {{power looms}} used a shuttle {{to throw the}} weft across, but in 1927 the faster and more {{efficient}} shuttleless loom came into use. Sulzer Brothers, a Swiss company had the exclusive rights to shuttleless looms in 1942, and licensed the American production to Warner & Swasey. Draper licensed the slower rapier loom. Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximise production for specific types of material. The most common of these are Sulzer shuttleless <b>weaving</b> <b>machines,</b> rapier <b>looms,</b> air-jet looms and water-jet looms.|$|R
50|$|Next {{process in}} the textile {{production}} is fabric manufacturing. Fabric Manufacturing laboratory has variety of <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> from hand <b>loom</b> to high speed air jet loom. This laboratory consist of dobby and jacquard hand looms, dobby and jacquard shuttle looms, terry towel looms, rapier dobby and jacquard looms, air jet <b>loom,</b> sectional warping <b>machine</b> and sizing machine.|$|R
5000|$|From 2007-2008, he was {{commissioned}} by the Osage Art Foundation to create a large-scale work titled “Musical Wheel”, a rotational wheel six meters in diameter, where participants are invited to sit inside the work. On the rotational ring, there are nine pieces of curved wooden soundboards mounted with hundreds of strings; as the boards turn slowly, the strings create ambient music from all four sides the wheel. Ng was attracted to {{the energy of the}} area in which the gallery was situated, he said “The gallery is nestled in a district which tells an interesting, orchestral tune: on a daily basis, there are men repairing car wheels, people pushing trolleys, forklifts transporting goods, ventilation fans humming, printing drums turning, <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> <b>looming.</b> This collective rotational energy of the working class becomes a core essence of the work.” [...] The artist wanted to interrogate the relationship between the gallery space and the location in which it was situated - the Osage Kwun Tong Gallery, being the largest contemporary art space in Hong Kong, and the district, the earliest and most representative industrial quarter in Hong Kong.|$|R

40|$|In Textile industry, {{production}} is mostly key concern for Industry owner. This always has attracted researchers and machines manufacturers {{to make new}} developments in process and machines. Air-jet {{is one of the}} leading and successful highest productive <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> However, it is now well established that due to add of charges of compressed air, manufacturing cost of air-jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> is higher as compared with rapier and projectile <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> This is why countries having energy issues do not prefer air-jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> comparing projectile <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> In this regard, several researchers and machine manufacturers have continuously been working to improve the efficiency of air-jet weft insertion. However, industry practice is as important as design made by researchers. The aim of this research is to investigate the air consumption of air-jet weaving on industrial scale practice. In this study, five <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> of same manufacturer and model were selected. It was observed that despite of manufacturing same quality of fabric, air consumption was varying almost in all <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> Conventionally, mill workers adopt hit and trial practice in weaving industry including airpressure setting which leads to variation of nozzle pressure. Main reason of disparity of air consumption in air-jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> may be variation of distance from compressor to <b>weaving</b> <b>machines,</b> number of joints, un-necessary valve opening and pipes leakages cause an increase of compressed air consumption...|$|R
40|$|Innovation of {{products}} {{is the key}} to survival. At this exhibition, we saw some trends of the innovation and development directions of <b>weaving</b> <b>machines.</b> Important innovation criteria include energy saving, flexibility, quality, product diversification as well as higher productivity. Flexibility and versatility are the key demands of fabric manufacturers, which drive the development of fabric formation technologies. Among <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> exhibited at the show, flexible rapier machines dominated the sector (36 companies). Air jets came second (32 companies), followed by water jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> (8 companies), projectile <b>weaving</b> <b>machines</b> and others. For projectile <b>weaving</b> <b>machines,</b> there were only three companies. For shuttle looms, there were five. Most of companies focussed on shuttleless <b>weaving</b> <b>machines,</b> especially air jet <b>weaving</b> <b>machine</b> and rapier <b>weaving</b> <b>machine.</b> These two technologies are likely to dominate over others in the near future. ITMA Asia + CITME 2008 was also a window to see the technological gap between Chinese textile machine manufacturing sector and international manufacturers, although the product quality and diversification of China's textile machinery have made remarkable progress in the past two decades. For the Chinese textile machinery industry, global science and technology develops with each passing day, it is a long-term goal to transform textile industry with modern technologies {{to keep pace with the}} international trend of informatics technologies and keep on enhancing the continuous innovation capability.

40|$|The {{continuously}} {{increasing demand}} {{of the customer}} requires equivalent response from the industry. This phenomenon of lean supply chain has also {{been seen in the}} paper and textile industries. TEXO AB produces customized weaving looms for the paper and textile industries. As every machine is redesigned to the customer requirements, TEXO needed to make the process efficient and effective. Once again the application of new computing technologies comes in handy. The practice of parametric design is applied to the TEXO’s FSX concept, {{which is one of the}} three <b>weaving</b> <b>loom</b> <b>machine</b> series supplied by TEXO. The frequent customization of FSX concept for each customer has created the need for faster redesign, better communication and quick order to suppliers. The automation is done on Autodesk Inventor using its iLogic and Shrinkwrap features. The parametric model is complete where all components to be customized are included. An excel sheet with design calculations, parameters and possible machine modules is developed together with the model. The feasibility of the automated design has been shown by the complete conformance of the model to the requirement. The excel sheet is very useful for improving the internal and external communications. After the completion of this project the redesign time is significantly reduced and the communication is simplified. It is also now possible to identify customization and module opportunities for future machines...|$|R
