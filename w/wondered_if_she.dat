500|$|When Stead {{was only}} halfway done, she hit a wall: she <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had focused the novel {{too much on}} her own {{personal}} life and problems. By her 40th birthday in January 2008, she had stopped writing. One week after her birthday celebration, Stead went to a writers' conference where the presenter advised attendees to stop thinking and just write. This speech worked {{as an antidote to}} Stead's writer's block; she started working on When You Reach Me again. After she had written two-thirds of the novel, Stead sent the draft to her editor Wendy Lamb at Random House. Perusing the script, Lamb found herself absorbed and wanted to help develop the book. Unlike Stead's debut novel First Light, which Lamb heavily edited, Lamb modified nothing on the first draft of When You Reach Me. Throughout the process, Stead helped Lamb understand the complicated concepts in the book and had drafts read by others to make sure [...] "revision hadn't created any holes or contradictions in the plot".|$|E
500|$|Quinn {{is portrayed}} by actress Dianna Agron. In casting Glee, series creator Ryan Murphy sought out actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway looking for unknown actors. Agron was the last primary actor to be cast, having won the role only days before the pilot began filming. Agron auditioned for Glee coming from a background in dancing and acting. She has been taking dance classes {{since the age of}} three, appeared in many music theatre productions and has appeared in television roles for Skidmarks, , and Heroes. Agron said in a 2009 interview pertaining to her casting session: [...] "I nearly bailed on my audition for the show. I was so nervous". With her wholesome good looks, Agron certainly looked the part, but the producers <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> appeared too innocent. Agron said in an interview: [...] "They told me to come back with straight hair and to dress sexier. Later that week, I started work." [...] Agron auditioned with Frank Sinatra's [...] "Fly Me to the Moon". The Glee producers said [...] "we really lucked out in finding Agron to play Quinn".|$|E

500|$|Changeling {{begins with}} an abduction, but largely avoids framing the story as a family drama to {{concentrate}} on {{a portrait of a}} woman whose desire for independence is seen as a threat to male-dominated society. The film depicts 1920s Los Angeles as a city in which the judgment of men takes precedence; women are labeled [...] "hysterical and unreliable" [...] if they dare to question it. Film critic Prairie Miller said that in its portrayal of female courage the film was [...] "about as feminist as Hollywood can get", and that because of this it had been the subject of sexist disdain. She compared this with the sexism shown to the women in Changeling and those who vied for high political office in 2008. Miller surmised that attitudes to independent, career-minded women had not changed significantly in the intervening years: Collins defies male-generated cultural expectations that women are not suited for professional careers and are punished for it. Rather than [...] "an expression of feminist awareness", David Denby argues, the film—like Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby—is [...] "a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring". The portrait of a vulnerable woman whose mental state is manipulated by the authorities was likened to the treatment of Ingrid Bergman's character in Gaslight(1944), who also <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> might be insane; Eastwood cited photographs that show Collins smiling with the child she knows is not hers. Like many other women of the period who were deemed disruptive, Collins is forced into the secret custody of a mental institution. The film shows that psychiatry became a tool in the gender politics of the era, only a few years after women's suffrage in the United States was guaranteed by the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. As women ceased to be second-class citizens and began to assert their independence, the male establishment used mental institutions in an effort to disempower them; in common with other unmanageable women, Collins is subjected to medical treatment designed to break her spirit and compel obedience, though some of the treatments, specifically the electroconvulsive therapy depicted in the film, did not exist ca. 1928-1930. The film quotes the testimony of the psychiatrist who treated Collins. Eastwood said the testimony evidenced how women were prejudged, and that the behavior of the police reflected how women were seen at the time. He quoted the words of the officer who sent Collins to the mental facility: Something is wrong with you. You're an independent woman. Clint Eastwood said, [...] "The period could not accept [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Jelinek {{said she}} felt very happy to receive the Nobel Prize, but felt [...] "despair for {{becoming}} a known, a person of the public". Known for her modesty and subtle self-irony, she – a reputed feminist writer – <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had been awarded the prize mainly for [...] "being a woman", and suggested that among authors writing in German, Peter Handke, whom she praises as a [...] "living classic", {{would have been a}} more worthy recipient.|$|E

2500|$|In 1948 Evans {{returned}} to the film studios after an absence of more than thirty years. At the instigation of Emlyn Williams she appeared in The Last Days of Dolwyn. The cast included Williams, Richard Burton, in his first film, and Allan Aynesworth, who had created the role of Algernon in The Importance of Being Earnest in 1895. This was Aynesworth's last film; Evans went on to make eighteen more {{over the next three}} decades. She played an elderly Welsh woman, and was well received by reviewers, although one <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was yet quite at home before the camera: [...] "there are indeed moments when she looks as disproportionate as a life-size Rembrandt in a one-room flatlet. But it is not, of course, the flatlet which stays in the memory". In the same year she played Countess Ranevskaya in Thorold Dickinson's film version of The Queen of Spades.|$|E
