25|$|Numerous {{causes for}} the {{evolution}} of human bipedalism involve freeing the hands for carrying and using tools, sexual dimorphism in provisoning, changes in climate and environment (from jungle to savanna) that favored a more elevated eye-position, and {{to reduce the amount of}} skin exposed to the tropical sun. It is possible that bipedalism provided a variety of benefits to the hominin species, and scientists have suggested multiple reasons for evolution of human bipedalism. There also is not only question of <b>why</b> <b>were</b> the earliest hominins partially bipedal but also why did hominins become more bipedal over time. For example, the postural feeding hypothesis explains for how earliest hominins became for the benefit of reaching out for food in trees while the savanna-based theory describes how the late hominins that started to settle on the ground became increasingly bipedal.|$|E

Marshall had noticed {{that none of the}} men's grievances had been aired in court. Directly after the court closed the case, Marshall sent a letter to Secretary Forrestal asking why only blacks were assigned the task of loading munitions; why had they not been trained for that task; <b>why</b> <b>were</b> they forced to compete for speed; <b>why</b> <b>were</b> they not given survivor's leaves; and why had they not been allowed to rise in rank. Forrestal replied weakly, saying that a predominance of black men were stationed at Port Chicago so of course they would be working there to load munitions. Forrestal pointed out that there was no discrimination because other naval weapons stations were manned by white crews loading munitions. The Navy Secretary said that the men had not been promoted because their time at Port Chicago had been a [...] "trial period", and that they were not given 30-day leaves because he thought it best for men to get quickly back to duty to prevent them from building up mental and emotional barriers.|$|E

500|$|There {{are further}} {{criteria}} influencing {{the choice of}} the candidate, including: which area of Europe the candidate comes from, favoured as Southern Europe in 2004; the candidate's political influence, credible yet not overpowering members; language, proficiency in French considered necessary by France; and degree of integration, their state being a member of both the eurozone and the Schengen Agreement. In 2004, this system produced a number of candidates and was thus criticised by some MEPs: following the drawn-out selection, the ALDE group leader Graham Watson described the procedure as a [...] "Justus Lipsius carpet market" [...] producing only the [...] "lowest common denominator"; while Green-EFA co-leader Daniel Cohn-Bendit asked Barroso after his first speech [...] "If you are the best candidate, <b>why</b> <b>were</b> you not the first?" ...|$|E
