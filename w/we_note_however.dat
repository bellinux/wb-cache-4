This is especially the case when their own home is placed at risk. My initial advice to you would be “don’t”.I record however, that you have decided that you do wish to proceed with the arrangement.The effect of registration of the sale will mean that you have lost your home if anything goes wrong.As advised, if for any reason Richmond Thornby Holdings Limited can’t get a release of the mortgage it will take on the property, effectively you will have lost your house and have to start again. You will have a right against the security the Company grants but this would be likely to be of no value.We note that at this stage you have satisfied yourselves the Company will {{be in a position to}} repurchase the property from you in 6 weeks.To summarise, our advice simply is it is better not to proceed with the transaction. <b>We</b> <b>note</b> <b>however</b> that you wish to assist your family, and you have done so in the full knowledge that the transaction is a financial risk to you and you may suffer financially in the event the Company being unable to complete the resale of the house for you.We note we have strongly recommended you consult an independent Solicitor in respect of the matter but you have declined to so.Yours faithfullyFROST & SUTCLIFFE'''' ...|$|E

This {{suggests that a}} smaller T-DNA size facilitates DNA transfer into host cells. Another important goal in order to strengthen selection efficiency was to maximize the concentration of hygromycin B that could be tolerated by transformed mycelia. Unlike transformation with the other AGL- 1 /binary vector combinations, AGL- 1 /pABr 3 allowed the amplification of transformed mycelial clumps capable of growing {{in the presence of}} hygromycin B concentrations as high as 300  μg/ml (Figure  3 c). This enabled the selective isolation and propagation of transformed mycelial regions. This is important, especially considering the lack of conidia-like elements in Tuber spp., the syncytial nature of Tuber hyphae, and thus the fact that transformants are mosaics, likely bearing more than one transformed locus. <b>We</b> <b>noted,</b> <b>however,</b> that transformed hyphae are not randomly distributed within mycelia, but appear to be concentrated at the periphery of mycelial clumps, the only region from which the fungus could be propagated.

Three slides, numbered 1, 2 and 3, were prepared from each patient. The first tract run by the drops when placing them in the slide showed a significantly lower percentage of aggregates than the remaining tracts (p less than 0. 01 post hoc Tukey test).
