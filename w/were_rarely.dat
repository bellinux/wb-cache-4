5|$|The {{governor}} {{has the authority}} to call on the General Assembly to convene a special session if legislators are unable to complete necessary work within time allotted by the regular sessions. Special sessions of the General Assembly <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> called in the state's early history, but have become more commonplace in modern times.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} to legalize birth control {{came to a}} gradual conclusion around the time Planned Parenthood was formed. In 1942, there were over 400 birth control organizations in America, contraception was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the anti-contraception Comstock laws (which still remained on the books) <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> enforced.|$|E
5|$|The series {{takes place}} mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new {{locations}} <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> introduced. The first four seasons {{of the show}} are set during a seemingly endless summer vacation, though from the fifth season onwards, the characters are shown attending junior {{high school in the}} fall and winter months.|$|E
50|$|The {{events of}} {{traditional}} narratives <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> set within realistic chronological frameworks. Time spans measured in years or decades <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> specified. Characters often are conceived and grow to maturity within miraculously short periods.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom {{contractual}} provisions for liquidated damages and other responses to breaches <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> enforced. Payments <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> deducted for poor performance against the contract. Government monitors {{have tended to}} be co-opted or ineffectual.|$|R
50|$|In most European countries, strikebreakers <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> used. Consequently, they <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> if ever {{mentioned}} in most European national labor laws. As mentioned above, it {{is left to}} the European Union member states to determine their own policies.|$|R
5|$|The {{size of the}} pre-Reform {{electorate}} {{is difficult}} to estimate. Voter registration was lacking, and many boroughs <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> contested in elections. It is estimated that immediately before the 1832 Reform Act, 400,000 English subjects were entitled to vote, and that after passage, the number rose to 650,000, an increase of more than 60%.|$|E
5|$|After much contemplation, {{she chose}} not to abdicate. Joseph himself often {{threatened}} to resign as co-regent and emperor, but he, too, was induced not to do so. Her threats of abdication <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 {{was a sign that}} God wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's interest that she remained sovereign, for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch.|$|E
5|$|As {{he waited}} for the Emperor's {{confirmation}} of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son of the former conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor. Subsequently, the two <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> in agreement, but kept their divisions private.|$|E
25|$|Because {{infection}} <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> symptomatic, treatment <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> required. There {{have been}} no published trials so treatment remains empirical. Agents {{that have been used}} include albendazole, metronidazole and cotrimoxazole for myositis. Corticosteroids have also been used for symptomatic relief.|$|R
50|$|FGM <b>was</b> <b>rarely</b> practiced.|$|R

5|$|Blue {{whales are}} not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> pursued by early whalers, who instead {{targeted}} sperm and right whales. In 1864, the Norwegian Svend Foyn equipped a steamboat with harpoons specifically designed for catching large whales. The harpoon gun was initially cumbersome and had a low success rate, but Foyn perfected it, and soon several whaling stations were established on the coast of Finnmark in northern Norway. Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.|$|E
5|$|By 1872, the {{railroad}} had extended from Portland to Roseburg. Along the way, it created growth in Willamette Valley {{towns such as}} Canby, Aurora, and Harrisburg, which emerged as freight and passenger stations, and provided a commercial lifeline to {{the part of the}} river valley above Harrisburg where steamships <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> able to travel. As {{the railroad}} made its way into the Umpqua Valley, new townsites such as Drain, Oakland, and Yoncalla were laid out.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in the NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> competitive on the field. He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player strikes, and the modern league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
50|$|Such reactions, {{which are}} most useful for alkyl iodides and bromides, <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> {{employed}} because {{the degree of}} alkylation is difficult to control. Selectivity can be improved via the Delépine reaction, although this <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> employed on an industrial scale.|$|R

5|$|Historical supernovae {{are known}} simply {{by the year}} they occurred: SN185, SN1006, SN1054, SN1572 (called Tycho's Nova) and SN1604 (Kepler's Star). Since 1885 the {{additional}} letter notation has been used, {{even if there was}} only one supernova discovered that year (e.g. SN 1885A, SN 1907A, etc.) — this last happened with SN 1947A. SN, for SuperNova, is a standard prefix. Until 1987, two-letter designations <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> needed; since 1988, however, they have been needed every year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th and early 19th century {{many forms of}} shoe polish became available, yet <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> {{referred}} to as shoe polish or boot polish. Instead, they were often called blacking (especially when mixed with lampblack), or simply continued {{to be referred to}} as dubbin. Tallow, an animal by-product, was used to manufacture a simple form of shoe polish at this time. Chicago, Illinois, where 82% of the processed meat consumed in the United States was processed in the stock yards, became a major shoe polish producing area.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{methods were}} {{predominantly}} used by physicists and astrophysicists. Spectroscopic techniques <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> taught in chemistry classes and were unfamiliar to most practicing chemists. Beginning around 1904, Frank Twyman of the London instrument making firm Adam Hilger, Ltd. tried to develop spectroscopic instruments for chemists, but his customer base was consistently {{made up of}} physicists rather than chemists.|$|E
40|$|Parasitic {{infection}} of the appendix <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> seen, but {{should be considered in}} patients with symptoms of chronic appendicitis. It <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> associated with histological inflammation of the appendix, therefore radiographic imaging, performed during initial workup, remains unremarkable most of the time...|$|R
50|$|It {{can be seen}} radiographically (i.e., with x-rays), {{although}} it <b>is</b> seen <b>rarely</b> in developed countries, given that osteomyelitis <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> left untreated there.|$|R
30|$|Cyproheptadine {{poisoning}} has <b>been</b> <b>rarely</b> reported.|$|R
5|$|The first {{armoured}} cruisers {{had been}} built in the 1870s, as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical cruiser roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection. However, the results <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> satisfactory, as the weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant that the ship became almost as slow as a battleship. As a result, navies preferred to build protected cruisers with an armoured deck protecting their engines, or simply no armour at all.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{origin of}} the Aylesbury duck is unclear. Before the 18thcentury, duck breeds <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> {{recorded}} in England, and the common duck, bred for farming, was a domesticated form of the wild mallard. The common duck varied in colour, and as in the wild, white ducks would occasionally occur. White ducks were particularly prized, as their feathers were popular as a filler for quilts.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{chosen for}} nest holes have soft {{heartwood}} and tough sapwood, the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree's core. It {{is not certain}} how suitable trees are selected, {{although it may be}} by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit sound at different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included grey alder, Japanese white birch, Japanese hop-hornbeam, Japanese tree lilac, willows, Japanese larch and Sargent's cherry. The Mongolian oak and prickly castor-oil tree <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> if ever used.|$|E
50|$|Note. These forms <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> used.|$|R

50|$|The kuisi bunsi {{has five}} tone holes, but {{only four of}} them are used when performing: the lower tone hole <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> used, but when used, the upper tone hole is closed with wax. The lower tone hole of the kuisi sigi <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> used.|$|R
5|$|A {{wide range}} of laws were invoked {{in the process of}} the suppression, from general treason to charges of book burning or {{demolishing}} houses, a process complicated by the relatively narrow definition of treason at the time. The use of informants and denunciations became common, causing fear to spread across the country; by November at least 1,500 people had been executed or killed in battle. Many of those who had lost property in the revolt attempted to seek legal compensation, and John of Gaunt made particular efforts to track down those responsible for destroying his Savoy Palace. Most had only limited success, as the defendants <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> willing to attend court. The last of these cases was resolved in 1387.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of French prisoners who escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, it has been {{estimated}} at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans trying to escape <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|As Austen's {{works were}} {{published}} anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but <b>were</b> <b>rarely</b> reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often {{focused on the}} moral lessons of the novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately {{set the tone for}} almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.|$|E
50|$|Unlike Scrub Island, {{a larger}} {{island off the}} Eastern Tip and which has two {{excellent}} beaches, Anguillita <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> even seen, since the western tip is virtually inaccessible by foot. As such it <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> visited by tourists, though it is accessible by sea kayak.|$|R
50|$|Various methods {{exist to}} promote {{disaster}} preparedness, but they <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> well documented and their efficacy <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> tested. Hands on training, drills and face-to-face interaction have proven more successful at changing behaviour. Digital methods {{have also been}} used, including for examples educational videogames.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{customer}} demand <b>is</b> <b>rarely</b> perfectly stable, businesses must {{forecast demand}} to properly position inventory and other resources. Forecasts {{are based on}} statistics, and they <b>are</b> <b>rarely</b> perfectly accurate. Because forecast errors are given, companies often carry an inventory buffer called [...] "safety stock".|$|R
