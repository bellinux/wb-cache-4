40|$|Wood {{maturation}} of {{red wine}} produces complex interactions between oak extracted compounds and pre-existing components <b>in</b> <b>wine.</b> <b>Wood</b> contributes with some aroma volatiles; but the whole volatile fraction, including the volatiles extracted from grape or produced during fermentation, could be involved in interactions with the non-volatile fraction. Samples {{of red wine}} with increasing time of <b>wood</b> contact, matured <b>in</b> 25 l casks of new American oak, were analysed on their volatile composition both in solution and headspace, and phenolic components. There was an increase of acetic acid and acetate esters {{as the time of}} wood contact increased. On the other hand, ethyl esters decreased as the time <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> increased. Some volatiles showed different behaviour when comparing their relationship between headspace and solution from two different casks, even though they were treated as replicates. This different evolution among casks was also consistent with different evolution of phenolic compounds, suggesting that there was an interaction among the volatile fraction and phenolic components...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenolic}} {{composition of}} heartwood extracts from Fraxinus excelsior L. and F. americana L., {{both before and}} after toasting in cooperage, was studied using LC-DAD/ESI-MS/MS. Low-molecular weight (LMW) phenolic compounds, secoiridoids, phenylethanoid glycosides, dilignols and oligolignols compounds were detected, and 48 were identified, or tentatively characterized, {{on the basis of their}} retention time, UV/Vis and MS spectra, and MS fragmentation patterns. Some LMW phenolic compounds like protocatechuic acid and aldehyde, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were unlike to those for oak wood, while ellagic and gallic acid were not found. The toasting of <b>wood</b> resulted <b>in</b> a progressive increase in lignin degradation products with regard to toasting intensity. The levels of some of these compounds <b>in</b> medium-toasted ash <b>woods</b> were much higher than those normally detected in toasted oak, highlighting vanillin levels, thus a more pronounced vanilla character can be expected when using toasted ash <b>wood</b> <b>in</b> the aging <b>wines.</b> Moreover, <b>in</b> seasoned <b>wood,</b> we found a great variety of phenolic compounds which had not been found <b>in</b> oak <b>wood,</b> especially oleuropein, ligstroside and olivil, along with verbascoside and isoverbascoside in F. excelsior, and oleoside in F. americana. Toasting mainly provoked their degradation, thus <b>in</b> medium-toasted <b>wood,</b> only four of them were detected. This resulted in a minor differentiation between toasted ash and oak woods. The absence of tannins <b>in</b> ash <b>wood,</b> which are very important <b>in</b> oak <b>wood,</b> is another peculiar characteristic that should be taken into account when considering its use in cooperage.

40|$|Antimicrobial plant {{extracts}} rich in polyphenols {{have recently}} been proposed as a total or partial alternative to sulfites during winemaking. This paper reports a first winery-scale trial of the addition of antimicrobial plant extracts during <b>wine</b> ageing <b>in</b> <b>wood.</b> Before being distributed in oak barrels, a Verdejo wine was treated with either a SO 2 regular dose (160 mg/L) or with a SO 2 half-dose (80 mg/L), together with two phenolic-rich extracts from eucalyptus leaves and almond skins (100 mg/L). Some of the wine was also stored in a stainless steel tank for comparison. After 6 months of ageing, the wine treated with the phenolic extracts remained microbiologically stable and showed correct enological parameters. Also, the volatile and phenolic composition of the wine was specifically determined to ascertain whether the addition of these phenolic extracts would affect the organoleptic properties of the wine. Although the addition of both eucalyptus and almond extracts led to statistically significant changes (p< 0. 05) in the concentration of several esters, C 13 norisoprenoids, volatile phenols and furanic compounds <b>in</b> the <b>wine,</b> only the concentration {{of some of these}} compounds was higher than their odor threshold. With regard to phenolics, addition of both extracts did not significantly modify their content, except for a lower content of hydroxycinnamic acids and esters and flavan- 3 -ols, which predicts minor changes <b>in</b> <b>wine</b> astringency. As seen from a PCA analysis of all volatile and phenolic data, wines were mainly differentiated by the ageing process itself, by the addition of extracts, and even by the barrel used. Finally, a triangle test showed no significant differences in the global sensory appreciation between wines treated and not treated with the antimicrobial phenolic extracts. These results demonstrated the potential applicability of phenolic extracts as a partial alternative to sulfur dioxide during the ageing of white <b>wines</b> <b>in</b> oak barrels. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Madeira wine is a {{fortified}} <b>wine</b> with impact <b>in</b> the Madeira Island’s economy. Similarly {{to other}} wines, its acidity should be well controlled {{in order to}} ensure Madeira wine quality, mostly the volatile acidity. Due to Madeira wine complex flavour, it is crucial to get a better knowledge about the volatile acidity impact in its features, namely determine the perception limit of acetic acid and ethyl acetate, as both are the main contributors for volatile acidity. Firstly, the olfactory perception threshold of volatile acidity was assessed by a trained and an untrained panel, using 5 and 10 years-old Sercial and Malvasia wines. Moreover, the current work also presents the evolution of organic acids, acetic acid and ethyl acetate during 540 days of ageing of Madeira wines (Malvasia, Bual, Verdelho and Sercial), comparing the same wines aged by both traditional ageing processes: canteiro and estufagem. Other <b>wine</b> samples, aged <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> casks (canteiro) for at least 5 years, were also evaluated. HS-SPME followed by GC-MS analysis was used to determine ethyl acetate concentration and IEC-HPLC-DAD was used for the organic acids determination, including acetic acid. The results indicated that acetic acid and ethyl acetate olfactory perception threshold depends essentially on wine’s age. Concerning acetic acid, the untrained panel was in average 5. 45 g/L (5 years-old) and 6. 22 g/L (10 years-old). Training the expert panel to recognize acetic acid odour, the values decreased for 1. 44 g/L (5 years-old) and 1. 87 g/L (10 years-old), but still remained higher than the established volatile acidity legal limits. Ethyl acetate threshold was similar for both panels (in average 327. 97 mg/L). Both compounds tend to increase exponentially with age, being more evident <b>in</b> sweet <b>wines.</b> Organic acids <b>in</b> young Madeira <b>wines</b> depend mostly on the nature of grape varieties, but this difference is minimized with wine ageing...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} for the {{analysis}} of major wine volatiles and semivolatiles by stir bar sorptive extraction in combination with thermal desorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SBSE-TD-GC-MS) was developed. Significant experimental parameters such as extraction time, temperature, salt addition, pH, and thermal desorption parameters were optimized to provide a sensitive and robust analytical method. The method provided good repeatability (%RSD < 10 %) for 38 major wine volatile compounds, including alcohols, acids, esters, phenols, aldehydes, ketones, and lactones. Quantitative data for 62 South African red and white wines were used to study the suitability of major volatile data for the differentiation of wine samples according to grape variety or cultivar. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) showed that most of the variation in volatile composition between wine samples could be ascribed to differences <b>in</b> <b>wine</b> age, <b>wood</b> contact, and fermentation practices. Despite the contribution of these factors, discriminant analysis (DA) was successfully applied to the classification of red and white wine samples according to cultivar. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} sensory {{characteristics}} of wines experimentally produced by “Malvasia Istriana” grapevine in the Tuscany coast (Grosseto) along a ten years period. The training system was double Guyot with plant production of approximately 2 kg. Most notably were produced two types of wine, with or without withering in the plant, in the latter case the 70 % of the branches were cut off two or three weeks before harvesting. Because of seasonal conditions are not always favorable, in some years the latter type has not been overripe grapes were harvested between 30 September and 2 October. Vinification was carried out under the same conditions using temperature control and using the same yeast strain. In one case, namely for wine of 1995, was performed a refinement in oak barrels by topping up of must obtained from grapes of overripe 1997 vintages, 1999 and 2000, racking is then occurred in 2002. Altogether we had 6 vintages and 9 wines which were subjected to the main physical-chemical analysis for a general characterization. Also were conducted by a trained sensory analysis sessions examining the wines at the same time, in order to evaluate the evolution of sensory descriptors and their hold over time. For this purpose we used a descriptive card specially crafted structured not parametric. The evaluations expressed in sensory analysis have been subjected to factorial analysis prior to standardization. Generally speaking most of the wines is characterized by significant softness that is partly attributable to the low fixed acidity of the grapes. There is also a good grip in time for the balance of the wine and the permanence of fruity notes, acacia honey and dried fruits, wines to age. The floral notes, on the other hand, there are only about young wines and those produced from grapes not overriped. Of particular importance have appeared the sensorial characteristics of the <b>wine</b> aged <b>in</b> <b>wood</b> barrels, with a technique similar to the "Solera", for the intensity and olfactory persistence. In the light of the results obtained, discussed in relation to the characteristics of the vintage and physical-chemical analysis, it can be concluded that the “Malvasia Istriana” grape lends itself to the production of wines from overripe grapes...|$|R
