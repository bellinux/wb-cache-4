Besides, it depends largely on the facts you supply them whether they consider it worth while to have one." ...|$|E

6000|$|As {{prosperity}} flowed in upon him, David Boone {{became more}} insane--for his condition of mind was little, if at all, short of temporary insanity--and his proceedings became more eccentric than ever. Among other things, he became suddenly smitten {{with a desire}} to advertise, and immediately in the columns of the tapers appeared advertisements to the effect that [...] "The Celebrated Toy Emporium" [...] was to be found in Poorthing Lane. Finding that this increased his business considerably, he hit upon a plan of advertising which has been practised rather extensively of late years in London. He sent out an army of boys with pots of <b>whitewash</b> and <b>brushes,</b> with directions to print in rough but large legible letters the words, [...] "Who's Boone?" [...] on all the blank walls of the metropolis, and in the papers he answered the question by having printed under the same title, [...] "Why, the manager of the Toy Emporium, to be sure, in Poorthing Lane." [...] He also advertised specially that he had in stock, [...] "an assortment of 500 golden-haired dolls from Germany, full-dressed, half-dressed, and naked." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nay, in {{the boat}} at the minute of which I have been speaking, silent and neglected, sat a fellow-passenger, who was a greater adept at {{removing}} nuisances than the whole Board of Health put together; and who had done his work, too, with a cheapness unparalleled; for all his good deeds had not as yet cost the State one penny. True, he lived by his business; so do other inspectors of nuisances: but Nature, instead of paying Maia Squinado, Esquire, some five hundred pounds sterling per annum for his labour, had contrived, with a sublime simplicity of economy which Mr. Hume might have envied and admired afar off, to make him do his work gratis, by giving him the nuisances as his perquisites, and teaching him how to eat them. Certainly (without going {{the length of the}} Caribs, who upheld cannibalism because, they said, it made war cheap, and precluded entirely the need of a commissariat), this cardinal virtue of cheapness ought to make Squinado an interesting object {{in the eyes of the}} present generation; especially as he was at that moment a true sanitary martyr, having, like many of his human fellow-workers, got into a fearful scrape by meddling with those existing interests, and [...] "vested rights which are but vested wrongs," [...] which have proved fatal already to more than one Board of Health. For last night, as he was sitting quietly under a stone in four fathoms water, he became aware (whether by sight, smell, or that mysterious sixth sense, to us unknown, which seems to reside in his delicate feelers) of a palpable nuisance somewhere in the neighbourhood; and, like a trusty servant of the public, turned out of his bed instantly and went in search; till he discovered, hanging among what he judged to be the stems of ore-weed (Laminaria), three or four large pieces of stale thornback, of most evil savour, and highly prejudicial to the purity of the sea, and the health of the neighbouring herrings. Happy Squinado! He needed not to discover the limits of his authority, to consult any lengthy Nuisances' Removal Act, with its clauses, and counter- clauses, and explanations of interpretations, and interpretations of explanations. Nature, who can afford to be arbitrary, because she is perfect, and to give her servants irresponsible powers, because she has trained them to their work, had bestowed on him and on his forefathers, as general health inspectors, those very summary powers of entrance and removal in the watery realms for which common sense, public opinion, and private philanthropy are still entreating vainly in the terrestrial realms; so finding a hole, in he went, and began to remove the nuisance, without [...] "waiting twenty-four hours," [...] "laying an information," [...] "serving a notice," [...] or any other vain delay. The evil was there, - and there it should not stay; so having neither cart nor barrow, he just began putting it into his stomach, and in the meanwhile set his assistants to work likewise. For suppose not, gentle reader, that Squinado went alone; in his train were more than a hundred thousand as good as he, each in his office, and as cheaply paid; who needed no cumbrous baggage train of force-pumps, hose, chloride of lime packets, <b>whitewash,</b> pails or <b>brushes,</b> but were every man his own instrument; and, to save expense of transit, just grew on Squinado's back. Do you doubt the assertion? Then lift him up hither, and putting him gently into that shallow jar of salt water, look at him through the hand-magnifier, and see how Nature is maxima in minimis.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he's a {{dangerous}} rival, in some ways," [...] said Ricker. [...] "When {{it comes to}} slush and a <b>whitewash</b> <b>brush,</b> I don't think you're a match for him. But perhaps you don't intend to choose the same weapons." [...] Ricker pulled down the green-lined pasteboard peak that he wore over his forehead by gaslight, and hitched his chair round to his desk again, and Maxwell {{knew that he was}} authorized to do the work.|$|E
40|$|The scene {{opens in}} an artist's studio, the artist {{asleep in his}} chair. A large old {{fashioned}} clock opens and a young lady comes out and awaking the artist, requests him to paint her picture. While the artist is executing the work a clown comes down from the clock, takes in the situation and begins {{to make love to}} the lady. The artist detects him and compels him to desist his love making. He continues to paint. The clown becomes interested and asks the artist to allow him to paint the picture, and begins smearing a <b>whitewash</b> <b>brush</b> over the canvas, when lo, a most perfect image of the young lady appears. The image then steps down from the frame, joins the young lady in the studio, and the figures, each a perfect counterpart of the other begin to dance to the great astonishment of the artist. The clown then by waving his hand causes the figures of the two girls to merge into one. The artist then assumes his seat and awakens from his dream with a great shock. 125 ft.
