5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commissioned}} on 22 November {{and became the}} flagship of Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall, commander of the naval defenses of Georgia. Under pressure from Mallory to engage the blockading ships, Tattnall attempted to engage them before any ironclads arrived on 5 January 1863, but army engineers could not clear the obstacles blocking the channel in a timely manner, despite early coordination being made by Tattnall to do so. It took another month to actually clear the obstacles and two monitors arrived {{before the end of}} January. Nonetheless Tattnall attempted to pass through the obstructions during high tide on 3 February, but high winds prevented the water from rising enough to allow the ship to do so. After Atlanta successfully passed through them on 19 March, Tattnall planned to attack the Union base at Port Royal, South Carolina while the monitors were attacking Charleston. Deserters revealed Tatnall's plan while he <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of Wassaw Sound and he was forced to retreat when three monitors augmented the defenses at Port Royal. Dissatisfied with Tattnall's perceived lack of aggressiveness, Mallory replaced Tattnall as commander of the Savannah squadron later that month with Commander Richard L. Page. Page, in his turn was relieved in May by Commander William A. Webb; Atlanta remained the squadron flagship throughout this time.|$|E

500|$|Lost Luggage was {{developed}} by Games by Apollo, a video game studio based in Richardson, Texas, which targeted the game at people who traveled regularly, believing {{that they would like}} its content. At the time of Lost Luggages development, the company employed five people. The game was conceived by programmer Ed Salvo. He had been at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport after a meeting with Apollo founder Pat Roper and <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> carousel for his luggage to arrive. Later, Salvo discussed the concept of the game with Roper, and they {{came up with the idea}} to have the carousel [...] "spewing unmentionables." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon seemed {{absolutely}} normal {{when she}} returned home the next day, and steadfastly maintained his love for her and their son, saying: [...] "It's you I love Cyn ... I love you {{now more than ever}} before". [...] Lennon went to New York with McCartney shortly after, but as Cynthia was specifically not invited, a trip to Pesaro, in Italy, was arranged with her mother. After an evening with Italian hotelier Roberto Bassanini, Mardas <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hotel to break the news that Lennon was planning to sue for divorce on grounds of adultery, seek sole custody of Julian, and [...] "send her back to Hoylake". She said in 2005: [...] "The mere fact that 'Magic Alex' [...] arrived in Italy {{in the middle of the}} night without any prior knowledge of where I was staying made me extremely suspicious. I was being coerced into making it easy" ... "to accuse me of doing something that would make them not look so bad." [...] As Lennon had initiated divorce proceedings, it prompted her to exclaim: [...] "Suing me for divorce? On what grounds is he suing me?" [...] When the news of Ono's pregnancy broke, Cynthia started her own divorce proceedings against Lennon on 22 August 1968. The financial settlement was hampered by Lennon's refusing to offer any more than £75,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., telling her on the phone that the payment was akin to winning the football pools and that she was not worth any more. The settlement was then raised to £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )., £2,400 annually (equivalent to £ in [...] )., and custody of Julian. Another £100,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). was put into a trust fund which Julian would inherit when he was 21. Until that time, his mother would receive the interest payments. Their decree nisi was granted on 8 November 1968. The trust fund had one codicil, which provided for any further children by Lennon, so when Sean Lennon was born in 1975, Julian's inheritance was cut to £50,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] )..|$|E

2500|$|At 10:25a.m., a time-bomb {{contained}} in an unattended suitcase detonated inside an air-conditioned waiting {{room at the}} Bologna station, which, the season being Summer (it was August), and with air conditioning being uncommon in Italy at the time, was crammed full of people. The explosion destroyed most of the main building and hit the Ancona–Chiasso train that <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first platform. [...] The blast was heard for miles. [...] The roof [...] of the waiting room collapsed onto the passengers, which greatly increased the total number killed in the terrorist attack.|$|E
2500|$|On February 26, 1775, {{members of}} the Marblehead militia confronted 240 British troops {{under the command of}} Colonel Alexander Leslie after a {{standoff}} at the North Bridge in Salem, Massachusetts. [...] Leslie landed his troops in Marblehead, under orders of General Thomas Gage to proceed to Salem and confiscate artillery that was hidden there. [...] Word quickly spread through Marblehead and Salem, and the Salem militia <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bridge when Leslie arrived. [...] After a tense standoff, Leslie ended up retreating back to Marblehead where he was met by the Marblehead militia, which had fallen in to reinforce the troops in Salem. [...] The Marbleheaders followed Leslie's troops back to their boats, mocking them as they marched.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, then Police Chief David McCoy {{ordered the}} {{responding}} officers {{to arrest the}} Mayor, stating that he believed Thomas was [...] "a danger to himself and others". [...] Interestingly, Thomas was transported to the Henderson County Jail instead of the Gun Barrel City jail. [...] Chief David McCoy later told a local newspaper that he made that decision because a nurse was on duty at the County Jail and he wanted Thomas to be monitored by a nurse. [...] Thomas was granted a phone call {{when he arrived at}} the Henderson County Jail. [...] It was approximately 2:00AM and Thomas called recently elected Justice of the Peace Dale Blaylock at home. [...] The phone call woke Judge Blaylock from his sleep, but Thomas nonetheless asked him to come to the jail right away and arraign him, presumably so Thomas could be released quickly. [...] It was reported in a local newspaper that Judge Blaylock immediately traveled at least thirty miles to the Henderson County Jail in Athens, Texas and arrived at approximately 3:00AM. [...] He arraigned Thomas first and set his bail at $500.00, the maximum allowed by law for the offense. [...] It was also reported that while Judge Blaylock was at the jail, he arraigned and set bond for all other inmates waiting to see a Judge the following day. [...] It was reported in the local newspaper that Thomas' father, Larry Ray Thomas, <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> jail and posted the $500.00 cash bond only a few minutes after Judge Blaylock set his bail, and Thomas was immediately released.|$|E
