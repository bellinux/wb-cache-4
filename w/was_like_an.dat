5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And we got to do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> art project.|$|E
25|$|Graeme Swann {{was picked}} ahead of Monty Panesar as England {{decided not to}} field with a second spinner. The {{conditions}} on the day were windy with little swing in the wicket. The pitch was recently re-laid resulting in little pace and variable bounce which was to trouble both teams in the match. Paul Collingwood commented that the wicket <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> English wicket.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 and {{for some}} years {{afterwards}} in Britain, factory-made aqualungs were very expensive, and many aqualungs of this type were made by sport divers in diving clubs' workshops, using miscellaneous industrial and war-surplus parts. One necessary raw material was a Calor Gas bottled butane gas regulator, whose 1950s version <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> aqualung regulator's second stage but passed gas {{all the time because}} its diaphragm was spring-loaded; conversion included changing the spring and making several big holes in the wet-side casing. The cylinder was often an ex-RAF pilot's oxygen cylinder; some of these cylinders were called tadpoles from their shape.|$|E

25|$|Since its inception, Chachachá {{music had}} a close {{relationship}} with the dancer's steps. The well-known name Chachachá came into being {{with the help of the}} dancers at the Silver Star Club in Havana. When the dance was coupled to the rhythm of the music, it became evident that the dancer's feet were making a peculiar sound as they grazed the floor on three successive beats. It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> onomatopoeia that sounded as: Chachachá. From this peculiar sound, a music genre was born which motivated people from around the world to dance at its catchy rhythm.|$|E
25|$|For defense, Toyota's {{starting}} unit {{had a better}} defensive stance against their counterparts in Crispa. With Jaworski, Fernandez and King anchoring the defense, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> impregnable Fort Knox to penetrate the individual defenses lay down by the team. It was a tribute therefore to Crispa's individuals' capabilities to go beyond this defense {{set up by the}} three. Crispa, however had the edge at the bench since they had noted defensive aces like Padim Israel, Joy Dionisio, Yoyoy Villamin, Bay Cristobal (especially in 1983 under Coach Tommy Manotoc) while Toyota had to contend with Herrera, Javier, Coloso and Bulaong to provide the defensive spunk.|$|E
25|$|Ali, Muhammad's {{cousin and}} a leader in battle, was often {{entrusted}} with command and was left {{in charge of the}} community in Medina when Muhammad led the Battle of Tabouk. Ali was also the husband of Muhammad's daughter, Fatimah, and the father of his grandchildren Hasan and Husayn. Ali's father was Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib, Muhammad's uncle, foster father and protector. As a member of Abu Talib's family, Muhammad <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> older brother and guardian to Ali (who, as a youth, {{was among the first to}} accept Islam). A charismatic defender of the faith, Ali was assumed by some to claim a leadership position after Muhammad's death. In the end, however, Abu Bakr assumed control of the Muslim community.|$|E

25|$|After partition, Risalpur <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> {{abandoned}} airfield. The airbase {{was formally}} established after {{the creation of}} Pakistan on 15 August 1947 with 20 officers, 21 trainees, 23 senior non commissioned officers (SNCOs) and 257 airmen. The base comprised {{only a handful of}} men and some equipment. About a month later, the Flying Training School was established at Risalpur, that carried out Initial, elementary and advanced flying training. In September 1947, six Harvard aircraft from Flying Training School of Ambala, that were transferred to Pakistan after partition, reached Risalpur. Wing Commander Asghar Khan, later to become the first Air Chief of the PAF, took over as the first Officer Commanding of the School, with Harvard and Tiger Moth aircraft in the inventory. Flt Lt M Khyber Khan, who later rose to the rank of Air Vice Marshal, and his student, Flight Cadet Akhtar, flew the first training sortie on 22 September 1947.|$|E

[...] One player discovered Strahd's backstory and was so affected by it that {{when it came time to}} kill the vampire at the end of {{the adventure}}, despite having a sword capable of dispatching Strahd, he refused, and his companions were forced to complete the task. Afterwards, Hickman asked him why.

500|$|In his {{publication}} of AD120 called The Spiritual Constitution of the Universe (靈憲, Ling Xian, lit.

The Boston Herald said [...] "it is important for teens to learn about sexually transmitted diseases and the cost of unprotected sex ... and should help parents begin conversations with their own children". PopMatters's Jodie Janella Horn described Degrassi: The Next Generation as [...] "the most unnervingly accurate series ever of the high school genre". Another comparison was made between Degrassi: The Next Generation and The O.C., saying [...] "The O.C. will never remind me of anything in my life", while the events in the two-part episode [...] "Voices Carry" [...] with [...] "hotel room trashing, projectile launching, fist fighting at weddings bi-polar loon Craig , <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> actual scene from my actual teenage life and just like me, Ashley thinks they're going to pull through it together". AfterElton.com, a website that focuses on the portrayal of gay and bisexual men in the media praised the series for [...] "not only focusing on gay teens, but it showcases gay sex, and relationships.
