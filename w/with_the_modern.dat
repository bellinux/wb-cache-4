The fleet was commanded by Captain Henry Mowat. The attack began with a naval bombardment which included incendiary shot, followed by a landing party meant to complete the town's destruction.

Efforts {{have been made to}} identify the locality, with some linking it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> village of Kapsia west of Mantinea in Arcadia, but this is too far from the reported area of the battle based on the sources, and furthermore olive trees do not grow in the region.|$|E

5|$|The rugby {{competition}} {{took place}} in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium. The original plan was to stage the rugby matches at the São Januário Stadium. However this was scrapped because the club in charge of the venue missed the deadline to present its project.

It was later announced that the rugby competition will take place in a temporary arena at Deodoro Stadium, shared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> pentathlon. In April 2016 concerns were raised by the World Rugby head of competitions and performance, Mark Egan, about progress of construction at the temporary 15,000-seater stadium.|$|E
5|$|Though {{evolution}} is not progressive, it does sometimes proceed in a linear way, reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages, but such examples are entirely consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> neo-Darwinian theory of evolution. These examples have sometimes {{been referred to}} as orthoselection but are not strictly orthogenetic, and simply appear as linear and constant changes because of environmental and molecular constraints on the direction of change. The term orthoselection was first used by Ludwig Hermann Plate, and was incorporated into the modern synthesis by Julian Huxley and Bernard Rensch.|$|E

5|$|When Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, his piece The Lottery became an immediate success and lasted for decades after. Combined <b>with</b> <b>The</b> <b>Modern</b> Husband, Fielding could have received up to 1,000 pounds from the plays' first run. This placed Fielding at the position of being the main contributor of plays to the Royal Theatre. Currently, Fielding is primarily viewed as a novelist, but his plays suggest that he wished to be a playwright and that his career would be in theatre. Although Fielding wrote twenty-six plays, {{only a handful of}} them were ever published in critical editions before 1990.|$|E
5|$|A 2007 {{study of}} Canis {{dentition}} {{shows that in}} comparison <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> gray wolf and the Pleistocene LaBrea wolf, the Beringian wolf possessed large carnassial teeth and a short, broad palate relative {{to the size of}} its skull. The row length of the Beringian wolf's premolars was longer, the P4 premolar (the upper carnassial) longer and wider, and the M1, M2, and m1 (the lower carnassial) molars longer than those found in the other two types of wolves. The Beringian wolf's short, broad rostrum increased the force of a bite made with the canine teeth while strengthening the skull against the stresses caused by struggling prey. Today, the relatively deep jaws {{similar to those of the}} Beringian wolf can be found in the bone-cracking spotted hyena and in those canids that are adapted for taking large prey. Beringian wolves possessed a craniodental morphology that was more specialized than modern gray wolves and Rancho LaBrea wolves for capturing, dismembering, and consuming the bones of very large megaherbivores, having evolved this way due to the presence of megafauna. Their stronger jaws and teeth indicate a hypercarnivorous lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of conquest, polities in the {{northern}} Yucatán peninsula included Mani, Cehpech and Chakan; further east along the north coast were Ah Kin Chel, Cupul, and Chikinchel. Ecab, Uaymil, Chetumal all bordered on the Caribbean Sea. Cochuah {{was also in the}} eastern half of the peninsula. Tases, Hocaba and Sotuta were all landlocked provinces. Chanputun (modern Champotón) was on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, as was Acalan. In the southern portion of the peninsula, a number of polities occupied the Petén Basin. The Kejache occupied a territory between the Petén lakes and what is now Campeche. The Cholan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning eastern Chiapas and southwestern Petén. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation amongst the Spanish.|$|E
