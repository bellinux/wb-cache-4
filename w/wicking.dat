50|$|<b>Wick</b> {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in 1249 and is called 'the Weke' in 1542. In 1736-7 the settlement consisted of Upper <b>Wick</b> and <b>Wick.</b> In 1759 the Upper <b>Wick</b> no longer existed. In 1773 <b>Wick</b> was renamed Devizes <b>Wick,</b> the prefix being doubtless added to {{distinguish it from}} Potterne <b>Wick</b> and <b>Wick</b> in Rowde. In 1795-6 the hamlet contained between 30 and 33 assessable houses. <b>Wick</b> was later known for it dairy industry, non of which exists today.|$|R

25|$|Retailer Marks & Spencer reintroduced the {{material}} {{used as an}} alternative to nylon in swimsuits in the 1960s. While Lycra is used in most swimsuits designs because of its high elasticity, lower expense, and water <b>wicking</b> nature, its major drawback is that it breaks down in chlorine, commonly found in swimming pools. When worn daily, a swimsuit made of Lycra will break down in about 2–3 months. Speedo introduced Fastskin in 2007 as the lightest and fastest material for competitive swimwear. Unlike lycra, it does not break down in chlorine.|$|E
25|$|When on duty {{officers}} wear a black <b>wicking</b> T-shirt {{with the}} Brunswick star and 'Wiltshire Police' {{on the chest}}, 'Police' on the sleeves, and black uniform trousers.

25|$|At that time, the <b>Wicking</b> Library was the school's newest wing. The {{library in}} the parking lot did not satisfy {{educators}} who thought that a library could be the center of instructional activity. In addition, many classrooms in the school needed upgrading and the music facilities were poor. The plan to solve these problems showed a small addition on the left, a new hallway across the rear of the plant, and rooms surrounding the library. The music department would get two big practice rooms and a classroom. A large two-story structure was planned to surround the library. When the plans were revealed, everyone was happy that the definitely modern building would be {{around the corner from the}} traditional Georgian Facade. In September 1973, the new wing was completed. South now had first-class science labs and social studies classrooms, appropriately naming the new addition the “S-Building.” In addition to the new classrooms, South gained a new 116-seat lecture hall.|$|E
50|$|The {{lamp burner}} has a flat <b>wick,</b> usually made of cotton. The {{lower part of}} the <b>wick</b> dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the <b>wick</b> extends out of the <b>wick</b> tube of the lamp burner, which {{includes}} a wick-adjustment mechanism. Adjusting how much of the <b>wick</b> extends above the <b>wick</b> tube controls the flame. The <b>wick</b> tube surrounds the <b>wick,</b> and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner. Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed, metal sprocket bearing against the <b>wick.</b> If the <b>wick</b> is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone {{at the top of the}} <b>wick</b> tube, the lamp will produce smoke and soot (unburned carbon). When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the <b>wick</b> has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow flame. As the kerosene burns, capillary action in the <b>wick</b> draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank. All kerosene flat <b>wick</b> lamps use the dead flame burner design, where the flame is fed cold air from below and hot air exits above.|$|R

25|$|Until 1994 the No.1 Dress {{was also}} the {{everyday}} working uniform, but today it is rarely seen except on formal occasions. The normal working dress retains the shirt and trousers. In some forces short sleeved shirts may be worn open-necked. Long sleeved shirts must always be worn with a tie or cravat, worn {{with or without a}} jersey or fleece. If a jersey, fleece or jacket is worn over a short sleeved shirt, then a tie must be worn. In 2003, Strathclyde Police replaced the white shirts with black <b>wicking</b> T-shirts with stab vest on top, for the majority of officers on duty. Some forces use combat trousers (trousers are of a cargo pocket style i.e. two thigh pockets and two conventional side and rear pockets) and boots. Today, female officers almost never wear a skirt in working dress, and sometimes wear trousers in formal dress as well. Officers also frequently wear reflective waterproof jackets, which have replaced the old greatcoats and cloaks traditionally worn in inclement weather. Most officers now wear stab vests, a type of body armour, when on duty.|$|E
2500|$|Cloth diapers are {{reusable}} {{and can be}} {{made from}} natural fibers, man-made materials, or a combination of both. They are often made from industrial cotton which may be bleached white or left the fiber’s natural color. Other natural fiber cloth materials include wool, bamboo, and unbleached hemp. Man-made materials such as an internal absorbent layer of microfiber toweling or an external waterproof layer of polyurethane laminate (PUL) may be used. Polyester fleece and faux suedecloth are often used inside cloth diapers as a [...] "stay-dry" [...] <b>wicking</b> liner because of the non-absorbent properties of those synthetic fibers.|$|E
2500|$|Winter backpacking {{requires}} {{a higher level}} of skill and generally more specialized gear than in other seasons. Skis or snowshoes may be required to traverse deep snow, or crampons and an ice axe where needed. Winter sleeping bags and tents are essential, as are waterproof, water-repellent, and moisture dissipating materials. Cotton clothing retains moisture and chills the body, both particularly dangerous in cold weather. [...] Winter backpackers stick to wool or synthetic fabric like nylon or polypropylene, which hold less moisture and often have specialized <b>wicking</b> properties to dissipate sweat generated during aerobic activities. Layering is essential, as wet clothes quickly sap body heat and can lead to frostbite or hypothermia.|$|E

2500|$|In {{more modern}} applications, {{microbial}} cellulose has become relevant {{in the medical}} sector. [...] It [...] has been tested and successfully used as a wound dressing, especially in burn cases. [...] Studies have shown that burns treated with microbial cellulose coverings healed faster than traditional treatments and had less scarring. [...] The microbial cellulose topical applications are effective due to the cellulose's water holding ability and water vapor permeability. [...] The high water holding ability provides a moist atmosphere at the injury site, which is critical in healing, while the <b>wicking</b> ability allows seepage from the wound {{to be removed from}} the site. [...] Also, the microbial cellulose molds very well {{to the surface of the}} skin, providing a conformal covering even in usually difficult places to dress wounds, such as areas on the face. [...] This technique has been so successful that commercial microbial cellulose products, such as Biofill ®, have been developed. [...] Another microbial cellulose commercial treatment product is XCell produced by the Xylos Corporation, which is mainly used to treat wounds from venous ulcers. [...] Studies have also been performed where traditional gauze dressings are treated with a microbial cellulose biopolymer to enhance the properties of the gauze. [...] In addition to increasing the drying time and water holding abilities, liquid medicines were able to be absorbed by the microbial cellulose coated gauze, allowing them to work at the injury site.|$|E
2500|$|A yarn's {{usefulness}} for a knitting {{project is}} judged by several factors, {{such as its}} loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, <b>wicking</b> properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features. [...] Other factors include allergenicity; speed of drying; resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew; melting point and flammability; retention of static electricity; and the propensity to become stained and to accept dyes. [...] Different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, {{so there is no}} one [...] "best" [...] yarn. [...] The resilience and propensity to (un)twist are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. [...] More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. [...] A key factor in knitting is stitch definition, [...] corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. [...] Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.|$|E
