Brundage and the IOC had considered the potential of television revenue {{as early as the}} Melbourne Games of 1956, but had been slow to address the issue, with the result that television rights for the 1960 Games were {{in the hands of the}} Rome organizing committee; the IOC received only 5% of the $60,000 rights fee. Accounts submitted by the Rome organizers showed they lost money on the Olympics; the IOC would have received a portion of the profits, and had no money to offer the sports federations who wanted a percentage of the proceeds. In future years, the sale of television rights became a major source of revenue for the IOC, rising to $10 million by the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, and $1.2 billion, long after Brundage's death, at Athens in 2004.

2500|$|Haggard {{developed}} a concept he called [...] "The Life-Giving Church", which amounted to his ministry practice. He believed that churches and their members either lived [...] "in the Tree of Life" [...] or [...] "in the Tree of Knowledge {{of good and}} evil", referring to the two trees in the Garden of Eden (see Gen. 2:9). He wrote a book, The Life-Giving Church, to expound on this difference, and said that motivations are the key difference between two types of Christians. For instance, Haggard proposed, two women can stand outside an abortion clinic with protest signs. The [...] "tree of life" [...] protestor is there because she loves the unborn and has compassion for the mother and father. The [...] "tree of knowledge of good and evil" [...] protestor has come because she believes abortion is evil and must be stopped. [...] "One way we can tell which tree we are living in," [...] writes Haggard, [...] "is our response to sin... {{one of the greatest}} marks of bearing His [...] character is our response to someone else's sin. If <b>we</b> <b>handle</b> others' mistakes with a life-giving attitude, then we (and they) have the opportunity to enjoy great power and freedom. But if <b>we</b> <b>handle</b> others' mistakes negatively, then we're eating from the wrong tree and will begin to die." [...] Christians who live in the [...] "tree of life," [...] writes Haggard, [...] "grow in their understanding of right and wrong, and they find great insight, wisdom, victory, and joy in the stream of Jesus' righteousness." [...] Those who dwell in the opposite tree find and display [...] "frustration, judgmental attitudes, and death." ...|$|E

[...] Daly's resolution was covered extensively by the local media and elevated the issues of treatment of protests {{in relation to the}} Olympics being held in China, the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay and the torch ceremonies being held in San Francisco, the only North American stop. The torch relay {{will be the first time}} in Olympics history that protests will accompany the torch as it passes through a U.S. city. [...] Daly stated, [...] "he magnitude of attention paid to the Olympic Games and the torch relay makes the event the appropriate platform to discuss human rights. If someone can look you in the face and tell you the Olympics are limited to the individual competitions that take place, well, that's a good poker player." [...] Daly also criticized the rare decision to set up designated [...] "free-speech zones" [...] stating, [...] "I don't see why we should break from our pattern of how <b>we</b> <b>handle</b> mass protests or demonstrations for China." [...] San Francisco mayor, Gavin Newsom, said he has [...] "very serious concerns" [...] about the situation in Tibet but added San Francisco is [...] "privileged" [...] to be the torch's only stop in North America and that the event should rise above political concerns and that the Games should be a time [...] "to focus on the things that unite us and not divide us." [...] In a later committee meeting supervisors Carmen Chu and Sean Elsbernd amended the resolution to welcome the Global Human Rights Torch Relay on April 5 and the Tibetan Freedom Torch on April 8 and commend [...] "their efforts to raise awareness regarding human rights violations in China and urging the San Francisco City Representatives ... to welcome the Torch in the explicit spirit of Olympism, consistent with the United Nations Charter ... and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights." ...|$|E

Trees, grass, flowers, woodland streamlets, cattle, deer, and unsophisticated man.

6000|$|Yet even in {{this attempt}} I am aware that I shall be obliged to draw more largely on the reader's attention, than so immethodical a {{miscellany}} as this can authorize; when in such a work (the Ecclesiasical Polity) of such a mind as Hooker's, the judicious author, though no less admirable for the perspicuity than for the port and dignity of his language,--and though he wrote for men of learning in a learned age,--saw nevertheless occasion to anticipate and guard against [...] "complaints of obscurity," [...] {{as often as he}} was to trace his subject [...] "to the highest well-spring and fountain." [...] Which, (continues he) [...] "because men are not accustomed to, the pains we take are more needful a great deal, than acceptable; and the matters <b>we</b> <b>handle,</b> seem by reason of newness (till the mind grow better acquainted with them) dark and intricate."

We never thought, as these people do, that all repairs to tools and ploughs can be done on the very spot. All that is needed when a strap breaks, is that each ploughman should have an awl and a leather-cutter to stitch the leather. How is it with us in our country? If leather breaks, we farmers say that leather is unclean, and we go back from the fields into the village to the village cobbler that he may mend it. Unclean? Do not <b>we</b> <b>handle</b> that same thing with the leather on it after it has been repaired? Do we not even drink water all day with the very hand that has sweated into the leather? Meantime, we have surely lost an hour or two in coming and going from the fields." [...] [He will understand that. He chatters like a monkey when the men waste time.

6000|$|I did not {{at first}} find it at all an easy matter to make test weights so alike as to differ in no other appreciable respect than in their {{specific}} gravity, and if they differ and become known apart, the knowledge so acquired will vitiate future judgments in various indirect ways. Similarity in outward shape and touch was ensured {{by the use of}} mechanically-made cartridge cases; dissimilarity through any external stain was rendered of no hindrance to the experiment by making the operatee handle them in a bag or with his eyes shut. Two bodies may, however, be alike in weight and outward appearance and yet behave differently when otherwise mechanically tested, and, consequently, when they are handled. For example, take two eggs, one raw and the other hard boiled, and spin them on the table; press the finger for a moment upon either of them whilst it is still spinning: if it be the hard-boiled egg it will stop as dead as a stone: if it be the raw egg, after a little apparent hesitation, it will begin again to rotate. The motion of its shell had alone been stopped; the internal part was still rotating and this compelled the shell to follow it. Owing to this cause, when <b>we</b> <b>handle</b> the two eggs, the one feels [...] "quick" [...] and the other does not. Similarly with the cartridges, when one is rather more loosely packed than the others the difference is perceived on handling them. Or it may have one end heavier than the other, or else its weight may not be equally distributed round its axis, causing it to rest on the table with the same part always lowermost; differences due to these causes are also easily perceived when handling the cartridges. Again, one of two similar cartridges may balance perfectly in all directions, but the weight of one of them may be disposed too much towards the ends, as in a dumb-bell, or gathered too much towards the centre. The period of oscillation will differ widely in the two cases, as may be shown by suspending the cartridges by strings round their middle so that they shall hang horizontally, and then by a slight tap making them spin to and fro round the string as an axis.|$|E

"I let him run on, this papier-mache Mephistopheles, and {{it seemed}} to me that if I tried I could poke my {{forefinger}} through him, and would find nothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe. He, don't you see, had been planning to be assistant-manager by and by under the present man, and I could see that the coming of that Kurtz had upset them both not a little. He talked precipitately, and I did not try to stop him. I had my shoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on the slope like a carcass of some big river animal. The smell of mud, of primeval mud, by Jove! was in my nostrils, the high stillness of primeval forest was before my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black creek. The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silver--over the rank grass, over the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple, over the great river I could see through a sombre gap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly by without a murmur. All this was great, expectant, mute, while the man jabbered about himself. I wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace. What were we who had strayed in here? Could <b>we</b> <b>handle</b> that dumb thing, or would it handle us? I felt how big, how confoundedly big, was that thing that couldn't talk, and perhaps was deaf as well. What was in there? I could see a little ivory coming out from there, and I had heard Mr. Kurtz was in there. I had heard enough about it, too--God knows! Yet somehow it didn't bring any image with it--no more than if I had been told an angel or a fiend was in there. I believed it in the same way one of you might believe there are inhabitants in the planet Mars. I knew once a Scotch sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people in Mars. If you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved, he would get shy and mutter something about 'walking on all-fours.' If you as much as smiled, he would--though a man of sixty--offer to fight you. I would not have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie. You know I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lies--which is exactly what I hate and detest in the world--what I want to forget. It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do. Temperament, I suppose. Well, I went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in Europe. I became in an instant as much of a pretence as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims. This simply because I had a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not see--you understand. He was just a word for me. I did not see the man in the name any more than you do. Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do you see anything? It seems to me I am trying to tell you a dream--making a vain attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams...." ...|$|E
