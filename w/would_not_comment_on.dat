In January 1947, he quit as Maryland coach, stating {{that he did not}} want to remain athletic director or resign from the Washington Redskins, both of which the school wanted. Shaughnessy said he would work full-time for the Redskins for the remaining year on his contract, and might return to coach only college football at the end of his term, possibly with Maryland. President Byrd affirmed that Shaughnessy's poor 1946 record was not related to his departure. He was replaced by split T proponent Jim Tatum.|$|E
5|$|Bednar {{was hired}} by the Canadian National Exhibition in 1998, during a period during a period where both the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds had low {{profitability}} or were losing money. The CNEA made just $70,000 in 1997. He said he was being paid less than his predecessor, Bryan Tisdall, who was one of five departing executives that the CNEA and Exhibition Place grounds made large severance payments to. When Bednar joined, the 1998 fair was already planned, and he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> its future direction. The following year, CNE started promoting its events on weekends, which there was previously a policy against. The change in policy allowed corporate partners to offer discounted or free ticket promotions. This led to a 7 percent increase in admissions, but a large reduction in revenues. According to a city councillor on the CNEA board, the crowding and traffic of the event discouraged potential customers from continuing to visit the event in the final week.|$|E

25|$|The first {{intimate}} photograph, with likenesses of Chen and Gillian Chung, {{was posted}} on the Hong Kong Discuss Forum at approximately 8:30p.m. on 27 January 2008. Although the original post was deleted after a few hours, the image did the rounds at other major forums in Hong Kong such as Uwants and HKGolden. Chung's management agency, Emperor Entertainment Group (EEG), immediately challenged its authenticity, and filed a police report. The following day, a second explicit photograph of Chen with another starlet appeared on the Internet. EEG denounced the person who released it. Gillian Chung had taken a leave of absence, and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the matter. Shaped by the denials, the initial media consensus was that the photographs were hoaxes.

5000|$|The {{time of the}} {{collision}} was unclear at first, but {{in the days after}} {{the collision}} a time of 01:30 was generally accepted. On Monday, 19 June (Japan Standard Time)—two days after the collision—the Japan Coast Guard and Nippon Yusen (NYK Line), ACX Crystals operator, said, after further investigation, the collision was at about 01:30. At this time, ACX Crystal made a sudden turn, according to Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. (US Navy ships frequently turn off their AIS to preserve operational security.) The US Navy initially said the event was at 02:20, when AIS data showed the cargo ship returning to the same area where it had turned earlier, and five minutes before the event was reported to the Japan Coast Guard by ACX Crystal at 02:25. On Monday, the US Navy said [...] "all aspects of this incident" [...] were under investigation and declined to <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the discrepancy.

500|$|Although {{state legislators}} {{maintained}} that reforming {{the public school}} system was too large an issue to tackle during the 60-day legislative session of 1990 and requested that Wilkinson call a special legislative session in June 1990 to consider the issue, the governor insisted that the issue be resolved during the regular session and said that he would not allow consideration of tax increases to fund improvements in the system if he had to call a special session. Wilkinson presented a budget proposal to the General Assembly that contained measures increasing taxes on cigarettes and corporations and eliminating sales tax exemptions on legal, engineering, and advertising services. Legislators favored raising the sales tax to six percent instead. For much of the legislative session, Wilkinson remained steadfastly opposed to an increased sales tax, repeatedly calling it a [...] "dead issue" [...] and threatening to veto it. Then on March 9, 1990, Wilkinson announced that he would drop his opposition to the tax in exchange for the Assembly's approval of a $600 million bond issue to finance road improvements he had promised during the campaign. The Lexington Herald-Leader called the move [...] "a stunning reversal" [...] and noted that Wilkinson <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> why he changed his mind. With the impasse between the legislature and Wilkinson resolved, House Speaker Don Blandford announced that the remainder of the session would focus only on approving the state budget and passing the court-mandated education reforms; any bills still in committees would not be brought to a vote, he said. On April 11, 1990, the Assembly passed the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) to comply with the Supreme Court's decision. Besides increasing funding for schools, it mandated high performance measures and held schools accountable for meeting them. Educators hailed the legislation as being among the nation's best education reform plans.|$|E

On 8 December 2011, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the Washington Post that the U.S. cannot be certain the drone shown was real because the U.S. does not have access to it, but also stated that [...] "We have no indication that it was brought down by hostile fire." [...] A second senior U.S. military official said that a major question is how the drone could have remained [...] "virtually intact," [...] given the high altitude from which it is said to have crashed.

Both Kirby and fellow spokesman George Little <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>comment</b> further <b>on</b> whether the U.S. military believed the drone was the one missing, both did say that the missing drone had not been recovered.

50|$|In March 2014, an {{associate}} professor of feminist studies, Mireille Miller-Young, was charged with battery, theft and vandalism after she allegedly stole and destroyed a sign from a Pro-life demonstrator, who was protesting in an area of the UCSB campus designated as a “free speech zone.” The sign depicted graphic imagery of aborted fetuses, and Professor Miller-Young responded by allegedly stealing the sign from one of the demonstrators, a 16-year-old girl who was identified {{as a member of the}} group Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust, and when the girl tried to take the sign back, the professor allegedly pushed and scratched her. The university initially stated that it <b>would</b> <b>not</b> publicly <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> personnel matters. However, UCSB's Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, Michael D. Young, issued a statement supporting free speech on campus, while also accusing outside groups of trying to create divisions in the campus community. Although Miller-Young initially pleaded not guilty, she changed her plea to no contest in July 2014, and was sentenced to three years probation; 108 hours of community service; and 10 hours of anger management classes. In November 2014, the anti-abortion group involved in the incident filed a civil lawsuit against the University of California Santa Barbara and against Mireille Miller-Young. The complaint reportedly was filed to “vindicate plaintiff’s own rights and rights of others” with the anti-abortion group claiming that the university failed to discipline Professor Miler-Young, who as of the filing of the civil lawsuit remains employed by UCSB.|$|R
