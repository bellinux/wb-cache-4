5|$|Hyde Park {{hosted a}} Great Fair {{in the summer}} of 1814 to {{celebrate}} the Allied sovereigns' visit to England, and exhibited various stalls and shows. The Battle of Trafalgar was re-enacted on the Serpentine, with a band playing the National Anthem while the French fleet sank into the lake. The coronation of King George IV in 1821 was celebrated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> in the park, including an air balloon and firework displays.|$|E
5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. It is common for quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the easiest}} to recycle would be bismuth-containing fusible alloys {{in the form of}} larger objects, then larger {{soldered}} objects. Half of the world's solder consumption is in electronics (i.e., circuit boards). As the soldered objects get smaller or contain little solder or little bismuth, the recovery gets progressively more difficult and less economic, although solder with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering. Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> bismuth content, perhaps as bismuth phosphomolybdate, and then bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.|$|E

5|$|Rasmussen {{was also}} {{involved}} {{in a review of}} fossil birds from Miocene and Pliocene deposits in North Carolina. Finds included an early Miocene loon Colymboides minutus, various ducks, a crested tern closely resembling the modern royal tern Sterna maxima, {{and a member of the}} crow genus, one of the few fossil passerine birds from that period. The review found that fossil birds from this period generally closely resemble a modern species or genus, and those that do not can usually be placed in a modern family <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> degree of confidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{reference to}} cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., a Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in {{the records of}} a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re {{the use of a}} parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony makes clear that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be said <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.|$|E

25|$|Much of Pennsylvania German's {{difference}} from Standard German {{can be summarized}} as consisting of a simplified grammatical structure, several vowel and consonant shifts that occur <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> degree of regularity, {{as well as a}} variety of lexical differences.

25|$|The {{efforts of}} the dukes to {{increase}} their power and to give unity to the duchy had met <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> measure of success; but they were soon vitiated by partitions among different members of the family, which for 250 years made the history of Bavaria {{little more than a}} repetitive chronicle of territorial divisions bringing war and weakness in their wake.|$|E

The album is heavily electronic with some heavy beats. It also contains some explicit content. Both Hayes and Conley share vocal duties on this album.|$|E

He was plagued by recurring poor health, especially when the wound he had received from Sublett became re-infected in 1883, causing him to be bedridden for almost two years. In 1892, Hardin was described as 5 feet 9 inches tall and 160 pounds, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> complexion, hazel eyes, dark hair, and wound scars on his right knee, left thigh, right side, hip, elbow, shoulder, and back.

25|$|In {{the history}} of how systems of {{representation}} of language through graphic means have evolved in different human civilizations, more complete writing systems were preceded by proto-writing, systems of ideographic or early mnemonic symbols. True writing, in which the content of a linguistic utterance is encoded so that another reader can reconstruct, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> degree of accuracy, the exact utterance written down, is a later development. It is distinguished from proto-writing, which typically avoids encoding grammatical words and affixes, {{making it more difficult}} or impossible to reconstruct the exact meaning intended by the writer unless a great deal of context is already known in advance. One of the earliest forms of written expression is cuneiform.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{anterograde}} amnesia have trouble recalling new information and new autobiographical events, but {{the data are}} less consistent {{in regard to the}} latter. Medveds and Hirst recorded the presence of islands of memory– detailed accounts– that were described by such patients. The island memories were a combination of semantic and episodic memories. The researchers recorded patients giving long narratives <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> amount of detail that resembled memories that the patients had prior to the trauma. The appearance of islands of memory could {{have something to do with}} the functioning of adjacent cortical areas and the neocortex. In addition, the researchers suspect that the amygdala played a role in the narratives.|$|E

25|$|Their {{first album}} with Peter Dolving {{back at the}} helm (and signed to a new deal with Century Media), was {{entitled}} Revolver. The new album was released in October 2004 and named {{as it was to}} convey the evolution of the band and the music it plays as a whole. Revolver was met <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> amount of fan support and critical acclaim, and the band toured the world extensively in support of it, including a second stage spot at Ozzfest 2005. On February 2 of 2005, Marco Aro played his last show in Stockholm, Sweden but as a guest singer. In 2006, the band performed on the Extreme The Dojo vol.15 tour in Japan with Exodus and Nile, while Edge of Spirit opened for them.|$|E
25|$|France {{had been}} {{undergoing}} {{a revolution in}} its government and social orders. A National Assembly declared itself into being and promulgated their intention to provide France <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> and liberal constitution. Louis XVI moved to Paris in October of that year but grew to detest Paris and organised an escape plot in 1791. The escape plot known as the Flight to Varennes ultimately failed to materialise and destroyed any positive public opinion for the monarchy. Louis XVI's brothers-in-exile in Coblenz rallied for an invasion of France. Austria and Prussia responded to the royal brothers' cries and released the Declaration of Pillnitz in August. The declaration stated that Prussia and Austria wished to restore Louis XVI to absolute power but would only attempt to do so {{with the assistance of}} the other European powers.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} rounds, Trout {{seemed to have}} a good game plan. However, Álvarez's power took over after the third round, {{eventually}} scoring a knockdown in the seventh round to give Trout the first knockdown of his career. Álvarez set up the knockdown with a pawing left jab, followed by the straight right hand. The fight was closer than expected, but Álvarez still managed to dominate Trout throughout the fight with impressive head movement and shocking power. All three judges scorecards were in favor of Álvarez <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> margin (115-112, 116-111 and 118-109). Although the last score card (118-109) created controversy, the majority of sport analysts had Álvarez winning by at least 2 points. Immediately after the bout, Trout stated that he hadn't underestimated Álvarez but that he trained to fight a completely different fighter.|$|E
