500|$|In {{order to}} build support early in the campaign, Hunter participated in local straw polls. On March 1, at the Spartanburg, South Carolina poll, Hunter {{finished}} a close third in a statistical tie with McCain and Giuliani. The showing impressed Spartanburg Republican Gerald Emory who referred to Hunter as, [...] "a true Ronald Reagan conservative that we can support." [...] The following month he won the Anderson County, South Carolina straw poll and tied for second place in both the Greenwood County and Pickens County straw polls. Hunter thanked the counties for their support, which he claimed provided [...] "a huge boost." [...] He added, [...] "t is clear our message of maintaining a strong national defense, securing our border without amnesty, holding China accountable on trade, and protecting life are resonating with the voters. Our campaign is one of issues, not flash and expense. We don't have a jet or an army of consultants and paid staff. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> conservative message that is true. In the end, that will be what Americans want." ...|$|E
500|$|Jaws 3-D had two 3D consultants: the {{production}} started with Chris Condon, president of StereoVision, and Stan Loth was later {{added to the}} team for the Arrivision 3D. Production began using the StereoVision, but this was dropped after {{a week for the}} Arrivision system, [...] "which Alves believed was a superior system because it has a wider variety of lenses". According to Alves, inferior systems lead to ghosting and blurring, leaving audiences with headaches. He says that [...] "the left and right images [...] are very well-matched, and the photography is very clean; it's restful to the eye, and though <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> occasional effects where things do emerge toward the audience from the plane of projection, you come out of the film without a headache." [...] Historian R. M. Hayes says that the film was shot using both the Arrivision and StereoVision single strip-over-and-under units. Both cameras were used in conjunction with each other. This is a means of shooting 3D movies in normal color with a single camera and single strip of film: the Arrivision 3D technique uses a special twin-lens adapter fitted to the film camera, and divides the 35mm film frame in half along the middle, capturing the left-eye image in the upper half of the frame and the right-eye image in the lower half – this is known as [...] "over/under". This allows filming to proceed as for any standard 2D film, without the considerable additional expense of having to double up on cameras and film stock for every shot. When the resultant film is projected through a normal projector (albeit one requiring a special lens that combines the upper and lower images), a true polarised 3D image is produced. This system allows 3D films to be shown in almost any cinema since it does not require two projectors running simultaneously through the presentation – something most cinemas are not equipped to handle. What is required of the theatre is both the special projection lens and a reflective [...] "silver" [...] screen to enable the polarized images to reflect back to the viewer with the appropriate filter on each eye blocking out the wrong image, thus leaving the viewer to see the film from two angles as the eyes naturally see the world. According to the company that built the underwater camera housings for Jaws 3-D, the underwater sequences were shot using an Arriflex 35–3 camera with Arrivision 18mm over/under 3D lens.|$|E

2500|$|Collins {{adapted the}} novel for film herself, in {{collaboration}} with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he [...] "felt {{the only way to}} make the film really successful was to be totally subjective", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present. Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, [...] "In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers' manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katniss's head, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game center and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was tonally important." [...] Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that [...] "I thought that it was very interesting that there would be one generation [...] who knew that [...] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is".|$|E
