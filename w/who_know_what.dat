5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is world psychiatry and know it is not the same as what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E

500|$|Q {{performs}} her own stunts in the series. The actress {{liked to}} have her character [...] "be able to do her own thing," [...] as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted [...] "but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always {{got to take a}} step back and let the men shine. And in this, it's about the women <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they're doing." [...] At some point Q set up a three-week long training period for the rest of the cast to make their fight scenes in the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.|$|E
500|$|In March 1967, Rindt married Nina Lincoln, a Finnish {{model and}} {{daughter}} of racing driver Curt Lincoln, {{whom he had}} raced {{in the early part}} of his career. After becoming engaged, Lincoln had originally broken up with Rindt and sent the engagement ring back. Rindt then put it back into the box with a note telling her to keep it until she changed her mind, which she did upon receiving the package, later explaining: [...] "I like men <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they want." [...] The couple moved to Switzerland, near Begnins, where they built a house together. The Rindts had one daughter, Natasha, who was two years old at the time of her father's death. Nina Rindt married twice more after Rindt's death, first Philip Martyn, with whom she had another daughter, and then Alexander Hood, 4th Viscount Bridport, making her Lady Nina Hood Bridport. The couple had a son, Anthony. Their daughter Natasha later worked with Bernie Ecclestone for several years after he had taken over the commercial rights of Formula One.|$|E

500|$|Kai Owen {{describes}} Thomas, Morgan and Hughes collectively with Robin Griffith (Barry Williams) as a [...] "good old-fashioned Welsh cast <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it's all about". Jonathan Lewis Owen {{was cast}} as Rhys' best man [...] "Banana Boat" [...] a character referred to sporadically since Torchwoods first series premiere [...] "Everything Changes" [...] (2006). In {{keeping with the}} character's name {{he was given a}} pair of banana patterned cuff links to compliment his costume. As a joke, Eve Myles (who Jonathan Owen had previously worked with in other projects) left a banana skin on his car on his first day of filming. Collette Brown played [...] "Carrie", the original human form of the mother Nostrovite. To transform her into the alien creature the actress was required to spend approximately an hour having make-up applied. Brown was surprised at the efficiency of the make-up artists as she had expected the transformation process to take longer. Originally, the human versions of the Nostrovite shapeshifter were intended to be more monstrous but Davies felt it was important that the audience would still be able to recognise the actor underneath once the make up had been applied.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{noted for its}} [...] "dry, sterile" [...] production. Rasmussen said that was not his intention, as he tried for an ambient sound similar to the {{previous}} two albums. He was not present during the album's mixing, for which Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero had been hired beforehand. Rasmussen felt that, in his absence from the mixing process, Thompson and Barbiero ended up using only the close microphones on the mix {{and none of the}} room microphones, thus causing the [...] "clicking", thin drum sound. Popoff noted that because of the strange production, the bass guitar was nearly inaudible, while the guitars sounded [...] "strangled mechanistic". He saw the [...] "synthetic" [...] percussion as another reason for the album's compressed sound. The sound has nearly-inaudible bass guitar, which Rasmussen claims was ordered by Hetfield and Ulrich after hearing the initial mixes, resulting in his belief that [...] "Jason Newsted, [...] Toby Wright and I are probably the only people <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the bass parts actually sounded like on that album". Thompson similarly blamed Ulrich for the inaudible bass, stating that Ulrich ordered him to remove the bass from the mix. In their defense, Hetfield and Ulrich said that most of Newsted's bass lines closely followed the rhythm guitar lines {{to the point of being}} indiscernible from each other. A lack of direction is also partly to blame; since the album was largely produced by the band, there was no one present in the studio to guide the band's new bassist and tell him what was expected of him, something a producer would typically do. Newsted was not satisfied with the final mixes: [...] "The Justice album wasn't something that really felt good for me, because you really can't hear the bass." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people <b>who</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E
