5|$|Set {{within a}} fictionalized {{version of the}} San Francisco Bay Area, {{the game is played}} from a third-person {{perspective}} and its open world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Players control Marcus Holloway, a hacker who works with the hacking group DedSec to take down the city's advanced surveillance system known as ctOS. There are multiple <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> missions, and each successful assignment increases the follower count of DedSec. Cooperative multiplayer allows for competitive one-on-one combat and connecting with other players in order to neutralize a player who is causing havoc.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the fictional city of Karnaca. After Empress Emily Kaldwin is deposed by the witch Delilah Copperspoon, the player may choose between playing as either Emily or her Royal Protector and father Corvo Attano as they attempt to reclaim the throne. Both Emily and Corvo employ their own array of supernatural abilities, though the player can {{alternatively}} decide to forfeit these abilities altogether. There is a multitude of <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> missions, from stealth to purposeful violent conflict, navigated through a sandbox environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} contains quests and puzzles {{that the}} player must solve. There are different <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> quests, all {{with their own}} pitfalls. Peaceful resolutions {{can be made with}} characters and factions, though these can have ill effects, such as releasing secrets or worsening relations with other factions. Violent completion of quests may be faster, though they can result in the weakening of alliances between the player and the factions. In some of the puzzle sections, the player directs lasers to hit designated targets; others require the player to build with blocks, as in Minecraft. Puzzle sections were not featured in the base game. Upon completion of quests, the assisted factions reward the protagonist with Nuka-Cola bottle caps, one of the fictional currencies found throughout the Fallout series. The player character also gains experience points. Some of the quests include investigating minor mysteries, retrieving missing items, solving disagreements, and clearing out monster-infested areas.|$|E

25|$|In particular, this norm gets smaller when {{a number}} is multiplied by p, in sharp {{contrast}} to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime). While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |−|p yields the field of p-adic numbers. These are essentially all possible <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> Q, by Ostrowski's theorem. Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed (or local) fields. This local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory.|$|E
500|$|The player's {{freedom to}} explore {{may be limited}} until they {{complete}} certain objectives and advance the game plot. Players must visit specific locations and complete specific missions {{in order to win}} the game, ii. [...] iii. [...] such as racing, tailing, couriering, robbing, stealing, shooting, assassinating, and driving to specific checkpoints. There may be multiple <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> these missions as the game environment is designed to facilitate shortcuts, experimentation, and creative ways to kill enemies. Completing a core mission will unlock further missions and advance the storyline, and if the player fails a mission {{they will be able to}} resume the game from before the mission began. In addition, these games usually offer optional side missions, which allow players to gain other rewards. These side missions improve the game's replay value. These games are also known for incorporating numerous minigames into the game world, [...] such as circuit races. Ultimately, this allows the player to follow or ignore the game's storyline as they see fit.|$|E
500|$|Previous Mega Man games {{typically}} {{allowed the}} player {{to call on}} the transformable dog Rush or use other support items in order to traverse difficult or otherwise inaccessible parts of a stage. Mega Man 6 instead features a pair of [...] "Rush Adaptors" [...] that fuse Mega Man and Rush into special forms. The first, [...] "Jet Mega Man", lets the player fly upward or hover {{for a brief period}} of time, but prevents the use of charge shots. The second, [...] "Power Mega Man", utilizes a powerful, short-range punch attack for destroying large blocks. The player cannot slide when using either adapter. Mega Man 6 also presents less linear <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the stages than in previous entries in the series. There are two pathways in many of the stages that lead to boss rooms, but the player is often required to use one of the Rush adaptors to begin an alternate route. Although either one will clear the stage, only one of them will give the player a letter circuit board for assembling the helper bird Beat. Collecting all four parts will allow the player to call on Beat to attack enemies.|$|E
50|$|Local laws <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a stepparent {{adoption}} vary. While {{having the}} non-custodial parent {{consent to the}} adoption is the easiest <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a stepparent adoption, {{it is still possible}} <b>to</b> have one <b>completed</b> when they either do not consent, or cannot be located.|$|R
50|$|Brigus Head Path is a 6.5 km hike of {{moderate}} difficulty. It takes 2-4 hours (one <b>way)</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete.</b> The trailheads {{are located in}} Brigus South and Admirals Cove. Features Hares Ears rock formation at Hares Ears Point.|$|R

2500|$|World at War [...] {{features}} more mature themes than previous Call of Duty installments and [...] is open-ended, giving the player multiple <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> objectives, but otherwise generally plays like previous iterations of the franchise. Players fight alongside AI-controlled teammates. They help during the game's missions by providing cover fire, shooting down enemies, and clearing rooms for entry.|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen: [...] former US Army Special Forces {{soldier and}} a current CIA {{contractor}} {{who has been}} burned (identified as an unreliable or dangerous agent) and now finds himself {{in his hometown of}} Miami, unable to leave. With his assets frozen, he is forced to live off his wits and any small investigative jobs he can find while he searches for answers about who has burned him and why. Highly skilled and extremely clever, he can think on his feet, often improvising electronic devices and using ordinary items ranging from duct tape to cake frosting in highly unorthodox <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a job. He has two black belts or, as he puts it in one episode, [...] "thirty years of karate" [...] and is [...] "rated with anything that fires a bullet or holds an edge". He has an uncanny ability to assume cover identities, working in numerous regional dialects and international accents; however, he cannot speak Spanish fluently. He believes that his unhappy childhood, largely at the hands of an abusive father, has helped to make him into a natural covert operative while also making close relationships difficult for him. He has a younger brother, Nate (Seth Peterson), who appeared in several episodes before being killed by a sniper in Season 6. Michael presents himself as a cynic hardened by experience but occasionally reveals a soft, and sometimes vulnerable, side. His favorite food is yogurt, which is featured or eaten by {{at least one of the}} characters in each episode. He has a romantic relationship with Fiona. In the series finale he and Fiona are living in Ireland raising Charlie (Nate's son) as their own child.|$|E
50|$|The cherry blocks {{are absent}} from Mr. Do Vs. Unicorns and early {{revisions}} of Mr. Do's Castle. Instead, blocks {{that are not}} keys or skulls {{at the start of}} a stage will be fill blocks (those left behind when unicorns fall into holes and are left alone for a time). Because of this, there are only three <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> a level in this version, versus the four <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> levels in Mr. Do's Castle. In addition, in these early revisions, the fill blocks change colors every two stages.|$|E
50|$|Biscan Cove Path is a 7.3 km hike of {{moderate}} difficultly. It takes about 2-4 hours (one <b>way)</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete.</b> The trailheads {{are located in}} Cape St. Francis and Pouch Cove. The hike can be challenging but offers views offshore.|$|R

Scoring and ranking are otherwise the same as the single-player version.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{campaign}} is also noted as being very difficult, with some early campaign choices making subsequent missions much harder without the player realizing it. While the game attempted to present the player with multiple <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> some missions, the methods often varied wildly in difficulty, and the player would not know this until after trying all options.|$|E
50|$|White Horse Path is a 17.5 km, strenuous hike. It takes 8-10 hours (one <b>way)</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete,</b> {{therefore}} {{preparation is}} required.

50|$|Released {{around the}} same time as Shenmue, Sword of the Berserk is notable for its early use of quick time events (QTE). It used these to {{determine}} the different non-linear paths the player would take, depending on whether they succeed or fail in pressing the displayed button quickly enough during a QTE, allowing different <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> the game.|$|E
50|$|Only three {{universities}} currently offer {{graduate programs}} in statistics education: the University of Granada, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Florida. However, {{graduate students in}} a variety of disciplines (e.g., mathematics education, psychology, educational psychology) have been finding <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> dissertations on topics related to teaching and learning statistics. These dissertations are archived on the IASE web site.|$|E
5000|$|Many logic puzzles {{allow an}} {{analogue}} of metagaming. By convention, logic puzzles are only considered well-constructed {{if they have}} a unique solution. When solving a puzzle, one might notice that if a certain candidate symbol were placed in one square, there would be multiple <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> another part of the puzzle, and no extra information could possibly decide between them. Ruling out that candidate on these grounds would be metagaming.|$|E
50|$|Beaches path is a 7.0 km, easy hike. It {{should take}} 2-3 hours (one <b>way)</b> <b>to</b> <b>complete.</b> The trailheads {{are located in}} Witless Bay and Mobile.
