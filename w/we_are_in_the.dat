25|$|A related {{speculation}} by Sagan and Newman {{suggests that}} if other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their signals and probes simply have not arrived yet. However, critics have noted that this is unlikely, since it requires that humanity's advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This is {{a tiny fraction of}} the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions and calculations resulting from them, so the likelihood that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of this transition is considered low in the paradox.|$|E

25|$|As 7 {{is not a}} Fermat prime, the 7th {{roots of}} unity {{are the first that}} require cube roots. There are six {{primitive}} 7th roots of unity; thus their computation involves solving a cubic polynomial, and therefore computing a cube root. The three real parts of these primitive roots are the roots of a cubic polynomial; thus they may be expressed in terms of square and cube roots. However, as these three roots are real, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of casus irreducibilis, and any expression of these real parts in terms of radicals involves necessarily some nonreal complex number.|$|E

Menken said of the general songwriting process, [...] "the first challenge for us was finding that musical palette and lyrical palette and performance palette that really spoke to everybody and said that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world of early Walt and to have that place to start." ...|$|E

The orchestra was invited to perform again at the 2013 Spring for Music Festival as one of two returning ensembles. Kalmar said of the return invitation, [...] "To be invited once is a thrill. To be invited twice is clear proof that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> artistic big leagues." [...] However, in October 2012 the Symphony announced it would not accept the invitation for financial reasons.|$|E

500|$|Antestor {{are one of}} the few {{bands in}} the Christian metal scene who use corpse paint in their {{appearances}} and on photos. One example is the booklet photos in the album The Return of the Black Death, depicting Antestor in Norsemen outfits and black and white face paints at a snowy Norwegian mountain location. Sometimes the group uses art blood, as known for the session bassist Ravn Furfjord's (Frosthardr) appearance at the Bobfest 2004 concert. The band explains that corpse paint [...] "is the same for us as masking is for actors or mimes; One way to express certain feelings in the battle <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> main purpose is to concentrate on God and not to break a lance in side issues like these." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the middle}} of 1992, Southampton's manager, Ian Branfoot, became [...] "the most popular manager in English football", as he took {{telephone}} calls from clubs [...] "trying to bargain with players they don't want plus cash". Although Branfoot accepted that a sale was inevitable, he claimed that [...] "whatever happens, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> driving seat". In July 1992, Shearer was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of £3.6 million, with David Speedie reluctantly moving to The Dell {{as part of the}} deal. Despite Branfoot's claim to be [...] "in the driving seat", Saints failed to include a [...] "sell-on clause" [...] in the contract. Shearer, less than a month off his 22nd birthday, was the most expensive player in British football. In his four years in the Southampton first team, Shearer made a total of 158 appearances in all competitions, scoring 43 goals.|$|E

Stewart also added: [...] "We always knew that the records we created were special [...] {{at the time it was}} more contractual obligation , I can only have so many songs produced by me on the album, and she honestly didn't need any more records, as you can tell by the success of this album, the songs have been flawless." [...] The producer later revealed one of the songs was titled [...] "Dressing Up", saying: [...] "This song is really special. It's called 'Dressing Up,' so it's going to be a big record, I think, it definitely fits. It's right there in what her sensibilities are as a musician and a songwriter. She doesn't change much. She has a very keen musical taste. It'll be really good".|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "This macabre musical {{about a young}} bridegroom who mistakenly weds a girl from beyond the grave is an endearingly schizoid Frankenstein of a movie, by turns relentlessly high-spirited and darkly poignant." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "A wondrous flight of fancy, a stop-motion-animated treat brimming with imaginative characters, evocative sets, sly humor, inspired songs and a genuine whimsy that seldom finds its way into today's movies." [...] Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The variety of its cadaverous style is never less than inspired; never has the human skull's natural grin been redeployed so exhaustively for yuks." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying [...] "As an achievement in macabre visual wizardry, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride has to be reckoned some sort of marvel." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "Cinema's reinvigorated fixation with the living dead suggests that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grip of an impossible longing, or perhaps it's just another movie cycle running its course. Whatever the case, there is something heartening about Mr. Burton's love for bones and rot here, if only because it suggests, despite some recent evidence, that he is not yet ready to abandon his own dark kingdom." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Corpse Bride sing, ultimately, is the breadth of imagination that it demonstrates; creating a cluttered, textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we're loathe to leave at the end." ...|$|E
