5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed. Historically however, {{there have also been}} examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a <b>weather-resistant</b> undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of a tropical storm, warnings were issued for the Cayman Islands, the northwestern and central Bahamas, and the Cuban provinces of Matanzas, Cienfuegos, Villa Clara, Sancti Spíritus, and Ciego de Ávila on September28. However, the warnings were discontinued the following day after reports of the storm's prompt dissipation. After forecasters warned of severe weather across the Cayman Islands, schools and government offices closed in low-lying areas, and emergency teams cleaned out storm drains and readied shelters. Thunderstorms in Grand Cayman forced Cayman Airways to cancel all express flights to Cayman Brac and Little Cayman on October29; <b>weather-resistant</b> jet service was provided to stranded passengers. A marine warning was required for all three islands due to rough sea conditions.|$|E

25|$|The coat must be {{stripped}} by hand or a non-cutting knife {{to retain its}} <b>weather-resistant</b> qualities. This does not hurt the dog when done properly. Keeping the skin above the stripped section taut {{with the other hand}} helps especially where the skin is looser, i.e. belly and chest. Never cut the coat – use your fingers or a non-cutting knife. If the coat is clipped, it loses colour and becomes softer, thus losing its <b>weather-resistant</b> characteristics. For the same reason the coat should not be washed too often, as detergents take away the natural skin oils. Most Irish terriers only need washing when dirty.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s and 1960s all the {{vehicles}} were upgraded. The carriages {{were converted to}} closed-body design and the locomotives had their wooden shutters and doors replaced with more <b>weather-resistant</b> metal ones. The livery at this point was changed to a more typical Welsh livery, the carriages being cream and crimson and the locomotives pea-green and red.|$|E
25|$|In 1967, Saint Phalle {{began working}} with {{polyester}} resin, a material which could be shaped easily, but would transform into a hard, smooth, <b>weather-resistant</b> surface. This new technology enabled her to construct enormous, fantastical figures for display outdoors in public spaces and parks. The material is reasonably durable outdoors (similar materials are used for boats and car bodies), though decades of weather exposure would eventually cause deterioration, requiring art conservation measures.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} outdoor {{track is}} {{in the shape of}} a stadium, 400 metres in length, and has at least eight lanes 1.22m in width (small arenas might have six lanes). Older track facilities may have nonstandard track lengths, such as 440 yards (402.3m; 1/4 mile) (common in the United States). Historically, tracks were covered by a dirt running surface. Modern All-weather running tracks are covered by a synthetic <b>weather-resistant</b> running surface, which typically consists of rubber (either black SBR or colored EPDM granules), bound by polyurethane or latex resins. Older tracks may be cinder-covered.|$|E
500|$|The Clumber Spaniel is {{the largest}} of the spaniels, and is long and heavy-bodied, {{standing}} only [...] in height but weighing from [...] It is similar in shape to the smaller Sussex Spaniel. The Clumber has a heavy bone structure, has a massive 'melting' head with a mournful and dopey expression, a square nose and muzzle, and large vine-leaf shaped ears. Freckles on the muzzle and front legs are common. Its coat is dense, <b>weather-resistant,</b> straight, and flat with feathering around the ears, belly and legs. Clumbers are predominantly white in colour with lemon, brown, or orange markings around the eyes, and {{at the base of the}} tail.|$|E
500|$|The Scottish Terrier is a small, compact, short-legged, sturdily-built terrier of good {{bone and}} substance. They have a hard, wiry, <b>weather-resistant</b> {{coat and a}} thick-set, cobby body which is hung between short, heavy legs. These characteristics, joined with his very special keen, piercing, [...] "varminty" [...] expression, and his erect ears and tail are salient {{features}} of the breed. The Scottish Terrier's bold, confident, dignified aspect exemplifies power in a small package. The eyes should be small, bright and piercing, and almond-shaped not round. The color should be dark brown or nearly black, the darker the better. The ears should be small, prick, set well up on the skull and pointed, but never cut. They should be covered with short velvety hair.|$|E
500|$|The {{transforming}} {{video screen}} {{was designed by}} Mark Fisher in a collaboration with Chuck Hoberman and Frederic Opsomer. The screen was fabricated by Opsomer's company Innovative Designs of Belgium, using LED pixels manufactured by Barco. The screen was purchased and rented to the tour by XL Video. It {{is made up of}} elongated hexagonal segments mounted on a multiple pantograph system, which enables it to [...] "open up" [...] or spread apart vertically as an effect during the concerts. The video screen is composed of over onemillion pieces: 411,000 pixels, 320,000 fasteners, 150,000 machined pieces, and 30,000 cables are needed to create the visual display at each concert. The screen is mounted on a cabled pulley system to enable the entire screen and pantograph system to move lower and closer to the band. The automation for the screen deployment was provided by Kinesys UK. The LED segments of the screen are <b>weather-resistant.</b>|$|E
500|$|Oil shales {{have been}} {{divided into three}} {{categories}} based on mineral composition [...] carbonate-rich shale, siliceous shale and cannel shale. Carbonate-rich shales derive their name from {{the large amount of}} carbonate minerals such as calcite and dolomite. As many as twenty carbonate minerals have been found in oil shale, the majority of which are considered authigenic or diagentic. Carbonate-rich oil shales, particularly that of lacustrine-sourced deposits, have usually the organic-rich layers sandwiched between carbonate-rich layers. These deposits are hard formations that are resistant to weathering and they are difficult to process using ex-situ methods. [...] Siliceous oil shales are usually dark brown or black shales. They are not rich in carbonates but rather in siliceous minerals such as quartz, feldspar, clay, chert and opal. Siliceous shales are not as hard and <b>weather-resistant</b> as carbonate-rich shales, and may be better suited for extraction via ex-situ methods. [...] Cannel shales are usually dark brown or black shales, which consist of organic matter that completely encloses other mineral grains. They are suitable for extraction via ex-situ methods.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Weather-resistant</b> (WR) {{receptacles}} {{are made}} of UV stabilized thermoplastic with high cold impact resistance to withstand the elements. [...] Required by the 2008 National Electrical Code in outdoor damp or wet locations, WR receptacles should be installed in patio, deck, and pool areas. [...] They are available {{in a variety of}} models including GFCI and tamper-resistant. [...] For added protection, WR receptacles should be protected by Extra-Duty While In-Use or <b>Weather-Resistant</b> Covers. [...] These covers are ruggedly constructed to seal out moisture (dripping or condensing), dust, debris, and insects, while providing easy access to receptacles to allow homeowners to use power tools, trimmers, sprinkler systems, and pumps with confidence and improved safety.|$|E
2500|$|The {{geological}} {{history of}} the Falkland Islands began during the Precambrian era more than 1000 million years ago, when Proterozoic granites and gneisses were laid down in Gondwana. [...] These rocks {{became part of the}} Cape Meredith/ formation and outcrop at the Cape. During the Siluro-Devonian era, these rocks were overlain with quartzose and subarkosic sandstones with some siltstone and mudstone, rocks that are particularly erosion- and <b>weather-resistant,</b> giving these parts of the islands a rugged landscape and coastline.|$|E
2500|$|The canopy {{is made of}} PTFE-coated {{glass fibre}} fabric, a durable and <b>weather-resistant</b> plastic, and is 52m high in the middle – one metre for each week of the year. [...] Its {{symmetry}} is interrupted by a hole through which a ventilation shaft from the Blackwall Tunnel rises. [...] As with all tent canopies, the roof has a finite weathering life; and once this is reached the decision {{will need to be}} made, either to replace it, at enormous cost, or to remove the entire structure.|$|E
2500|$|Like most drumheads, timpani heads can be {{made from}} two materials: animal skin (typically calfskin or goatskin) or plastic (typically PET film). Plastic heads are durable, <b>weather-resistant,</b> and {{relatively}} inexpensive. Thus, they are more commonly used than skin heads. However, many professional timpanists prefer skin heads because they produce a [...] "warmer" [...] timbre. Timpani heads are sized based {{on the size of the}} head, not the bowl. For example, a [...] drum may require a [...] head. This [...] size difference has been standardized by most timpani manufacturers since 1978.|$|E
2500|$|The new tower {{provided}} the durable <b>weather-resistant,</b> vibration-free environment necessary for accurate instrument readings. [...] The {{first floor of}} the tower contains the director's office. [...] The weather bureau is on the second floor and a laboratory and access to the roof are found on the third floor. [...] Various wind gauges and other meteorological recording instruments are attached to the roof of the tower. [...] The observatory still retains barometers and other instrumentation dating from the late 19th century. [...] These instruments are used to calibrate the modern instrumentation to preserve the accuracy and integrity of the data base dating back to 1885.|$|E
2500|$|A {{portable}} {{dance floor}} is typically about , {{and consists of}} many [...] panels to create the desired size. [...] There is trim edging around the border, allowing users to enter the floor safely. [...] The portable panels are constructed from either oak parquet, for indoor use, or honeycomb aluminum and laminate for indoor and outdoor use. Other [...] portable dance floors are made out of a polypropylene base with a commercial grade laminate top surface. These floors are extremely durable and often used in the event-planning, hospitality industries. [...] While older-style portable dance floors feature solid-wood construction, many portable dance floors use an interlocking system for a simple system to connect the pieces. High-quality, <b>weather-resistant,</b> portable dance floors are also engineered {{to be used for}} both indoor and outdoor applications.|$|E
2500|$|Facilities for milling lumber {{were almost}} non-existent: [...] workers used stone axes and crude saws {{to shape the}} wood, and often used logs which only had their bark {{stripped}} from them. These methods gave mission structures their distinctive appearance. [...] Timber was used to reinforce walls, as vigas (beams) to support roofs, and as forms for door and window openings and arches. Since most of the settlements were located in valleys or coastal plains almost totally devoid of suitably large trees, the padres were in most cases limited to pine, alder, poplar, cypress and juniper trees for use in their construction efforts. Indians used wooden carrettas, drawn by oxen, to haul timber from as much as forty miles away (as was the case at Mission San Miguel Arcángel). At Mission San Luis Rey, however, the ingenious Father Lasuén instructed his neophyte workers to float logs downriver from Palomar Mountain to the mission site. The lack of good-sized timber forced the men to design mission buildings that were long and narrow. For example, the widest inside dimensions {{of any of the}} mission buildings (at San Carlos, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz) is : the narrowest, at Mission Soledad, spans [...] The longest structure, at Mission Santa Barbara, stretches [...] Stone (piedra) was used as a construction material whenever possible. [...] In the absence of skilled stonemasons, the inexperienced builders resorted to the use of sandstone; though easier to cut, it was as not <b>weather-resistant</b> as that which would have been used by skilled artisans. To bind the stones together, the priests and Indians followed the (Mexican) Pre-Columbian technique of using mud mortar, since mortar made from lime was unavailable to them. Colored stones and pebbles were added to the mud mixture, giving it [...] "a beautiful and interesting texture." ...|$|E
