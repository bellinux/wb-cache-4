It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And then {{it just kind of}} got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was like, I have to say something. I need to say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and you guys have to help me {{figure out how to do}} that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival.
