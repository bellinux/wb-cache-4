40|$|A new {{finite element}} assembly, {{to account for}} the {{structural}} behaviour of the region surrounding a spot weld, is developed. The formulation derives from the analytic solution of two circular sheets externally clamped, with a central rigid core connecting them (representing the spot weld). The effective modelling strategy of the above mentioned region makes use of equivalent beam elements; therefore, the implementation is possible in any structural code. The aim is to use this assembled element for the region around the spot: two assembled elements, connected by a link, form the spot <b>weld</b> <b>connection</b> between two metal sheets. The analytic solution is provided for any possible typology of loading acting on a spot weld (shear, bending and orthogonal loads). Moreover, the link connecting the two sub elements may be considered rigid as well as deformable, this can be very useful to evaluate fatigue damage evolution in structures jointed with many spot welds. Using these assembled elements for the spot weld region, an important increase in the accuracy is reached, as demonstrated in the example.

40|$|Fatigue is an {{important}} failure mode for large suspension bridges under traffic loadings. However, large suspension bridges have so many attributes {{that it is difficult}} to analyze their fatigue damage using experimental measurement methods. Numerical simulation is a feasible method of studying such fatigue damage. In British standards, the finite element method is recommended as a rigorous method for steel bridge fatigue analysis. This paper aims at developing a finite element (FE) model of a large suspension steel bridge for fatigue stress analysis. As a case study, a FE model of the Tsing Ma Bridge is presented. The verification of the model is carried out with the help of the measured bridge modal characteristics and the online data measured by the structural health monitoring system installed on the bridge. The results show that the constructed FE model is efficient for bridge dynamic analysis. Global structural analyses using the developed FE model are presented to determine the components of the nominal stress generated by railway loadings and some typical highway loadings. The critical locations in the bridge main span are also identified with the numerical results of the global FE stress analysis. Local stress analysis of a typical <b>weld</b> <b>connection</b> is carried out to obtain the hot-spot stresses in the region.

40|$|Butt <b>weld</b> <b>connection</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used connection types in steel structures, and its post-fire mechanical property is crucial for the estimation of the residual mechanical capacity of steel structures after building fires. To study the mechanical properties of butt weld connections after being exposed to high temperatures, Q 235 and Q 345 butt weld specimens were designed, heated to various high temperatures between 400 °C and 800 °C, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Tensile tests were conducted on these butt weld specimens to obtain the force–displacement curves and relevant mechanical properties (yield and ultimate strengths) at various temperatures. The following conclusions were obtained from the test results: (1) The post-fire mechanical properties of the butt weld specimens were affected by material grade and heating temperature; (2) when the temperature exceeded 600 °C, the yield and ultimate strengths of the Q 235 and Q 345 butt weld specimens began to decrease; the strength reduction of the latter was greater than that of the former; (3) when the temperature was 800 °C, the yield strength and ultimate strength of Q 235 decreased to 87 % and 91 % of the ambient-temperature yield and ultimate strengths, respectively; and (4) the yield and ultimate strengths of Q 345 decreased to 83 % and 87 % of those at room temperature.

40|$|AbstractCoke drums undergo cyclic thermal and {{mechanical}} loading during operation, {{which tend to}} cause damage like bulging and cracking near circumferential welds in coke drums. In this paper, considering {{the existence of the}} overmatch welds and uneven temperature field during oil-feeding and water quenching as well as quenching conditions, the bulging behavior of the coke drum is investigated. Firstly, the uniaxial tension and ratchetting experiments of parent metal and weld of coke drum are carried out at 20 oC, 200 oC, 300 oC, and 400 oC. Secondly, the ratchetting strains are predicted by OW-II kinematic hardening model and the predicted ratchetting strain rates of steady stage are in qualitative agreement with the experimental results. By comparison, weld has significantly smaller ratchetting strain rate than parent metal under the same loading conditions, which shows that the anti-ratchetting ability of weld is better than that of parent metal. Thirdly, the transient temperature field during oil-feeding and water quenching are numerically simulated with the help of dynamic coordinate system method, which yields the axial temperature difference and its characteristic value for the simplified characteristic load {{to be used in the}} cyclic plastic analysis of coke drum cycled between oil-feeding and water quenching. Fourthly, the ratchet boundaries are determined under moving axial temperature gradient by cyclic plasticity analysis for the parent metal. It is found that, when temperature difference range of water quenching is smaller, the ratchet boundaries are heavily influenced by the cyclic internal pressure. Finally, considering the strength differences between parent metal and weld, cyclic plasticity analysis is done for the circumferential <b>weld</b> <b>connection</b> region of coke drum. The results indicate that the bulging is preferentially near and about 10 mm above the weld under given loading conditions. It is also observed that, for cylinder with or without the circumferential weld, the co-existence of cyclic internal pressure can increase the ratchetting strain of the structure and the ratchetting strain rate of structure also increases with the cyclic internal pressure range...|$|E

40|$|Highway sign {{structures}} {{are widely used}} {{in the state of}} Indiana as well as many other states in the US. Due to their high flexibility, wind loading on these sign structures occasionally produces significant stress cycles associated with fatigue damage. Cracking caused by fatigue damage may occur at several critical spots on the sign structures. Cracks in sign structures have been observed {{in a number of states}} and several sign structure failures have been reported. ^ Analytical research was performed to evaluate the fatigue lives of the critical details in sign structures, including double-mastarm cantilever sign structures, box-truss sign structures, monotube sign structures, tri-chord sign structures, and single-mastarm cantilever sign structures. Finite element models of the sign structures were developed based on selected prototype sign structures installed in Indiana. Natural wind gusts was chosen to be the most critical source of load causing fatigue damage on the investigated sign structure types, except for the single-mastarm cantilever sign structure. The wind speed distributions for six locations in Indiana were determined, and a wind load simulation procedure was developed to generate wind load time histories. Dynamic analyses were performed with the generated wind load applied on the finite element models to obtain the stress time histories at several structural details. A fatigue analysis procedure was defined to predict the fatigue lives based on the stress time history results. ^ According to the analytical results, the double-mastarm cantilever sign structure was found to be the most fatigue-susceptible sign structure, excluding the single-mastarm cantilever sign structure, and the post-to-base plate socket <b>weld</b> <b>connection</b> was the most critical structural detail. It was also found that variations in the fatigue life occurred due to differences in the wind environment at various sites. ^ The method, the frequency, the personnel qualification, and the procedures for sign structure inspection were proposed based on a literature search and communication with inspection engineers. Guidelines for component inspection of sign structures were recommended. Suggestions for future research were presented. ...|$|E

DNV-RP-C 203 is one typical guideline, which is well used among engineers in oil and gas sector in Norway. The guideline describes the overall and detail design methodology of fatigue design of offshore steel structure. For fatigue analysis of tubular joints, the guideline covers methodology to determine stress concentration factors, hot spot stresses and finally the fatigue life.

For simple uniplanar joint and geometry, where joint classification is available and the limited non-dimensional geometrical parameter in range, the finite element analysis is unpopular to utilize due to the unnecessary time consumption and cost, which is not favourable according to the aspect of business.

The purpose of this thesis is to compare the fatigue life of tubular joint in offshore jacket according to the SCFs in DNV-RP-C 203 and Abaqus/CAE, with basis on time history analysis carried out in previous master thesis [1] of defined jacket structure in case study [2].

The experimental results of specimens from actual sign structures show that the GFRP repaired connection achieved 1. 17 to 1. 25 times the capacity of the uncracked aluminum <b>welded</b> <b>connection.</b> These results, along with the minimal traffic disruption anticipated in the application, make this repair method a good candidate for implementation...|$|R

40|$|Precast {{concrete}} bridge deck panels {{have been used}} for decades to accelerate bridge construction. Cracking of the transverse connection between panels is a common problem that can damage deck overlays and cause connection leaking leading to corrosion of lower bridge elements. To better understand the behavior of bridge deck transverse female-to-female connections, shear and moment lab testing were performed at Utah State University for the Utah Department of Transportation. Two existing UDOT connections were tested, a <b>welded</b> stud <b>connection</b> and a post tensioned connection. A variation of the <b>welded</b> <b>connection</b> using rebar was also tested. In addition, two new curved bolt connections were tested as a new method of post tensioning a connection. The manner of connection cracking and associated cracking loads were recorded along with the ultimate connection capacities. The connections were also tested in a low cycle, high amplitude cyclical shear test. Lab testing showed that the <b>welded</b> stud <b>connection</b> had the lowest moment capacity. It also showed that the <b>welded</b> rebar <b>connection</b> had significantly higher strength than the <b>welded</b> stud <b>connection</b> with higher cracking and ultimate loads. Curved bolts were also shown to {{be a good way to}} post tension a connection with similar moment capacities as the post tensioned connection. Longer curved bolts were found to perform better than shorter curved bolts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The stress {{concentration}} factors (SCFs) in <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> usually occur at zones with high stress levels. Stress concentrations reduce the fatigue behavior of <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> in offshore structures and cracking can develop. By using the grinding technique, cracking can be eliminated. Stress concentration factors {{are defined as}} a ratio of maximum stress at the intersection to nominal stress on the brace. Defining the {{stress concentration}} factor is an important stage in the fatigue behavior of <b>welded</b> <b>connections.</b> Several approaches have evolved for designing structures with the classical S-N approach for estimating total life. This work correlates to the stress concentration factors of T-welded connections and the fatigue behavior. Stress concentration factors were computed with the finite element employing 3 D T-welded connections with intact and grinding depth conditions. Then, T-welded connections were constructed with A 36 plate steel and welded with E 6013 electrodes to obtain the stress-life (S-N) approach. The methodology from previous works was used to compute the SCF and fabricate the T-welded connections. The {{results indicated that the}} grinding process could restore the fatigue life of the T-welded connections for SCFs values in the range of 1. 29. This value can be considered to be a low SCF value in T-welded connection. However, for higher SCF values, the fatigue life decreased, compromising and reducing the structural integrity of the T-welded connections...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a refined analysis for evaluating low-cycle fatigue crack initiation life of <b>welded</b> beam-to-column <b>connections</b> of steel frame structures under strong earthquake excitation. To consider different length scales between typical beam and column components {{as well as}} a few crucial beam-to-column <b>welded</b> <b>connections,</b> a multiscale finite element (FE) model having three different length scales is formulated. The model can accurately analyze the inelastic seismic response of a steel frame and then obtain in detail elastoplastic stress and strain field near the welded zone of the connections. It is found that the welded zone is subjected to multiaxial nonproportional loading during strong ground motion and the elastoplastic stress-strain field of the welded zone is three-dimensional. Then, using the correlation of the Fatemi-Socie (FS) parameter versus fatigue life obtained by the experimental crack initiation fatigue data of the structural steel weldment subjected to multiaxial loading, the refined evaluation approach of fatigue crack initiation life is developed based on the equivalent plastic strain at fatigue critical position of beam end seams of crucial <b>welded</b> <b>connections</b> when the steel frame is subjected to the strong earthquake excitation...|$|R
