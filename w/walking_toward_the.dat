25|$|Landrith made {{immediate}} headlines when he {{was involved}} in a scuffle against the New York Yankees on June 11. Rookie Oriole outfielder Boog Powell was hospitalized after Yankees pitcher Bud Daley beaned Powell {{in the head with a}} pitch in the top of the 4th. In the bottom of the 4th, Baltimore pitcher Robin Roberts immediately threw a fastball over the head of Yankees star Roger Maris. Maris started <b>walking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> mound, bat in hand. Roberts was afraid that if things got physical he would break his hand. Landrith jumped on Maris' back, clearing the benches. No punches were thrown in the incident, nor were any suspensions or fines levied by American League president Joe Cronin. The Orioles won 5-3.|$|E
25|$|Three 11-year-old boys rode {{their bikes}} {{into the west}} parking lot to {{purchase}} soft drinks. Hearing {{a member of the}} public yell something unintelligible from across the street, all three hesitated, before Huberty shot the three boys with his shotgun and Uzi. Joshua Coleman fell to the ground critically wounded in the back, arm, and leg; he later recalled looking toward his two friends, Omarr Alonso Hernandez and David Flores Delgado, noting that Hernandez was on the ground with multiple gunshot wounds to his back and had started vomiting; Delgado had received several gunshot wounds to his head. Coleman survived; Hernandez and Delgado both died at the scene. Huberty next noticed an elderly couple, Miguel Victoria Ulloa (74) and Aida Velazquez Victoria (69), <b>walking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> entrance. As Miguel reached to open the door for his wife, Huberty fired his shotgun, killing Aida with a gunshot to the face and wounding Miguel. An uninjured survivor, Oscar Mondragon, later reported that he had seen Miguel cradling his wife in his arms and wiping blood from her face. Miguel shouted curses at Huberty, who approached and killed him with a shot to the head.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Change" [...] {{was directed by}} Shawn Robbins. It was filmed at the ballroom in the Scottish Rite Cathedral in Indianapolis, Indiana. The video commences with a shot of a stained glass window. It then transitions to Swift, clothed by a white cocktail dress and black cowboy boots, performing alongside a backup band in an empty ballroom. The band members dressed semi-casual and played the instruments bass, drums, and various guitars. As the video progresses, Swift is seeing singing and dancing. Cut-scenes feature close-ups of Swift in another setting, clothed by another white cocktail dress and surrounded by hot pink, white, and blue twinkling lights in a black background. The video concludes with Swift turning back and <b>walking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> backup band. An alternate version of the video features footage from United States Olympic team at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Both versions of the music video premiered on NBC.com in August 2008. To date, the video has over 41 million views on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|Two years later, on the 20th {{anniversary of}} Jurassic Park, a 3D {{version of the}} film was {{released}} in cinemas. Spielberg declared that he had produced the film {{with a sort of}} [...] "subconscious 3D", as scenes feature animals <b>walking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cameras and some effects of foreground and background overlay. In 2011, he stated in an interview that Jurassic Park was the only of his works he had considered for a conversion, and once he saw the 3D version of Titanic in 2012, he liked the new look of the film so much that he hired the same retrofitting company, Stereo D. Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kamiński supervised the nine-month process closely in-between the production of Lincoln. Stereo D executive Aaron Parry declared that the conversion was an evolution of what the company had done with Titanic, [...] "being able to capitalize on everything we learned with Jim on Titanic and take it into a different genre and movie, and one with so many technical achievements." [...] The studio had the help of ILM, which contributed some elements and updated effects shots for a better visual enhancement. It opened in the United States and seven other territories on April 5, 2013, with other countries receiving the re-release in the following six months.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{members of}} the {{audience}} reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramović described it later: [...] "What I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started <b>walking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 1, 1974, two Salvation Army cadets were <b>walking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Mayfair Market {{just two}} blocks away from the Salvation Army School for Officers' Training Center when {{a black man who}} was {{following}} them overtook them, wheeled around, fired four shots at them, and fled. Thomas Rainwater, 19, died; Linda Story, 21, survived. Two policemen were on the scene within 15 seconds, and although a manhunt was initiated in an effort to find the killer, it proved to be futile. They suspected that the Zebra killers had struck again, as the shell casings found on the sidewalk were found to be from a [...]32-caliber gun.|$|E

2500|$|On May 15, Frank Paroubek {{told police}} he had spoken to a man {{he did not know}} who told him he had seen Elsie late in the {{afternoon}} of April 8 on Kedzie Avenue, south of 28th St., long after she {{was supposed to have been}} taken by the [...] "gypsies." [...] Lt. Costello assigned detectives to find the man. The previous reported sighting of Elsie had her <b>walking</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> canal on South Troy St., a half block south of her aunt's house. If the unknown man told the truth, Elsie was only three blocks away from a bridge. Despite the coroner's findings, Lt. Costello had become convinced that Elsie's death was an accident and that she had simply fallen into the canal, although Inspector Healey had had the canals and drainage ditches dragged repeatedly during the search. Coroner Hoffman continued to insist Elsie was murdered. Apparently some confusion had occurred during the initial examinations. The first physician (probably Dr. Kingston) to examine Elsie on the night of May 9 told Lt. Costello that she had drowned, with no marks of abuse, and Costello had repeated this when he spoke to the family. However, the following day, the same physician's autopsy findings concluded Elsie had not drowned and that she appeared to have been suffocated.|$|E
