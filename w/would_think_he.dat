5|$|But if {{you were}} here, my father, you'd tell me to stand by my job and not to desert Mr. McClure in this crisis. It would mean such a serious loss to him in money and {{influence}} {{not to have the}} March article come out—Everyone <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was beaten and scared out, for the articles are under such a glare of publicity and such a fire of criticism. I {{had nothing to do with}} the January article remember, my work begins to appear in February. Mr. McClure is ill from worry and anxiety...|$|E
500|$|The writer Rupert Gould, in {{a lengthy}} essay on New South Greenland [...] {{published}} in 1929, queries {{the assumption that the}} [...] sighting was simply invented by Morrell, partly on the grounds that very little weight is given to the discovery in Morrell's 500-page account. Gould writes: [...] "If Morrell wished to gain an undeserved reputation as an Antarctic explorer, one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> could have gone a better way about it than to bury his pièces justificatives, after he had forged them, in an undistinguished [...] corner of so bulky a book." [...] Nor would he have credited it to Captain Johnson two years earlier, rather than to himself.|$|E
500|$|In the November 1902 {{issue of}} the {{literary}} magazine The Bookman Herriman wrote of his profession self-deprecatingly, while poet La Touche Hancock, {{in an article in}} that issue titled [...] "The American Comic and Caricature Art", wrote, [...] "Art and poetry is the characteristic of George Herriman. [...] Were his drawings not so well known one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had mistaken his vocation." [...] Herriman's work was increasing in popularity, and he occasionally had front-page, full-color strips for the Pulitzer supplements, such as Two Jolly Jackies about two unemployed sailors, which began in January 1903. [...] He began drawing the cowboy strip Lariat Pete in September for the McClure syndicate after Two Jolly Jackies was ended.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Mr. Pilgrim, 'he {{can hardly}} stand it much longer {{at the rate}} he's going on, one <b>would</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He's</b> been confoundedly cut up about that {{business}} of Armstrong's, I fancy. It may do him some harm, perhaps, but Dempster must have feathered his nest pretty well; he can afford to lose a little business.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's queer {{he should}} show himself {{so close to}} Crumville. One <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> want to put all the {{distance}} possible between himself and your folks." ...|$|R

500|$|Several {{people were}} interviewed for the part, {{including}} Tom Jones, Robert Goulet, and Jerry Vale. Meanwhile, Behr {{and a friend}} attended a memorabilia show at the Beverly Garland Hotel in North Hollywood, where James Darren was signing autographs. Darren had not wanted to attend the event, but had been convinced otherwise. Behr thought he was so charming {{that he wanted to}} talk to him about the role on the spot, but his friend talked him out of it as he felt that Darren <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was insane. Surma got in touch with Darren at Behr's prompting. Darren initially rejected the role, having heard that the part was a singer. Darren's agent went back to him three times and eventually convinced him to read the script, which is when he fell in love with the character. He later called it a [...] "dream come true".|$|E
2500|$|At a later {{point in}} the season, Lisa Todorovich of Zap2it chastised Naomi for being [...] "all about herself" [...] while failing to support Liam during a series of troubles. While {{acknowledging}} Naomi's faults, which eventually lead to a break-up with Liam, Krista Navin of MassLive.com stated that [...] "it is totally consistent with her character that she would {{want to try to}} be there for Liam, but just be too into her own drama to really be able to be. Also, I think it makes sense that someone like Liam <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would want to be with someone like Naomi, and then be pretty disillusioned by the reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both in {{his works}} and direct overtures to the press, Friedrich Christian gave {{detailed}} accounts {{of his time}} in the Nazi party. In 1963 for instance, he claimed that Hitler refused to shave his famous mustache because people <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "sick". He said his wife Alexandra commented to Hitler that [...] "his haircut and little mustache were always openings for cartoonists", but that Hitler replied [...] "one shouldn't change a company's trademark, even if one doesn't like it any longer. The public has become so used to it over the years that it would rebel if he suddenly looked completely different." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He is {{not happy}} in his work. There is {{something}} wanting in his scheme of life. I have built a ladder for him to climb. I have given him the chance of becoming the greatest statesman of to-day. One <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> had some other ambition." ...|$|R
60|$|Bessie. Leave that to me. Of course all his fancies are not mad. They aren't. (Pause.) Most {{people in}} this town <b>would</b> <b>think</b> what <b>he</b> had set his mind on quite sensible. If he ever talks to you of it, don't {{contradict}} him. It would--it would be dangerous.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the artists}} {{attending}} those meetings was painter John Opper, who {{said in an interview}} that Swinden was very quiet, shy, and inhibited. He also said that Swinden was one of the best painters in the group. [...] "His paintings were very powerful, very strong. You <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would be one of those robust persons like Gorky, for instance. But he was the opposite of Gorky. He was very withdrawn." [...] Around this time, Swinden may have painted abstracts exclusively. But later, according to Irving Sandler, [...] "it was sort of a mixture between figurative and geometric abstraction. It was a kind of hard-edge figure towards the end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{responded to}} the {{complaints}} by dispatching Gen. Joseph E. Johnston to investigate {{the condition of the}} army. Davis assumed that Johnston, Bragg's superior, would find the situation wanting and take command of the army in the field, easing Bragg aside. However, Johnston arrived on the scene and found the men of the Army of Tennessee in relatively good condition. He told Bragg that he had [...] "the best organized, armed, equipped, and disciplined army in the Confederacy." [...] Johnston explicitly refused any suggestion that he take command, concerned that people <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had taken advantage of the situation for his own personal gain. When Davis ordered Johnston to send Bragg to Richmond, Johnston delayed because of Elise Bragg's illness; when her health improved Johnston was unable to assume command because of lingering medical problems from his wound at the Battle of Seven Pines in 1862.|$|E
2500|$|Bragg's {{subordinate}} generals {{were nearly}} mutinous in expressing their dissatisfaction with Bragg's command during his Kentucky campaign (Battle of Perryville) and Stones River. Confederate President Jefferson Davis {{responded to the}} complaints by dispatching Gen. Joseph E. Johnston to investigate {{the condition of the}} army. Davis assumed that Johnston, Bragg's superior, would find the situation wanting and take command of the army in the field, easing Bragg aside.

6000|$|... "Hilyer {{is simply}} mad," [...] said the Curate. He {{got up and}} went padding round the room to the door to put out his boots. [...] "To judge by his manner you <b>would</b> really <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{believed}} this cripple was an Angel." [...] ("Are your shoes out, dear?") ...|$|R
2500|$|Chris friend, John Garza {{moved in}} with him six months after Selena's death. They began writing music, which Chris found healing. In 1998 he formed a rock band with Garza, Rudy Martinez (former member of La Mafia) on bass, former Selena y Los Dinos keyboardist Joe Ojeda and Jesse Esquivel on drums. The band's name (the Chris Pérez Band) was chosen by Garza, Martinez, Ojeda and Esquivel. Chris {{preferred}} the name Cinco Souls, but the other band members wanted to utilize his [...] "reluctant celebrity." [...] The band was signed to Hollywood Records, and went to A Studios (now Henson Studios) in Los Angeles to begin recording their debut album. Chris wrote the song [...] "Best I Can" [...] to explore his feelings about losing Selena and his struggle to continue without her. The song was not planned for the album, for fear that listeners <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> included the track for commercial reasons, but Hollywood Records and the band convinced him to [...] include it on the album after hearing the demo.|$|E

500|$|Peirce {{initially}} {{wanted to}} shoot in Falls City, but Vachon {{told her that}} filming {{there would not be}} possible. Afterwards, the film was going to be shot in Omaha, Nebraska, but Peirce felt that [...] "none of [...] looked right." [...] In addition, Peirce also scouted filming locations in Kansas and Florida before deciding on Texas. [...] One of Peirce's main goals was for the audience to sympathize with Brandon. On the film's DVD commentary track, Peirce said, [...] "The work was informing me about how I wanted to represent it. I wanted the audience to enter deeply into this place, this character, so they could entertain these contradictions in Brandon's own mind and <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was crazy, <b>would</b> not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was lying, but would see him as more deeply human".|$|R
30|$|As Sam said, Amichai’s {{piece is}} {{intimate}} … I <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> is {{troubled by the}} uncertainty of the future, yet the quote from [the book of] Daniel is the disturbing element. It leaves little uncertainty as {{it seems to be a}} sure prediction of more anguish to come (Daniel).|$|R
50|$|Long-term {{interactivity}} includes {{action that}} affects the pet's growth, behavior or life span. For example, training a pet may have a good effect on the pet's behavior. Long-term interactivity is quite important {{for a sense of}} reality as the user <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> has some lasting influence on the pet.|$|R
6000|$|... "To hear Nat Poole {{talk you}} <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{had won the}} game already," [...] said Roger, to the others on Dave's seven. [...] "He makes me sick!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Blanche! Blanche!" [...] cried Sir Patrick, [...] "one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{had gone}} for a voyage round the world. You silly child! he will be back again the day after to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a head he has got," [...] {{said the}} irritated Susan; [...] "isn’t it {{wonderful}} how {{he thinks of}} it all! Nobody <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was so clever to look at him." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{several days}} I {{could not look}} upon the dignified and almost courtly Mr. Dusante without {{laughing}} internally and wondering what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> if <b>he</b> knew how, without the slightest provocation on his side, a matrimonial connection with him had been discussed by these good women, and how the matter had been finally settled. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have considered this the most surprising incident in the whole series of his adventures.|$|R
60|$|Pontiac said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> it over. <b>He</b> {{felt certain}} that Bevoir and Valette {{were up to}} some foul deed, and was half {{inclined}} to send them from the village.|$|R
50|$|The next day, Nakazato {{arrives at}} a gas station where he {{encounters}} Itsuki Takeuchi, who accidentally accepts Nakazato's challenge as he drives off. However, Takumi later refuses to accept because he is not a racer despite being persuaded by Itsuki. Meanwhile, Yuichi Tachibana overhears the situation and tells the Akina Speedstars why Takumi refuses to race. He referenced to Takumi how good Nakazato is and that no one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a coward if he refuses. Later, Takumi changes his mind, but when he arrives home, he is shocked to discover that his father, Bunta, had already taken the Eight-Six with him. Takumi waits desperately, and realizes how much of a racer he already is.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can never}} {{get used to the}} way you mention the--the--that name," [...] complained Felicity. [...] "To hear you speak of the Old Scratch any one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was just a common person." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good gracious! Hans {{wants to}} go in for tragedy!" [...] ejaculated Tom. [...] "Who <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was so bloodthirsty. If you keep on like that, Hansy, dear, I'll be afraid you'll murder us in our sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “A most {{extraordinary}} man, a Mr. Nuttel,” said Mrs. Sappleton; “could only {{talk about his}} illnesses, and dashed off without a word of good-bye or apology when you arrived. One <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had seen a ghost.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But no braver {{than the}} German we brought with us," [...] replied Maud thoughtfully. [...] "One <b>would</b> almost <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had no sensation, yet {{he must be}} {{suffering}} terribly. The doctor will amputate the remnants of his foot {{in an hour or}} so, but the man positively refuses to take an anaesthetic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{will not}} seek, father, {{because they think}} that she is dead, and will never know {{otherwise}} unless that white man tells them, which he will scarcely do, as the Zulus <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> shot the soldier, not I. She has been sent to us, and it is our duty to keep her." ...|$|R
