40|$|The maximally {{localized}} <b>Wannier</b> <b>functions</b> play a {{very important}} role in the study of chemical bonding, ballistic transport and strongly-correlated system, etc. A significant development in this branch was made in 1997 and conjectured that the maximally localized <b>Wannier</b> <b>functions</b> are real. In this paper, we prove the conjecture. A key to this proof is that the real parts of complex <b>Wannier</b> <b>functions</b> equal to the algebraic average of two real <b>Wannier</b> <b>functions</b> and the spread functional of one of the two real <b>Wannier</b> <b>functions</b> is less than one of complex <b>Wannier</b> <b>functions.</b> If one starts with initial real <b>Wannier</b> <b>functions,</b> the gradients of spread functional to get the maximally localized <b>Wannier</b> <b>functions</b> are only calculated in half of Brillouin zone and more localized <b>Wannier</b> <b>functions</b> are obtained.

40|$|Starting from {{a single}} band Hubbard model in the <b>Wannier</b> <b>function</b> basis, we revisit {{the problem of the}} ligand {{contribution}} to exchange and derive explicit formulae for the exchange integrals in metal oxide compounds in terms of atomic parameters that can be calculated with constrained LDA and LDA+U. The analysis is applied to the investigation of the isotropic exchange interactions of LiCu_ 2 O_ 2, a compound where the Cu-O-Cu angle of the dominant exchange path is close to 90 ^∘. Our results show that the magnetic moments are localized in Wannier orbitals which have strong contribution from oxygen atomic orbitals, leading to exchange integrals that considerably differ from the estimates based on kinetic exchange only. Using LSDA+U approach, we also perform a direct ab-initio determination of the exchange integrals LiCu_ 2 O_ 2. The results agree well with those obtained from the <b>Wannier</b> <b>function</b> approach, a clear indication that this modelization captures the essential physics of exchange. A comparison with experimental results is also included, with the conclusion that a very precise determination of the <b>Wannier</b> <b>function</b> is crucial to reach quantitative estimates.

40|$|BaBiO 3 is a {{material}} where Bi 4 + ions with half-filled 6 s-states form an alternating set of Bi 3 + and Bi 5 + ions {{resulting in a}} charge ordered insulator. The charge ordering is accompanied by breathing distortion of the BiO 6 octahedra (extension and contraction of the Bi-O bond lengths). Standard density functional theory (DFT) calculations fail to obtain the crystal structure instability caused by the pure breathing distortions. Combining effects of the breathing distortions and tilting of the BiO 6 octahedra allows DFT to reproduce qualitatively an experimentally observed insulator with monoclinic crystal structure but strongly underestimates the breathing distortion parameter and energy gap values. In the present work we reexamine the BaBiO 3 problem within the GGA+U method using a <b>Wannier</b> <b>function</b> basis set for the Bi 6 s-band. Due to the high oxidation state of bismuth in this material, the Bi 6 s-symmetry <b>Wannier</b> <b>function</b> is predominantly extended spatially on surrounding oxygen ions and hence differs strongly from a pure atomic 6 s-orbital. That is {{in sharp contrast to}} transition metal oxides (with exclusion of high oxidation state compounds) where the major part of the d-band <b>Wannier</b> <b>function</b> is concentrated on the metal ion and a pure atomic d-orbital can serve as a good approximation. The GGA+U calculation results agree well with experimental data, in particular with experimental crystal structure parameters and energy gap values.
