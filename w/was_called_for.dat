5|$|In January 2010, Singh <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> an {{audition}} by Shanoo Sharma, {{the head of}} the casting division for Yash Raj Films. They informed him that it was for a lead role in their film titled Band Baaja Baaraat, a romantic comedy set in the world of wedding planning. Aditya Chopra, {{the vice president of the}} company, later saw the audition tapes on video and was impressed by Singh's acting, and decided that he fit the part of Bittoo Sharma, the hero of the film. However, the director Maneesh Sharma needed some more convincing and he <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a few more auditions over the next two weeks until they were completely convinced of his caliber. After the two weeks of testing, Singh was confirmed for the role of Bittoo, with Anushka Sharma playing the female lead.|$|E
5|$|Team Canada took {{a number}} of {{questionable}} early penalties. With two Canadians (White and Peter Mahovlich) off, Yakushev scored to give the Soviets the lead 1–0. The game was delayed after a mistaken call against J. P. Parise, (he <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> interference, but Parise admitted later he was guilty of cross-checking) and emotions boiled over. Parise <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a misconduct for banging his stick on the ice, {{and when he saw}} the misconduct called, he dashed across the ice with his stick raised. Parise nearly swung his stick at Kompalla and got a match penalty. Sinden threw a chair on the ice. Some writers have commented that the incidents resulted {{in the rest of the}} game being refereed capably.|$|E
5|$|A special {{election}} <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> May 16, 1978 in the 46th Ward when Alderman Chris Cohen, first elected in 1971, was re-elected in 1975 but retired in mid-term {{to head the}} Chicago regional office of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. On March 6, 1978 Ralph Axelrod, chief administrative assistant to Cook County Sheriff Richard Elrod, and ward committeeman since 1973, slated himself for alderman.|$|E
25|$|In some Conservative synagogues, {{women who}} are B'not Kohen (daughter of a Kohen) or B'not Levi (daughter of a Levite) can <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> {{the first or second}} aliyot. In Israel and some congregations in North America, only men are {{permitted}} to <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the Kohen and Levite aliyot even if women can <b>be</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the other aliyot.|$|R

5|$|After Britain {{declared}} war on Germany in September 1939, Auden told the British embassy in Washington that {{he would return to}} the UK if needed. He was told that, among those his age (32), only qualified personnel were needed. In 1941–42 he taught English at the University of Michigan. He <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the draft in the United States Army in August 1942, but was rejected on medical grounds. He had been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1942–43 but did not use it, choosing instead to teach at Swarthmore College in 1942–45.|$|E
5|$|Alchemists {{thought of}} mercury as the First Matter {{from which all}} metals were formed. They {{believed}} that different metals could be produced by varying {{the quality and quantity}} of sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.|$|E
5|$|Following halftime, Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second half. Texas' kickoff was fielded by Antonio Banks, who returned it to the Tech 41-yard line. On the first play of the half, Thomas was tackled for a loss of two yards on a running play up the middle. After an incomplete pass, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings, who fell down short of the first down marker. The Hokies punted, but Texas <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a five-yard running into the kicker penalty and Tech opted to re-kick. After the second kick, Texas' offense started at its 17-yard line.|$|E

5|$|In March 1979 James Callaghan's Labour {{government}} fell, and {{a general}} election <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> 3 May. This led to a brief delay in {{the start of the}} trial as Thorpe, who still had a following among North Devon Liberals, was adopted as their candidate in the election. Largely isolated from his party's national campaign, he lost the seat to his Conservative opponent by over 8,000 votes.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes {{and two of}} the latter's {{business}} acquaintances—John le Mesurier and George Deakin—appeared before magistrates at Minehead, Somerset, in a committal {{hearing to}} determine whether they should stand trial. The court heard evidence of a conspiracy from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it also learned that Bessell was being paid £50,000 by The Sunday Telegraph for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, and a general election <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{lost the}} April 8 {{national}} championship game against Midwest number one seed Louisville by an 82–76 score. Albrecht scored 17 first-half points on 4-for-4 three-point shooting. Burke scored 24 points {{in the championship game}} and made the seven-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned Peyton Siva's dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a foul, resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} play after the interception, Pegues gained one yard on a rushing play to the right. Clark then {{completed}} a pass to Jarrett Ferguson at the Alabama 36-yard line for a first down. During the play, Alabama <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a five-yard penalty for grabbing Ferguson's facemask during the tackle. After the penalty, Angelo Harrison gained nine yards on a reverse run. Ferguson then was tackled for a loss of two yards, and Clark threw an incomplete pass on third down. Tech head coach Frank Beamer sent in Graham to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick sailed right of the goal, however. With 4:10 remaining in the first quarter, Tech led Alabama 70.|$|E
5|$|Sharp {{divisions}} among rebel factions {{became apparent}} during a second meeting in Saqba on 5 December. According to Syrian journalist Munir al-Rayyes, hostility between al-Kharrat and al-Shallash was well-known among the rebels. Because al-Shallash had levied war {{taxes on the}} major landlords and city elites of the Ghouta, al-Kharrat's benefactor al-Bakri viewed him {{as a threat to}} the traditional landowning class to which al-Bakri belonged. Al-Rayyis claimed the meeting <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> by al-Kharrat, who ordered his fighters to capture and bring al-Shallash to Saqba. However, according to al-'As, the summit was called by al-Shallash, and once the latter arrived in the village, al-Kharrat personally detained him and confiscated his horse, weapons and money.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the East–West Telegraph line in the 1870s, along Eyre's route, resulted in a hazardous trail that could be followed for interstate travel. A national highway <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for,</b> but the federal government {{did not see the}} route as important enough until 1941, when a war in the Pacific seemed imminent. The highway was constructed between July 1941 and June 1942, but was trafficable by January 1942. Though originally named Forrest Highway, after John Forrest, by the war cabinet, it was officially named and gazetted Eyre Highway, a name agreed upon by the states' nomenclature committees.|$|E

5|$|The {{first play}} of the Tech drive was a seven-yard run by Stith. This was {{followed}} by an incomplete pass from Clark, but Alabama <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> pass interference during the play. After the penalty, Virginia Tech had a first down at the Alabama four-yard line. On the first play after the penalty, Stith broke through the Alabama defense for Tech's second touchdown of the quarter. The extra point was good, and with 5:09 remaining in the quarter, Tech extended its lead to 247.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} {{faced each other}} {{for the first time since}} the altercation on November 17, 2007, which the Nuggets won 115–83. Opposing players Renaldo Balkman and Linas Kleiza began arguing with each other after Balkman <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a hard foul on Kleiza, but the {{incident}} was defused after Balkman was given a technical foul. Iverson, Anthony, and Marcus Camby were all removed early in the fourth quarter. Balkman and Kleiza later became teammates after Balkman was traded to the Nuggets in the 2008 off-season.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{existing}} {{command and control}} arrangement between the CIA, the AIRA, and the Seventh Air Force, the Air Force wielded little actual control over air support. In order to increase its dominance, {{a reduction in the}} role of the Raven FACS <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for.</b> Instead, greater use was to be made of Nail FACs from Nakhon Phanom's 23rd Tactical Air Support Squadron which had recently begun transitioning to OV-10 Bronco aircraft. In the end, the Nails made increasing appearances over Military Region 2, but they never seriously encroached on the role of the Ravens.|$|E

5|$|With {{limited time}} remaining, Clemson {{attempted}} an onside kick {{in an effort}} to retain possession and have a chance to make up some of the scoring deficit. The kick was recovered by Virginia Tech, however, and the Vick-led Tech offense returned to the field at the Clemson 44-yard line. Suggs was stopped for no gain on a run up the middle, Vick threw an incomplete pass, then he completed a 14-yard pass to Wynn for a first down at the Clemson 30-yard line. After the first down, Ferguson gained a few yards on a run up the middle, then Suggs advanced the ball to just short of the first-down marker. On third down, Suggs gained the first down with a run up the middle. Following the first down, Clemson defender Alex Ardley <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a personal foul and ejected from the game. The penalty gave Virginia Tech a first down at the Clemson 10-yard line. From there, Clemson <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a five-yard offsides penalty. On the first play after the consecutive penalties, Vick pitched the ball to Suggs, who ran into the end zone untouched. The extra point kick was good, and Virginia Tech extended its lead to 4120 with 3:41 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|A halt <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> Christmas while {{supplies}} were brought up. Units had a rest day. Most dined on turkey, ham, roast potatoes and Christmas pudding, and Christmas services were held. General Blamey insisted that Christmas fare {{be available to}} all units, and extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} carry out his directive. In one instance, a Piper Cub of No. 4 Squadron RAAF dropped Christmas fare to a Papuan Company on a long range patrol. The advance resumed on 27 December, preceded by air strikes by 18 B-25 Mitchell and 12 Boston bombers. The 2/15th Infantry Battalion and tanks of A Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion took the lead on 31 December; they reached Sialum on 2 January 1944. This had a sheltered beach which served as a maintenance area. That day, the American landing at Saidor placed a large force across the Japanese escape route.|$|E
5|$|Following Florida State's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech's offense {{began its}} third {{possession}} of the game at the Tech 24-yard line after a short kick return. Running back Andre Kendrick ran for a short gain, but on the next play Vick <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> an intentional grounding penalty while attempting to avoid a sack. The Hokies were unable {{to make up the}} yardage lost by the penalty and punted after failing to gain a first down. Owing to the penalty, Tech punter Jimmy Kibble was forced to kick from his own end zone. Florida State was able to break through the Tech offensive line during the punt and blocked the kick. The ball was picked up by Florida State defender Jeff Chaney, who dashed into the end zone for Florida State's second touchdown of the game. The score and extra point gave Florida State a 140 lead with 2:14 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
