500|$|At the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright {{said he was}} {{intrigued}} by the story's high concept and character. Wright also stressed that the film {{would not be a}} spoof but an action-adventure with some comedic elements and would incorporate both the Hank Pym and Scott Lang incarnations of the character. Wright said that he was looking to [...] "do a prologue <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Pym as Ant-Man in action in the 60s, in sort of Tales to Astonish mode basically, and then the contemporary, sort of flash-forward, is Scott Lang's story, and how he comes to acquire the suit, how he crosses paths with Hank Pym, and then, in an interesting sort of Machiavellian way, teams up with him." [...] The next February, Wright said that the project was in [...] "a holding pattern" [...] while the script was being revised, and that he had been doing research for the film by studying nanotechnology. In March 2008, Wright said that the first draft of the script had been completed and he was working on the second.|$|E
500|$|Distribution {{rights for}} the United States were picked up at Sundance by IFC Films. Trinity Filmed Entertainment was the British distributor. The film was {{released}} in the United States and the United Kingdom on 24 September 2010. In both these countries, the film was distributed without the seventh of its nine reels. The running time was therefore 137 minutes at 25 frames per second, which the director had instructed that the film should be played at, or 142 minutes at the more common 24 frames per second. Noé says {{that none of the}} cut material is essential for the film. He describes it as [...] "some astro-visions, an orgy scene with Linda and the Japanese girl, the scene <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> [...] waking up at the morgue and he thinks he's alive but he's not, and then the camera goes down the plughole where she's tipping his ashes." [...] The reason the shorter version was made was that Noé had promised the investors to make an alternative edit if the film ended up being longer than two hours and 20 minutes. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in France on 1 December 2010. Each edition features both the complete version and the shorter cut.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an email}} {{exchange}} with Farley published on March 28 in The Wall Street Journal, Wendy Perron stated, [...] "the publicity department for Fox Searchlight, the studio behind the film, is just 'doing its job' in promoting Portman's work". She also noted: [...] "'Natalie {{did most of}} the dancing <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> her in closeup, and she worked hard to make them convincing', Perron said via email. 'Obviously, the far shots plus the pirouettes and closeups on the feet were Sarah or another double.'" ...|$|E

Then it goes in circles downwards until it reaches Saracen's Tent. It goes right to The Great Stalacpipe Organ where it goes next to some big stalactites and stalagmites. Last, {{it goes to the}} Wishing Well and goes to a sign where they honor veterans who come from Page County and it climbs out through a small passage <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the [...] "Fried Eggs" [...] rock formation.

2500|$|Filming for {{the series}} takes place in New York City, {{significantly}} in Harlem, where the series is set. Coker described the neighborhood as [...] "the {{only place in the}} city <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets". For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in Greenwich Village [...] "that would’ve been a little easier for us to shoot in", but Coker said [...] "the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn’t want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem." [...] Sound stage work also takes place in New York. Manuel Billeter serves as director of photography {{for the series}}, after doing the same for Jessica Jones.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{completion}} of the series, Rowling began to speak openly about Snape, discussing the contrast between his character arc and that of Albus Dumbledore. Rowling said [...] "the series is built around [...] ", and maintained that she always knew what Snape {{would turn out to be}} at the end and that she carefully plotted his storyline throughout the series. [...] "I had to drop clues all the way through because as you know in the seventh book when you have the revelation scene where everything shifts and you realise...what Snape's motivation was. I had to plot that through the books because at the point <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> what was really going on, it would have been an absolute cheat on the reader at that point just to show a bunch of stuff you've never seen before." [...] Rowling further said in an interview that she wanted Snape to find redemption and forgiveness: [...] "Snape is a complicated man...he was a flawed human being, like all of us. Harry forgives him...Harry really sees the good in Snape ultimately... I wanted there to be redemption." ...|$|E

2500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Harlem, {{including}} Lenox Avenue and areas where American Gangster was shot, the Mount Olivet Baptist Church, St. Nicholas Park, Jackie Robinson Park, Riverside Park, and the Riverside Drive viaduct; in Washington Heights, including at the United Palace; Cortlandt Alley in Chinatown; in areas of Queens for when Cage escapes Seagate Prison and puts on the classic Power Man costume; the Roosevelt Island steam plant and Queens Detention Facility for interiors of Seagate; the Music Hall of Williamsburg for the exterior of Harlem's Paradise; the former Fulton Correctional Facility in The Bronx for the Crispus Attucks Complex; and the Long Island City portion of Newtown Creek. It was important to Coker for the series to film in Harlem, [...] "the {{only place in the}} city <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> those wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets". For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in Greenwich Village [...] "that would’ve been a little easier for us to shoot in", but Coker said [...] "the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn’t want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem." [...] Soundstage filming for the series took place at Broadway Stages in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. For the church that Cage and Temple visit in Savannah, Georgia, an abandoned church in The Bronx was found that was being sold, and the production was able to [...] "graffiti up and sort of ruin" [...] it. They also had to spend two days carting snow from the site before filming, after a recent blizzard.|$|E
2500|$|Hip hop {{culture has}} spread to both urban and {{suburban}} communities throughout the United States and subsequently the world. These elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. Even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. [...] Hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats and basslines from old records [...] to the art form means {{that much of the}} culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. Sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called [...] "flipping" [...] in hip hop culture. Hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier African-American-rooted musical genres such as blues, jazz, rag-time, funk, and disco {{to become one of the}} most practiced genres worldwide. It is the language of urban environments and the youth around the world, many who do not know what Hip Hop (the consciousness which makes up the collective culture of Hip Hop) is or what it means to [...] "Be Hip Hop" [...] , have recently begun to attribute being Hip Hop with being black, however that is race , not culture and not consciousness. as KRS-One says [...] "Hip Hop is the only place <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Martin Luther King Jr. s; 'I have a dream speech' in real life" [...] and [...] "To be Hip Hop you have to have the courage to be you and be Hip Hop all the time not just when it's popular or convenient, and have repped it when it wasn't and you were the only one repping it." [...] He also notes that Hip Hop is beyond something as simple minded as race or gender or nationality, it belongs to the world.|$|E
2500|$|The {{scene in}} Beauty and the Beast {{during which the}} song is heard is the moment when Belle and the Beast's true {{feelings}} for each other are finally established. Set in the ballroom of the Beast's castle, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] is performed by the character Mrs. Potts, an enchanted teapot, midway through the film as she explains the feeling of love to her young teacup son Chip, referring to the emotion as [...] "a tale as old as time". According to Armen Karaoghlanian of Interiors, [...] "Belle familiarizes the Beast with the waltz and as soon he feels comfortable, he gracefully moves her across the floor". Afterwards, the song continues to play instrumentally as Belle and the Beast retire to the balcony for a romantic candlelit dinner. Believed to be the [...] "centerpiece that brings Beauty and her Beast together," [...] the sequence offers an insight into both characters' psyches. From the Beast's perspective, it is the moment he realizes {{that he wants to}} confess his true feelings for Belle to her and [...] "decides he wants to tell Belle he is in love with her." [...] Meanwhile, Belle begins {{to fall in love with}} her captor. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Jennie Punter reviewed it as the scene in which [...] "romance finally blossoms." [...] Film critic Ellison Estefan, writing for Estefan Films, believes that the sequence is responsible for [...] "add another dimension to the characters as they continue to fall deeply in love with each other." [...] Explaining the song's role in the film, director Kirk Wise described the scene as [...] "the culmination of their relationship," [...] while producer Don Hahn pegged it as [...] "the bonding moment of the film when the two main characters finally get together." [...] The scene had long been envisioned as having a more live-action feel to it than the rest of the film, an idea that originated from story artists Brenda Chapman and Roger Allers, who were the first to suggest that the ballroom be built using computers. As the film's executive producer, former Head of Disney's film division Jeffrey Katzenberg recalled that he began working on Beauty and the Beast deciding what its [...] "wowie" [...] moment would be, defining this as [...] "the moment in the movie <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> what's on the screen and go, 'Wow-IEE'"; this ultimately became the film's ballroom sequence. According to Hahn, the scene was conceived out of the filmmakers' desire to manipulate the camera in order to [...] "sweep" [...] the audience away. Allers and Chapman conceived the ballroom in order to provide the characters with an area in which they could linger, and were surprised by the amount of artistic freedom with which they were provided by the animators, who agreed to adjust to the changes in perspective that would result from the moving camera. While Allers decided to raise the camera in order to view the dancing couple from the overhead chandelier, Chapman decided to rotate the camera around Belle's skirt as the couple danced past it.|$|E
