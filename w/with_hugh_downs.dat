25|$|In June 1978, Arledge {{created the}} newsmagazine 20/20; after its first episode {{received}} harshly negative reviews, the program – which debuted {{as a summer}} series, before becoming a year-round program in 1979 – was immediately revamped to feature a mix of in-depth stories and interviews, <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> appointed as its anchor (later paired alongside his former Today colleague Barbara Walters). In February 1979, ABC sold its recording division to MCA Inc. for $20 million; the label was discontinued by March 5 of that year, {{and all of its}} 300 employees were laid off (the rights to the works of ABC Records and all of MCA's other labels have since been acquired by Universal Music Group).|$|E
50|$|Arledge's {{first major}} {{creation}} for ABC was 20/20, which premiered in June 1978. The first iteration {{of this program}} fared badly, and resulted in the firing of the original hosts, <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> chosen as the new anchor beginning {{the second week of}} the program.|$|E
50|$|Barbara Walters, {{though not}} the first to cross the line between news and {{personality}} stories, is for many the quintessential news-media icon. Her career dates back to the 1950s, and her current prominence at ABC is largely due to celebrity interviews, with a long running co-anchorship on 20/20 <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> and, later, John Stossel until 2004, and her overlapping morning infotainment show The View.|$|E
50|$|Edd Hall {{served as}} {{announcer}} on The Tonight Show from 1992 until 2004. Hall occasionally appeared in skits {{during the opening}} monologue. These skits often involved slapstick injury to Hall (by using a stunt double, dummy, or film clip), such as vehicles running him over in the studio parking lot. Unlike his predecessors on Tonight (i.e. McMahon <b>with</b> Carson, <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> <b>with</b> Jack Paar), Hall did not serve as a sidekick for Leno during his tenure on Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike his {{predecessors}} on Tonight (i.e. McMahon <b>with</b> Carson, <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> <b>with</b> Jack Paar), Edd {{did not serve}} as the only sidekick for Mr. Leno during his tenure on Leno's incarnation of [...] "The Tonight Show". Hall appeared in hundreds of sketches though. He often played the [...] "stooge" [...] to host Leno. Some of his most memorable sketches included vehicles running him over in the studio parking lot, getting [...] "attacked" [...] by actors in large animal costumes, or Leno would discover Hall [...] "missing" [...] from the studio and would go in search of him - eventually finding Edd in a ridiculous place or situation.|$|R
5000|$|Walters {{first became}} known as a {{television}} personality in the early 1960s, {{when she was a}} writer and segment producer of [...] "women's interest stories" [...] on the NBC News morning program The Today Show, where she began work <b>with</b> host <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs.</b> As a result of her outstanding interviewing ability and her popularity with viewers, she received more airtime on the program. Even though her production duties made her a significant contributor to the program, she had no input in choosing a successor for Downs when he left in 1971, and Frank McGee was hired. In 1974, at the time of McGee's death, Walters became co-host of the program, the first woman to hold such a title on an American news program.|$|R
50|$|Arlene Francis {{hosted the}} program as {{editor-in-chief}} <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> serving as her announcer and assistant. Music was performed by the Norman Paris Trio and singer Johnny Johnston. The team of editors presenting segments on particular topics included Poppy Cannon (food), Rose Franzblau (family relations and child psychology), Eve Hunter (fashion and beauty), Sydney Smith (interior decorating), Estelle Parsons (special projects), Leona Baumgartner (health), and Will Peigelbeck (gardening and home repairs).|$|E
50|$|On {{leaving the}} Navy, Eddy resumed control of WBKB, and almost {{immediately}} established an operation that was historically noteworthy. In addition to continuing with his technical and production innovations, Eddy initiated many highly popular programs, including Junior Jamboree (puppeteers, later becoming Kukla, Fran and Ollie), the Chicago Zoo with Marlin Perkins (later Wild Kingdom), news <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> and the first live broadcasts of many sports: baseball (Chicago Cubs remote from Wrigley Field), college football (Notre Dame remote from South Bend), boxing, wrestling, and golf.|$|E
50|$|O'Day spoke candidly {{about her}} drug {{addiction}} in her 1981 memoir High Times, Hard Times, {{which led to}} a string of TV appearances on 60 Minutes, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Today Show with Bryant Gumbel, The Dick Cavett Show, Over Easy <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder, and several others. She toured Europe, and also performed a 50th Anniversary Concert (1985) at Carnegie Hall which resulted in the (2010) release of Anita O'Day - Big Band at Carnegie Hall (Emily Productions). O'Day also headlined New York's JVC Jazz Festival.|$|E
50|$|Bevins joined The Independent {{before its}} launch in 1986, {{and was the}} {{newspapers}} first political editor. Significantly, his newspaper opposed the anonymous lobby system, preferring {{to find their own}} sources, a policy Bevins fully supported. This innovation was short-lived, but did lead to such briefings being attributed. He was credited by Colin <b>Hughes</b> <b>with</b> bringing <b>down</b> Margaret Thatcher.In 1991, he won the What the Papers Say Political Reporter of the Year award.|$|R

5000|$|After a {{few years}} as a {{publicist}} with Tex McCrary Inc. and {{a job as a}} writer at Redbook magazine, Walters joined NBC's The Today Show as a writer and researcher in 1961. She moved up to become that show's regular [...] "Today Girl", handling lighter assignments and the weather. In her autobiography, she describes this era before the Women's Movement as {{a time when it was}} believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting [...] "hard news". Previous [...] "Today Girls" [...] (whom Walters called [...] "tea pourers") included Florence Henderson, Helen O'Connell, Estelle Parsons and Lee Meriwether. Within a year, she had become a reporter-at-large developing, writing, and editing her own reports and interviews. One very well received film segment was [...] "A Day in the Life of a Novice Nun," [...] edited by then first assistant film editor Donald Swerdlow (now Don Canaan) who was subsequently promoted to become a full film editor at NBC News. She had a great relationship <b>with</b> host <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> for years. When Frank McGee was named host, he refused to do joint interviews with Walters unless he was given the first three questions. She was not named co-host of the show until McGee's death in 1974, when NBC officially designated Walters as the program's first female co-host.|$|R
50|$|After film school, Danner {{began working}} {{on a wide variety}} of productions. He worked as a {{producer}} on several educational television programs such as The Profiles Series with Lou Gossett, Jr. and The National Report Series <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs</b> for public television. Danner's other television credits include reality television programs such as Jury Duty, and music videos with recording artists such as Master P and MIGGS. Partnering with Insights Entertainment and Google, he has written, directed and produced over twenty television, radio and interactive media commercials for such clients as Variety Children's Charity, Stern Environmental Group, iBank and the U.S. Airforce.|$|E
5000|$|The entire on-air crew {{remained}} mostly consistent from 1966-1970. Bob Forbes {{was assigned}} as [...] "wireless" [...] microphone, covering the garages and roving reports. The pre-race coverage was 30 minutes long. In {{a departure from}} previous years, Sid Collins decided to eliminate booth interviews with celebrities during the race. The only exception was an interview <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs,</b> but that was during the post-race coverage. In addition, Luke Walton interviewed Evel Knievel in the pit area {{during the early stages}} of the race. Knievel was making his first visit to the 500, as a guest of the A. J. Foyt team.|$|E

2500|$|With expiring enlistments leaving {{fewer than}} 100 men {{remaining}} in his regiment, Haslet crossed the Delaware with Washington {{and joined the}} attack on Trenton {{on the morning of}} December 26, 1776. However, on January 3, 1777, in a skirmish {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Princeton, <b>with</b> General <b>Hugh</b> Mercer <b>down</b> and wounded, Haslet tried to rally Mercer's brigade and was himself shot in the head and killed instantly. Nevertheless, they did rally and a surprising victory was won to complement the earlier one at Trenton. The [...] "corps of loyalists" [...] he defeated at Mamaroneck was led by the famous Indian fighter Robert Rogers (soldier). Legend has it that Washington wept over his corpse on the battlefield and notes by Washington's stepson confirm that Washington did come across Haslet's body at Princeton, but does not mention any shedding of tears.|$|R

5000|$|The Apollo Program in Milwaukee, Wisconsin {{were the}} glory years for Atwood. He {{had led the}} {{proposal}} team and as director of engineering and operations, he oversaw the Apollo program at AC Spark Plug. The program included a guidance and navigation system, an optical system, and a computer. Atwood's organization became the prime contractor. When asked about his contribution to the Apollo Program, Atwood would always downplay his contribution and let his people take the credit. In fact his contribution was [...] "tremendous" [...] said Hugh Brady, Atwood's program manager for Apollo. Atwood was involved with NASA at the launches at Cape Kennedy, led the negotiations for getting contracts and had total management responsibility. His interface with General Motors management was also {{very important to the}} program. Atwood also represented General Motors on nationwide television's Today Show <b>with</b> <b>Hugh</b> <b>Downs.</b> Atwood would reflect later that it was this appearance was his [...] "greatest risk". Atwood spent 30 minutes explaining to an anxious 20 million viewers what was happening with the Apollo 8 astronauts as they circled incommunicado around {{the far side of the}} Moon on Christmas Eve morning, 1968.|$|E
