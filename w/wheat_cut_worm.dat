40|$|Varying {{responses}} to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) stubble management preceding double-crop soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] have been reported; however, little {{work has been}} done in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Additionally, there is limited information for wheat stubble management using glyphosate-resistant soybean. The objectives of this study were to observe the effects of wheat stubble management (WSM) on physiological growth and yield characteristics for double-cropped glyphosate-resistant soybean, evaluate the impacts of WSM on soil moisture retention and soil surface shading, monitor weed response characteristics, and perform a simple economic analysis comparing the four stubble management treatments. During 2003 and 2004, four WSM treatments were evaluated at two locations in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The WSM treatments were: <b>wheat</b> <b>cut</b> at a height resulting in stubble height of 15 cm with straw removed (baling), <b>wheat</b> <b>cut</b> for stubble height of 15 cm with straw returned to the plot, <b>wheat</b> <b>cut</b> for stubble height of 7. 5 cm and straw returned to the plot by mowing with a rotary mower following soybean planting, and <b>wheat</b> <b>cut</b> for stubble height of 30 cm straw returned to the plot.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} was to ensure quality green forage and silage early in the spring on family farms in northern Croatia, through introducing winter cereals and Winter pea mixtures. For that purpose mixtures of Winter pea (cv. Maksimirski visoki) with triticale (cv. Clercal) were cut in the beginning of May, while the mixtures of Winter pea with wheat (cv. Sana and cv.

The mixtures were used to feed dairy cows from the beginning of flowering till the full bloom of Winterpea. The green mass yields (GMY) for mixtures of Winter pea with triticale cut in the beginning of pea flowering varied from 24. 0 to 52. 7 t/ha, while the GMY of mixtures cut in the full bloom of Winter pea were from 46. 7 to 67. 5 t/ha. Average dry matter yields (DMY) for mixtures of Winter pea with triticale cut in the beginning of flowering varied from 4. 05 to 12. 2 t/ha, while the DMY of mixtures cut in the full bloom of Winter pea were from 8. 98 to 18. 39 t/ha.

From the nature of the injuries to corn, particularly on account of the difficulty of any direct examination of some forms, and the difficulty of making any exact estimate, their injuries are, I think, very generally under-estimated. Probably the most serious losses come from those working under ground, the injuries of which are to be found simply in the lessened crop, and which consequently pass unnoticed by most farmers.

Approach: Response varied according to insect species, specific formulation and AITC application rates. Results: Fumigant {{toxicity of}} the oil based on 9 h exposure was evaluated against the three insect larvae, the diamond back moth, P. xylostella larvae were more susceptible followed by tobacco <b>cut</b> <b>worm,</b> S. litura and cabbage white, P. rapae larvae. To P. xylostella larvae, LC 50 value was 1. 5 µL L - 1 air, S. litura larvae (LC 50, 1. 8 µL L - 1 air) and P. rapae larvae (LC 50, 2. 0 µL L - 1 air). These three insect larvae were killed after 9 h exposure to a dose of 4. 3 µL L - 1 air {{of the oil}}, showed no significance difference with that of phosphine (40 µg L - 1 air) a recommended dose. On the other hand, on the spray application bioassays, mortality data counted 72 h after treatment, the P. rapae larvae were most susceptible to AITC formulations followed by S. litura larvae and P. xylostella larvae. LC 50 values, to P. xylostella larvae, HJ(A) and HJ(B) were the most potent toxicant (33 mg L - 1) and (46 mg L - 1) respectively, while the least toxic was HJ(C) (556 mg L - 1). To S. litura larvae, HJ(B) and HJ(A) were the most efficient (10 mg L - 1) and (22 mg L - 1) respectively, while HJ(D) (LC 50, 385 mg L - 1) {{was found to be}} the least toxic. The both of HJ (B) and HJ (C) had similar insecticidal activity (LC 50, 8 mg L - 1) to Pieris rapae larvae followed by HD (B) (LC 50, 22 mg L - 1) and HD (A) (LC 50, 82 mg L - 1). Conclusion/Recommendations: It was concluded that the AITC oil showed promise findings and may be a good alternative to old fumigant phosphine. The others were found efficient on the spray application bioassays but the mixture of AITC with cypermethrin especially HJ (A) and HJ (B) were found to be better than AITC mixed with chlorpyrifos and AITC pure.

40|$|Schistocephalus solidus {{is one of}} the few cestodes {{that can}} be bred in vitro. Worms have {{typically}} been bred in pairs, so the parents of each offspring can clearly be assigned. From a genetic perspective, it would be useful to be able to mate an individual worm to multiple partners while still being able to distinguish among different parents. As each adult S. solidus possesses numerous reproductive complexes, cutting worms and breeding the pieces separately would facilitate such breeding designs. We halved worms before in vitro breeding and evaluated whether this affected outcrossing rates and reproductive output. Cutting did not influence clutch mass, i. e. egg number and size, or outcrossing rates, but eggs from <b>cut</b> <b>worms</b> had a lower hatching rate than eggs from uncut worms. We found that when two anterior worm halves were bred together, they produced fewer, smaller eggs with higher hatching rates, compared to two posterior halves. Moreover, once we controlled for this effect of ‘worm half’, the two halves of an individual worm tended to reproduce similarly under comparable circumstances. We conclude that cutting plerocercoids increases the flexibility with which this tapeworm can be experimentally bred without dramatically affecting the production of viable, outcrossed eggs...|$|R

The aim of this study was to select prospective varieties of sweet sorghum, optimum sowing times and densities to achieve high yields of ethanol production and to establish stable operational conditions in cultivating this crop. The summer-autumn cropping season combined with the sowing densities of 8. 3 – 10. 9 plant m− 2 obtained the highest ethanol yield.
