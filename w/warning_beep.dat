5000|$|... "Precognitive Scanner" [...] (place {{it behind}} your ear, {{and it will}} read the speech center in your brain and emit a <b>warning</b> <b>beep</b> to prevent you from uttering [...] "faux pas, Freudian slips, and ill-timed obscenities") ...|$|E
5000|$|In StarCraft, the Terran Goliath unit shares many design {{similarities}} with ED-209, {{being both}} bipedal and armed {{with an automatic}} cannon and missiles. Repeatedly clicking the unit will cause the pilot to say [...] "Mil-spec ED-209 on." [...] Similarly, if a Protoss Dragoon unit is clicked repeatedly, it will issue a <b>warning</b> <b>beep</b> and say, [...] "Drop your weapon! You have 15 seconds to comply." [...] and will then count down before playing a phaser sound effect.|$|E
5000|$|Reversing (also {{known as}} backing up) {{is the process}} of driving a vehicle in the reverse {{direction}} in order to maneuver. Rear view mirrors are standard equipment for this endeavor. Extremely large or luxury vehicles may have in addition technical aids such as backup cameras. Many industrial vehicles such as fork lifts automatically activate a <b>warning</b> <b>beep</b> whilst reversing. In the UK lorries may be fitted with warning devices which repeatedly announce [...] "This vehicle is reversing", or the equivalent phrase in Welsh.|$|E
50|$|All TW6000s {{are driven}} (from the cab, of course) using an {{integral}} traction/braking with a deadman's trigger that drivers must depress {{to mobilize the}} vehicle, if released while moving, first it (the <b>warning</b> system) <b>beeps,</b> then the track brakes are applied.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the second Chernobyl disaster, The Zone is {{littered}} with small areas of altered physics, known as anomalies. There are several different variations, each one having a unique impact upon those who cross its path. They can be potentially deadly to the player and other NPCs, delivering electric shocks, or pulling them into the air and crushing them. Most anomalies produce visible air or light distortions and their extent can be determined by throwing bolts (of which the player carries an infinite supply) to trigger them. Some stalkers also possess an anomaly detector, which emits <b>warning</b> <b>beeps</b> of a varying frequency depending on their proximity to an anomaly. The guide in the film Stalker, and his predecessors in the Strugatsky brothers' book Roadside Picnic, test various routes before proceeding. In the film, metal nuts tied with strips of cloth are used.|$|R
40|$|When {{trying to}} affect our {{emotions}} as a narrative accompaniment to familiar visuals, elec-tronic and pre-recorded sounds colour our perception {{in a unique}} way, arguably beyond the possi-bilities of conventional instruments. The omnipresent <b>warnings</b> of <b>beeping</b> mobile phones, pop-music ringtones {{and of course the}} sounds and music from video game consoles affirm that electron-ic music is not only functional, but almost mandatory. But electronic music has been influenced by the visual and in turn, the visual has been enriched by electronic music...|$|R
50|$|The command {{returns the}} {{selected}} choice as an exit code {{which is set}} to the index of the key that the user selects {{from the list of}} choices. The first choice in the list returns a value of 1, the second a value of 2, and so forth.If a key is pressed that is not a valid choice, the command will sound a <b>warning</b> <b>beep.</b> If an error condition is detected, an exit code value of 255 will be returned. An exit code value of 0 will be returned, if the user presses + or +.Choice displays the default choices Y and N if used without parameters.|$|E
5000|$|All lenses have {{internal}} electronic Seiko #1 shutters with {{a maximum}} 1/400 sec speed, PC-type X flash sync plug, T-switch for long exposures, a plug for standard remote cable release for B exposures, depth of field preview lever, distance scale, aperture adjust ring. In [...] "B" [...] mode, the RZ67 models will expose up to 30 seconds (a <b>warning</b> <b>beep</b> will sound for the last 10 seconds). In [...] "T" [...] mode, the camera can expose indefinitely without drawing power from the battery. Most lenses, except for the 37 mm, 75 mm shift lenses and the 500 mm lenses have 77 mm filter threads {{on the front of}} the lens. The 75 mm shift lenses and the 500 mm lenses have 105 mm filter threads. Some lenses have a floating element; focusing these lenses involves setting a subject distance ring on the lens after focusing with the bellows.|$|E
40|$|Field {{experiments}} with ISA (Intelligent Speed Adaptation) {{has been carried}} out in the city of Debrecen, Hungary. Twenty vehicles were equipped with two kinds of ISA systems: 1) support via an active accelerator pedal and 2) warning via beep signals and flashing red light when exceeding the speed limit. Speed was continually logged in all vehicles and the test drivers were interviewed. The results show that they had a positive attitude towards ISA generally, but they reported some negative changes in workload factors. They liked the <b>warning</b> <b>beep</b> signal more than support via the gas pedal...|$|E
40|$|Two {{alternative}} Human-Machine-Interface {{solutions for}} in-vehicle speed support were evaluated in field trials in Hungary and Spain. Twenty vehicles on both test sites were equipped with {{two kinds of}} systems: 1) support via an Active Accelerator Pedal and 2) <b>warning</b> via <b>beep</b> signals and flashing red light when exceeding the speed limit. The test drivers drove one month with each system. Both systems {{had an effect on}} speed and the effect was greater for the Active Accelerator Pedal than for the “BEEP”-system. Both systems were perceived as useful but not satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Human {{subjects}} misjudge {{the position}} of a target that is flashed during a pursuit eye movement. Their judgments are biased in the direction in which the eyes are moving. We investigated whether this bias can be reduced by making the appearance of the flash more predictable. In the normal condition, subjects pursued a moving target that flashed somewhere along its trajectory. After the presentation, they indicated where they had seen the flash. The mislocalisations in this condition were compared to mislocalisations in conditions in which the subjects were given information about when or where the flash would come. This information consisted of giving two warning flashes spaced at equal intervals before the target flash, of giving two <b>warning</b> <b>beeps</b> spaced at equal intervals before the target flash, or of showing the same stimulus twice. Showing the same stimulus twice significantly reduced the mislocalisation. The other conditions did not. We interpret this as indicating that it is not predictability as such that influences the performance, {{but the fact that the}} target appears at a spatially cued position. This was supported by a second experiment, in which we examined whether subjects make smaller misjudgments when they have to determine the distance between a target flashed during pursuit and a reference seen previously, than when they have to determine the distance between the flashed target and a reference seen afterwards. This was indeed the case, presumably because the reference provided a spatial cue for the flash when it was presented first. We conclude that a spatial cue reduces the mislocalisation of targets that are flashed during pursuit eye movements. The cue does not have to be exactly at the same position as the flash...|$|R
40|$|Field {{experiments}} with ISA (intelligent speed adaptation) {{were carried out}} in Hungary and Spain in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Twenty private vehicles in each country were equipped with two kinds of systems: (1) support via an active accelerator pedal (AAP) and (2) <b>warning</b> via <b>beep</b> signals and a flashing red light when the speed limit was exceeded (BEEP). The test drivers drove for a month with both systems installed in each car. Speed was continually logged in all the vehicles and the test drivers were interviewed about their acceptance and experiences of the systems. The results show that both systems reduced the mean and 85 percentile speeds, but that the AAP was more effective. There was no long-lasting effect on speeds when the systems were removed. After the trial half of the drivers were willing to keep an ISA system, but more drivers {{wanted to keep the}} BEEP-system even though it showed lower satisfaction ratings than the AAP. The results indicate no major differences between the countries despite the workload being perceived to be higher in Hungary than in Spain...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the top of}} {{the screen}} is a timer, which will count up from zero to a time {{determined}} before each round during the briefing. As the timer approaches its end, a <b>warning</b> tone will <b>beep.</b> If the player does not destroy the remaining enemies before the timer finishes, the enemies will leave the level, and the word [...] "CAUTION" [...] will appear on the screen. This means the MIRV has been launched. The MIRV will appear from {{the top of the}} screen. As the MIRV descends, it will break up into three clusters, each of which will then break up into three separate bombs. The player must shoot all of the bombs before they reach the ground.|$|R
50|$|Red minibuses {{often provide}} more {{convenient}} transport for riders not served by green minibuses or other public buses, {{and are thus}} quite popular. Where green minibus drivers are paid fixed wages to drive their routes, red minibus drivers often rely on their fares for a living and thus are often seen {{to be more aggressive}} drivers. The prevalence of aggressive driving has resulted in the Transport Department making it mandatory for Hong Kong minibuses to be equipped with large read-out speedometers which allow passengers to track the speed at which minibus drivers operate. Currently, if minibuses exceed 80 km/h, the speedometer will sound an audible <b>warning</b> signal (begin <b>beeping)</b> to the driver and passengers. If the minibus exceeds 100 km/h, the beeping will turn into a sustained tone. However, almost without exception this warning signal is ignored by both driver and passengers.|$|R
