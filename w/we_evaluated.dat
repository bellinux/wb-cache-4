When children were about five years old, school and residential {{exposure to}} RF-EMF from base stations was assessed with a geospatial model (NISMap) and from indoor sources (cordless phone/WiFi) using parental self-reports. Parents also reported their children’s use of mobile or cordless phones. When children were seven years old, <b>we</b> <b>evaluated</b> sleep quality as measured with the Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) filled in by parents. Of eight CSHQ subscales, <b>we</b> <b>evaluated</b> sleep onset delay, sleep dura-tion, night wakenings, parasomnias and daytime sleepiness with logistic or negative bino-mial regression models, adjusting for child’s age and sex and indicators of socio-economic position of the parents. <b>We</b> <b>evaluated</b> the remaining three subscales (bedtime resistance...|$|E
