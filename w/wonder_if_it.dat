5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E

[...] Christopher Tayler, in the London Review of Books, called the characterisation of Mountstuart weak and {{wondered if he was}} merely a device through which Boyd could write pastiche about 20th-century writers, [...] "Boyd hustles you through to the end despite all this, but it’s hard not to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was really worth making the journey." [...] In The Atlantic Monthly, Brooke Allen liked the Mountstuart character: [...] "he is far more generous, forgiving, and free than most of us. He is also more amusing, and more amused by life", thus making an [...] "attractive central character" [...] and Boyd's writing showed [...] "a great natural vitality and an increasingly sophisticated humanism." [...] The Atlantic Monthly selected it as one of the [...] "books of the year".|$|E

500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that if we go on a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor." [...] Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair".|$|E

2500|$|The protagonist is a monk, {{who becomes}} tempted by a ball that bounces through his window into his cell. He find himself enthralled by {{the ball and}} even begins to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> may be {{affiliated}} with the devil. He spends countless hours playing with the ball, and when he talks to a woman whose son had lost the ball, and feels pressured to return it, the neighbors claim he appeared {{to look like the}} devil. He then eventually throws the ball out his window, and the ball transforms into the Sombrerón. [...] Thus again, Asturias is showing that humans [...] "are capable to breaking the ties that bind them to the undesirable".|$|E
2500|$|The Sydney Morning Herald {{critique}} by Philip Derriman {{said that}} the book was ‘well researched, well illustrated and well written... anyone who looks into the book for an informed, readable account {{of the life of}} an extraordinary individual who also happened to be a fantastically successful sportsman will be well satisfied.’ He also said: ‘Perry’s book does include a personal detail about Sir Donald Bradman, which, as far as I know, has not previously appeared in print—namely that he is a former Freemason. Perry states the fact without comment, although many readers, having heard the stories of friction between Catholics and Mason in Australian cricket in the 1930s and 1940s, are sure to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was a factor in the lifelong personal rift between Bradman and his Catholic team-mates, Bill O’Reilly and Jack Fingleton.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Basora of Newsweek, {{stated that}} {{director}} Proyas flooded {{the screen with}} [...] "cinematic and literary references ranging from Murnau and Lang to Kafka and Orwell, creating a unique yet utterly convincing world". Similarly, David Sterritt wrote in the Christian Science Monitor that [...] "The story is dark and often violent, but it's told with a remarkable sense of visual energy and imagination." [...] Additionally, Marshall Fine of USA Today, found the film to be [...] "Fascinating, visionary filmmaking." [...] and [...] "With its amber-tinged palette and its distinctively dystopian view of life, {{it may be the}} most unique-looking film we've seen in ages... defies logic and makes frightening and unexpected leaps." [...] Critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that the [...] "plot that Dark City builds on John's predicament is a confused affair" [...] and that the film's premise is [...] "unsettling enough to make you <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> could actually derail a seriously drug-addled mind." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Water Babies, a {{fairy tale}} for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, {{published}} in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having [...] "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species", and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater– Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did {{you put it in}} a bottle? Did it <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> could get out? Could I see it some day?– Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian– I could never make sure about that Water Baby... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did– There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.When you grow up I dare say you {{will be one of the}} great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.|$|E
2500|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version was}} {{generally}} considered the weakest {{version of the}} game. IGN's Marc Nix scored it 6 out of 10, and was especially critical of the combat; [...] "enemies get the jump on you with the first attack, and since there can be several enemies on screen, it can {{take a long time}} for your turn to come up. Then you have to watch every swipe of battle, which all begin and end with the characters taking a LONG walk across the screen to attack and then retreat - just the time that it takes for sprites to rotate back into the ready position is enough time for you to lose interest." [...] He called the game [...] "a rough start for the journey." [...] GameSpy's Avi Fryman scored it 1.5 out of 5, criticizing the graphics, and finding the game buggy, writing [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was even tested prior to its clearly rushed release." [...] GameSpot's Frank Provo scored it 2.1 out of 10, writing, [...] "the range of interactivity is so low and the action is so infrequent that Frodo's quest to Mount Doom is reduced to nothing more than a trivial errand. What's more, the entire game is so unpolished and full of bugs that it's unfathomable how it ever passed quality assurance in the first place." ...|$|E
