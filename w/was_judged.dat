5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third day of the trial, Wiens incurred a self-inflicted injury by banging his head against a table. He was diagnosed with haematomas and a suspected traumatic brain injury, but <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> fit to stand trial after a hospital-based medical examination. While continuing with noncompliant and destructive behaviour, Wiens was temporarily restrained by nine security officers in court.|$|E
5000|$|But farther, this question, (Who shall <b>be</b> <b>judge?)</b> cannot mean, {{that there}} <b>is</b> no <b>judge</b> at all: for {{where there is}} no {{judicature}} on earth, to decide controversies amongst men, God in heaven <b>is</b> <b>judge.</b> He alone, it <b>is</b> true, <b>is</b> <b>judge</b> of the right. But every man <b>is</b> <b>judge</b> for himself, as in all other cases, so in this, whether another hath put himself into a state of war with him, and whether he should appeal to the Supreme Judge, as Jeptha did.|$|R

5|$|Despite the accident, a {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 {{as it was}} felt that mixed-power aircraft would be of some use easing the transition of pilots from piston-engine fighters to jet-engined ones. At the same time Sukhoi's Su-5 was cancelled as it <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> inferior to the I-250.|$|E
5|$|For {{several decades}} {{after the end of}} the silent film era, the subject matter of Stowe's novel <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> too {{sensitive}} for further film interpretation. In 1946, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer considered filming the story but ceased production after protests led by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.|$|E
5|$|Only Kronshtadts hull {{survived the}} war {{reasonably}} intact {{and was about}} 10% complete in 1945. She <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> obsolete and the Soviets considered converting her into an aircraft carrier, but the idea was rejected and both hulls were scrapped in 1947.|$|E
40|$|Can’t one truly <b>judge</b> {{that one}} <b>is</b> <b>judging?</b> Matthew Soteriou {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} authoritatively knowing one’s own mental acts which depends on a surprising assumption: One cannot truly <b>judge</b> that one <b>is</b> <b>judging.</b> After briefly criticizing his account of one’s awareness that one <b>is</b> <b>judging,</b> I critically scrutinize two of his arguments against the possibility of truly <b>judging</b> that one <b>is</b> <b>judging.</b> Firstly, assuming such a possibility leads to a regress. Secondly, the second-order judgement inevitably replaces the first-order judgement such as to make the former wrong. Matthew Soteriou (2005) has provided a thorough analysis of our intuitive claims to be directly and authoritatively aware of our own mental activity. Soteriou opposes non-occurrent belief and conscious judgement. The latter is a mental act, the former is not. Conscious judgement is identified with occurrent belief (Soteriou 2005, 96). While one can have a non-occurrent belief that one is believing that p despite not believing that p, one’s non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> now <b>judging</b> that p cannot be subject to such a mistake. Whenever one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p, one has a non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p (Soteriou 2005, 95). Whenever one has a non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p, this belief cannot be false...|$|R
50|$|Throughout its {{existence}} {{the court had}} two permanent judges at any one time. From 1865 to 1878 and 1905 to 1943 the senior <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> titled <b>Judge</b> and the junior <b>judge's</b> title <b>was</b> Assistant <b>Judge.</b> Between 1878 and 1905 the senior <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> titled Chief Justice and the junior <b>judge's</b> title <b>was</b> <b>Judge.</b>|$|R

5|$|The two-story station {{building}} {{was destroyed by}} a fire on June 11, 1983. The building had been vacant since the early 1970s and was a frequent target of vandalism; the fire <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> to be of suspicious origin.

5|$|A {{series of}} legal maneuverings {{involving}} both sides {{took place in}} the late winter and early spring of 1996. Defense attorneys requested that cameras be barred from Green's eventual trial, but the request was rejected. Green <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> by court-appointed psychologists to be competent to stand trial and denied a reduction in bail. The presiding judge ruled that she would stand trial once, for all of the charges against her, rather than be tried separately on each.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{building}} a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest vessels that were planned <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> appropriate. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for trans-shipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 {{as a result of}} the Six-Day War reinforced the economic viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus avoiding the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal.|$|E
5000|$|Stevens's main {{assertion}} {{was that}} using magnitude estimations/productions respondents {{were able to}} make judgements on a ratio scale (i.e., if x and y are values on a given ratio scale, then there exists a constant k such that x = ky). In the context of axiomatic psychophysics, [...] formulated a testable property capturing the implicit underlying assumption this assertion entailed. Specifically, for two proportions p and q, and three stimuli, x, y, z, if y <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> p times x, z <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> q times y, then t = pq times x should be equal to z. This amounts to assuming that respondents interpret numbers in a veridical way. This property was unambiguously rejected ( [...] , [...] ). Without assuming veridical interpretation of numbers, [...] formulated another property that, if sustained, meant that respondents could make ratio scaled judgments, namely, if y <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> p times x, z <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> q times y, and if y <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> q times x, z <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> p times y, then z should equal z. This property has been sustained in a variety of situations ( [...] , [...] ).|$|R

5|$|Although {{plans for}} further heavy bomber attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took place. One {{of the options}} considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> impractical as little was known about the suitability of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not {{make contact with the}} enemy.|$|E
5|$|As a child, {{director}} Pete Docter relocated {{with his}} family to Denmark when his father moved to study the music of Carl Nielsen. While his sisters had an easy time adjusting to the new surroundings, Docter felt he <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> constantly by peers. While other kids were interested in sports, Docter sat alone drawing, a hobby that eventually led him to animation. His social anxiety ended by high school.|$|E
5|$|At 5ft 7in (171cm) in height, Drummond <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> too slight of {{build for}} the {{infantry}} and was instead {{assigned to the}} 2nd Stationary Hospital of the Australian Army Medical Corps as an orderly. In December 1914, Drummond's unit arrived in Egypt. He was sent to Gallipoli in April 1915 and served on a hospital ship, assisting surgeons in candlelit operations on the wounded. Drummond was evacuated later that year, suffering from dysentery. In December, he applied for a transfer to the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and was discharged from the Australian Army in April 1916.|$|E

5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} as she had {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.|$|E

50|$|A major area {{of debate}} {{involves}} consequentialism, in which actions <b>are</b> <b>judged</b> by the potential {{results of the}} act, such as to maximize happiness, called utilitarianism, and deontology, in which actions <b>are</b> <b>judged</b> by how they adhere to principles, irrespective of negative ends.|$|R
5|$|During {{the course}} of the evaluation, the Tri-partite pilots {{developed}} a typical sortie routine for the Kestrel of conducting short take-offs (STO) and returning to base on vertical landings. This manner of operation (STOVL) <b>was</b> <b>judged</b> to be the optimal practice. Operating from rough airstrips was also trialled at nearby RAF Bircham Newton, where the aircraft proved adept at traversing boggy ground and taking off from a variety of temporary ground coverings.
