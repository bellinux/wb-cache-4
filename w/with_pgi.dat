40|$|Individuals with a {{particular}} variant of the gene phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) {{have been shown to}} have superior dispersal capacity and fecundity in the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia), raising questions about the mechanisms that maintain polymorphism in this gene in the field. Here, we investigate how variation in the Pgi genotype affects female and male life history under controlled conditions. The most striking effect is the longer lifespan of genotypes with high dispersal capacity, especially in nonreproducing females. Butterflies use body reserves for somatic maintenance and reproduction, but different resources (in thorax versus abdomen) are used under dissimilar conditions, with some interactions <b>with</b> the <b>Pgi</b> genotype. These results indicate life-history trade-offs that involve resource allocation and genotype!environment interactions, and these trade-offs are likely to contribute to the maintenance of Pgi polymorphism in the natural populations...|$|R
40|$|Frequent extinctions {{of local}} populations in metapopulations create {{opportunities}} for migrant females to establish new populations. In a metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia), more mobile individuals {{are more likely}} to establish new populations, especially in habitat patches that are poorly connected to existing populations. Here we show that flight metabolic rate and the frequency of a specific allele of the metabolic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi) were both highest in newly established, isolated populations. Furthermore, genotypes <b>with</b> this <b>pgi</b> allele had elevated flight metabolic rates. These results suggest that genetic variation in pgi or a closely linked locus has a direct effect on flight metabolism, dispersal rate, and thereby on metapopulation dynamics in this species.

40|$|We report {{identification}} of the Escherichia coli ybhE gene as the pgl gene that encodes 6 -phosphogluconolactonase. A tentative identification was first made based on the known approximate location of the pgl gene and the similarity of the presumptive ybhE-encoded protein sequence to a known Pgl enzyme. To test this notion, the ybhE gene was deleted and replaced with a drug marker. Like previously characterized pgl mutants, the ybhE deletion mutant had a Blu− phenotype (dark-blue staining with iodine due to accumulation of starch after growth on minimal maltose) and demonstrated impaired growth on minimal glucose medium when combined <b>with</b> a <b>pgi</b> mutation. Biochemical assay of crude extracts for 6 -phosphogluconolactonase enzymatic activity showed that ybhE encodes this activity. The ybhE gene was transferred from the E. coli chromosome to an expression vector. This ybhE clone complemented both the precise deletion of the ybhE gene and a larger deletion, pglΔ 8, for the Blu− phenotype and for phosphogluconolactonase activity, confirming that ybhE is the pgl gene. A newly observed phenotype of pgl strains is a lowered frequency of appearance of Bgl+ mutants that can utilize the β-glucoside salicin. This is likely due to poor growth of Bgl+ pgl strains on salicin due to the accumulation of 6 -phosphogluconolactone...|$|R

40|$|Optimization of {{yields and}} productivities in reductive whole-cell biotransformations is an {{important}} issue for the industrial application of such processes. In a recent study with Escherichia coli, we analyzed the reduction of the prochiral β-ketoester methyl acetoacetate by an R-specific alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to the chiral hydroxy ester (R) -methyl 3 -hydroxybutyrate (MHB) using glucose as substrate for the generation of NADPH. Deletion of the phosphofructokinase gene pfkA almost doubled the yield to 4. 8  mol MHB per mole of glucose, and it was assumed that this effect was due to a partial cyclization of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Here, this partial cyclization was confirmed by 13 C metabolic flux analysis, which revealed a negative net flux from glucose 6 -phosphate to fructose 6 -phosphate catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase. For further process optimization, the genes encoding the glucose facilitator (glf) and glucokinase (glk) of Zymomonas mobilis were overexpressed in recombinant E. coli strains carrying ADH and deletions of either pgi (phosphoglucose isomerase), or pfkA, or pfkA plus pfkB. In all cases, the glucose uptake rate was increased (30 – 47 %), and for strains Δpgi and ΔpfkA also, the specific MHB production rate was increased by 15 % and 20 %, respectively. The yield of the latter two strains slightly dropped by 11 % and 6 %, but was still 73 % and 132 % higher compared to the reference strain <b>with</b> intact <b>pgi</b> and pfkA genes and expressing glf and glk. Thus, metabolic engineering strategies are presented for improving yield and rate of reductive redox biocatalysis by partial cyclization of the PPP and by increasing glucose uptake, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that analyzing the behaviour of the complex intracellular biological networks is important for breeding industrially useful microorganisms. However, because {{of the complexity of}} these biological networks, it is currently not possible to obtain all the desired microorganisms. In this study, we constructed a system for analyzing the effect of gene expression perturbations on the behavior of biological networks in Escherichia coli. Specifically, we utilized 13 [*]C metabolic flux analysis (13 [*]C-MFA) to analyze the effect of perturbations to the expression levels of pgi and eno genes encoding phosphoglucose isomerase and enolase, respectively on metabolic fluxes. Results We constructed gene expression-controllable E. coli strains using a single-copy mini F plasmid. Using the pgi expression-controllable strain, we found that the specific growth rate correlated <b>with</b> the <b>pgi</b> expression level. 13 [*]C-MFA of this strain revealed that the fluxes for the pentose phosphate pathway and Entner-Doudoroff pathway decreased, as the pgi expression lelvel increased. In addition, the glyoxylate shunt became active when the pgi expression level was almost zero. Moreover, the flux for the glyoxylate shunt increased when the pgi expression level decreased, but was significantly reduced in the pgi -knockout cells. Comparatively, eno expression could not be decreased compared to the parent strain, but we found that increased eno expression resulted in a decreased specific growth rate. 13 [*]C-MFA revealed that the metabolic flux distribution was not altered by an increased eno expression level, but the overall metabolic activity of the central metabolism decreased. Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of perturbed expression of pgi and eno genes on changes in metabolic fluxes in E. coli quantitatively, metabolic sensitivity analysis was performed. As a result, the perturbed expression of pgi gene had a great impact to the metabolic flux changes in the branch point between the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway, isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction, anaplerotic pathways and Entner-Doudoroff pathway. In contrast, the impact of perturbed eno expression to the flux changes in E. coli metabolic network was small. Conclusions Our results indicate that the response of metabolic fluxes to perturbation to pgi expression was different from that to eno expression; perturbations to pgi expression affect the reaction related to the Pgi protein function, the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction, anaplerotic reactions and Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Meanwhile, eno expression seems to affect the overall metabolic activity, and the impact of perturbed eno expression on metabolic flux change is small. Using the gene expression control system reported here, it is expected that we can analyze the response and adaptation process of complex biological networks to gene expression perturbations. </p...|$|R

Three hundred and sixty invasive H. influenzae isolates were collected as part of Active Bacterial Core surveillance within the Georgia Emerging Infections Program between 1 January 1989 and 31 July 1998. All isolates were biotyped, serotyped by slide agglutination serotyping (SAST), and evaluated using PCR capsule typing. Nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) isolates were probed with Hib cap-gene-containing plasmid pUO 38 and with IS 1016; a subset was examined <b>with</b> phosphoglucose isomerase (<b>pgi)</b> genotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Discrepancies between SAST and PCR capsule typing were found for 64 / 360 (17. 5 %) of the isolates; 48 encapsulated by SAST were NTHi by PCR, 8 NTHi by SAST were encapsulated by PCR, 6 encapsulated by SAST were a different capsule type by PCR, and 2 encapsulated by SAST were capsule-deficient Hib variants (Hib-minus). None of the PCR-confirmed NTHi isolates demonstrated homology with residual capsule gene sequences; 19 / 201 (9. 5 %) had evidence of IS 1016, an insertion element associated with division I H. influenzae capsule serotypes. The majority of IS 1016 -positive NTHi were biotypes I and V and showed some genetic relatedness by PFGE. In conclusion, PCR capsule typing was more accurate than SAST and Hib-minus variants were rare. IS 1016 was present in 9. 5 % of NTHi isolates, suggesting that this subset may be more closely related to encapsulated organisms. A better understanding of NTHi may contribute to vaccine development...|$|R

40|$|The present {{experiments}} {{were designed to}} complement previous studies suggesting that aspects of male rat copulatory behavior are modulated by a descending serotonergic (5 -HT) inhibitory pathway originating in the nucleus paragigantocellularis (PGi) and terminating in the lumbosacral spinal cord. In Experiment 1, intact and PGi-lesioned male rats were evaluated for copulatory behavior following treatment with saline, the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT), or the 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonist 1 -(m-chlorophenyl) piperazine (MCPP). Animals <b>with</b> <b>PGi</b> lesions receiving saline or 8 -OH-DPAT showed a marked facilitation of copulatory behavior whereas animals <b>with</b> <b>PGi</b> lesions that received MCPP did not show such facilitation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with primary pulmonary hypertension who respond to vasodilators acutely, survival {{can be improved}} by the long term use of calcium channel blockers. However, testing for such a response with calcium channel blockers or prostacyclin (PGI 2) may cause hypotension and adversely affect gas exchange. Nitric oxide (NO), which does not have these effects, could be a better test agent. METHODS: NO (10, 20, and 40 ppm for 15 minutes), PGI 2 (1 [...] > 10 ng/kg/min), and oral nifedipine (10 mg, then 20 mg/h) were administered sequentially to 10 patients after determination of the 24 hour spontaneous variability of their pulmonary and systemic mean arterial pressures. Patients were considered responders if the mean pulmonary artery pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 20 % or more. RESULTS: Six patients (60 %) responded to all three agents, and three to none of the agents. One patient responded to PGI 2 only. In those who responded to vasodilators, NO had no major effect on gas exchange or systemic haemodynamics, while PGI 2 and nifedipine both induced systemic hypotension (mean (SD) systemic arterial pressure 72 (14) versus 89 (19) mm Hg <b>with</b> <b>PGI</b> 2 and 72 (15) versus 86 (17) mm Hg with nifedipine, p < 0. 05) and hypoxaemia (PaO 2 8. 7 (1. 4) versus 10. 8 (1. 0) kPa <b>with</b> <b>PGI</b> 2 and 8. 6 (1. 4) versus 10. 2 (1. 5) kPa with nifedipine, p < 0. 05) and increased venous admixture (28 (9) versus 14 (4) % <b>with</b> <b>PGI</b> 2 and 22 (9) versus 13 (5) % with nifedipine, p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: NO inhalation can accurately predict a vasodilator response to nifedipine in {{patients with}} severe pulmonary hypertension without adverse effects on systemic haemodynamics and gas exchange. This absence of side effects may make it a more appropriate agent for testing the vasodilator response. ...|$|E

Recently, we have found that the half-life of PGI 2 was prolonged through stabilization by HDL.

Methods: In 10 septic patients with altered mental status, stable hemodynamic status, and normal lactatemia, we investigated the effects of successive infusions of dobutamine at 5 μg/kg/min and PGI 2 at 5 ng/kg/min on mean blood flow velocity in a middle cerebral artery, using transcranial Doppler flowmetry. Results: Mean flow velocity increased with dobutamine (from 52 ± 4 to 62 ± 6 cm/s, P <. 005) but not <b>with</b> <b>PGI</b> 2 (from 55 ± 5 to 57 ± 5 cm/s, P = not significant).

With each agent, mean flow velocity was correlated with cardiac index (r =. 51, P <. 001) but not with arterial pressure. PGI 2 reduced PaO 2 from 103 ± 10 to 82 ± 6 mm Hg (P <. 005).

We provide new data concerning 15 -PGDH expression in human AAA, showing that 15 -PGDH is upregulated in AAA and mainly expressed in infiltrating leukocytes.

Platelets that had been preincubated and washed in the presence of PGE 1 and later resuspended in the absence of PGE 1 responded fully to activation by thrombin despite maximal phosphorylation of P 22 and P 24. Furthermore, addition of PGI 2 to PGE 1 -washed platelets prevented thrombin-induced platelet activation, but did not evoke further phosphorylation of P 22 or P 24. Phosphorylation of P 39 and P 50 correlated better <b>with</b> <b>PGI</b> 2 -induced inhibition of platelet activation. In experiments in which PGE 1 -induced inhibition of platelet activation was overcome by the addition of thrombin, no dephosphorylation of proteins phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent kinases was observed. These experiments indicate that: (a) phosphorylation of rap 1 B and glycoprotein Ib is not related to platelet inhibition by cyclic AMP; (b) phosphorylation of other proteins such as P 39 and P 50 probably plays a role in mediating cyclic AMP-dependent platelet inhibition; (c) reactions other than cyclic AMP-dependent protein phosphorylation may participate in platelet inhibition by cyclic AMP...|$|E
40|$|With an {{objective}} {{to develop and}} utilize genomics tools for pigeonpea improvement, pigeonpea researchers from leading institutes from India including National Research Centre on Plant Biotechnology (NRCPB) (New Delhi), ICRISAT (Patancheru), Indian Institute of Pulses Research (IIPR) (Kanpur), University of Agricultural Sciences (Dharwad), Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Agricultural University (Akola) and Banaras Hindu University (BHU) (Varanasi) established the Pigeonpea Genomics Initiative (PGI) {{under the leadership of}} Dr NK Singh of NRCPB. The first phase of the PGI was funded by Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) under the umbrella of Indo-US Agricultural Knowledge Initiative (AKI). In the 1 st Project Coordination Meeting of the PGI on 10 November 2006 (see photo), the “Asha” variety of pigeonpea was selected as a standard genotype for developing the genomic resources such as microsatellites, ESTs (expressed sequence tags), bacterial artificial chromosomel (BAC) libraries and for mapping and TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genome) populations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Growth {{impairment}} {{remains a}} major concern in children with Crohn's disease, but evidence remains unclear, in particular, whether steroid use is implicated. We aimed to (1) determine the frequency of temporary (TGI) and permanent (PGI) growth impairment in children administered steroids and (2) examine whether cumulative steroid administration was associated with TGI and/or PGI. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in patients with Crohn's disease (< 18 yr) administered steroids at the gastroenterology clinics of Sainte-Justine Hospital, Montreal. Steroid dosage, height during follow-up, adult height (after age 20), and parental heights were ascertained. Patients with height z score <- 1. 64 on more than 1 occasion before age 18 were considered as patients with TGI. Patients with adult heights < 8. 5 cm below the expected target heights were considered as patients <b>with</b> <b>PGI.</b> Association between steroid dosage and TGI/PGI was studied using logistic regression analyses. Data from the Swiss IBD Cohort Study were analyzed for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 221 children were studied. Approximately 19...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} Matricaria recutita extract on acute pain in the {{presence}} and absence of flumazenil (antagonist of benzodiazepine) and lesioned paragigantocellularis (PGi) nucleus was investigated. Method: Wistar male rats (250 ± 20 g) were used. Animals were grouped randomly into intact, sham and bilateral lesion of PGi nucleus. Intact and lesioned animals, each divided into 4 subgroups which received saline, M. recutita hydro-alcoholic extract (25 mg/kg), flumazenil (1 mg/kg) and flumazenil + M. recutita. Hot plate test were used for pain thereshold evaluation. Results: Results showed that: In intact animals M. recutita induced analgesic effect but flumazenil had significant hyperalgesic effect. In these animals flumazenil prevented the analgesic effects of M. recutita. Lesion of PGi induced significant hyperalgesia. M. recutita in absence of PGi nucleus showed significant analgesic effect and flumazenil increased pain sensation and caused significant hyperalgesia. The analgesic effect of M. recutita attenuated by flumazenil in absence of PGi nucleus. Conclusion: It seems that PGi nucleus involves in pain modulation but analgesic effect of M. recutita that may be via the benzodiazepine-like activity of some its components does not interact <b>with</b> <b>PGi</b> nucleus...|$|E
40|$|Operators {{of parking}} {{guidance}} and information (PGI) systems often have difficulty in providing the best car park availability information to drivers in periods of high demand. A new PGI configuration model {{based on the}} optimized combination method was proposed by analyzing of parking choice behavior. This article first describes a parking choice behavioral model incorporating drivers perceptions of waiting times at car parks based on PGI signs. This model was used to predict the influence of PGI signs on the overall performance of the traffic system. Then relationships were developed for estimating the arrival rates at car parks based on driver characteristics, car park attributes {{as well as the}} car park availability information displayed on PGI signs. A mathematical program was formulated to determine the optimal display PGI sign configuration to minimize total travel time. A genetic algorithm was used to identify solutions that significantly reduced queue lengths and total travel time compared with existing practices. These procedures were applied to an existing PGI system operating in Deqing Town and Xiuning City. Significant reductions in total travel time of parking vehicles <b>with</b> <b>PGI</b> being configured. This would reduce traffic congestion and lead to various environmental benefits...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} rapid {{identification}} method for a Chinese green tea <b>with</b> <b>PGI,</b> Anji-white tea, by class modeling techniques and NIR spectroscopy. 167 real and representative Anji-white tea {{samples were collected}} from 8 tea plantations in their original producing areas for model training. Another 81 non-Anji-white tea samples of similar appearance were collected from 7 important tea producing areas and used for validation of model specificity. Diffuse NIR spectra were measured with finely ground tea powders. OCPLS and SIMCA were {{used to describe the}} distribution of representative Anji-white tea objects and predict the authenticity of new objects. For data preprocessing, smoothing, derivatives, and SNV were applied to improve the raw spectra and classification performance. It is demonstrated that taking derivatives and SNV can improve classification accuracy and reduce the complexity of class models by removing spectral background and baseline. For the best models, the sensitivity and specificity were 0. 886 and 0. 951 for OCPLS, 0. 886 and 0. 938 for SIMCA with SNV spectra, respectively. Although it is difficult to perform an exhaustive analysis of all types of potential false objects, the proposed method can detect most of the important non-Anji-white teas in the Chinese market...|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of vascular grafts for {{coronary artery bypass}} surgery is crucial for a positive outcome. This study aimed to establish a novel line of vascular endothelial cells with a potent anticoagulant effect. A lentiviral vector was used to stably transfect human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) <b>with</b> <b>PGI</b> 2 S alone (HUVEC-PGI 2 S) or both PGI 2 S and tPA (HUVEC-PGI 2 S-tPA). Both HUVEC-PGI 2 S and HUVEC-PGI 2 S-tPA cells over-expressing PGI 2 S and tPA were compared to mock-transfected cells. The enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISAs) demonstrated that the anticoagulation components, ATIII and PLG, were up-regulated and coagulation factor FVIII was down-regulated in both cell lines. QRT-PCR and western blotting demonstrated the vasodilation and platelet disaggregation proteins PKA, PKC, and PTGIR were up-regulated in both cell lines, but MAPK expression was not altered in either cell line. However, cell viability and colony formation assays and cell cycle analysis demonstrated that both cell lines had a lower rate of cell growth and induced G 1 phase arrest. HUVEC-PGI 2 S and HUVEC-PGI 2 S-tPA cells have a potent anticoagulant effect and their use in vascular heterografts may decrease the risk of thrombosis...|$|E
40|$|Prostacyclin (PGI 2) modulates {{platelet}} activation to regulate haemostasis. Evidence has emerged {{to suggest that}} thrombi are dynamic structures with distinct areas of differing {{platelet activation}}. It was hypothesised that PGI 2 could reverse platelet spreading by actin cytoskeletal modulation, leading to reduced capability of platelet aggregates to withstand a high shear environment. Our data demonstrates that post-flow of PGI 2 over activated and spread platelets on fibrinogen, identified {{a significant reduction in}} platelet surface area under high shear. Exploration of the molecular mechanisms underpinning this effect revealed that PGI 2 reversed stress fibre formation in adherent platelets, reduced platelet spreading, whilst simultaneously promoting actin nodule formation. The effects of PGI 2 on stress fibres were mimicked by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and prevented by inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA). Stress fibre formation is a RhoA dependent process and we found that treatment of adherent platelets <b>with</b> <b>PGI</b> 2 caused inhibitory phosphorylation of RhoA, reduced RhoA GTP-loading and reversal of myosin light chain phosphorylation. Phospho-RhoA was localised in actin nodules with PKA type II {{and a number of other}} phosphorylated PKA substrates. This study demonstrates that PGI 2 can reverse key platelet functions after their initial activation and identifies a novel mechanism for controlling thrombosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} prostaglandins (PGs) of the A series (A 1 and {{dimethyl}} PGA 2), El, D 2, F 2 ~ and PGI 2 (prostacyclin) and of inhibitors of PG synthesis (aspirin and indomethacin) on the pathogenicity of vaccinia virus was studied in BALB/c mice. PGs of the A series, D 2 and F 2 ~ conferred {{little or no}} protection to mice against he lethal effects of vaccinia virus. Mice treated with PGEI showed {{a dramatic increase in}} mortality after viral infection. However, when mice were treated <b>with</b> <b>PGI</b> 2, their survival was greatly enhanced. Mice treated with aspirin and indomethacin showed a marked increase in mortality. Increased mortality correlated with higher virus yields in target issues (spleen) and with inhibition of antibody response, whereas the increase in survival correlated with lower virus yields and with normal antibody responses. The significance of our findings is that PGI 2 can block the outcome of the disease caused by vaccinia virus whereas other PGs and their inhibitors not only worsen the disease, but may activate and enhance viral infections through immune suppression. Results of experiments performed in tissue culture cells have suggested that prostaglandins (PGs) may play an important role during viral infection. However, contrasting results have bee...|$|E
