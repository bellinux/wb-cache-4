Basically CS is used to enhance the image quality, which helps to further process the image in later stages. Combination of these two approaches is quite new, but the results are very good.

The objective of this paper is to characterize the current position of the Czech <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> production and foreign trade in the world. Czech Republic is the main world producer of <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> and price maker of the European and world prices. With regards to trade, the Czech Republic is also the main producer and seller both in Europe and in the world. The <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> crop grown in the Czech Republic is mainly produced for exports, because the domestic consumption consists of only between four and five thousand tons. Major export markets of Czech <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> are European countries with a population of Slavic origin or those influenced by Slavic cuisine. Another important markets are overseas countries, that were settled by Slavic immigrants. The paper stresses out the position of the Czech Republic as a major player in the world market with <b>poppy</b> <b>seed.</b> The paper provides analysis of the market position of the Czech production and Czech foreign trade participation. Development of production and trade, as well as some other factors affecting the <b>poppy</b> <b>seed</b> economy, are analyzed such as prices, hectarage, yields, volume of production and volume of trade.
