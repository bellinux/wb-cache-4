5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against the {{discrimination}} faced {{by women and}} minorities in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>It</b> Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable reproductive health care for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E

5000|$|In February 2011 David Bennett, newly {{appointed}} Chair of Monitor, said the NHS could become like other privatised utilities, so that Monitor would potentially be a regulator like Ofcom, Ofgem and Ofwat: [...] "We, in the UK, {{have done this}} in other sectors before. <b>We</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in gas, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in power, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in telecoms … We've <b>done</b> <b>it</b> in rail, we've <b>done</b> <b>it</b> in water, so there's actually 20 {{years of experience in}} taking monopolistic, monolithic markets and providers and exposing them to economic regulation."

He played all the instruments except drums, which were contributed by Starr. The simple lyric was very much in Lennon's style, and Lennon was annoyed about not being asked to play on it. McCartney suggested it was [...] "tit for tat" [...] as he had not contributed to [...] "Revolution 9".|$|E

History teacher James Corcoran noted that working at the first year school was an opportunity to develop its community, saying [...] "You oftentimes will go into a school as a teacher, or even a principal, and it's 'This is the way <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> around here.'

500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2009, Mike Shinoda {{revealed}} info on {{the album}} in a Billboard magazine story, saying: [...] "I feel like we've been writing a lot. I'd say we've got about half the music done, though I shouldn't say halfway because {{who knows how long}} the next batch of songs will take. But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation {{and for the rest of}} the week we just go and work on whatever we find exciting." [...] He also explained the experimentation that the band would be working with, saying, [...] "It's not going to be Hybrid Theory. It's not going to be Minutes to Midnight. And if <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success is that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, {{he hopes to}} show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|After this album, {{the group}} planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to {{facilitate}} their solo careers. Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years?

500|$|Marvel Comics {{editor-in-chief}} Joe Quesada felt dissolving the Peter Parker and Mary Jane {{marriage and}} returning Spider-Man to his roots {{was necessary to}} preserve the longevity of the character for the next 20 or 30 years. Quesada said he and other previous editors-in-chief had long been seeking an opportunity to begin a new methodology in which to tell Spider-Man stories, but had not found a reasonable way to do so. Quesada said, [...] "It's very easy to un-marry a character, or fix something like that: you just do a huge universal retcon, and say a few events in history didn't happen. But that's really not the way <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> here at Marvel." [...] Quesada found an opportunity to address this in {{the events of the}} 2007 Civil War mini-series, which resulted in the unmasking of Spider-Man's identity to the public. Quesada knew J. Michael Straczynski was planning to end his run as a Marvel writer, so he personally approached Straczynski to propose [...] "One More Day" [...] as his final project.|$|E
500|$|While El Broide of People Magazine {{wrote that}} the single is {{performed}} in English and French, website Aficia's Valentin Malfroy noted that Spanish is also incorporated, also pointing out a male voice providing vocals for the refrain sung with a strong African accent. However, {{in an interview with}} Romanian station Kiss FM, Inna explained that the chorus is written in a language created by her and her label Global Records, further stating that, [...] "At Global Records, we stay so much together that we don't understand ourselves in Romanian, but also not in any other language. So we thought to create an own language. If the ones from Game of Thrones can do it, then why can't <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as well?" [...] People Magazine called the track a [...] "catchy" [...] tropical house song that [...] "effortlessly blends together" [...] tropical sounds with a Middle Eastern flair, along with [...] "simple and cheesy" [...] lyrics. Jonathan Currinn from Outlet Magazine labelled [...] "Heaven" [...] an [...] "exotic anthem", while Urban.ro called it a dance-pop song with exotic elements.

500|$|For {{most of the}} film, Berry's character, Turner, the 9-1-1 operator, does {{stay inside}} [...] "the hive" [...] before {{becoming}} {{actively involved in the}} search for Breslin's character, Welson, the kidnapped caller. D'Ovidio chose two female leads, explaining, [...] "I wanted strong women... I think it was appropriate here, since most 911 call operators are women." [...] Berry remarked, [...] "I love the idea of being a part of a movie that was so empowering for women. We don't often get to play roles like this, where ordinary people become heroic and do something extraordinary." [...] D'Ovidio chose to tell the story from the perspective of two characters—the operator and the caller—believing that it would become repetitive if it focused on only one. As a result, he switched perspectives every ten pages when writing the screenplay. As well as collaborating on the story with his wife, Nicole and Jon Bokenkamp, he accepted suggestions from Berry, Breslin and Eklund: [...] "Halle came in with some great notes and Abigail and Michael and it started to flesh things out. I'm not one to say 'no' to a great suggested line of dialogue. It just makes me look better as a writer! I feel it's a very collaborative process, and some of the happiest accidents happen when you just listen to people. When someone comes up to you and says, 'Why don't <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> this way?' I think that it's important to listen." ...|$|E

500|$|Around this time, Fuller {{was hoping}} to prepare a {{biography}} of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but felt that she could work on it only if she traveled to Europe. Her father's death and her sudden responsibility for her family caused her to abandon this idea. In 1836, Fuller was given a job teaching at Bronson Alcott's Temple School in Boston, where she remained for a year. She then accepted an invitation to teach under Hiram Fuller (no relation) at the Greene Street School in Providence, Rhode Island, in April 1837 with the unusually high salary of $1,000 per year. Her family sold the Groton farm and Fuller moved with them to Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. On November 6, 1839, Fuller held the first of her [...] "conversations", discussions among local women who met in the Boston home of the Peabodys. Fuller intended {{to compensate for the}} lack of women's education with discussions and debates focused on subjects including the fine arts, history, mythology, literature, and nature. Serving as the [...] "nucleus of conversation", Fuller also intended to answer the [...] "great questions" [...] facing women: [...] "What were we born to do? How shall <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> which so few ever propose to themselves 'till their best years are gone by". A number of significant figures in the women's rights movement attended these gatherings, including Sophia Dana Ripley, Caroline Sturgis, and Maria White Lowell.|$|E
500|$|Fellini was {{a notorious}} perfectionist, {{and this could}} be trying for his cast. At an American Film Institute student seminar, Quinn spoke of Fellini's intransigence over {{selecting}} a box in which Zampanò carries his cigarette butts, scrutinizing over 500 boxes before finding just the right one: [...] "As for me, any of the boxes would have been satisfactory to carry the butts in, but not Federico". Quinn also recalled being particularly proud of a certain scene in which his performance had earned applause from onlookers on the set, only to receive {{a phone call from}} Fellini late that night informing him {{that they would have to}} re-do the entire sequence because Quinn had been too good: [...] "You see, you're supposed to be a bad, a terrible actor, but the people watching applauded you. They should have laughed at you. So in the morning <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again." [...] As for Masina, Fellini insisted that she re-create the thin-lipped smile he had seen in her childhood photographs. He cut her hair by putting a bowl on her head and shearing off anything that wasn't covered up, afterwards plastering what remained with soap to give it a [...] "spiky, untidy look", then [...] "flicked talc into her face to give it the pallor of a kabuki performer."
