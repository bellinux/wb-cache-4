40|$|Enhancing {{consumer}} {{value is}} {{an increasingly important}} trend in tourism and hospitality, yet the process remains poorly understood by researchers and managers. Wine tourism destinations, <b>wineries,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cellar</b> doors provide the perfect setting for investigating consumer value as they involve a range of attributes. Review and analysis of previous studies reveals the key attributes that must be provided, the most important involving excellent service quality and the setting and surroundings of each winery visited. Significantly, value-for-money is not an attribute sought by wine tourists, indicating that quality wine producers may receive a premium for their product through the provision of valuable wine consumer experiences. Thirteen extant studies of wine tourism experiences {{across a range of}} wine regions are meta-analyzed to identify and classify the key attributes. Studies are both qualitative and quantitative, and both approaches provided findings that are merged into a single matrix of key attribute types. The management and research implications for wine tourism are then discussed, as well as the limitations of analysis that combines qualitative and quantitative findings in multiple locations over time...|$|R

50|$|In 1930, {{after the}} lease on the {{vineyards}} was not renewed, the Rabaud estate was run as one with Fernand Ginestet as tenant of both Sigalas-Rabaud and Rabaud-Promis. During the 1930s and 1940s, the labels {{of the wine}} showed both names. However, these were difficult time for the estate, due {{to a number of}} poor vintages in the 1930s and a poor wine market during the World War. In 1950, the Ginestet family {{wanted to get rid of}} their Rabaud holdings in order to buy Château Margaux. The descendants of the Sigalas family descendants were unwilling to own all of Rabaud, and the holdings were sold to the Dejean family, which put an end to the joint running of Rabaud. On the Sigalas side, Marquis de Lambert des Granges, whose wife was of the Sigalas family, took control over Sigalas-Rabaud. He invested in a new <b>winery</b> <b>and</b> <b>cellar.</b> Since the marketing situation was difficult at this stage, the approach chosen was to sell it exclusively through a succession of négociant houses, including Savour Club. This resulted in income to cover the fixed costs, but meant that Sigalas-Rabaud was not part of the regular Bordeaux trade.|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide greater {{understanding}} of wine tourist behaviour through profiling wine tourists. Demographic segmentation alone is a poor predictor of tourist behaviour (Prentice et al., 1998), whilst there is a general preference for psychographic segmentation. Many studies have evaluated wine region attributes, however, it is important to recognize that the importance of these attributes differ based on the wine tourist profile in question. Profiling also includes attitudes toward wine regions, satisfaction of previous visits and future intentions to visit. ?Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach was used, collecting data from a total of 650 wine consumers within Australia through self-administered surveys and online/email self-administered surveys. Data analysis techniques used included exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and analysis of variance (ANOVA). ?Findings Four wine tourist profiles were explored: the wine lover, the wine interested tourist, the wine curious tourist and the disinterested wine tourist. Significant differences were found between the four wine profiles with regard to important wine region attributes, satisfaction and attitudes toward wine regions and future intentions to visit a wine region. ?Practical implications The outcome of this research provides greater understanding of wine tourist segments. Profiling wine tourists provides <b>wineries</b> <b>and</b> <b>cellar</b> doors the opportunity to build strong relationships with each wine tourist profile through understanding their expectations of the wine tourism experience.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discern the intra-regional visitation {{patterns}} of wine tourists. Exploratory research was conducted in two branded wine regions, to conceptualise the spatial movement of wine tourists in a theoretical construct. Design/methodology/approach – Information was obtained from a random sample of 214 visitors to 25 wineries in two branded wine regions in South Australia. Data were collected by means of face-to-face interviews using a highly structured questionnaire at each of the winery cellar door venues. Findings – A conceptual theory regarding winery visitation sets (VSs) was developed. Discernable spatial visitation patterns to wineries result from the dynamic interaction of visitors’ needs <b>and</b> the incumbent <b>winery</b> profiles that exist in a hierarchy within a wine region. The grouping of sequentially visited wineries in the three-tier hierarchy form specific VSs of wineries. Winery profiles are initially determined by visitation incidence: the most visited Regional Centre Point (RCP) winery is followed by sequentially less visited regional profile (RP) <b>wineries</b> <b>and</b> a third tier of regional attribute (RA) wineries. Visitation pattern trends are identifiable and differ between first-time and repeat visitors. Research limitations/implications – It is possible to detail the market segmentation of wine tourists quite accurately in terms of their psychographics and demographics and favoured visitation patterns within the branded wine region. This will also provide important insights into the balance of <b>winery</b> <b>and</b> <b>cellar</b> door roles in the region and confirm the “optimal” number of wineries required to fulfil the needs of the ever-increasing numbers of wine tourists. Originality/value – This paper is of value to academic researchers, wine industry practitioners and travel and accommodation providers alike as it provides the foundation for a conceptual theory to explain the discernable intra-regional visitation patterns of wine tourists to the cellar doors of <b>wineries.</b> Karin Alant <b>and</b> Johan Bruwe...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims to {{show the}} extent to which the wine {{production}} sector in the Penedes Denominacio dOrigen responded to the challenges posed both in terms of supply (consolidation and emergence of producing countries outside the traditional European sphere) and demand (fall in wine consumption and new consumer habits). It looks at the evolution of the sector in the region from the beginning of the 1940 s up to present day. With the end of the 1936 - 1939 Civil War the sector had to deal with a fall-off in production, though it continued to take shape around the traditional wine trade. This situation changed when, at the end of the 1960 s, demand increasingly turned towards higher quality bottled wines. From the legislative standpoint, the response centred on technological innovation and company restructuring. This period saw the introduction of new equipment and processes, such as stainless steel tanks and controlled- temperature fermentation, with bottled wines pushing out bulk wine and the large warehouses giving way to <b>wineries</b> <b>and</b> <b>cellars.</b> In addition, one of the main features of the 1970 - 1985 period was the formation of the big wine and cava business conglomerates. Spains entry into the European Union in 1986 accelerated this transformation process, leaving the sector made up of companies that produced both wines and cavas, introduced red and varietal wines into the range of products they offered, owned many hectares of vines and in many cases showed a clear intention to enter the international market. exports, penedes, cava, production, catalonia, wine...|$|R

50|$|In 1892 {{he ordered}} the {{construction}} of the <b>winery</b> <b>and</b> wine <b>cellar</b> of the establishment. The cellar, with stone walls of two feet wide, maintained the conditions of constant temperature and humidity. Featuring a very modern facility for the time, it had two hydraulic presses, fermentation vats of concrete and 42 large oak barrels purchased in the workshops of Adolphe Fruhinsholz at Nancy (France). They were brought from France unarmed and each of it´s parts (called staves) had recorded the year they were built next to the signature of the manufacturer and a numbered brand that allowed to join them again. It´s a unique collection in the country, which fascinates for it´s quantity and quality of conservation and which coexists with modern French and American oak barrels where the best wines have their upbringing. The winery had attached a building for the production of olive oil. He also planted many olive trees, which most of them are still in perfect conditions with more than 100 years of age. They are represented on a flanking olive way access of about 200 meters.|$|R
