He later wrote that Newman [...] "galvanised television drama... a climate in which boldness paid." [...] In contrast, Don Taylor, who was a director in the drama department at the time, later claimed that he felt Newman was unsuited to the position of Head of Drama, writing: [...] "To put it brutally, I was deeply offended that the premier position in television drama, at a time <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was the National Theatre of the Air, had been given to a man whose values were entirely commercial, and who had no more than a layman's knowledge of the English theatrical tradition, let alone the drama of Europe and the wider world." ...|$|E

Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "this spirited rendition captured [...] jaunty essence", and Strecker noted with her [...] "B+" [...] that [...] "this was the moment <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> kicked in that the show {{will never be the}} same". Chaney also complimented Finn for having gotten [...] "the hang of this whole singing-and-dancing thing in the last three episodes of this season" [...] and gave a grade of [...] "B". She gave an [...] "A" [...] to [...] "In My Life", sung by the underclassmen, and said [...] "the harmonies sounded lovely"; Bell called it [...] "a perfect song to signify graduation". Others were less enthusiastic: Futterman {{described it as}} [...] "a blended-past-recognition, laden-with-harmonies Beatles tune" [...] and the point where the show [...] "entered sappy hour", and Slezak said it was [...] "not the most ringing endorsement for the National Champions' 2013 chances" [...] and graded it a [...] "C+".|$|E

The family was so poor that young Jimmie {{did not have a}} bed in which to sleep until he was nine years old. Davis was not sure of his date of birth; according to the New York Times, [...] "Various newspaper and magazine articles over the last 70 years said he was born in 1899, 1901, 1902 or 1903. He told The New York Times several years ago that his sharecropper parents could never recall just when he was born – he was, after all, one of 11 children – and that he had not had the slightest idea <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> was." [...] According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Davis was not sure exactly how old he was, noting only that he was born {{around the turn of the}} last century." [...] The birth date listed on his Country Music Hall of Fame plaque is September 11, 1902. However, the 1900 US Census attests to his being born in September 1899.|$|E

60|$|If we {{are going}} to teach {{children}} we must teach them first to move. And not by rule or mental dictation. Horror! But by playing and teasing and anger, and amusement. A child must learn to move blithe and free and proud. It must learn the fullness of spontaneous motion. And this it can only learn by continuous reaction from all the centers, through all the emotions. A child must learn to contain itself. It must learn to sit still if need be. Part of the first phase of education is the learning to stay still and be physically self-contained. Then a child must learn to be alone, and to adventure alone, and to play alone. Any peevish clinging should be quite roughly rebuffed. From the very first day, throw a child back on its own resources--even a little cruelly sometimes. But don't neglect it, don't have a negative attitude to it. Play with it, tease it and roll it over as a dog her puppy, mock it when it is too timorous, laugh at it, scold it <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> bothers you--for a child must learn not to bother another person--and when it makes you genuinely angry, spank it soundly. But always remember that it is a single little soul by itself; and that the responsibility for the wise, warm relationship is yours, the adult's.|$|E

60|$|Hauntings may be visual, auditory, or {{confined}} {{to the sense of}} touch. Auditory effects are produced by flutterings of air, noises are caused, steps are heard, laughter, and moaning. Lares domestici (brownies) mostly make a noise. Apparitions may be in tactile form of men or animals, or monsters. As for effects, some ghosts push the living and drive them along, as the Bride of Lammermoor, in Law's Memorialls, was 'harled through the house,' by spirits. The spirits of an amorous complexion seem no longer to be numerous, but are objects of interest to Thyraeus as to Increase Mather. Thyraeus now raises the difficult question: 'Are the sounds heard in haunted houses real, or hallucinatory?' Omnis qui a spiritibus fit, simulatus est, specie sui fallit. The spirits having no vocal organs, can only produce noise. In a spiritual hurly-burly, some of the mortals present hear nothing (as we shall note in some modern examples), but may they not be prevented from hearing by the spirits? Or again, the sounds may be hallucinatory and only some mortals may have the power of hearing them. If there are visual, there may also be auditory hallucinations. {133} On the whole Thyraeus thinks that the sounds may be real on some occasions, when all present hear them, hallucinatory on others. But the sounds need not be produced on the furniture, for example, when they seem to be so produced. 'Often we think that the furniture has been all tossed about, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> has not been stirred.' The classical instance of the disturbances which aroused Scott at Abbotsford, on the death of his agent Bullock, is in point here. 'Often a hammer is heard rapping, when there is no hammer in the house' (p. 82). These are curious references to phenomena, however we explain them, which are still frequently reported.|$|E
5000|$|On first down, Johnson spiked {{the ball}} to stop the clock.

On the next play, with the down marker showing second down <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was <b>really</b> third down, the Buffaloes made the same call and Bieniemy was again stopped short of the end zone. Johnson then spiked the ball (thinking it was third down <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was <b>really</b> fourth) to stop the clock with two seconds left.
