50|$|In Wi-Fi technology, a {{wireless}} link is established between a device called {{wireless access point}} (generally near the PC) and a device called a <b>wireless</b> <b>node,</b> which is interfaced to the CNC machine. There is one access point and multiple nodes. Each wireless access point and <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> has one IP address. This IP address must be of the same domain name as the PC. Thus {{a wireless}} Ethernet link is created. The <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> has an RS-232 port, which is connected to an RS-232 port of the CNC machine. Driver software on the PC maps the RS-232 port of the <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> as a virtual COM port of the PC. Once this is done, the DNC software {{takes care of the}} two-way data transfer.|$|E

50|$|This {{protocol}} was designed {{under the assumption}} that all nodes have the same transmission ranges, and does not solve the hidden terminal problem. The RTS/CTS frames cancause a new problem called the exposed terminal problem in which a <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> that is nearby, but is associated with another access point overhears the exchange and thenis signaled to backoff and cease transmitting for the time specified in the RTS.|$|E
3000|$|The <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes</b> in the {{heterogeneous}} {{wireless communication}} network have mobility. The channel characteristics are dynamic, and neighborhood relationships among <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes,</b> cooperative relationship and competitive relationship are also changing dynamically. The source node {{always wants to}} pay only the lowest cost of the <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes</b> participating in the cooperation, so that the secret communication rate satisfying its full requirement can be obtained. Assuming that the minimum security rate of the source node is R_s^ 0, then R_s>R_s^ 0 [...] is needed.|$|R

50|$|Arbitration inter-frame spacing (AIFS), in {{wireless}} LAN communications, is {{a method}} of prioritizing one Access Category (AC) over the other, such as giving voice or video priority over email. AIFS functions by shortening or expanding the period a <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> has to wait before it is allowed to transmit its next frame. A shorter AIFS period means a message has a higher probability of being transmitted with low latency, which is particularly important for delay-critical data such as voice or streaming video.|$|E
5000|$|Transmission: if {{the medium}} was {{identified}} as being clear or the node received a CTS to explicitly indicate it can send, it sends the frame in its entirety. Unlike CSMA/CD, it is very challenging for a <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> to listen {{at the same time}} as it transmits (its transmission will dwarf any attempt to listen). Continuing the wireless example, the node awaits receipt of an acknowledgement packet from the Access Point to indicate the packet was received and checksummed correctly. If such acknowledgement does not arrive in a timely manner, it assumes the packet collided with some other transmission, causing the node to enter a period of binary exponential backoff prior to attempting to re-transmit.|$|E

The system is netted and distributed. Every MEADS battle manager, radar, and launcher is a <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> on the network. By virtue of multiple communications paths, the network can be expanded or contracted as the situation dictates and precludes single point failure if one node becomes inoperable. It also has a plug-and-fight capability that allows MEADS launchers and radars to seamlessly enter and leave the network without shutting it down and interrupting ongoing operations. MEADS uses open, non-proprietary standardized interfaces to extend plug-and-fight to non-MEADS elements. This flexibility is new for ground-based AMD systems.|$|E

Despite numerous technological advancements in wireless network security, it is still very difficult to protect the wireless ad-hoc networks {{because of lack of}} centralized traffic concentration, thus requiring monitoring the behavior of individual wireless nodes.

For security of the mobile agents, we are sending a dummy agent to the <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> which will first check if the node is malicious or not. If node is not malicious then the dummy agent acknowledges to the source station and source station node transfers the actual mobile agent to the <b>wireless</b> <b>node.</b> In case the mobile agent suffers some intrusions at the <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> then to cope up with that another supervisor agent is also transferred along with the mobile agent. This supervisory agent informs to the source station about the intrusions or kills the mobile agent at <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> before intruder infects to it.

30|$|For {{deployments}} {{where the}} gateway node has sufficient processing power, constrained <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes</b> can be relaxed {{by the use}} of sequence numbers for transmitted packets. CLC will then run on the gateway node, which communicates changes to allowed data rates to the <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes</b> as well as for its own transmission over the wireless channel. When communicating these changes, the gateway node also offsets the sequence number of each node so that it knows which packets are issued before and after the change, respectively. For example, for each node, it may offset the sequence numbers with a value power of two higher than the last seen packet that arrived. Such an offset can be efficiently implemented using bit shift by the <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes</b> and will hence impose minimal overhead to these constrained devices.|$|R

40|$|TCP {{unfairness}} {{problem in}} access networks using the 802. 11 {{has been studied}} by many researchers. Their solutions required that the existing MAC protocol be modified. However, since they did not consider the case when each <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> has a different number of flows, they cannot provide fairness among wireless nodes having different numbers of flow in both directions. In order to resolve this problem, Weighted Window and Class-Based Weighted Window methods are proposed. In the Weighted Window method, each <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> can control the rate of TCP flows based on TCP window size. By applying this method, per-station fairness can be achieved, regardless of the number and direction of flows in each <b>wireless</b> <b>node.</b> Furthermore, to improve and to provide fair bandwidth allocation in the Weighted Window method when the users have different requirements, the Class-Based Weighted Window method is proposed. Therefore, for wireless nodes with different requirements, fair allocation bandwidth between wireless nodes {{in the same class}} of bandwidth is achieved. </p...|$|E
40|$|Stochastic network {{calculus}} {{provides an}} elegant way to characterize traffic and service processes. However, little {{effort has been}} made on applying it to multi-access communication systems such as 802. 11. In this paper, we {{take the first step}} to apply it to the backlog and delay analysis of an 802. 11 wireless local network. In particular, we address the following questions: In applying stochastic network calculus, under what situations can we derive stable backlog and delay bounds? How to derive the backlog and delay bounds of an 802. 11 <b>wireless</b> <b>node?</b> And how tight are these bounds when compared with simulations? To answer these questions, we first derive the general stability condition of a <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> (not restricted to 802. 11). From this, we give the specific stability condition of an 802. 11 <b>wireless</b> <b>node.</b> Then we derive the backlog and delay bounds of an 802. 11 node based on an existing model of 802. 11.

30|$|In addition, the <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes</b> in the {{heterogeneous}} {{wireless communication}} network have mobility, {{the relationship between}} nodes changes and the channel characteristics between the <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes</b> are in dynamic change. Therefore, the relative relationship among the <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes</b> (neighborhood relationship, collaboration relationship, competition relationship) is also changing dynamically. At the same time, mobile <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes</b> generally belong to different subjects and have selfishness. Their participation in collaboration always chooses strategies that are more favorable to themselves. Therefore, in order to motivate the trustworthy relay nodes to actively participate in the cooperation, the source node with confidential information transmission requires a certain cost {{to compensate for the}} energy consumption which is used by the cooperation node to help it to complete the secure communication. On the other hand, the source node always wants to pay only less cost to the <b>wireless</b> <b>nodes</b> participating in cooperation, so that it can get satisfactory results. In this way, the source node will choose those third party trusted nodes with low power price and greater help to participate in collaboration. This requires the reasonable pricing of the potential <b>wireless</b> relay <b>nodes,</b> which can occupy the advantages that should be occupied in many alternative relay nodes and obtain the relative maximum income. For example, in the vegetable market, a single merchant raising the price will only make it difficult to sell their own goods, to their own losses. And if a merchantâ€™s product cost is lower, it can objectively sell the goods at a price lower than the market price, thus gaining more sales and profits. Based on this consideration, the relationship between the source node and the trusted relay nodes which participates in the cooperative secure transmission is modeled as the Stackelberg game, and the relationship between the competing trusted relay nodes is modeled as a noncooperative game.|$|R
30|$|Multiple-Channel Model. In this model, {{infrastructure}} and ad-hoc transmissions operate at nonoverlapping frequency ranges. Wireless nodes {{in the coverage}} of a BT can simultaneously communicate with the BT using infrastructure mode and other wireless nodes using ad-hoc mode. Moreover, every BT node has multiple wireless channels, and so it can communicate with multiple wireless nodes simultaneously. Wireless nodes use OR and BTs use UR to forward packets. If the Candidate Relay Set (CRS) of a <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> consists of a BT and some wireless nodes, the <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> simultaneously employs {{infrastructure and}} ad-hoc transmissions to push the same packet to the BT and wireless nodes, respectively.|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, {{we study}} {{how to perform}} routing when each <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> is selfish, i. e., a <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> will always {{maximize}} its own benefit. Traditionally, it is assumed {{by the majority of}} the routing protocols for wireless networks that each <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> will forward the packets for other nodes if it is asked to do so. However, this assumption may not be true in practice, especially when the wireless devices are owned by individual users. A node will deviate from a routing protocol if it will gain more benefit by doing so. In this chapter, we assume that each <b>wireless</b> <b>node</b> will incur a cost when it forwards a unit of data for some other nodes. A node will forward the data only if it gets a payment to compensate its cost. Its profit (or called utility) will then be the payment minus its cost if it did forward the data. For a multicast with a source node and a set of receiver nodes, we assume that they will pay the relay nodes to carry the traffic from the source to receivers. We assume that the cost of each agent is private and each agent can manipulate its reported cost to maximize its utility. A payment scheme is strategyproof if every agent maximizes its utility when it reports its cost truthfully. In this chapter, we propose several strategyproof mechanisms for multicast for selfish wireless networks when each node has a cost of forwarding a unit data based on various structures. We prove that each of our payment schemes is optimum for the corresponding structure used...|$|E
