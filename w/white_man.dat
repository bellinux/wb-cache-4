5|$|Longstanding racial {{tensions}} between {{whites and blacks}} exploded in five days of violence that started on July 27, 1919. On that hot summer day, on a segregated Chicago beach, a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> was throwing rocks at black swimmers in the water at a beach on the South Side which resulted in Eugene Williams' death. Tensions escalated when a white police officer not only failed to arrest the <b>white</b> <b>man</b> responsible for Williams' death, but arrested a black man instead. Objections by black observers were met with violence by whites. Attacks between white and black mobs erupted swiftly. At one point, a white mob threatened Provident Hospital, many of whose patients were African American. The police successfully held them off.|$|E
5|$|Clarence Edward Smith {{was born}} on February22, 1928, and raised in Danville, Virginia, with his five {{brothers}} and one sister. During his childhood, Virginia was racially segregated, and he witnessed incidents of racism, including a fight between his father and a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> that was sparked by racial tensions. In 1946, he moved with his mother to New York City, where they settled in Harlem. He attended only two years of high school.|$|E

5|$|In March 1955, Claudette Colvin, a black fifteen-year-old schoolgirl in Montgomery, {{refused to}} give up her bus seat to a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> in {{compliance}} with Jim Crow laws, which were local regulations in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation. King was on the committee from the Birmingham African-American community that looked into the case; because Colvin was pregnant and unmarried, E. D. Nixon and Clifford Durr decided to wait for a better case to pursue.|$|E
5|$|Indiana put further {{restrictions}} on African Americans, prohibiting them from testifying {{in court in}} a case against a <b>white</b> <b>man.</b> The new constitution of 1851 expanded suffrage for white males, but excluded blacks from suffrage. While the state did not have legal segregation, it excluded black children from public schools {{as a matter of}} custom.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{was taught}} Indian Sign Language by the Crow. This {{would be a}} great help to him in his {{research}} as the language was common to all the plains tribes.

Together with co-author Margot Liberty, Stands in Timber published Cheyenne Memories shortly before he died in 1967.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Betty Jean Owens, an African-American woman, {{was brutally}} raped by four <b>white</b> <b>men</b> in Tallahassee.

5|$|Native Americans {{also used}} {{the area around the}} Cascades for their agriculture, leading them to often congregate in the region. As a result, gold miners {{eventually}} reached the area in the 1870s-1890s, searching for resources and rich land. The first <b>white</b> <b>man</b> recorded to observe the mountainDaniel Lindsleywas an employee of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company searching for possible railroad routes when he saw it in 1870.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man and a <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> both glistening with sweat and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, {{it is likely that}} it was painted over a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|Though {{research}} suggests William Edward White {{was the first}} African-American baseball player in MLB, unlike White who passed as a <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> Walker was open about his black heritage, and often faced racial bigotry prevalent in the late 19th century. His brother, Weldy, became the second black athlete to do so later in the same year, also for the Toledo ball club. Walker played just one season, 42 games total, for Toledo before injuries entailed his release.|$|E

5|$|Amid PCC/ZAPU's {{calls for}} various strikes and protests, {{including}} an appeal for black children to boycott state schools, Smith's Justice Minister Clifford Dupont had Nkomo and other PCC/ZAPU leaders restricted at Gonakudzingwa {{in the remote}} south-east two days after Smith took office. The politically motivated killing of a <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> Petrus Oberholzer, near Melsetter by ZANU insurgents on 4 July 1964 marked the start of intensified black nationalist violence and police counteraction that culminated in the banning of ZANU and PCC/ZAPU on 26 August, {{with most of the}} two movements' respective leaders concurrently jailed or restricted. ZANU, ZAPU and their respective guerrilla armies—the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)—thereafter operated from abroad.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} Sam Mendes’ films; American Beauty (1999), Revolutionary Road (2008) and Away We Go (2009). These films explicitly scrutinize <b>white</b> {{middle class}} <b>men</b> using {{a version of}} the colonial, white, male gaze. As this gaze is re-turned onto <b>white</b> <b>men,</b> instead of emphasising a collective and privileged identity, individuality is highlighted, showing <b>white</b> <b>men</b> to be confused and powerless. This chapter argues that the white gaze that disempowered the marginal for so long works in a very different way when applied to <b>white</b> <b>men</b> and Mendes’ injunction to ‘look closer’ in fact allows them to melt back into invisibility...|$|R

5|$|In August 1922, a {{traveling}} salesman named Jack Eaton {{was arrested for}} allegedly assaulting several young girls. The girls' parents refused to press charges, and Eaton was released. Later, he was captured by a mob, who cut him several times and poured turpentine into his wounds. An investigation found that the Scott County sheriff had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though Eaton was a <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> blacks were elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Sayers and Bears {{teammate}} Brian Piccolo {{became the}} first interracial roommates in the NFL. Sayers' ensuing friendship with Piccolo and Piccolo's struggle with cancer (embryonal cell carcinoma, which was diagnosed after it metastasized to a large tumor in his chest cavity), {{became the subject of}} the made-for-TV movie Brian's Song. The movie, in which Sayers was portrayed by Billy Dee Williams in the 1971 original and by Mekhi Phifer in the 2001 remake, was adapted from Sayers' account of this story in his 1970 autobiography, I Am Third. A notable aspect of Sayers' friendship with Piccolo, a <b>white</b> <b>man,</b> and the first film's depiction of their friendship, was its effect on race relations. The first film was made in the wake of racial riots, escalating racial tensions fueled by Martin Luther King's assassination, and charges of discrimination across the nation. Sayers and Piccolo were devoted friends and deeply respectful of and affectionate with each other. Piccolo helped Sayers through rehabilitation after injury, and Sayers was by Piccolo's side throughout his illness until his death in June 1970.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1851, Tubman {{returned}} to Dorchester County {{for the first time}} since her escape, this time to find her husband, John. She once again saved money from various jobs, purchased a suit for him, and made her way south. John, meanwhile, had married another woman named Caroline. Tubman sent word that he should join her, but he insisted that he was happy where he was. Tubman at first prepared to storm their house and make a scene, but then decided he was not worth the trouble. Suppressing her anger, she found some slaves who wanted to escape and led them to Philadelphia. John and Caroline raised a family together, until he was killed 16 years later in a roadside argument with a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> named Robert Vincent.|$|E

In particular, it finds that approximately 44 % of the racial earnings gap results from higher average skill and work experience levels of <b>white</b> <b>men.</b> ...|$|R

He added, however, {{that he was not}} sure whether the <b>white</b> <b>men</b> had been killed by the Kaffirs or by other <b>white</b> <b>men</b> with whom they had quarrelled.

5|$|Reports were {{received}} in January 1849 that some Aboriginal {{people had been}} killed near Guichen Bay. On 19 February, the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse arrived in the district to investigate. He began his inquiries, assisted by a mounted policeman, an interpreter, and an Aboriginal guide. An Aboriginal witness, Leandermin, took Moorhouse {{to the site of}} the alleged crime. He told Moorhouse that he and a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> named Parker were walking along a road when they heard shots. He went to see what was happening, and from behind some trees, saw four or five Aboriginal women lying on the ground with fresh wounds. He also saw others on the ground, who he presumed were dead because they were not moving. Two white men were present, Leandermin identified Brown as one of them, and stated that Brown had a gun in his hand.|$|E
5|$|In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer {{was murdered}} while alone {{at her house}} on May 8, 1916. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well {{respected}} in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated {{with a team of}} law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black man who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible; one of them stated that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him {{in front of the house}} wearing blood-stained overalls. He attributed the stains to a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after his arrest that he had been in an altercation with a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> a few days before the murder.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the forest was visited by {{mountain}} men and explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger. Colter {{is the first}} <b>white</b> <b>man</b> known to have visited both the Yellowstone region and the forest, which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Colter requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the Rocky Mountains during their return journey from the Pacific Ocean. Colter teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, Colter then explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole. Colter survived a grizzly bear attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who had taken his horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.|$|E
