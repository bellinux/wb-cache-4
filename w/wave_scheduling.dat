40|$|Decentralized {{operating}} systems that control large multicomputers need techniques to schedule competing parallel programs called task forces. <b>Wave</b> <b>scheduling</b> is a probabilistic technique {{that uses a}} hierarchical distributed virtual machine to schedule task forces by recursively subdividing and issuing wavefront-like commands to processing elements capable of executing individual tasks. <b>Wave</b> <b>scheduling</b> is highly resistant to processing element failures because it uses many distributed schedulers that dynamically assign scheduling responsibilities among themselves. The scheduling technique is trivially extensible as more processing elements join the host multicomputer. A simple model of scheduling cost is used by every scheduler node to distribute scheduling activity and minimize wasted processing capacity by using perceived workload to vary decentralized scheduling rules. At low to moderate levels of network activity, <b>wave</b> <b>scheduling</b> is only slightly less efficient than a central scheduler {{in its ability to}} direct processing elements to accomplish useful work...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for the rolling <b>wave</b> <b>scheduling.</b> The methodology aims {{to manage the}} cost and risk of delay of the project by identifying the best schedule using the available information. The literature shows the absence of specific quantitative algorithms for the rolling wave schedule {{since most of the}} approaches are merely qualitative. Therefore it is necessary to define and test a new methodology to evaluate the overall alternatives. This new approach first lists all the possible schedules than evaluate each schedule with a real option based optimization model. The methodology described has been implemented in Matlab, in order to perform the related sensitivity analysis. The results show how this approach is able to reduce both the expected cost and the variance respect to a not real option approach...|$|E

40|$|Because {{radio waves}} decay rapidly in sea water, {{acoustic}} communication {{is the most}} popular choic for underwater sensor networks. However, since the propagation speed of acoustic waves are 3 orders slower than radio <b>waves,</b> <b>scheduling</b> techniques designed for radio-based communication systems may not be suitable for underwater use. We consider how to time schedule each link in a broadcast domain once. We show that, unlike its terrestrial RF counterpart, this problem is NP complete. We then use a complete SAT solver to investigate the relation between the schedule length and the satisfiability of a given network. In radio-based communication systems, the minimum schedule length is equal to the number of transmitters located in the same broadcast domain. However, {{this is not the case}} for underwater acoustic setting. The minimum schedule length can be smaller due to the fact of nonnegligible propagation delay. Counter-intuitively, under certain circumstances, it can also be larger than the number of transmitters. We then mathematically analyze a randomized scheduler and present its performance in terms of the average successful transmissions and throughput, with considerations of scheduling length, node density, and packet length.

5000|$|Shovelhead, stylized SHOVELHEAD, is a Canadian {{rock band}} formed in 1995 in Montreal, Canada. The band {{consists}} of Marko Rakic (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Nikola Rakic (drums, backing vocals), Youri Targiroff (lead guitar, backing vocals) and Alexander Rakic (bass, backing vocals). Before the name SHOVELHEAD was chosen in 1995, all four members had played informally together or together {{as part of}} cover bands from their teenage years on. It was during the period {{just prior to the}} recording of their debut album, Pocus Cadabra, that the quartet first decided to take a more serious approach. Their first originals were recorded by Canadian platinum producer Glen Robinson and released independently as a full length CD titled Pocus Cadabra in 1996. SHOVELHEAD eventually secured management with entertainment attorney Jonathan Levin in Los Angeles in late 1997 and signed with Chicago based independent label QED Entertainment. SHOVELHEAD moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 1998 and showcased for several major labels in the Los Angeles area seeking major label distribution. Although no contracts materialized, SHOVELHEAD continued promoting themselves as independent artists. As the importance of major labels continued to wane, the band continued self promoting and touring and continued to record and release material independently. SHOVELHEAD followed the release of Pocus Cadabra with two more full length studio recordings, Dark Horse (1999) produced by SHOVELHEAD and recorded and mixed by producer Glen Robinson and Arson & Lace (2007). Although Arson & Lace was recorded in 2003, it was shelved and only released in 2007 due to contractual obligations. SHOVELHEAD is currently working on their fourth full length recording tentatively titled Killer <b>Waves</b> <b>scheduled</b> for release early spring 2015.|$|R

40|$|To {{cope with}} the {{challenge}} of Europe's rapid population ageing, it is important to improve our understanding of the complex linkages between economic, health, and social factors determing {{the quality of life of}} the older population. These interactions take place at the individual level in the first place, they are dynamic - as ageing is a process, not a state in time - and they must be related to a country's welfare regime. So far, however, cross-nationally comparable, longitudinal micro-data on the economic, social, and health situation of older people in Europe were missing. The 'Survey of Health, Ageing and Retrirement in Europe' (SHARE) is closing this gap. So far, SHARE collected data on health, social, and economic situation of more than 30, 000 individuals ageg 50 or older. In 2004, a baseline wave of data collection was conducted in 11 countries, ranging from Scandinavia (Denmark and Sweden) through Central Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands) to the Mediterranean (Spain, Italy and Greece). In 2005 - 06, further SHARE data were collected in Israel. For the second wave of data collection, which was conducted in 2006 - 07, two 'new' EU memeber states - the Czech Republic and Poland - as well as Ireland joined SHARE. The survey's third <b>wave,</b> which is <b>scheduled</b> for 2008 - 09, will focus on the collection of detailed life-histories of respondents who participated in previous waves. Further waves are being planned to take place on a biennial basis. Substantively, SHARE provides an infrastructure helping researchers to understand better the individual and population ageing process: where we are, where we are heading to and how we can influence the quality of life as we age - both as individuals and as societies. Methodologically, SHARE provides a unique opportunity to address a broad range of survey-research issues against the background of an ongoing large-scale corss-national study with a longitudinal perspective. This chapter focuses on methodological issues onf SHARE. It begins with a history of the SHARE baseling wave (Section 2), focussing on efforts made to ascertain cross-national comparability. We then describe the 'longitudinal' experiences from the survey's second round (Section 3), followed by an overview of the preparations for collecting life-histories in wave 3 (Section 4). The final Section 5 concludes with an outlook on the future of SHARE...|$|R
40|$|When a {{selected}} sample member refuses {{to take part}} in a survey interview, the survey organization may not accept the refusal as a final outcome, but rather to make further attempts to convert the refusals into an interview. The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of refusals conversion and the propensity of the converted refusals to respond at later waves in a longitudinal survey. A two-stage stratified randon sampling scheme was used with households in Oyo as the sampling unit. A sample of 750 households were randomly selected from the community and sub-divided into five equal groups with each group treated as a <b>wave.</b> The recording <b>schedule</b> was used to obtain information on demographic characteristics including survey process, external environment, age, gender, educational qualification, religion, employment status, family size, duration of interview and the type of questions. The data were collected through oral interview of the subjects. Summary statistics were constructed to look at the patterns of conversion of refusals. Logistic model was fitted to investigate the propensity of converted refusals to respond at later waves following a conversion. At wave 1 of the survey, 109 house heads were interview in households with a response rates (in percentage) of 72. 67. The interview period was an average of 8 minutes per house head. The response rate at wave 2, wave 3, wave 4 and wave 5 were 82, 81. 33, 82 and 80. 67 respectively. Outcomes of a conversion attempt were a full interview and a proxy interview. Five house heads went through the conversion process at wave 1 and data were successfully collected on 2 of them (40 %). All of them were interviewed again at wave 2 (100 %). Those converted refusals at wave 1, 100 % gave a full interview six months later. For house heads who were converted between wave 1 and wave 5 continued to give full interviews at every wave up to wave 5. For all other waves, the converted refusals participated throughout the survey. Logistic model showed that, those who were converted to a full interview rather than proxy interview were the most likely to give a full interview at subsequent wave. When we included in the model, information on the wave in which the initial conversion was took place and the time since conversion, we found that those whose initial conversions were in earlier and later waves were less likely to give a full interview compared with those were converted at wave 3. Adding demographic information suggested that male, people with their ages between ((30 âˆ’ 50) years, respondents with primary education were likely to take part again following a conversion. </p...|$|R
