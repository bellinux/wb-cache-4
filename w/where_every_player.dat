2500|$|The {{existence}} of pure strategy Nash equilibrium is guaranteed in potential games, and multiple Nash equilibria may exist. Learning algorithms such as [...] "best response" [...] and [...] "better response" [...] can only {{guarantee that the}} iterative learning process can converge {{to one of the}} Nash equilibria (if multiple). Equilibrium selective learning algorithms aim to design a strategy where convergence to the best Nash equilibrium, with respect to the potential function, is guaranteed. In, the authors propose an equilibrium selective algorithm named MaxLogit, which provably converges to the best Nash equilibrium at the fastest speed in its class, using mixing rate analysis of induced Markovian chains. In a special case <b>where</b> <b>every</b> <b>player</b> shares the same objective function (hence the potential function), and possibly the same action set, the problem is equivalent to distributed combinatorial optimization which arises in many engineering applications. Equilibrium selective learning algorithms such as MaxLogit can be used in such combinatorial optimizations, even in a distributed fashion.|$|E

Likewise, we find fruit in mishearings and happy accidents recognising that paths through are sometimes oblique or followed without intention; they flow intuitively from improvisations where the outcome can’t be known but is often far more beautiful than could ever have been planned. Music is a form of recycling <b>where</b> <b>every</b> new <b>player,</b> <b>every</b> new listener, makes new, unique and often very personal meaning from essentially the same set of notes or sounds.

40|$|THE Voronoi game on graphs {{consists}} of a graph G(V, E) and k players (k < n = |V |). The graph induces a distance between vertices d: V × V → N ∪ {∞}, which {{is defined as the}} minimal number of edges of any connecting path, or infinite if the vertices are disconnected. The strategy set of each player is V. A strategy profile of k players is a vector f = (f 1, [...] ., fk) associating each player to a vertex. For every vertex v ∈ V — called customer — the distance to the closest facility is denoted as d(v, f) : = minfi d(v, fi). Customers are assigned in equal fractions to the closest facilities as follows.

40|$|A {{completely}} uncoupled dynamic is {{a repeated}} play of a game, <b>where</b> each period <b>every</b> <b>player</b> knows only his action {{set and the}} history of his own past actions and payo¤s. One main result is that there exist no completely uncoupled dynamics with …nite memory that lead to pure Nash equilibria (PNE) in almost all games possessing pure Nash equilibria. By "leading to PNE " we mean that the frequency of time periods at which some PNE is played converges to 1 almost surely. Another main result is {{that this is not the}} case when PNE is replaced by "Nash "-equilibria": we exhibit a completely uncoupled dynamic with …nite memory such that from some time on a Nash "-equilibrium is played almost surely...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a setting <b>where</b> <b>every</b> pair of <b>players</b> that interact (e. g. exchange goods or information) create a surplus. An interaction {{can take place}} only if the players involved have a connection. If the connection is direct the two players split the surplus equally while if it is indirect then intermediate players also get {{a share of the}} surplus. Thus individuals form links with others to create surplus, to gain intermediation rents and to circumvent others who are trying to become intermediary. Our principal result is that strategic link formation in such a setting leads to the star network. In a star a single agent acts as an intermediary for all transactions and there is significant payoff inequality across ex-ante identical players...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a setting <b>where</b> <b>every</b> pair of <b>players</b> can exchange goods {{and that this}} exchange yields a fixed surplus. This exchange can take place only if the players have a connection. This connection can be direct {{in which case the}} two players split the surplus equally. We suppose that exchange can also occur if there is an indirect connection, in other words where there is one or more players in the path between the two players in question. In case of indirect connection, we require that <b>every</b> <b>player</b> essential to the transaction gets an equal share of the surplus. This formulation gives rise to three types of incentives for forming links. One, individuals would like to join the network so as to create exchange possibilities which in turn create surpluses. Two, there are rewards from being essential: players would like to place themselves between unconnected others to extract rents from intermediation. The third incentive to form links arises out of the desire to circumvent intermediaries. Our main result is that, so long as costs of forming links are not very small, the unique equilibrium network is a star. In this network a single agent is essential for all bilateral exchange and there is significant inequality in payoff distribution...|$|R
50|$|Deathmatches have {{different}} rules and goals {{depending on the}} game, but {{an example of a}} typical FPS-deathmatch session is <b>where</b> <b>every</b> <b>player</b> is versus every other player. The game begins with each player being spawned (starting) at random locations—picked from a fixed predefined set. Being spawned entails having the score, health, armor and equipment reset to default values which usually is 0 score, full (100%) health, no armour and a basic firearm and a melee weapon. After a session has commenced, arbitrary players may join and leave the game on an ad hoc basis.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other games, {{players are}} free to choose what weapons they want to use. There are no classes (although players can choose {{predefined}} and editable weapon configurations) or a money system used to buy weapons. Instead, FireArms uses a credit system <b>where</b> <b>every</b> <b>player</b> can spend 30 credits {{to his or her}} liking. Every player receives a free knife regardless of the weapons configuration they choose. Players can spend their credits on weapons and equipment, ammunition is free and can be obtained from ammunition boxes available throughout most maps for when a player runs out.|$|E
50|$|The tournament was {{the first}} to use the new format, similar to the one used in the minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events, <b>where</b> <b>every</b> <b>player,</b> {{including}} members of the top 16, started in the first round. Some of the sport's biggest names did not reach the tournament's final stage. Reigning world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan withdrew for personal reasons shortly before his qualifying match against Michael Wasley. World number one Mark Selby lost his qualifying match 3-5 to Andrew Pagett. World number four Shaun Murphy also exited the tournament at the qualifying stage, losing 1-5 to Alex Davies.|$|E
50|$|One Base Denial {{is a team}} game <b>where</b> <b>every</b> team (usually three teams) {{goes for}} one base.

40|$|We {{consider}} a setting <b>where</b> <b>every</b> pair of <b>players</b> can interact (e. g. exchange goods) and this interaction yields a fixed surplus. An interaction {{can take place}} only if the players involved have a connection. This connection may be direct, {{in which case the}} two players split the surplus equally. But the interaction could also be indirect (i. e. involving more than two players in the path), and then <b>every</b> <b>player</b> essential to the connection is assumed to get an equal share of the surplus. In the model, the incentives to forming links derive from the possibilities they avail in three respects: (1) the creation of new interaction opportunities; (2) the rents that can be attained from essential intermediation; (3) the payment of rents that can be avoided by circumventing intermediaries. We focus on an equilibrium notion in which pairs of players may jointly coordinate on the (possibly simultaneous) creation and destruction of the links they control. Our main conclusion is that, so long as costs of forming links are not very small, all (non-empty and strict) equilibrium networks are stars. In such networks, a single agent is essential for all bilateral interaction and there is significant inequality in payoff distribution. We end the paper by showing that the main gist of the analysis is essentially maintained if commitment is ruled out and bilateral deviations are required to be internally consistent...|$|R
50|$|The default game mode {{is ranked}} play, which puts players into 9 {{different}} ranks {{and attempts to}} match players within these ranks; Romino Games subsequently will reward players that finish at the top ranks on {{the completion of a}} season before resetting all rankings. The game's servers will adjust the player's ranking depending on their performance. Within ranked play, no team can have two or more players using the same Awesomenaut character. If necessary, computer-controlled opponents will be used to fill out a team, and if a player drops out of a match, they will be replaced by a computer opponent. Other modes allow for more variations but do not contribute towards ranking. Such modes include skimmishes where the singular character limit is removed, and round-robin modes <b>where</b> <b>every</b> time a <b>player</b> is killed, they are randomly assigned to a new Awesomenaut. Single and local players can also engage in practice matches against computer-controlled teams.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{information sharing}} in a multi-player repeated game. <b>Every</b> round, each <b>player</b> observes {{a subset of}} components of a random vector and then takes a control action. The utility earned by each player depends on the full random vector and on the actions of others. An example is a game where different rewards are placed over multiple locations, each player only knows the rewards in {{a subset of the}} locations, and players compete to collect the rewards. Sharing information can help others, but can also increase competition for desirable locations. Standard Nash equilibrium and correlated equilibrium concepts are inadequate in this scenario. Instead, this paper develops an algorithm <b>where,</b> <b>every</b> round, all <b>players</b> pass their information and intended actions to a game manager. The manager provides suggested actions for each player that, if taken, maximize a concave function of average utilities subject to the constraint that each player gets an average utility no worse than it would get without sharing. The algorithm acts online using information given at each round and does not require a specific model of random events or player actions. Thus, the analytical results of this paper apply in non-ergodic situations with any sequence of actions taken by human players. Comment: 14 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
