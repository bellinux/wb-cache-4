Even though the effect of the SOC on soil aggregation seems to be more evident in the <b>wet-sieved</b> aggregates (Puget et al. 2000), the aggregates obtained from dry sieving might have more information on the processes occurring in situ.

40|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} are {{the drivers}} of ecosystem biogeochemistry, but {{the field of}} soil ecology lags behind other biological disciplines in understanding habitat constraints driving biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of these microorganisms. One approach to characterizing habitat at the micro-scale is to subset soil into naturally occurring physical associations of particles, organic matter, and microbes called aggregates. However, classic methods of separating soil aggregates can drastically change microbial communities and activities. In this dissertation, a methodological approach to isolating soil aggregates for biological analysis is refined and then applied to evaluating microbial activity and fungal community structure in three ecosystems managed for bioenergy production. Subsequently, aggregate-scale processes are scaled out to contrast ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in the three ecosystems. Direct contrast of soil extracellular enzyme activities within soil aggregates isolated by traditional slaking means, dry sieving, and optimal moisture found wet sieved large macroaggregates (3 ̆e 2000 µm) had four times greater activity than macroaggregates isolated by the other methods.

40|$|Soil {{aggregates}} are microhabitats for microorganisms, {{and directly}} influence microorganisms that live within and {{are influenced by}} microorganisms in return. Two methods are used to isolate soil aggregates by their size: dry sieving (sieving air-dried soil) and wet sieving (sieving soil in water). <b>Wet-sieving</b> methods are generally considered to represent separation of aggregate classes that are stable to physical disaggregation in water, a condition considered favorable for protecting soil structure over time. However, {{little is known about}} the effect of sieving methods on microbial abundance, diversity, and functions, hindering the understanding of the relationship between soil structure and soil aggregates as habitat and soil microorganisms. In this study, the effect of dry and wet sieving on bacterial diversity, and abundance of microorganisms involved in N fixation (nifH gene), nitrification (amoA bacteria and archaea), and denitrification (narG, nirS and nosZ genes), was determined for four sizes of soil aggregates from a cropland and grassland. Quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR) showed little differences in relative gene abundance between size fractions of soil aggregates, but <b>wet-sieving</b> method significantly increased gene abundance for amoA bacteria, nirS and nosZ genes. When the N functional genes were expressed as percentage of the bacterial 16 S rRNA genes, the wet sieving resulted in significantly higher genes percentage for all the genes (except for narG gene), and significant differences between soil aggregate size fractions at the grassland site. The different sieving methods resulted in different bacterial community compositions, but only the <b>wet-sieving</b> method was able to reveal significant differences in bacterial community composition between soil fractions in grassland. The results demonstrate significantly different quantitative and qualitative interpretation of soil microbial community depending on whether aggregate samples were obtained from wet or dry sieving, highlighting the importance in the choice of the sieving method...|$|R
30|$|Samples for grainsize {{analysis}} were collected {{only for those}} materials that are finer than approximately 10  cm in size. Lahar deposits contain larger clasts (tens of cm to 1  m in size); therefore, the samples represent predominantly matrix fraction of the whole sediments. Sample quantities of about 200 – 1000  g of dry weight for meter-thick deposits and less than 100  g for decimeter- to centimeter-thick deposits were collected. Sandy and gravelly samples were dry-sieved and separated by grain fractions in a phi scale, whereas muddy sediments were <b>wet-sieved</b> after dried samples (weighted) were soaked in water medium, and were separated by a sieve with a mesh size of 63  μm. Grains larger than 63  μm (sand and gravel) were again dry-sieved in a phi scale. Petrography of sieved samples (1 / 4 – 1 / 8  mm fraction) was carried out under binocular and petrographic microscopes. Grainsize for smaller than 63  μm (i.e., mud fraction) was examined by a laser grainsize analyzer, Malvern Mastersizer 3000 at Niigata University.

The ability of a green waste and a yard waste compost to suppress the soil-borne plant pathogens Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini (host: flax), Phytophthora cinnamomi (host: lupin), and Meloidogyne hapla (host: tomato) was determined.

To investigate the mechanisms behind these effects, A. agrestis and the millipede Sigmoria ainsliei (Xystodesmidae) were placed into microcosms with soil and either L horizon, F and H horizon, or a combination L/FH treatment. Microcosms were destructively sampled and reconstructed with the same treatments every four weeks to assess faunal fresh weight change and survival. Soils from earthworm treatments were <b>wet-sieved</b> for cocoons to assess treatment effects on reproduction.

In this study, the effects of test conditions as well as intrinsic soil properties on structural stability were investigated for selected soils from Hamedan Province. Mean weight diameter (MWD) and tensile strength (Y) of aggregates were determined by wet sieving method and indirect Brazilian test, respectively. The soil samples were pre-wetted slowly to matric suction of 200 kPa before the wet sieving. The pre-wetted samples were <b>wet-sieved</b> for 5, 10 and 15 min in order to simulate different hydro-mechanical stresses imposed on soil structure. Tensile strength of soil aggregates were also measured at air-dry and 500 kPa matric suction conditions. Short duration shaking (i. e. 5 min) could effectively discriminate the Hamedan soils in terms of structural stability due to their fairly low aggregate stabilities. The soil organic matter content had the highest impact on MWD followed by both clay and CaCO 3 content. The same was true for the Y values i. e.

Because diatom frustules behave hydrodynamically unlike most mineral grains, these types of particles can theoretically be separated in liquids. Based on this principle, a new method has been developed, which employs split-flow thin fractionation (SPLITT) {{as a tool for}} separating diatom frustules from other sedimentary particles. The SPLITT channel selected for this study had a length of 20 cm, a breadth of 4 cm, and a height of 371 mum. For optimum results, samples were pretreated, e. g., suspended and <b>wet-sieved</b> prior to any processing with the SPLITT cell. The sample concentrations used in the fractionation process were below 0. 1 % (w/v) to minimize particle-particle interaction, which affects the quality of the separation.

A long-term (26 years) tillage experiment in northeast China examined no-tillage (NT), plowing tillage (PT) and deep loosing (DL). The soil samples (from a depth of 0 - 20 cm) were <b>wet-sieved</b> into five aggregate classes (1000 - 2000 mu m, 500 - 1000 mu m, 250 - 500 mu m, 50 - 250 mu m, and 250 mu m) were assessed by CPMAS C- 13 NMR. Macro-aggregates contained more SOC concentration than micro-aggregates. However, PT resulted in a greater SOC concentration in 50 - 500 mu m aggregates. NT and DL increased the active C and decreased the slow C in 500 - 1000 mu m aggregates, whereas PT showed the inverse. The C- 13 NMR spectrum demonstrated that NT increased alkyl-C content, PT obtained a higher carbonyl-C concentration, and DL gained a greater O-alkyl-C concentration. Moreover, evaluating the impacts of tillage systems on the complexity revealed that the most complicated structure was presented in NT, the least in PT, whereas DL had an intermediate effect. Active C contains C 2 -C 6 carbohydrate and anomeric C (Cl) polysaccharides, slow c consists of aldehyde-C, ketonic-C and quinone-C, and the passive C is enriched in aromatic-C.

40|$|A global {{compilation}} of nearly sixty measurement studies {{is used to}} evaluate two methods of simulating the mineral composition of dust aerosols in an Earth system model. Both methods are based upon a Mean Mineralogical Table (MMT) that relates the soil mineral fractions to a global atlas of arid soil type. The Soil Mineral Fraction (SMF) method assumes that the aerosol mineral fractions match the fractions of the soil. The MMT is based upon soil measurements after wet sieving, a process that destroys aggregates of soil particles {{that would have been}} emitted from the original, undisturbed soil. The second method approximately reconstructs the emitted aggregates. This model {{is referred to as the}} Aerosol Mineral Fraction (AMF) method because the mineral fractions of the aerosols differ from those of the <b>wet-sieved</b> parent soil, partly due to reaggregation. The AMF method remedies some of the deficiencies of the SMF method in comparison to observations. Only the AMF method exhibits phyllosilicate mass at silt sizes, where they are abundant according to observations. In addition, the AMF quartz fraction of silt particles is in better agreement with measured values, in contrast to the overestimated SMF fraction. Measurements at distinct clay and silt particle sizes are shown to be more useful for evaluation of the models, in contrast to the sum over all particles sizes that is susceptible to compensating errors, as illustrated by the SMF experiment. Model errors suggest that allocation of the emitted silt fraction of each mineral into the corresponding transported size categories is an important remaining source of uncertainty. Evaluation of both models and the MMT is hindered by the limited number of size-resolved measurements of mineral content that sparsely sample aerosols from the major dust sources.

According to the hierarchical theory, microaggregates {{are assumed to be}} stabilized by persisting binding agents, whereas macroaggregates by transient or temporary organic materials. Humic substances, considered to be recalcitrant, could probably act as persistent binding agents and hence relatively more would be found at microaggregate level. In a long-term experiment established in the early 1960 s in north-eastern Italy, we <b>wet-sieved</b> large macroaggregates into three aggregate-size classes (2000 – 250 ìm, 250 – 53 ìm and b 53 ìm) in contrasting soils (clay, sandy and peaty) fertilized with manure or mineral fertilizers. We analyzed the organic (OC) and humic (HC) carbon of each aggregate fraction, also investigating the molecular weight of the humic substances (HSs) extracted. The aims were to evaluate the effect of the different fertilization types on the aggregates and organic matter distribution and investigate the composition and role of HC as binding agent. The results demonstrated that the addition of manure significantly increased the proportion of macroaggregates with respect to mineral fertilization (605 and 545 g aggr kg. 1 of soil respectively), but only in the clay soil. However, manure application increased the OC and HC concentration in the aggregate fractions with respect to the mineral and control treatment, in all the three soils. Organic carbon concentration generally increased with increasing aggregate size as well as HC that followed the same pattern, showing a very high correlation with OC (rN 0. 95). The HC/OC ratio ranged narrowly among aggregate classes and was not higher at microaggregate level, suggesting no hierarchical role of HC as persisting binding agents. Apparent molecular weight distribution of HC extracted, suggested a likely different origin and chemical composition depending on aggregate fractions and soil...|$|E
40|$|Aggregation is a {{key process}} for soil {{functioning}} as it influences C storage, vulnerability to erosion and water holding capacity. While the influence of soil C content or tillage on aggregation has been documented, much less {{is known about the}} role of soil mineralogy. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine quantitatively if different clay minerals of a temperate soil contribute differently to aggregation and if their contribution is modulated by soil management. We compared the aggregate-size distribution of three cropping systems in a silt loam soil in Versailles (France) : organic cropping system (ORG, tilled yearly), direct seeding mulch-based cropping system (DMC, tilled every 4 years), both from a long-term trial, and a nearby grassland. Soil samples from 0 - 5 cm were <b>wet-sieved</b> to 5 mm and air-dried before aggregate-size separation. For each aggregate class, fraction < 2 µm was separated and analysed using X-ray diffraction. Organic C content was determined both in aggregates and < 2 -µm fractions. C content was lower in ORG than in the two other treatments. The proportion of large-macroaggregates (500 - 5000 µm) was greater in DMC and grassland; while microaggregates (50 - 250 µm) showed greater proportions in ORG. In the three treatments, microaggregates had the greatest amount of clays, with preferential accumulation of smectitic phases. In grassland, clays from all aggregated fractions showed more smectitic phases than free-clay fraction. The results indicate that smectitic phases contributed particularly to the microaggregates dynamics. Their contribution to aggregation was lower for larger aggregate sizes where the influence of organic matter was preponderant. Moreover, it was observed that cultivation (ORG and DMC treatments) reduced the relative enrichment of smectitic phases in stable aggregates which makes them more vulnerable to slaking erosion and alters their physico-chemical function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Erosion soil loss is an {{important}} problem to be solved. Polyacrylamide (PAM), a biodegradable polymer, {{has been used in}} irrigating ditch to reduce soil loss for a long time. It can also be used as an aggregate agent to keep the balance of soil water. The performance of PAM as a soil aggregate agent of silty clay loams was conducted by the <b>wet-sieving</b> method in this study. The effects of PAM on the germination and growth of Bermuda and Bahia were observed. The experiments were conducted in a controlled box with constant temperature and humility. An out-door experiment was also conducted to understand the germination rate of seeds and the development of roots of grasses in ambient condition. Experimental results showed that the addition of PAM would delay the germinations of seeds. However it could enhance the growth of the Bermuda and Bahia grasses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the medieval site of Nogara in the “Basso Veronese ” in Northern Italy. Environmental {{archaeology}} has been included in project planning from an early stage, ensuring establishment of rigorous recovery systems including <b>wet-sieving</b> and flotation for animal and plant remains. Nogara is a wet site, with excellent preservation due {{in some cases to}} waterlogging. Excavation of layers dating to c. 9 th- 11 th c. has yielded many thousands of hand-collected bones and sieved fragments, including a large component of wild mammals birds, and fish. The settlement is documented in the ecclesiastical archives and of interest is the strong monastic influence in the area (in particular exploitation of the forest and wetlands), in addition to the process of “incastellamento”. The site and preliminary faunal information are considered in relation to cultural influences and transformations and previous zooarchaeological research in the Veneto and across Northern Italy...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} species richness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in three distinct forests with Araucaria angustifolia (native forest, reforestation with A. angustifolia and plantation with Pinus taeda) in the "Floresta Nacional de São Francisco de Paula", State of Rio Grande do Sul, also accounting for seasonal variation. Six soil samples from each forest {{were collected from}} Araucaria angustifolia rhizosphere in four seasons during a one-year period, for identification of the AMF species. Spores were extracted by <b>wet-sieving</b> followed by centrifugation in water and 50 % sucrose solution. The greatest richness (16 species) {{was found in the}} Araucaria reforestation and the lowest in the native forest (eight species). The season with higher species richness was different in each site. The most representative genera in all forests were Acaulospora and Glomus. Historical aspects and plant species composition can account for some of the differences among sites...|$|R
