40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} at IKTS was {{the development of a}} new conductor paste for aluminum nitride ceramic substrates, which can be used for lead-free soldering and shows both good film characteristics and good cost-effectiveness. To characterize possible correlations between paste components, like alloying elements, inorganic binder, and film properties different analytical methods were carried out. Microscopy and FESEM were used to characterize surface properties. Adhesion (<b>wire</b> <b>peel</b> test) and solder leach resistance were determined to investigate soldering characteristics. The results show that an influence could be found for the metal alloy composition and for the components of the inorganic binder. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R

When she is killed {{at the end of}} the second Hellraiser film (after Channard throws a knife into her open neck wound), she reverts to her original human form, revealing that she had once been a pretty woman.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{development}} in smart structures has enhanced the great efforts {{in understanding the}} mechanical and thermo-mechanical behaviour of shape-memory alloy (SMA) materials. SMAs, {{in the form of}} wires and strips, have been embedded into advanced composite structures to control the shape and residual stress of the structures. It is well recognised that the mechanical properties of embedded SMA composites are highly dependent on the integrity of the interface, particularly by the existence of high thermal-induced shear stress at the SMA wire/epoxy interface. This paper discusses the debonding failure mechanism of embedded pre-strained SMA wires in an epoxy matrix environment using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. It was found that debonds occurred at the SMA wire/matrix interface for a wire with a pre-strained level of 8 % at a temperature above A sub f. Several cracks in the matrix were found around the wire-end region and arrayed along the circumferential direction. A sharp crack, which was propagated towards the radial direction of the wire, was induced in a matrix with high air-bubble content during the wire /matrix debonding process. The effect of high-temperature treatment of SMAs was also studied. It was found that the surface layer of the <b>wire</b> <b>peeled</b> off when the wire was heated at 773 K for 10 min...|$|R
40|$|Aluminum nitride {{ceramics}} (AlN) {{became of}} interest as substrate material for hybrid manufacturers. Its high thermal conductivity and the TCE {{close to that}} of silicon make it well suited for MCM's and high power circuits. Furthermore it is nontoxic compared to BeO. However the practical use of AlN {{is dependent on the}} availability of reliable metallization technics. Usual thick film pastes which were developed for alumina (Al 2 O 3) often show incompatibility with AlN because of the interaction of the contained inorganic binder (often PbO-B 2 O 3 -SiO 2 glasses) and the substrate during the firing process, resulting in an disturbed interface between the ceramic and the functional layer. This may lead to poor adhesion of conductor paste systems. The investigations made with glasses of the system BaO-SiO 2 -B 2 O 3, which is thermodynamically stable towards AlN, showed the possibility to develop Ag/Pd-conductive pastes with good properties on AlN. Additives which vary the viscosity of the used glasses influence significant the initial adhesion, the adhesion durability after high temperature annealing and the solder wettability of the metallic layer. Crystalline phases caused by the additives seem to be responsible for the increase in adhesion strength. The developed Ag/Pd conductive paste has a sheet resistivity of 20 - 24 mOhm/sq and an inital adhesion of more than 28 N/ 4 qmm (<b>wire</b> <b>peel</b> test). After storage at increased temperature of 150 degree C for 1000 hours the adhesion remains constant at about 20 N/ 4 qmm...|$|R
40|$|Background: Properties of coated archwires, {{which have}} been {{introduced}} for esthetic demands during orthodontic treatments, along {{with the use of}} tooth-colored brackets, are not clear. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the load-deflection and surface properties of coated superelastic archwires with conventional superelastic archwires in conventional and metal-insert ceramic brackets. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 3 types of archwires including ultraesthetic polycoated, ultraesthetic epoxyresin coated and conventional (uncoated) superelastic nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires were used in each of 2 types of brackets including conventional and metal-insert ceramic. To simulate oral environment, all specimens were incubated in artificial saliva using thermocycling model and then were tested in three-bracket bending test machine. Loading and unloading forces, plateau gap and end load deflection point (ELDP) were recorded. Archwires were investigated with a stereomicroscope before and after the experiment. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey tests were used at P< 0. 05. Results: Epoxyresin archwires produced lower forces (19 to 310 gr) compared to polycoated (61 to 359 gr) and NiTi (61 to 415 gr) (P< 0. 0001). The maximum ELDP (0. 43 mm) was observed in epoxyresin archwires (P< 0. 001). Coatings of some epoxyresin wires were torn and of polycoated <b>wires</b> <b>peeled</b> off. Conventional ceramic bracket produced higher loading forces with polycoated and NiTi archwires and lower unloading forces with all 3 types of archwires compared to metal-insert type (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Epoxyresin-coated archwire had the lowest force and highest ELDP. Coatings were not durable in these experimental conditions. Conventional ceramic bracket produced higher frictional force compared to metal-insert type...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{insertion}} of a Totally Implantable Access Port (TIAP) is a routinely employed technique {{in patients who}} need a safe and permanent venous access. The number of TIAP implantations is increasing constantly mainly due to advanced treatment options for malignant diseases. Therefore {{it is important to}} identify the implantation technique which has the optimal benefit/risk ratio for the patient. Study design A single-centre, randomized, controlled superiority trial to compare two different TIAP implantation techniques. Sample size: 160 patients will be included and randomized intra-operatively. Eligibility criteria: Age equal or older than 18 years, patients scheduled for primary elective implantation of a TIAP in local anaesthesia and a signed informed consent. Primary endpoint: Primary success rate of the randomized technique. Intervention: Venae Sectio in combination with the Seldinger Technique (guide <b>wire</b> and a <b>peel</b> away sheath) will be used to place a TIAP. Reference treatment: Conventional Venae Sectio will be used with a direct {{insertion of}} the TIAP without guide <b>wire</b> or <b>peel</b> away sheath. Duration of study: Approximately 20 months. Organisation/Responsibility The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and in accordance with the moral, ethical, and scientific principles governing clinical research as set out in the Declaration of Helsinki (1989) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article aims {{to analyze}} the {{difference}} in stresses generated in the bracket-cement-tooth system {{by means of a}} peel load in single and double-mesh bracket bases using a three-dimensional finite element computer model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A three-dimensional finite element model of the bracket-cement-tooth system was constructed and consisted of 40, 536 bonds and 49, 201 finite elements using a commercial mesh generating programmer (ANSYS 7. 0). Both single and double-mesh bracket bases were modified by varying the diameter from 100 - 400 &# 181;m progressively, and the spacing between the mesh wires was kept at 300 &# 181;m for each diameter of <b>wire.</b> A <b>peel</b> load was applied on the model to study the stresses generated in different layers. RESULTS: In case of double-mesh bracket base, there was reduction in stress generation at the enamel in comparison to single-mesh bracket base. There was no difference in stress generated at the bracket layer between single and double-mesh bracket bases. At the impregnated wire mesh (IWM), layer stresses increased as the wire diameter of the mesh increased. CONCLUSION: Results show that bracket design modification can improve bonding abilities and simultaneously reduce enamel damage while debonding. These facts may be used in bringing about the new innovative bracket designs for clinical use...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—During {{manufacture}} of wire bonding in packaged IC products, {{the breaking of}} bond <b>wires</b> and the <b>peeling</b> of bond pads occur frequently. The result is open-circuit failure in IC products. There were several prior methods reported {{to overcome these problems}} by using additional process flows or special materials. In this paper, a layout method is proposed to improve the bond wire reliability in general CMOS processes. By changing the layout patterns of bond pads, the reliability of bond wires on bond pads can be improved. A set of different layout patterns of bond pads has been drawn and fabricated in a 0. 6 - m single-poly triple-metal CMOS process for investigation by the bond wire reliability tests, the ball shear test and the wire pull test. By im-plementing effective layout patterns on bond pads in packaged IC products, not only the bond wire reliability can be improved, but also the bond pad capacitance can be reduced for high frequency application. The proposed layout method for bond pad design is fully process-compatible to general CMOS processes. Index Terms—Ball shear test, bond pad, bond wire, layout, reli-ability, TAB, wire pull test.

40|$|The {{metallization}} of {{wire bonding}} pads on Si-based integrated circuits (ICs) contains Ti, TiN, and Al layers with vertical W-plugs located through the Ti and TiN layers. One percent Si-Al wire (32 μm in diameter) was bonded on the pads by an ultrasonic transducer using a <b>wire</b> bonding machine. <b>Peeling</b> failures {{occurred during the}} ultrasonic bonding process. The peeling fractures were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. The results showed that bonds peeled off from the interface between the Al layer and the top surface of the W-plugs or from the interface between the Si-base and the bottom surface of the W-plugs. The distribution of W-plugs also affected the bond peeling from the top or bottom surfaces of the W-plugs. Mechanisms giving rise to the peeling failure of bonds were analyzed based on the acoustic impedance of materials, which determined the amount of ultrasonic energy transmitted from one material to another. Two different paths of ultrasonic energy transmission occurred during the bonding process due to the different acoustic impedances of the materials. One is from the Al layer, through the TiN and Ti layers, to the IC. The other is from the Al layer, through the W-plugs, to the IC. The different distributions of ultrasonic energy at the positions with W-plugs and without W-plugs caused stress concentrations around the top or bottom surfaces of the W-plugs, which resulted in peeling failures of the bonds.

40|$|Starch is an {{important}} food carbohydrate, and accounts {{for many of the}} properties of popular starchy foods such as noodles. Generally noodles can be divided into two types: wheat-based noodles (containing gluten) and starch-based noodles (gluten free). Physical properties of wheat noodles blended with buckwheat or millet flour, and mung bean starch noodles blended with other starches were investigated in this study. Commercial buckwheat and millet flour were added to wheat flour at different mixing ratios ranging from 0 – 100 %, and their pasting, thermal, gelling and rheological properties were investigated. Two endotherms were observed during DSC measurement of millet-wheat blends at high mixing ratio, as individual starch tended to gelatinize separately in excess water. Large and mostly non-additive changes were observed in pasting and rheological properties, indicating interactions existed between components. However, within a complex flour-water system, with many variables altered at the same time (protein, lipid, gluten content), it is difficult to accurately model these changes. Mung bean is widely considered as the best material to make starch noodles. Potato, sweet potato, rice and sorghum were added to mung bean starch and their impact on pasting, thermal, swelling, rheological, and gelling properties were studied. Non-additive effects were found in most attributes, and were partially explained by amylose content and particle size distribution. After studies on flour and starch blends, corresponding noodle qualities were investigated. Higher level of buckwheat and millet addition led to a weaker texture in wheat noodles but no big variation in cooking properties. A similar situation was found in most noodles made from starch blends. A 10 % addition of buckwheat and millet to wheat noodles can lower in vitro digestion, while addition of other starches all led to worse qualities. A <b>wire</b> cutting and <b>peeling</b> test model was established, using seven kinds of noodle sheets for texture evaluation, but was not fully consistent with oral sensations on corresponding noodle strands, possibly due to impact of humidity variation on the sample surface and on the effect of saliva lubrication in the mouth. Further, an indentation test for elasticity evaluation was performed on nine types of noodle sheets, in combination with AFM imaging, pasting and texture study. Results indicated that relaxation ratio of noodle sheets may relate to final viscosity of flour and starches, but a larger sample size is needed for further confirmation. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
