50|$|A {{large number}} of medieval {{constructive}} elements remain in situ: ground beams (grunnstokker), sills (sviller), corner posts (hjørnestolper), <b>wall</b> <b>planks</b> (veggtiler) and aisle wall plates (stavlægjer). The construction of the raised central area with staves, strings and cross braces, and the roof itself, also date from medieval times.|$|E
50|$|The portal {{and other}} {{details of the}} north wall of the present church, {{as well as the}} <b>wall</b> <b>planks</b> of the gables, are {{decorated}} in classic Urnes-style. They are probably relics from one of the earlier churches. It has been speculated that the portal may originally have been the main portal, facing west.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone was}} laid on August 2, 1842 {{in the presence}} of King Friedrich Wilhelm himself. It was a demanding task for carpenters who had never seen the church, nor any stave church, to rebuild it correctly. In spite of excellent drawings, most of the materials were discarded. Only the main construction, consisting of sills, posts and wall plates, were made use of, in addition to the carved doorframes. All of the external gallery was built with new materials, and every <b>wall</b> <b>plank</b> was replaced.|$|R
50|$|Vågå stave {{church is}} the second oldest stave church in the country, which was {{constructed}} around 1150 and originally dedicated to St. Peter. It was converted to a cruciform church in 1625; the carved portal and <b>wall</b> <b>planks</b> are original. The baptismal font dates from the original church and a Gothic crucifix from the 13th century can be seen there as well.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church was}} {{converted}} to a cruciform church in 1626-28. Only the carved portals and decorative <b>wall</b> <b>planks</b> survived from the original stave church. It was a half-timbered building, where the church materials are reused. The basic architectural plan is a Latin cross. Above the crossing is a turret with a high tower helmet and four small side towers, a legacy from the Gothic tower architecture.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} built with a {{rectangular}} nave and a narrower choir. The nave and choir both have raised central spaces. The choir {{was extended to}} the east in the 17th century, but this addition was later removed. The drawing by Johan Christian Dahl depicts this, {{as well as the}} deteriorated state of the church at that time. During the 20th century the church underwent a restoration, and the richly decorated <b>wall</b> <b>planks</b> were covered to stop further deterioration.|$|E

50|$|On {{the stone}} foundation, four huge ground beams (grunnstokker) are placed like a # sign, their ends {{protruding}} 1-2 {{meters from the}} lap joint where they intersect. The ends of these beams support the sills of the outer walls, forming a separate horizontal frame. The tall internal posts are placed on the internal frame of ground beams, and carry the main roof above the central nave (skip). On the outer frame of sills rest the main <b>wall</b> <b>planks</b> (veggtiler), carrying the roof over the pentice or aisles (omgang) surrounding the central space. The roof thus slopes down in two steps, as in a basilica.|$|E
50|$|The {{houses were}} built so that planks {{on the walls}} and roofs could be taken off and used at other places, as the people moved seasonally. Paired {{uprights}} supported rafters, which, in turn, held roof planks that overlapped like tiles. <b>Wall</b> <b>planks</b> were lashed between sets of poles. The position of these poles depended on the lengths of the boards they held, and they were evidently set and reset through the years the houses were occupied. Walls met at the corners by simply butting together. They stayed structurally independent, allowing for easy dismantling. There were no windows. Light and ventilation came by shifting the position of roof planks, which were simply weighted with rocks, not fastened in position.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{previous}} National Bridge Inventory data, {{the state of}} Iowa has nearly 20, 000 bridges on low-volume roads (LVRs). Thus, these bridges are {{the responsibility of the}} county engineers. Of the bridges on the county roads, 24 percent are structurally deficient and 5 percent are functionally obsolete. A large number of the older bridges on the LVRs are built on timber piling with timber back walls. In many cases, as timber abutments and piers age, the piling and back <b>wall</b> <b>planks</b> deteriorate at a rate faster than the bridge superstructure. As a result, {{a large percentage of the}} structurally deficient bridges on LVRs are classified as such because of the condition of the timber substructure elements. As funds for replacing bridges decline and construction costs increase, effective rehabilitation and strengthening techniques for extending the life of the timber substructures in bridges with structurally sound superstructures has become even more important. Several counties have implemented various techniques to strengthen/repair damaged piling, however, there is minimal data documenting the effectiveness of these techniques. There are numerous instances where cracked and failed pilings have been repaired. However, there are no experimental data on the effectiveness of the repairs or on the percentage of load transferred from the superstructure to the sound pile below. To address the research needs, a review and evaluation of current maintenance and rehabilitation methods was completed. Additionally, a nationwide survey was conducted to learn the methods used beyond Iowa. Field investigation and live-load testing of bridges with certain Iowa methods was completed. Lastly, laboratory testing of new strengthening and rehabilitation methods was performed...|$|E
60|$|Daniel Davidson {{was engaged}} in a very {{important}} conversation with old Duncan McKay {{at the time the}} formidable troop of North-Westers swept through the settlements. The old man was seated in the hall, parlour, drawing-room--or whatever you choose to call it--of Ben Nevis House. It was an uncarpeted, unpainted, unadorned room with pine <b>plank</b> flooring, <b>plank</b> <b>walls,</b> a <b>plank</b> ceiling, a plank table, and a set of plank chairs. Ornament was dispensed with in the hall of Ben Nevis House; for although Elspie would fain have clothed it with a little feminine grace, its proprietor would not hear of such proposals.|$|R

5000|$|Near Moesgaard Beach is a {{reconstruction}} of a Stone Age cult-building from the Funnel Beaker Period, around 2500 BC. The original house was located near two dolmens and a passage grave at Tustrup in Northern Djursland. It {{is believed that}} the building served religious ceremonies - perhaps as a resting place for the dead, until the flesh had decayed and the bones could be moved into surrounding graves. The original wooden building burnt to the ground at some point, {{and parts of the}} roof sheeting of birch-bark with turf cover collapsed inwards with the burnt <b>wall</b> <b>planking.</b> 26 richly decorated offering vessels and pottery ladles representing the golden age of pottery in Danish prehistory were found inside the collapsed building.

50|$|Another {{carpentry}} method {{which is}} sometimes called <b>plank</b> <b>wall,</b> board <b>wall,</b> plank-on-plank, horizontal <b>plank</b> frame is the stacking of horizontal planks or boards to form a wall of solid lumber. Sometimes the planks were staggered or spaced apart to form keys for a coat of plaster. This method was recommended by Orson Squire Fowler for octagon houses in his book The Octagon House: A Home for All in 1848. Fowler mentions he had seen this wall type being built in central New York state while traveling in 1842.|$|R

5000|$|Bethel Church is a {{historic}} church building in rural Morning Sun, Iowa, United States. The congregation was organized by the Wapello mission of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Iowa in 1854. In addition to the Morning Sun congregation, the Wapello mission included congregations in Concord, Long Creek, and two in Wapello. [...] The property for the church building and its adjacent cemetery was donated by Merit Jamison. Members of the congregation built the building {{under the supervision of}} stonemason Francis McGraw. The limestone structure is a Vernacular form of Iowa folk architecture. The small cornice returns are influenced by the Greek Revival style. The plain interior features plastered <b>walls,</b> <b>plank</b> flooring and wood-carved furnishings from the church's early years. The iron fence that runs along the gravel road was added in 1861. The church is no used for regularly scheduled services. [...] It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.|$|R
