5|$|If the Council {{does make}} an adverse report, Parliament may amend {{the bill to}} rid it of any {{differentiating}} measures before sending {{it back to the}} Council for inspection. The MP having charge of the bill may give two clear days' notice of the amendments he or she proposes to move in Parliament to the provisions of the bill that were adversely reported upon by the Council. The bill then stands recommitted to a committee of the whole Parliament on those provisions, and the proposed amendments are considered. Parliament then resumes, and the MP having charge of the bill reports whether the amendments were agreed to by the committee. If so, the MP moves that the amended bill should be resubmitted to the Council. There is uncertainty as to whether the Council <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> another report within any time limit, or if the bill will then be directly presented to the President for assent.|$|E

It is similar, though simpler, to the concept of the project brief in PRINCE2.

The draft acquisition goal is meant to give the main reasons and the main goals to those people who <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the decision to actually start of the acquisition or not.

25|$|Proposition Joe hosts {{a meeting}} with the heads of the New Day Co-Op {{consortium}} of drug dealers. He is in an awkward position, having had an entire shipment of narcotics stolen by Omar. He tries to convince his colleagues that they should pay for a replacement shipment while they work on recovering the stolen drugs. The rest of the Co-Op members are dubious and tell Joe that as the drugs were in the possession of his people when they were stolen, he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for the loss. Joe threatens to cut them off from his supplier in the future if they insist on this course and this quiets their protests. Marlo Stanfield quizzes Joe about which of his people was there when the shipment was taken. Joe admits that it was his nephew Cheese but tells Marlo that he will protect Cheese from any retribution. He offers to put Marlo in touch with his connection so he can reassure him that Cheese did not steal the drugs for himself.|$|E

500|$|The {{fifth and}} final season begins in 2036, {{following}} from the flash-forward fourth-season episode [...] "Letters of Transit". As September warned, Observers {{from the far}} future, having ruined Earth for themselves, time-traveled to 2015 and instituted [...] "The Purge", wiped out much of humanity, subjected the survivors to their control, and began modifying the planet's environment to be more suitable for themselves. The Fringe team was able to seal themselves in amber to avoid capture shortly after the Purge, and are reunited through Henrietta ("Etta") (Georgina Haig), Peter and Olivia's now adult daughter who disappeared shortly after the Observer arrival in 2015. Walter reveals he and September developed a plan to defeat the Observers, revealed {{through a series of}} pre-recorded videotapes ambered in the lab. The tapes lead to several components of a device, including a young Observer child, named Michael (Spencer List in Season 1 and Rowan Longworth in Season 5), but further allude to a man named Donald that had helped Walter prepare the plan. Etta is killed during these events, driving Olivia and Peter to complete the plan for her sake. Through Michael, they discover Donald is September, having been stripped of his Observer powers for helping the Fringe team, and that Michael is his genetic son, having been purposely grown as an anomaly in the far future. September explains the plan is to send Michael to the year 2167, where human genetic experiments to sacrifice emotion for intelligence would be started and leading {{to the creation of the}} Observers; by showing them Michael, who possesses both emotion and intelligence, the experiments would be stopped and the Observers never created. September is prepared to take Michael to the future as the plan is set in motion, but he is shot and killed at the last moment; Walter, already made aware that he <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a sacrifice, takes Michael through to the future to assure the plan's completion. As predicted, time is reset from the invasion onwards in 2015; the Observers never invade, and Peter, Olivia, and Etta, live their lives peacefullyâ€”though Peter receives one final letter from his father: a drawing of a white tulip.|$|E
