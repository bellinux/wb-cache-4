5|$|Back in London Emmeline {{was visited}} by Sylvia, {{who had not}} seen her mother in years. Their {{politics}} were by now very different, and Sylvia was living, unmarried, with an Italian anarchist. Sylvia described a moment of familial affection <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>met,</b> followed by a sad distance between them. Emmeline's adopted daughter Mary, however, remembered the meeting differently. According to her version, Emmeline set her teacup down and walked silently out of the room, leaving Sylvia in tears. Christabel, meanwhile, had become a convert to Adventism and devoted {{much of her time}} to the church. The British press sometimes made light of the varied paths followed by the once indivisible family.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his large}} number of works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>met</b> in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|He married Julia Stanley in 1938. John {{was their}} only child together, but as Alf was often away at sea during World War II, {{he did not see}} much of his child during his infancy. During this period, Julia became {{pregnant}} with another man's child. He offered to look after his wife, their child and the expected baby, but Julia rejected the idea. He had very little contact with his son until Beatlemania, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>met</b> again, but later had only intermittent contact with each other. He died in Brighton, where he had gone to live after marrying 19-year-old Pauline Jones, with whom he had two sons.|$|E

5|$|His first {{project for}} Webb and Knapp was an {{apartment}} building with funding from the Housing Act of 1949. Pei's design {{was based on a}} circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>met.</b> The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Kuznetsova {{defeated}} Radwańska {{again in}} the opening match of Fed Cup tie between Russia and Poland. At the 2016 Wuhan Open, Kuznetsova saved a match point in the second set en route to winning a three-set, quarter-final thriller, and also saved a match point <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>met</b> at the WTA Finals in Singapore later that year. Their most recent meeting, at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, saw Kuznetsova win in straight sets, a decade on from their first meeting.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} how {{directly}} Offenbach influenced Johann Strauss. He had encouraged Strauss to turn to operetta <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>met</b> in Vienna in 1864, {{but it was not until}} seven years later that Strauss did so. However, Offenbach's operettas were well established in Vienna, and Strauss worked on the lines established by his French colleague; in 1870s Vienna, an operetta composer who did not do so was quickly called to order by the press. In Gammond's view, the Viennese composer most influenced by Offenbach was Franz von Suppé, who studied Offenbach's works carefully and wrote many successful operettas using them as a model.|$|E

5|$|The artistic {{community}} appreciated {{his work}} in this vein, and Rodin was invited to Paris Salons by such friends as writer Léon Cladel. During his early appearances at these social events, Rodin seemed shy; in his later years, as his fame grew, he displayed the loquaciousness and temperament {{for which he is}} better known. French statesman Leon Gambetta expressed a desire to meet Rodin, and the sculptor impressed him <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>met</b> at a salon. Gambetta spoke of Rodin in turn to several government ministers, likely including , the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Fine Arts, whom Rodin eventually met.|$|E

5|$|Written by James Follett, this {{involved}} monsters {{attacking a}} race of beings who live inside Halley's Comet, unaware that there is anything beyond it they believe that their world is the sum and total of the universe. Into the Comet would have used the companions of Romana and K9. Follett was a novelist who pitched this idea to script editor Douglas Adams circa September 1979 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>met</b> up and discussed the forthcoming return of Halley's Comet. Unfortunately the storyline was rejected by Adams. Follett resubmitted Into the Comet to new script editor Christopher H. Bidmead around May 1980, but once again the storyline was not pursued.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} memorable {{match between}} the two sides came on 1 February 1958, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>met</b> in a league fixture at Highbury. It was the last league game that United played before the Munich air disaster five days later, which claimed the lives of eight of their players and saw two other players injured {{to such an extent that}} they never played again. United won the game 5–4, with goals from Tommy Taylor (twice), Duncan Edwards, Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet.

5|$|First {{founded in}} 1908, the club played seven seasons in non-League {{football}} before folding in 1917. A new club {{was formed in}} 1922, and played in the Midland League for seven years before joining the Football League. They played in the third tier until 1959, when they were promoted for the first time. York achieved their best run in the FA Cup in 1954–55, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>met</b> Newcastle United in the semi-final. They fluctuated between the Third and Fourth Divisions, before spending two seasons in the Second Division in the 1970s.

At the end of 2003–04, they lost their Football League status after being relegated from the Third Division. The 2011–12 FA Trophy was the first national knockout competition won by York, and {{they returned to the}} Football League that season.|$|E
