A good example is that OES estimates calculate how many primary school teachers (including their <b>wages)</b> <b>work</b> in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale, CA MSA, which can be aggregated to how many primary school teachers (including their <b>wages)</b> <b>work</b> in California, which in turn can be aggregated to how many primary school teachers (including their <b>wages)</b> <b>work</b> in the United States.|$|R

Some defenders of slavery, mainly from the Southern slave states argued that Northern workers were [...] "free but in name – the slaves of endless toil," [...] and that their slaves were better off. This contention has been partly corroborated by some modern studies that indicate slaves' material conditions in the 19th century were [...] "better than what was typically available to free urban laborers at the time." [...] In this period, Henry David Thoreau wrote that [...] "t is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself." ...|$|E
