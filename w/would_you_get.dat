Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. Why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E

6000|$|When the Spanish {{governor}} heard this, {{he calls}} to Will Atkins: [...] "How, Seignior Atkins," [...] says he, [...] "will you murder us all? What have {{you to say}} to that?" [...] That hardened villain was so far from denying it, that {{he said it was}} true, and G-d d-mn him they would do it still before they had done with them. [...] "Well, but Seignior Atkins," [...] said the Spaniard, [...] "what have we done to you that you will kill us? And what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> by killing us? And what must we do to prevent your killing us? Must we kill you, or will you kill us? Why will you put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins?" [...] says the Spaniard very calmly and smiling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah!" [...] you exclaim, [...] "what a question! The animal wants must {{of course}} be supplied." [...] True, most refined one, but {{a hunk of}} bread {{and a plate of}} soup would fully suffice for animal needs. Would your refined pleasures have as keen a relish for you if you had only to look forward to bread and water between six and nine? Answer, ye sportsmen, how <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> through your day's work if there were not a glorious dinner at the end of it? Speak, ye ballroom frequenters, how would you skip, even with the light of {{brilliant}} eyes to encourage you, if there were not what you call a jolly good supper somewhere in the background? Be honest, all of you, and confess--what you tacitly and obviously admit by your actions every day--that our mere animal wants are of vast importance, and that in our ministering to these the only difference between ourselves and the Eskimos is, a somewhat greater variety of viands, a little less of toil in obtaining them, a little more of refinement and cleanliness in the consumption of them, and, perchance, a little less of appetite.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. I {{agree with}} you, dearie. We {{made a mistake}} when we called HIM. His face just {{looks like one of}} those long, narrow stones in the graveyard, doesn't it? 'Sacred to the memory' ought to be written on his forehead. I shall never forget the first sermon he preached after he came. It was on the subject of {{everyone}} doing what they were best fitted for--a very good subject, of course; but such illustrations as he used! He said, 'If you had a cow and an apple tree, and if you tied the apple tree in your stable and planted the cow in your orchard, with her legs up, how much milk <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> from the apple tree, or how many apples from the cow?' Did you ever hear the like in your born days, dearie? I was so thankful there were no Methodists there that day--they'd never have been done hooting over it. But what I dislike most in him is his habit of agreeing with everybody, no matter what is said. If you said to him, 'You're a scoundrel,' he'd say, with that smooth smile of his, 'Yes, that's so.' A minister should have more backbone. The long and the short of it is, I consider him a reverend jackass. But, of course, this is just between you and me. When there are Methodists in hearing I praise him to the skies. Some folks think his wife dresses too gay, but I say when she has to live with a face like that she needs something to cheer her up. You'll never hear ME condemning a woman for her dress. I'm only too thankful when her husband isn't too mean and miserly to allow it. Not that I bother much with dress myself. Women just dress to please the men, and I'd never stoop to THAT. I have had a real placid, comfortable life, dearie, and it's just because I never cared a cent what the men thought." ...|$|E

6000|$|The homesteader laughed derisively. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I guess you're sorry now. Anyone who saw <b>you</b> <b>would</b> think <b>you</b> were. <b>Get</b> {{right back}} to the chair yonder and stay there." ...|$|R
6000|$|When the Spanish {{governor}} heard this, {{he calls}} to Will Atkins, [...] "How, Seignior Atkins, would you murder us all? What have {{you to say}} to that?" [...] The hardened villain was so far from denying it, that {{he said it was}} true, and swore they would do it still before they had done with them. [...] "Well, but Seignior Atkins," [...] says the Spaniard, [...] "what have we done to you that you will kill us? What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> by killing us? And what must we do to prevent you killing us? Must we kill you, or you kill us? Why will you put us to the necessity of this, Seignior Atkins?" [...] says the Spaniard very calmly, and smiling. Seignior Atkins was in such a rage at the Spaniard's making a jest of it, that, had he not been held by three men, and withal had no weapon near him, it was thought he would have attempted to kill the Spaniard {{in the middle of all}} the company. This hare-brained carriage obliged them to consider seriously what was to be done. The two Englishmen and the Spaniard who saved the poor savage were of the opinion that they should hang one of the three for an example to the rest, and that particularly it should be he that had twice attempted to commit murder with his hatchet; indeed, there was some reason to believe he had done it, for the poor savage was in such a miserable condition with the wound he had received that it was thought he could not live. But the governor Spaniard still said No; it was an Englishman that had saved all their lives, and he would never consent to put an Englishman to death, though he had murdered half of them; nay, he said if he had been killed himself by an Englishman, and had time left to speak, it should be that they should pardon him.|$|E
6000|$|It {{happened}} that soon after this the mother sent {{the two girls}} to the town to buy needles, thread, laces, and ribbons. Their road led over a heath where huge boulders of rock lay scattered here and there. While trudging along they saw a big bird hovering in the air, circling slowly above them, but always descending lower, till at last it settled on a rock not far from them. Immediately afterward they heard a sharp, piercing cry. They ran forward, and saw with horror that the eagle had pounced on their old friend the dwarf, {{and was about to}} carry him off. The tender-hearted children seized hold of the little man, and struggled so long with the bird that at last he let go his prey. When the dwarf had recovered from the first shock he screamed in his screeching voice: [...] "Couldn't you have treated me more carefully? You have torn my thin little coat all to shreds, useless, awkward hussies that you are!" [...] Then he took a bag of precious stones and vanished under the rocks into his cave. The girls were accustomed to his ingratitude, and went on their way and did their business in town. On their way home, as they were again passing the heath, they surprised the dwarf pouring out his precious stones on an open space, for he had thought no one would pass by at so late an hour. The evening sun shone on the glittering stones, and they glanced and gleamed so beautifully that the children stood still and gazed on them. [...] "What are you standing there gaping for?" [...] screamed the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became scarlet with rage. He was about to go off with these angry words when a sudden growl was heard, and a black bear trotted out of the wood. The dwarf jumped up in great fright, but he hadn't time to reach his place of retreat, for the bear was already close to him. Then he cried in terror: [...] "Dear Mr. Bear, spare me! I'll give you all my treasure. Look at those beautiful precious stones lying there. Spare my life! what pleasure <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> from a poor feeble little fellow like me? You won't feel me between your teeth. There, lay hold of these two wicked girls, they will be a tender morsel for you, as fat as young quails; eat them up, for heaven's sake." [...] But the bear, paying no attention to his words, gave the evil little creature one blow with his paw, and he never moved again.|$|E
