40|$|The {{leaves of}} the <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Morus alba L.) are used {{worldwide}} in traditional medicine as anti-diabetics. Various constituents of mulberry leaves, such as iminosugars (i. e. 1 -deoxynojirimicin), flavonoids and related compounds, polysaccharides, glycopeptides and ecdysteroids, {{have been reported to}} exert anti-diabetic activity, but knowledge about their contribution to the overall activity is limited. The objective of the present work was to determine the in vivo anti-diabetic activity of an extract of mulberry leaves (MA), and to examine to what extent three major constituents, chlorogenic acid, rutin and isoquercitrin, might contribute to the observed activity. Quantities of the three constituents of interest in the extract were determined by using HPLC-DAD. Activity was determined by using a type II diabetic rat model. After 11 days of per os administration of 250 or 750 mg/kg of MA or the corresponding amounts of each individual compound, a dose dependent decrease of non-fasting blood glucose levels were found for MA, chlorogenic acid and rutin, but not for isoquercitrin.

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> (Morus alba L) is {{cultivated}} throughout Asia and Europe, including Poland. The {{leaves and}} root bark preparations from Morus alba {{have been used}} in traditional phytomedicine. The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare chemical composition and antioxidative activity of aqueous extracts prepared from Polish variety of Morus alba leaves at the laboratory (L) and pilot plant scale (PP) conditions. Proximate composition, phenolic acids profile (HPLC/MS), flavonol glicosides (HPLC/ MS), polyphenols (Folin-Ciocalteu assay), and the antioxidant activity (ABTS and DPPH assay) of the extracts were determined. The main phenolic compounds were identified as gallic, protocatechuic, phydroxybenzoic, vanillic, chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic acids. Chlorogenic acid was the main phenolic constituent of both extracts. The flavonols fraction contained rutin, quercetin 3 -β-D-glucoside, and kaempferol 3 -β-D- glucopyranoside. Total concentration of phenolic compounds were 7. 9 g and 14. 4 g gallic acid equivalent/ 100 g extract, and antioxidant activity was 137. 1 and 214. 1 μMol Trolox equivalent/g dry weight for the PP and L extracts, respectively. We concluded that current pilot plant process is less efficient than laboratory process at the aqueous extraction of bioactive components from Morus alba dried leaves. Potential improvements may include increasing efficacy of the extraction, decreasing losses of bioactive components during the process, or both. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Cheney Brothers {{turned a}} failed venture in seri-culture into a multi-million dollar silk empire {{only to see}} it and the American textile {{industry}} decline into near oblivion one hundred years later. Because of time and space limitations this paper is limited to Cheney Brothers 2 ̆ 7 activities in New York City which are, but a fraction, of a much larger story. Brothers and beginnings Like many other enterprising Americans in the 1830 s, brothers Charles (1803 - 1874), Ward (1813 - 1876), Rush (1815 - 1882), and Frank (1817 - 1904), Cheney became engaged in the time consuming, difficul t business of raising silk worms until they discovered that speculation on the morus morticaulis, the <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> upon which the worms fed, might be far more profitable. As with all high profit operations the tree business was a high-risk venture, throwing many investors including the Cheney brothers, into bankruptcy. Failure however, was not part of Ch ney vocabulary. In 1838, with a friend from New York, Edwin H. Arnold, they built a water power mill on the Hop Brook in Manchester Connecticut with financing supplied by their successful artist brothers, Seth (1810 - 1856) and John Cheney (1801 - 1885). The Mt.

Through a crack in one of the walls, they whisper their love for each other. They arrange to meet near Ninus' tomb under a <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> and state their feelings for each other. Thisbe arrives first, but upon seeing a lioness with a mouth bloody from a recent kill, she flees, leaving behind her veil. When Pyramus arrives he is horrified at the sight of Thisbe's veil, assuming that a wild beast has killed her. Pyramus kills himself, falling on his sword in proper Babylonian fashion, and in turn splashing blood on the <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> leaves.

40|$|The grandiose, but failed, {{attempts}} to produce silk in Sweden {{in the past}} have been largely ignored by historians. This thesis describes the history of sericulture in Sweden, including three periods of practical trials in 1735 - 1765, 1830 - 1898 and 1913 - 1918. For a long time, the secrets of sericulture were closely guarded in China but {{by the beginning of the}} 16 th century, knowledge of silk cultivation techniques had reached a number of European countries. The pursuit of domestic silk production was often a costly undertaking instigated by royalty. Since conditions in Sweden and Denmark were partly similar, there was some degree of influence and cooperation between these neighbouring countries. The chapters dealing with attempts at silk production during the 18 th century and the history of sericulture in northern Europe are primarily based on printed sources and literature. Several of the 18 th century silk farmers documented their experiments, allowing us to follow their efforts and ideas on the feasibility of silk farming in Sweden. The descriptions of the two latter sets of Swedish silk production trials presented in the thesis are primarily based on archive materials, mainly consisting of minutes and annual reports. The history of sericulture in Sweden began in the mid- 1730 s, when Mårten Triewald conducted experiments and exhaustively described and published these. Carl Linnaeus was a significant influence in Swedish sericulture during this early period. Naturalists were hired as plantation managers and were tasked with supplying the silk industry in Sweden with home-produced raw material. The work was prompted by the desire to find an alternative for the huge Swedish imports of raw silk from China and Southern Europe. However, silk farming never became particularly common, despite the financial incentives available for producing silk and planting mulberry trees during the 1750 s in the belief that some ‘extravagance’ was beneficial for society as a whole. When the ‘Hats’ position of power ended, so did the financial support for manufacturing luxury goods. Founded in 1830, the Swedish Association for Domestic Sericulture was active for nearly 70 years thanks to foreign influences and the notion that silk farming could be a popular livelihood. Members of the Swedish Royal Family served as patrons and several well-known scientists participated in the projects. The Association furnished mulberry plants and seeds, together with silkworm eggs, most of which were distributed to plantations controlled by the Association or county agricultural societies. However, the Association’s annual reports show that many private individuals also planted mulberry trees and some pursued silk farming. Sericulture growing trials were carried out at a number of sites across Sweden, on the initiative of Jacob Berzelius, among others. These trials were mainly funded by Government grants, but numerous wealthy individuals also made contributions to the sericulture venture. Some income was generated by the silk products produced, which were almost solely bought by the Swedish Royal Family. The Swedish Sericulture Association was founded in southern Sweden in 1913 but this third brief foray into sericulture produced few results. All three periods of sericulture trials were initiated by enthusiasts with a firm belief that some silkworm host plants would survive the Nordic climate. There were a number of claims that the <b>white</b> <b>mulberry</b> <b>tree</b> had become acclimatised, but an equal number of cold winters and springs proved the opposite. Ultimately, Swedish sericulture was never economically feasible, since the natural conditions were unfavourable and the output from Swedish silk production was modest, and the cost high, in relation to imported silk. The almost 200 -year history of sericulture in Sweden provides an important glimpse into the obsessions and culture of the age, but there were far too many obstacles for the dream of Swedish silk ever to become a reality...|$|E

The results showed the following. 1) With drought stress increasing, the heights, base diameters, and root surface areas of <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> decreased significantly relative to the corresponding earlier period. The root / shoot ratio increased gradually in the earlier stage, and decreased gradually in the later stage. The specific root area of <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> on the whole increased significantly relative to the corresponding earlier period. 2) With the elongation of treatment time, the growth of mulberry seedlings decreased gradually, and the heights, base diameters, root surface area and root / shoot ratio of the <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> in the three treatment groups increased to different degrees. The specific root area of <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> on the whole decreased gradually. We concluded that under the different degrees of drought stress the growth of <b>mulberry</b> <b>trees</b> would be inhibited, but the plants were also able {{to adapt to the}} stress, thereby maintaining physiological and metabolic viability.
