[...] Charles Poore, writing in The New York Times, noted that Bond's mission [...] "is aimed at restoring Britain's pre-World War II place among the powers of the world. And on that subject, above all others, Ian Fleming's novels are endlessly, bitterly eloquent." [...] The Boston Globes Mary Castle opined that the agent's trip was [...] "Bond's latest and grimmest mission", which she called [...] "Escapism in the Grand Manner".|$|E

He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley was pleased with the result, saying that [...] "everything about that episode worked". The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script; Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode [...] "came together much better on the screen than we thought it would <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>read</b> the script.

The two tracks, [...] "'Purity" [...] and [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", were inspired by a story that was published online about a girl named Purity Knight, who was kidnapped and buried alive. The website, called Crime Scene, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website didn't include any disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many viewers believed that the story was true, including Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylor."I still think the story's real. It fucked our whole world up <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>read</b> it. Can you imagine a girl being buried in a box and have all this lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy? It just hurts your head."

2500|$|As {{the poet}} implores [...] "Sweet love" [...] (1) {{to conquer the}} lust that is ruining his union with the young man. This {{analysis}} of the sonnet relies upon two assumptions: 1) the young man is the poet's lover and 2) that when the poet refers to [...] "sad interim" [...] (9), he {{does not mean that}} the young man is away from London, but that he is separated from him emotionally - i.e., they are in a [...] "period of estrangement" [...] from one another due to the young man's promiscuity. Thus the poet is [...] "whipping up the young man's flagging affection. Behind lines 9-12 flickers a reminiscence of the situation of Hero and Leander" [...] (Rowse 115). The situation becomes even more clear <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>read</b> Sonnet 57, in which the poet, now very worried about the young man's lustful nature, asks him outright, [...] "Being your slave, what should I do but tend/Upon the hours and times of your desire?... dare I question with my jealous thought/Where you may be" [...] (1-2/9-10).|$|E
2500|$|The {{work was}} set aside until 1815 when Coleridge {{compiled}} manuscripts of his poems for a collection titled Sibylline Leaves. The poem remained buried in obscurity until a 10 April 1816 meeting between Coleridge and Lord Byron, who persuaded Coleridge to publish Christabel and [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] as fragments. Leigh Hunt, the poet and essayist, witnessed {{the event and}} wrote, [...] "He recited his 'Kubla Khan' one morning to Lord Byron, in his Lordship's house in Piccadilly, when I {{happened to be in}} another room. I remember the other's coming away from him, highly struck with his poem, and saying how wonderfully he talked. This was the impression of everyone who heard him." [...] Byron arranged for John Murray to publish the poem with Christabel and [...] "The Pains of Sleep" [...] along with prefaces to the works. A contract was drawn up on 12 April 1816 for 80 pounds. Charles Lamb, poet and friend of Coleridge, witnessed Coleridge's work towards publishing the poem and wrote to Wordsworth: [...] "Coleridge is printing Xtabel by Lord Byron's recommendation to Murray, with what he calls a vision of Kubla Khan – which said vision he repeats so enchantingly that it irradiates & brings Heaven & Elysian bowers into my parlour while he sings or says it". Coleridge stayed in London to work on the poem and also to try and break his opium addiction. However, not everyone was happy with the idea of the poem's being published, as Coleridge's wife, who was not with him, wrote to Thomas Poole, [...] "Oh! when will he ever give his friends anything but pain? he has been so unwise as to publish his fragments of 'Christabel' & 'Kubla-Khan' ... we were all sadly vexed <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>read</b> the advertisement of these things." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 64 is a {{great example}} of why people always say [...] "You should never let your past {{interfere}} with your present". Barret argues that sonnet 64 [...] "provides an example of past-oriented natural habitats that might interfere with the productive considerations of the future". In other words, because the speaker is letting the past overwhelm his thoughts, he therefore cannot think positively about the future due to past habits or tendencies. Unlike some of the other sonnets addressed to the young man, sonnet 64 moves toward a feeling of the lover's exposure to the risk of being destroyed. Barret also argues that the phonetic play between ruminate and ruinate is as she says an [...] "underscore a relationship inherent in the poem’s logic", [...] "Each quatrain of the sonnet open with the same construction — [...] "When I have seen" [...] — yet these statements are never met with a summational [...] "then", so the temporal ambiguity the phrase creates the remains unresolved: Does the speaker gesture toward repeated past actions ('in the instances that I have seen') or forward to a causational limit point ('once I have seen')?". <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>read</b> the lines that pertain to the waves and the shore, [...] "at times the waves are winning against the shore, and then at times the shore is winning against the waves", the speaker almost speaks in a tone of confidence and determination to not let time control his life. Although when he goes to say Time will take my love away we begin {{to get a sense of}} uncertainty within the speaker. This uncertainty within the speaker is described by Barret when she argues [...] "The sonnet registers temporal matters in personal terms; the couplet never corrects the poem's grammatically obscured engagement with time, but instead introduces a paralyzing temporal collapse: the present moment becomes overwhelmed by an anticipation of future loss—an extreme version of 'I miss you already.'.... The ruin/ruminate pairing bespeaks a suspicion of an imagined time spent looking back".|$|E
