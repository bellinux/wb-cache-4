40|$|Using {{the analogy}} between lateral {{convection}} of heat and the two-phase flow in bubble columns, alternative turbulence modelling methods were analysed. The k-ε turbulence and Reynolds stress models were used to predict the buoyant motion of fluids where a density difference arises due {{to the introduction of}} heat or a discrete phase. A large height to <b>width</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> cavity was employed in the transport of heat and it was shown that the Reynolds stress model with the use of velocity profiles including the laminar flow solution resulted in turbulent vortices developing. The turbulence models were then applied to the simulation of gas-liquid flow for a 5 : 1 height to <b>width</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> bubble column. In the case of a gas superficial velocity of 0. 02 m s- 1 it was determined that employing the Reynolds stress model yielded the most realistic simulation results. © 2003 Elsevier B. V.

A computer model utilizing optical ray tracing is used to predict the reflective propagation of laser beam energy focused into the narrow gap of a metal joint for the purpose of predicting the location of melting and coalescence which form the weld. The model allows quantitative analysis of the effects of changes to joint geometry, laser design, materials and processing variables. This analysis method is proposed as a way to enhance process efficiency and design laser welds which display deep penetration and high depth to <b>width</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios,</b> reduced occurrence of defects and enhanced melting.

This quality gives them a relatively large surface area, which can lead to powerful tensile and absorptive characteristics, which are remarkably different from, and cannot be predicted by study of the non-fibrous parent materials. An example of this is asbestos, where the toxicity of the material is heavily influenced by its structural anatomy.

A simple model of the twisted filaments as elliptic helices grouped in concentric shells have been used to derived analytical results for the intrinsic variation of Jc with the twist pitch, tp. In tapes with high thickness to <b>width</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>ratios</b> and large tp values, this model predicts a linear dependence of Jc with 1 /tp, when the shape and superconducting filling factor of the tapes are constant. The Jc(tp) values depend on a set of parameters that define the helices, which may be derived from the analysis of the morphology of the filaments inside the tapes. To assess the model we have compared the predictions with the results here reported on Ag and Ag 0. 94 Au 0. 06 alloy sheathed tapes with 19 and 37 twisted filaments, respectively.

Their mode of manufacture is such that each channel has the cross-section of a sinusoidal curve closed off by a nearly straight edge. During the operation of such converters, heat generated at the channel walls is transferred to the gases flowing through the channels. To understand the overall heat transfer characteristics of the monolith, it is necessary to understand the heat transfer rate between the channel walls and the fluid contained within them. With the use of the computational fluid dynamics package FIDAP, a three-dimensional model of a single channel was used to determine the local Nusselt number (Nu) versus Graetz number (Gz) correlation for heat transfer between the fluid and the walls of the channel. Flow through the channel was laminar and developing from a flat velocity profile at the channel inlet to the fully developed flow towards the outlet.

40|$|The {{mismatch}} {{stress field}} in a graded epilayer and its substrate is analyzed by analogy to thermal stresses. In particular, a straight dislocation {{line and a}} half-rectangular dislocation loop in the graded epilayer are investigated. For the straight dislocation line, there are two positions in the epilayer at which the resultant force acting on the dislocation is null. If the dislocation is generated from the surface and passes the first zero force position, it will continue moving toward the second zero force position, where the dislocation is at a stable equilibrium. It is the stable equilibrium position that determines the dislocation formation energy and then the critical thickness of the graded epilayer. For a half-rectangular dislocation loop, its optimum shape occurs at a saddle point of the total energy profile {{as a function of}} the dislocation width and length. The activation energy for emitting a perfect or a partial dislocation loop, the dislocation <b>width,</b> and the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> of dislocation length to width are all related to the graded layer thickness. All three, the activation energy, the dislocation <b>width,</b> and the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio,</b> decrease quickly when the thickness increases from its critical value and then gradually approach extreme value as the thickness approaches infinity. The extreme values of the activation energy, the dislocation <b>width,</b> and the <b>aspect</b> <b>ratio</b> correspond to those for a dislocation loop emitted From the surface of an epilayer with a uniform composition.
