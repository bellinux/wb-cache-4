25|$|A {{completely}} new approach of using SIRs for the separation or purification of biotechnological {{products such as}} proteins {{is based on the}} concept of impregnating porous particles with aqueous polymer solutions developed by B. Burghoff. These so-called Tunable Aqueous Polymer-Phase Impregnated Resins (TAPPIR) enhance aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) by applying the SIR technology. During classical aqueous two-phase extraction, biotechnological components such as proteins are extracted from aqueous solutions by using a second aqueous phase. This second aqueous phase contains e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG). On the one hand, a low density difference and low interfacial tension between the two aqueous phases facilitate comparatively fast mass transfer between the phases. On the other hand, PEG appears to stabilize the protein molecules, which results in a comparatively low protein denaturation during the extraction. However, a significant drawback of ATPE is the persistent emulsification, which makes phase separation a challenge. The idea behind TAPPIR is to use the advantages posed by SIRs, namely low extractant loss due to immobilization in the pores and less emulsification than in liquid-liquid extraction. This way, the drawbacks of ATPE could be remedied. The setup would consist of a packed column or a fluidized bed rather than liquid-liquid extraction equipment with additional phase separation steps. Nonetheless, as yet only first feasibility studies are on the way to prove the concept. Adrawback of this method is the non-conitnous <b>working</b> <b>mode.</b> The packed column is run similar as a chromatographic column.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The energy {{consumption}} {{of information and}} com-munication technology (ICT) industry has become a serious problem, which mostly comes from the network infrastructure, rather than the mobile terminals. In this paper, we consider densely deployed cellular networks where the coverage of base stations (BSs) overlaps and the traffic intensity varies over time and space. An energy saving algorithm is proposed by dynam-ically adjusting the <b>working</b> <b>modes</b> (active or sleeping) of BSs according to the traffic variation with respect to certain blocking probability requirement. In addition, to prevent frequent mode switching, BSs are set to hold their current <b>working</b> <b>modes</b> {{for at least a}} given interval.

50|$|Robotic {{surgery is}} a term used for {{correlated}} actions of a surgeon and a surgical robot (that has been programmed to carry out certain actions during the preoperative planning procedure). A surgical robot is a mechanical device (generally looking like a robotic arm) that is computer-controlled.Robotic surgery {{can be divided into}} three types, depending on the degree of surgeon interaction during the procedure: supervisory-controlled, telesurgical, and shared-control. In a supervisory-controlled system, the procedure is executed solely by the robot, which will perform the pre-programmed actions. A telesurgical system, also known as remote surgery, requires the surgeon to manipulate the robotic arms during the procedure rather than allowing the robotic arms to work from a predetermined program. With shared-control systems, the surgeon carries out the procedure {{with the use of a}} robot that offers steady-hand manipulations of the instrument. In most robots, the <b>working</b> <b>mode</b> can be chosen for each separate intervention, depending on the surgical complexity and the particularities of the case.|$|E
