25|$|Some economists such as Scott Sumner and Edmund Phelps {{advocate}} a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> program. A <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> is a payment {{made by a}} government for work people do. It is based either on an hourly basis or by income earned. Advocates argue that the primary deficiencies of the EITC and the minimum wage are best avoided by a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy.</b> However, the <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> in America suffers {{from a lack of}} political support from either major political party.|$|E
50|$|The idea of wage {{insurance}} {{has been}} tested as early as 1995 in Canada's Earnings Supplement Project. Robert Litan and Lori Kletzer proposed the idea for wage insurance in United States in a 2001 paper. The basic concept became the United States Department of Labor's Alternative Trade Adjustment Assistance for Older Workers (ATAA). The ATAA compliments the Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which does not offer a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> or wage insurance. The TAA focuses on retraining workers while the ATAA includes a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> for workers who are considered too old to undergo retraining. The ATAA program includes a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> for laid off workers {{over the age of}} 50 who held a job with wages less than $50,000 a year, and who start a new job within 26 weeks of being laid off. The program gives a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> of half the difference between the worker's old and new wages with a maximum subsidy of $10,000. The subsidy can last for up to two years.|$|E

30|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} of active labour market policies is to integrate unemployed persons with placement barriers into employment. Temporary <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> aim to set incentives for firms to hire such persons. In their study based on the IAB Establishment Panel Survey waves 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009, Lutz Bellmann and Gesine Stephan examine the following questions: Is there {{a relationship between the}} use of targeted <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> and structural characteristics of the establishment? Do companies with higher employment dynamics use targeted <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> more frequently? Do companies that use <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> utilize other instruments of active labour market policies more often, too? All in all, the empirical results confirm that structural characteristics of the establishment {{have an impact on the}} use of targeted <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies.</b>|$|R

30|$|We {{refer to}} <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> as any {{transfer}} {{from the government}} that is able {{to reduce the cost}} of labor and/or increase take-home pay. Hence, there are many types of <b>wages</b> <b>subsidies</b> depending on who the payee is (employers or workers); how the transfer is made (social security contributions, taxes, or direct transfers); or eligibility and targeting criteria (all workers, new entrants, youth). There are, of course, also differences in the administrative arrangements used to implement <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> (see Section 3). Regardless, <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> can affect the cost of labor and take home pay and therefore the supply and demand of labor.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, a large {{correspondence}} {{experiment was}} conducted in Belgium. Two applications of graduates, identical except that one revealed a disability (blindness, deafness or autism), were both sent out to 768 vacancies for which the disabled candidates {{could be expected to}} be as productive as their non-disabled counterparts, based on the vacancy information. In addition, the researcher randomly disclosed the entitlement to a substantial <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> in the applications of the disabled candidates. Disabled candidates had a 48% lower chance to receive a positive reaction from the employer side compared with the non-disabled candidates. Potentially due to the fear of the red tape, disclosing a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> did not affect the employment opportunities of disabled candidates.|$|E

50|$|The DA has {{suggested}} measures to make South Africa's labour market more amenable to job creation.

30|$|This paper reviews {{international}} {{experiences with}} the implementation of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> and develops a policy framework to guide their design in developing countries. The evidence suggests that, if the goal is only to create jobs, <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> are unlikely to be an effective instrument. <b>Wage</b> <b>subsidies,</b> however, could have a role in helping first-time job seekers or those who have gone through long-periods of unemployment or inactivity, to gain some work experience and in the process build skills and improve their employability. If these “learning” effects are large enough, the social benefits of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> could outweigh their cost. When <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> are designed with these objectives in mind, there are important implications in terms of eligibility and targeting, how the subsidy is set, its duration, and the types of conditionalities on employers and beneficiaries. Given uncertainty regarding their impact, in all cases, programs should be piloted and evaluated prior to full scale implementation.|$|R

They analyze two prototypical models of skill formation: (a) a learning-by-doing model and (b) an on-the-job training model. In general the authors find different results for the two models bearing different implications of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> on skill formation. On-the-job training models predict that <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> reduce skill formation. Learning-by-doing models predict the opposite. The provisional evidence favors the learning-by-doing model. Findings show that EITC increased the long term wages of participants {{with low levels of}} education.|$|R
30|$|Even {{though the}} {{evidence}} in developing countries is still thin, it suggests {{that the success of}} <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> depends on context. For example, in Slovakia, <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> do not appear to have increase employment or earnings among beneficiaries (Lubyova and Ours 1999). In Poland the results were even less encouraging: male beneficiaries of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> {{were less likely to be}} employed. This is likely to be explained by a stigma effect where beneficiaries are perceived by the employers as inferior workers than otherwise identical workers (Kluve et al. 1999).|$|R

50|$|The New Jobs {{tax credit}} was {{a tax credit}} policy created {{as part of the}} 1977 {{stimulus}} package enacted by the Carter administration and was in effect through 1978. The tax credit acted as a form of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> by granting employers a tax credit for making new hires. In 1979, the credit was not renewed and it was ultimately perceived as a failure due to poor execution and lack of exposure.|$|E
30|$|A more {{promising}} function of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> {{in developing countries}} would be to allow workers to acquire skills that improve their employability and labor market opportunities through work experience and on the job-training. Some of the evidence reviewed in the paper suggest that, {{at least in the}} case of certain groups such as youth, the effect <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> persist after they expire.

30|$|Countries {{adopting}} <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> {{would then}} need considered the following issues {{in terms of}} design: 1) {{in order to minimize}} substitution and windfall effects, target <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> to narrow categories of workers who are truly excluded from wage employment; 2) promote self-selection by asking beneficiaries to participate in preparatory activities such as life-skills training; 3) use vouchers to identify beneficiaries but make payments to the employer to increase incentives for take up; 4) set <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> as a percentage of negotiated wages up to a maximum; 5) have in place the right communication campaign; and 5) have in place the necessary systems for enforcement, monitoring and evaluation. In terms of the latter, given considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> on human capital and labor market outcomes, it is important that programs are piloted and evaluated prior to full scale implementation.|$|R

5000|$|Germany's social {{security}} law provides that firms must employ a certain quota of [...] "severely disabled" [...] people. Those {{that do not}} are obliged to pay into a ‘compensation fund’ instead. This fund is used to pay a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> to integration enterprises (Integrationsbetriebe) that do employ disabled people. This allows higher staffing levels to be maintained, which both compensates for the lower productivity of some workers, and allows an atmosphere to be created in which people have time for each other. This makes the jobs sustainable for disabled people.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{criticisms of}} the {{campaign}} allege a pro-conservative bias evident in policies such as support for workfare, opposition to increases {{in the minimum wage}} and opposition to <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> schemes such as Labour's Jobs Guarantee. The left-wing New Statesman have criticised the groups links to the Conservative Party and the centre-right think tank the Centre for Social Justice. The New Statesman also object to the groups support for workfare whereby unemployed people are made to work for their unemployment benefits rather than a wage. The Political Scrap blog have criticised the group as an [...] "astroturfing operation which purports to “represent” the young unemployed while advocating for tax cuts and the watering down of equality legislation".|$|E
30|$|To {{maximize}} their impact, <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> might {{also need to}} be linked to other active labor market programs such as training, counseling, intermediation and job search assistance 17. For this reason, a natural entry point to receive <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> are public employment services agencies (see Robalino and Sanchez-Puerta 2009). In principle, these agencies can become “one-stop shops” where job-seekers register. The agency then connects job-seekers with different service providers under specific contracting and payment systems. Some of these service providers can be responsible for linking beneficiaries of <b>wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> with employers and monitoring the implementation of the program (see below).|$|R

50|$|The rate {{increase}} {{was accompanied by}} an offset package to help Singaporeans {{with the increase in}} GST. The package would cost the government $4 billion over five years. The government argued that the offset package would help the majority of Singaporeans offset their increased GST costs for several years. The offset package consisted of direct transfer benefits, in the form of cash payouts (GST credits, growth dividends, senior citizens' bonuses), CPF top-ups (post-secondary education account top-ups for students, Medisave top-ups for older Singaporeans), and rebates (on utilities and public housing service & conservancy charges). Those who earned less or lived in smaller homes received more benefits. The government also argued that the Workfare Income Supplement, a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy,</b> would provide significant support for lower-income workers on a continuing basis even after the GST offsets have been distributed.|$|E
50|$|The Institute is {{generally}} {{critical of the}} federal minimum wage. In 2015, it published a report by American Action Forum’s Douglas Holtz-Eakin and Ben Gitis, which {{made the case that}} an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2020 would cost 6.6 million jobs. According to a 2016 issue brief by Oren Cass, these deleterious effects are mainly {{due to the fact that}} increases in the federal minimum fail to account for differences in local conditions: not all labor markets are the same. Cass has also argued for the introduction of a federal wage subsidy—additional dollars per hour worked delivered via one's paycheck—as a better third way to help low-income workers. In 2015, he wrote that a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> is superior to both the minimum wage and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) because it incentivizes workforce participation and delivers benefits directly to workers, without distorting the labor market.|$|E

It is an alternative for the [...] "work for the dole" [...] scheme introduced by the Abbott Government in the previous budget. Slated to commence on 1 April 2017 and aiming to engage over 30,000 young jobseekers, the program will feature three stages; the first stage being an intensive pre-employment skills training course, five months after job seekers register with the Department of Employment's [...] "jobactive" [...] service. The second stage with see job seekers introduced into the workplace through at least 120,000 four to twelve-week internships provided in cooperation with jobactive and participating businesses, where businesses will receive an upfront payment of $1000 for each intern they take on, and interns will be paid an additional $200 a fortnight, {{on top of their}} income support payments. In the third and final stage, businesses who hire participants as employees will be given a <b>wage</b> <b>subsidy</b> of $10,000 for hiring [...] "less than job ready" [...] seekers and $6,500 for more job ready seekers, billed as the [...] "Youth Bonus wage subsidy". To fund the program, $500 million will be axed from the work for the dole scheme, in addition to the $240 million Job Commitment Bonus. Furthermore, as of October 2016, [...] "the most prepared job seekers" [...] will now require at least 12 months of registration with jobactive for work for the dole, instead of the six months required before the change, forecast to save $494.2 million over four years.|$|E
30|$|<b>Wage</b> <b>subsidies,</b> {{payments}} to employers or workers that {{reduce the cost}} of labor or increase take-home pay, are increasingly being adopted or considered by developing countries as one component of their labor market policy (ILO and World Bank 2012). <b>Wage</b> <b>subsidies</b> were common during the recent financial crisis as a means to maintain employment levels (Banerji et al. 2014). In several countries they are used to promote the integration into the labor market of specific groups of workers, including youth and women (Almeida et al. 2012).
