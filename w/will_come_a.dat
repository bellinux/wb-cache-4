25|$|Biogerontologist Marios Kyriazis {{suggested}} that biological immortality in humans is an inevitable consequence of natural evolution. His theory of extreme lifespans through perpetual-equalising interventions (ELPIs) proposes {{that the ability}} to attain indefinite lifespans is inherent in human biology, and that there <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> time when humans will continue to develop their intelligence by living indefinitely, rather than through evolution by natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Further to {{what has}} been {{mentioned}} it should be stressed that a good well-aged pu'er tea is not evaluated by its age alone. Like all things in life, there <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> time when a pu'er teacake reaches its peak before stumbling into a decline. Due to the many recipes and different processing method used in the production of different batches of pu'er, the optimal age for each age will vary. Some may take 10 years while others 20 or 30+ years. It is important to check the status of ageing for your teacakes to know when they peaked so that proper care can be given to halt the ageing process.|$|E
500|$|When Balzac was {{exhibited}} in 1898, the negative reaction was not surprising. The Société rejected the work, {{and the press}} ran parodies. Criticizing the work, Morey (1918) reflected, [...] "there may come a time, and doubtless <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> time, when it will not seem outre to represent a great novelist as a huge comic mask crowning a bathrobe, but even at the present day this statue impresses one as slang." [...] A modern critic, indeed, indicates that Balzac is one of Rodin's masterpieces.|$|E

500|$|Harriet {{returns in}} 2005 Christmas special [...] "The Christmas Invasion", set {{several months later}} when the {{character}} is now Prime Minister. Jones oversees {{the launch of the}} Guinevere Space Probe which is captured by an invading Sycorax spaceship. Although the invasion is averted by the Doctor (now David Tennant) Jones orders the covert Torchwood organisation to destroy the retreating Sycorax ship, arguing that there <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> time when the Doctor cannot protect Earth and so she must do what she can to defend it. The Doctor reacts furiously to what he perceives as cold blooded murder and tells her that he can bring her down with just six words: [...] "Don't you think she looks tired?" [...] In the episode's dénouement, Jones faces rumours of ill-health and a vote of no confidence. In the 2007 episode [...] "The Sound of Drums" [...] it is stated that the Master, running for Prime Minister under the alias Mr Saxon, appeared right after Harriet Jones's downfall.|$|E
500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>a</b> darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{application}} of the traditional [...] "man" [...] and traditional [...] "woman" [...] in lesbian relationships is common, as with gay male relationships.
