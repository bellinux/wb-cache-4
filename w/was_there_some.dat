2500|$|Since dikyklos (δίκυκλος) and tetrakyklos (τετράκυκλος) {{mean nothing}} but [...] "two-wheeler" [...] and [...] "four-wheeler," [...] {{and since the}} monokyklos (μονόκυκλος) body is {{sandwiched}} in the Eleusis inventory between a four-wheeler body and its four wheels, to take it as anything but a one-wheeler strains credulity far beyond breaking point. It can only be a wheelbarrow, necessarily guided and balanced by a man...what does now emerge as certainty is that the wheelbarrow did not, as is universally claimed, make its European debut in the Middle Ages. It <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> sixteen centuries before.|$|E
2500|$|I said to him, 'Commander of the Believers, <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> {{matter that}} troubled you this night?' And he said, 'Yes, I saw how I was {{occupied}} while governing {{the affairs of}} the community, all its black sheep and its white sheep, and I remembered the stranger, beggared and straying, and the poor and the needy, and the prisoners in captivity, and all like them in the far places of the earth, and I realised that God Most High would ask me about all of them, and I (Umar) would testify about them, and I feared that I should find no excuse when I was with God, and no defence with me.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wondered}} <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> double {{meaning in}} the words. I made shift to pass on, leaving his taunt unanswered, when suddenly he stepped {{up to me and}} tapped my shoulder.|$|E

50|$|The NP-complete problem In the {{previous}} section resembles typical puzzles: <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> way to plug in values that solves the problem? Correspondingly, the PSPACE-complete problem <b>there</b> resembles games: <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> move I can make, such that for all moves my opponent might make, <b>there</b> will then <b>be</b> <b>some</b> move I can make to win? The question alternates existential and universal quantifiers. Not surprisingly, many puzzles {{turn out to be}} NP-complete, and many games turn out to be PSPACE-complete.|$|R
50|$|He famously (in {{relation}} to scientists) said: <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> {{people who live}} in a dream world, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> who face reality: and then <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> who turn one into the other.|$|R
60|$|As {{he often}} remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, {{he found himself}} at first gazing at the {{portrait}} {{with a feeling of}} almost scientific interest. That such a change should have taken place was incredible to him. And yet it was a fact. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> subtle affinity between the chemical atoms, that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas, and the soul that was within him? Could it be that what that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they made true? Or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> other, more terrible reason? He shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the picture in sickened horror.|$|E
60|$|A {{telegram}} for Carmina? <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> {{private correspondence}} going on? And were the interests involved {{too important to}} wait for the ordinary means of communication by post? Considering these questions, Mrs. Gallilee poured out a cup of tea and looked over her letters.|$|E
6000|$|Had she {{given an}} assumed name? <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> unhappy celebrity {{attached}} to her own name? Miss Roseberry did not wait to ask herself these questions. [...] "How can I thank you," [...] she exclaimed, gratefully, [...] "for your sisterly kindness to a stranger like me?" ...|$|E

"They are an {{extremely}} heterogeneous group. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> 40 different nationalities, there's 18 different languages, There's a big division between Arabic-speaking and Urdu-Pashto-speaking ones. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> {{people who are}} extremely well educated and westernised, and {{some people who are}} not at all. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> very young people and some very old and wise people. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> people who speak English well, people who don't speak English at all. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> who go in with mental disorders <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> very secular, and some deeply devout." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>there</b> <b>is</b> much beast {{and some}} devil in man; so <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> angel and some God in him. The beast {{and the devil}} may be conquered, but in this life never destroyed.|$|R
6000|$|Amelius listened, wondering. Had he seen drowsily what {{he thought}} he had dreamed, or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> mysterious sympathy between Sally and himself? The occult speculations were {{interrupted}} by Sally. [...] "May I take off my bonnet, and make myself tidy?" [...] she asked. Some men might have said No. Amelius was not one of them.|$|E
6000|$|The strokes which {{represented}} the figures [...] "15" [...] were unquestionably a little, a very little, thicker than the strokes {{which represented}} the three zeros or [...] "noughts" [...] that followed. Had a hair {{got into the}} pen of the head-clerk, {{who had made the}} entry? or <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> trifling defect in the paper, at that particular part of the page? ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> {{instinct}} {{of humanity}} {{left in the}} soldier who allowed Marguerite through the barrier into the prisoner's cell? Had the wan face of this beautiful woman stirred within his heart the last chord of gentleness that was not wholly atrophied by the constant cruelties, the excesses, the mercilessness which his service under this fraternising republic constantly demanded of him? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] exclaimed the King, {{casting a}} keen {{glance at his}} son. [...] "Are you {{becoming}} interested in politics, then; or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> grievous breach of court etiquette which has attracted your attention?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{truth in}} it," [...] replied a colleague. [...] "He {{has gone to}} Rome--there is no doubt of that, and he has <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> time, but only for distraction. He had overworked himself." ...|$|R
60|$|It seemed {{incredible}} that a {{woman of}} that quality {{should be forced to}} accept a vocation at once so low, so distasteful, and so unremunerative. With her evident antecedents, had she no friends but this common Western night watchman of a bank? Had Roberts deceived him? Was his whole story a fabrication, and <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> complicity between the two? What was it? He knit his brows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some soldier {{took me to}} an officer's tent. Nell <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>some</b> white an' all in. She just said, 'Laddy!' Thorne was there, too, an' he was bein' worked over by {{the camp}} doctor. I didn't ask no questions, because I seen quiet was needed round that tent. After {{satisfying}} myself that Nell was all right, an' Thorne in no danger, I went out.|$|E
6000|$|The doubt {{had barely}} {{occurred}} to her, before a startling suspicion succeeded it. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> secret purpose {{to be answered}} by making her sleep in the spare room? Did the question which the servant had heard Geoffrey put to Hester, on the previous night, refer to this? Had the fire which had so unaccountably caught the curtains in her own room, been, by any possibility, a fire purposely kindled, to force her out? ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{relevant}} question: {{what will}} research discover? Can [...] "types" [...] of mental states be meaningfully described by [...] "types" [...] of physical events (type physicalism), or <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> other {{problem with this}} pursuit? ...|$|R
6000|$|A pause. [...] "All right." [...] The light flickered to the ground. [...] "You <b>were</b> <b>there.</b> <b>Some</b> trouble {{broke out}} {{between you and}} the Willet boy. Is that right? You had a beef over his girl--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Chalmers, earnestly, [...] "you {{interest}} me very much. Did {{all of your}} portraits reveal some unpleasant trait, or <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> that did not suffer from the ordeal of your peculiar brush?" ...|$|R
60|$|His pocket-book <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> <b>Some</b> papers {{fell from}} {{it as she}} unfastened the clasp. One {{of them was the}} letter which had come to him from Mr. Brock's death-bed. She turned over the two sheets of note-paper on which the rector had written the words that had now come true, and found the last page of the last sheet a blank. On that page she wrote her {{farewell}} words, kneeling at her husband's side.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Not very long,' I said; 'but I {{went down}} once to Cairo, and <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> years. It was there I {{came to know}} {{something}} of {{the ways of the}} infidels.

If you will tell me what to do, I will follow your instructions carefully.' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{repeated}} {{these words}} {{over and over}} again, till the hearing them seemed to bewilder all my senses. I hardly knew what I touched. Suddenly, my searching hands stopped of themselves, I could not tell why. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> change in the room? Was there more air in it, as if a door had been opened? Was there something moving over the floor? Had Margaret left her bed?--No! the mournful voice was speaking unintermittingly, and speaking from the same distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he remarked}} at last, with a long-drawn breath, [...] "all I've {{got to say}} <b>is</b> <b>there's</b> <b>some</b> pretty nice people in this world after all. Take Mrs. Mortimer. Now she's the real goods--regular old American." ...|$|R

He corded up the box at his leisure, {{concealed}} it in its accustomed place, took his brandy-bottle from the cupboard, opened Joanna Grice's letter--and still there was no sound of any one entering, in the passage downstairs. Before he began to read, he drank some of the spirit from the neck of the bottle. <b>Was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> inexplicable dread stealing over him at the mere prospect of examining the contents of this one solitary letter? ...|$|E

6000|$|When she {{had seen}} her father begging with his threadbare {{disguise}} on, when she had entreated him not to give her father money, she had been distressed, but not like this. Something had made her keenly and additionally sensitive just now. Now, <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>some</b> one in the hopeless unattainable distance? Or had the suspicion been brought into his mind, by his own associations of the troubled river running beneath the bridge with the same river higher up, its changeless tune upon the prow of the ferry-boat, so many miles an hour the peaceful flowing of the stream, here the rushes, there the lilies, nothing uncertain or unquiet? ...|$|E
