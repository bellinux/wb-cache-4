[...] One Iraqi Christian told Human Rights <b>Watch</b> <b>how</b> he was stopped by insurgents in Anbar and ordered to convert to Islam or face death. Another Iraqi Shia related how insurgents from other Arab countries had expelled many Kurds and Shi'ia from cities and executed others. After the Second Battle of Fallujah, American forces uncovered Al Qaeda torture and execution chambers, which had been used on Iraqis suspected of working with Westerners or the Iraqi government. Some of the chambers still contained victims. Some executions, like those of Nicholas Berg and Kim Sun-il, had been videotaped by their perpetrators. [...] Some Fallujah residents stated that during the battle, Al Qaeda had shot anyone trying to leave.|$|E

500|$|Anime News Network's Carlo Santos {{said that}} the series walks [...] "the line between serious sleuth drama and supernatural spell-fest", [...] "balancing all that with the {{occasional}} joke". He said the graphic violence is {{the best part of}} the series, praised the Madhouse animation and described it as [...] "Case Closed with spirit powers". Serdar Yegulalp from About.com said it has [...] "n interesting concept", is [...] "competent enough", and [...] "has a few fun twists", but that apart from the supernatural elements it does not bring anything that has not already been done in Case Closed. Writing for Mania.com, Chris Beveridge said the anime operates principally around the two main characters; he said that it is [...] "more interesting to <b>watch</b> <b>how</b> Neuro and Yako operate, to understand methods and personalities, more than the actual event. And that weakens the episode because it never feels like we're really drawn into the mystery itself." [...] Beveridge added it [...] "has some good production values", but criticized Neuro's appearance, [...] "which is bordering on comical" [...] as it makes it difficult for the series [...] "to go a darker route".|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Lionel visits Smallville {{to buy the}} Ross Creamed Corn company {{immediately}} before a meteor shower occurs. Twelve years later during season one, Lionel exiles his son Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) to Smallville to run LuthorCorp's local fertilizer plant as a test. When Lex makes a profit {{for the first time}} in years, Lionel closes the plant and blames Lex's poor managerial skills. Lionel later confronts his son at the Luthor mansion when Lex tries to orchestrate an employee buyout to save the fertilizer plant. When strong winds force debris to smash through the mansion, Lionel is pinned under a fallen support beam and Lex hesitates to save his father. In Season two, Lex saves Lionel but loses his sight because of Lex's judgment to rush into surgery. Season two's first half shows Lionel as blind. Lex and Lucas Luthor (Paul Wasilewski)—Lionel's illegitimate son—devise a plan to uncover Lionel's deception; it is revealed that Lionel was blind but that his eyes healed and he intentionally neglected to tell anyone so he could <b>watch</b> <b>how</b> they acted around him. Season two's second half shows Lionel is aware of the Kawatche caves and tries to unlock the mysterious symbols there, to the dismay of Clark Kent (Tom Welling).|$|E
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} in 1988 {{asked about the}} Bulletin Board System jargon in his writing, Gibson answered [...] "I'd never so much as touched a PC when I wrote Neuromancer"; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community. Gibson similarly did not play computer games despite appearing in his stories. He wrote Neuromancer on a 1927 olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which Gibson described as [...] "the kind of thing Hemingway would have used in the field". By 1988 he used an Apple IIc and AppleWorks to write, with a modem ("I don't really use it for anything"), but until 1996 Gibson {{did not have an}} email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing. His first exposure to a website came while writing Idoru when a web developer built one for Gibson. In 2007 he said, [...] "I have a 2005 PowerBook G4, a gig of memory, wireless router. That's it. I'm anything but an early adopter, generally. In fact, I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them; I <b>watch</b> <b>how</b> people behave around them.

She scored 82 points less than the leading competitor, Ki Bo-bae of South Korea. Zam competed against American Khatuna Lorig, the fourth ranking athlete in the ranking round, in the round of 64. Lorig beat Zam three sets to none in about six minutes. This meant Zam was eliminated from the competition. After the games Zam said: [...] "I am not that good at archery but I love it. It was so good to meet world ranking archers who are famous and to <b>watch</b> <b>how</b> they do it.

In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is [...] "the third Rei". Misato forces Ritsuko to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard and the dummy plug system which operates using clones of Rei.

Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to thrive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates but eventually kills him. [...] After the final Angel is defeated, Seele triggers the [...] "Human Instrumentality Project", a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of all mankind are merged together through Rei. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the others, who congratulate him.|$|E

2500|$|After {{securing}} neutrality from Konstantin, {{the grand}} duke retreated behind Russian lines to <b>watch</b> <b>how</b> the scenario would play out.

[...] This was due to a promise by the Russians earlier {{that they were going to}} help put the rebellion down. [...] The patriotic Poles could not have been more pleased [...] they took the upper hand and the Grand Duke Konstantin on 3 December retreated toward Russia. He himself retreated behind Russian lines but following the failure of the uprising expressed admiration for the valor of the Polish insurgents. The policy of neutrality at all costs has led to Konstantin being viewed two ways through the scope of history, either he would be viewed by the Russian royal family as weak and a sympathizer to the Poles, or he would be seen as a seed for the idea of a soon to be independent Poland, though he was trying to effectively avoid a war.|$|E

2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would <b>watch</b> <b>how</b> coaches were working with students. Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There was something in Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, I did not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. But I could see he had something special." ...|$|E
