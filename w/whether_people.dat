During the first night, {{as he and his}} father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have looked}} for {{evidence}} of {{the driving force behind}} the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name. Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E
5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no genetic defect in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E

One campaign that aimed at raising awareness of precycling focused on <b>whether</b> <b>people’s</b> self-reported behaviors were affected by exposure to precycling advertisements on the radio, television, or in-store flyers. The researchers concluded that the most effective results stemmed from the inclusion of social rewards that invoke an intrinsic motivation to engage in precycling behaviors.|$|R

It aims to describe and examine <b>whether</b> <b>people's</b> lifestyle {{can contribute to the}} development of depression. The thesis describes contemporary society, defines the lifestyle and the main areas this lifestyle manifests itself. It also describes the affective disorders. The conclusion includes a few interviews with both healthy and depressed people which should ilustrate the theoretical knowledge for better understanding...|$|R
25|$|Ibn Khaldun {{believed}} that the physical environment influenced non-physical factors in addition to skin color. He argued that soil, climate, and food determined <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> were nomadic or sedentary, and what customs and ceremonies they held. His writings may have influenced the later writings of Montesquieu during the 18th century through the traveller Jean Chardin, who travelled to Persia and described theories resembling those of Ibn Khaldun.|$|E
25|$|Political {{security}} – Political {{security is}} concerned with <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> {{live in a society}} that honors their basic human rights. According to a survey conducted by Amnesty International, political repression, systematic torture, ill treatment or disappearance was still practised in 110 countries. Human rights violations are most frequent during periods of political unrest. Along with repressing individuals and groups, governments may try to exercise control over ideas and information.|$|E
25|$|A 2006 {{study in}} the Journal of Conflict Resolution found that {{although}} almost no respondents in countries of the European Union regarded themselves as antisemitic, antisemitic attitudes correlated with anti-Israel opinions. Looking at populations in 10 European countries, Charles A. Small and Edward H. Kaplan surveyed 5,000 respondents, asking them about Israeli actions and classical antisemitic stereotypes. The surveys asked questions about <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> thought that the IDF purposely targets children or puts poisons the Palestinian water supplies.|$|E

25|$|Introduction of {{same-sex}} marriage laws has varied by jurisdiction, being variously accomplished through legislative change to marriage laws, a court ruling based on constitutional guarantees of equality, or by direct popular vote (via ballot initiative or referendum). The recognition {{of same-sex}} {{marriage is a}} political and social issue, and also a religious issue in many countries, and debates continue to arise over <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> in same-sex relationships should be allowed marriage or some similar status (a civil union).|$|E
25|$|Graph {{theory is}} also {{widely used in}} {{sociology}} as a way, for example, to measure actors' prestige or to explore rumor spreading, notably {{through the use of}} social network analysis software. Under the umbrella of social networks are many different types of graphs. Acquaintanceship and friendship graphs describe <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> know each other. Influence graphs model whether certain people can influence the behavior of others. Finally, collaboration graphs model whether two people work together in a particular way, such as acting in a movie together.|$|E
25|$|On {{account of}} the {{magnitude}} of the Holocaust, many theologians have re-examined the classical theological views on God's goodness and actions in the world. Some believers and former believers question <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> can still have any faith in God after the Holocaust, and some of the theological responses to these questions are explored in Holocaust theology. Orthodox Jews have stated their reasons for why they believe the Holocaust happened and, to a more extreme degree, why they felt the Jews of Europe deserved to die.|$|E

In this paper, we investigate <b>whether</b> <b>people’s</b> self-regulatory focus moderates a robust learning effect, like EC. Two studies demonstrate that evaluative conditioning of positive valence is moderated by self-regulatory focus. In particular, promotion-oriented individuals exhibit an increased attention for positive stimuli and an improved learning of positive valence. Evaluative conditioning of negative valence, however, was not moderated by self-regulatory focus...|$|R

25|$|Unlike Newell and Simon, John McCarthy {{felt that}} {{machines}} {{did not need}} to simulate human thought, but should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and problem solving, regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> used the same algorithms. His laboratory at Stanford (SAIL) focused on using formal logic to solve a wide variety of problems, including knowledge representation, planning and learning. Logic was also the focus of the work at the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere in Europe which {{led to the development of}} the programming language Prolog and the science of logic programming.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{cognitive}} psychologists {{carry out}} research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or IQ tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the Wason test). Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g., If A then B and how they make inferences about alternatives, e.g., A or else B. They test <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations, e.g., A is {{to the left of}} B, or A happens after B, and about quantified assertions, e.g., All the A are B. Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and counterfactual situations.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of <b>whether</b> <b>people</b> from different cultures vary in {{locus of control}} has long been of interest to social psychologists. Japanese {{people tend to be}} more external in locus-of-control orientation than people in the U.S.; however, differences in locus of control between different countries within Europe (and between the U.S. and Europe) tend to be small. As Berry et al. pointed out in 1992, ethnic groups within the United States have been compared on locus of control; African Americans in the U.S. are more external than whites when socioeconomic status is controlled. Berry et al. also pointed out in 1992 how research on other ethnic minorities in the U.S. (such as Hispanics) has been ambiguous. More on cross-cultural variations in locus of control can be found in Shiraev and Levy (2004). Research in this area indicates that locus of control has been a useful concept for researchers in cross-cultural psychology.|$|E
