500|$|The main {{theme of}} the novel is drugs, which Faulks said came partly from the {{timeframe}} of the novel and partly from Fleming not using it as a major theme: [...] "1967, the summer of love... Drugs were first coming to public notice. The Stones were busted, and there was that famous leader in The Times. And, you know, what are <b>we</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> now all the time? Drugs. It's still very resonant. And there's little about drug-dealing in Fleming. It's not something he did in any depth." [...] Faulks also wanted to broaden the aspect of the story compared to Fleming: [...] "The book is set during the Cold War and I wanted it to not just be a crime story but to also have a political background. I was also determined that although the book is set in 1967, I wanted the issues that it touches on to still be alive to us today".|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{maintains}} {{that she has}} never received any formal acting training. Instead, she credits director Milton Katselas with teaching her the difference between how an actor initially thinks a character would behave during a particular scene, and how the actor themself would behave during that same scene. Vulture.com's Angelica Jade Bastién identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an actress of such depth, breadth, and tenacity, she obliterates the argument that an untrained actor has less capability than her trained counterparts." [...] In 1992, Rolling Stone Gerri Hirshey identified Pfeiffer as [...] "an accomplished character actress" [...] who is comfortable wearing costumes that are unflattering in the traditional Hollywood sense, The Fabulous Baker Boys Susie Diamond – her most critically acclaimed role to-date – being a notable exception at the time. Pfeiffer explained that she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them interesting, opting to play characters that [...] "move" [...] her instead: [...] "I know that if I can hear the character as I'm reading, it's made some connection [...]" [...] A film critic once summarized the actress as [...] "a character actress in a screen siren's body", a sentiment with which her Scarface co-star and friend Al Pacino agrees. Pfeiffer is often commended for her ability to disguise her true feelings and emotions, a technique she frequently uses to her advantage in period films; playing roles in period costume {{has become something of}} a trademark of hers. Pfeiffer herself has admitted to being skilled in this particular area but at the same time believes that hiding one's true feelings is not uncommon, speculating, [...] "that's how most people behave. We may not be as mannered or as proper as people were in the 19th century, but very rarely are <b>we</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> what we're really thinking." [...] Pfeiffer has called acting a [...] "sadomasochistic" [...] profession due to how [...] "brutal" [...] the process can be at times. She is often praised for her acting abilities by various directors with whom she has collaborated over the years. Director Martin Scorsese described Pfeiffer, who he directed in the period drama The Age of Innocence (1993), as [...] "an actress who could portray inner conflict with her eyes and face better than any other film star of her generation." [...] Jonathan Demme (Married to the Mob, 1988) declared “It’s hard for me to imagine anyone who, on a level of quality, would have an edge on her." ...|$|E
