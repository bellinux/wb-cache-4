5|$|The {{image of}} a <b>winding</b> <b>stair</b> has also been tied to scenes in Dante's journey from Purgatory to Paradise in the Divine Comedy. Further, the image is thought {{associated}} with stairs as the path of mystical ascent {{in the writings of}} sixteenth-century Spanish mystic Saint John of the Cross. Eliot often alludes to this symbol in several of his poems.|$|E
25|$|The narrow, five-storey {{tower is}} only 7.5 m square, with walls up to 1.6 m thick. Each level {{originally}} {{had a single}} room, with a <b>winding</b> <b>stair,</b> built into {{the thickness of the}} walls, wrapping around and linking the floors. At the basement level was a low-vaulted cellar with its own access. The main door was at the first-floor, level giving access to a small hall. Above this are two further rooms, the second vaulted. The stair continues to a pyramidal caphouse, giving access to the east parapet walk. The west parapet walk is accessed through the garret room at this level.|$|E
500|$|Modernists {{read the}} {{well-known}} poem [...] "The Second Coming" [...] as a dirge {{for the decline}} of European civilisation, but it also expresses Yeats's apocalyptic mystical theories, and is shaped by the 1890s. His most important collections of poetry started with The Green Helmet (1910) and Responsibilities (1914). In imagery, Yeats's poetry became sparer and more powerful as he grew older. The Tower (1928), The <b>Winding</b> <b>Stair</b> (1933), and New Poems (1938) contained {{some of the most}} potent images in twentieth-century poetry.|$|E

2500|$|The rood screen, that {{wonderful}} {{feature of the}} medieval church, was now universal. It consisted of a tall screen of usually about thirty ft. high, {{on the top of}} which rested a loft, i.e. a platform rood about [...] in width guarded on either side by a gallery screen, and either on the top or in front of that, facing the nave, was placed the rood, i.e. a large crucifix with figures of St Mary and St John on either side. This rood screen sometimes spanned the church in one continuous length (Leeds, Kent), but often filled in the aisle and chancel arches in three separate divisions (Church Handborough, Oxon.). The loft was as a rule approached by a <b>winding</b> <b>stair</b> built in the thickness of the aisle wall. The lower part of the screen itself was solid paneled to a height of about [...] and the upper part of this paneling was filled in with tracery (Carbrook, Norfolk), while the remaining flat surfaces of the panels were often pictured with saints on a background of delicate gesso diaper (Southwold, Suffolk). Towards the end of this period the employment of figures became less common as a means of decoration, and the panels were sometimes filled- entirely with carved foliage (Swimbridge, Devon). The upper part of the rood screen consisted of open arches with the heads filled in with pierced tracery, often enriched with crockets (Seaming, Norfolk), embattled transoms (Hedingham Castle, Essex), or floriated cusps (Eye, Suffolk). The mullions were constantly carved with foliage (Cheddar, Somerset), pinnacles (Causton, Norfolk), angels (Pilton, Devon), or decorated with canopy work in gesso (Southwold). But the feature of these beautiful screens was the loft with its gallery and vaulting. The loft floor rested {{on the top of the}} rood screen and was usually balanced and kept in position by means of a groined vaulting (Harberton, Devon) or a cove (Eddington, Somerset). The finest examples of vaulting are to be seen in Devon. The bosses at the intersections of the ribs and the carved tracery of the screen at Honiton stand unrivaled. Many screens still possess the beam which formed the edge of the loft floor and on which the gallery rested. It was here that the medieval roodscreen carver gave most play to his fancy, and carved the finest designs in foliage to be seen throughout the whole Gothic period. Although these massed moulds, crests and bands have the appearance of being carved out of one log, they were in practice invariably built up in parts, much of the foliage, etc., being pierced and placed in hollow moulds in order to increase the shadow. As a rule the arrangement consisted of a crest running along the top, with a smaller one depending from the lower edge, and three bands of foliage and vine between them (Feniton, Devon). The designs of vine leaves at Kenton, Bow and Dartmouth, all in Devon, illustrate three very beautiful treatments of this plant. At Swimbridge, Devon, there is a very elaborate combination; the usual plain beads which separate the bands are carved with twisted foliage also. At Abbots Kerswell and other places in the district round Totnes the carvers introduced birds in the foliage with the best effect. The variety of cresting used is very great. That at Winchcomb, Gloucester, consists of dragons combined with vine leaves and foliage. It illustrates how Gothic carvers sometimes repeated their patterns in as mechanical a way as the worst workmen of the present time. Little can be said of the galleries, so few remain to us. They were nearly all pulled down when the order to destroy the roods was issued in 1548. That they were decorated with carved saints under niches (Llananno, Wales), or painted figures (Strencham, Worcester), is certain from the examples that have survived the Reformation. At Atherington. Devon, the gallery front is decorated with the royal coat of arms, other heraldic devices, and with prayers. The Breton screen at St Fiacre-le-Faouet is a wonderful example of French work of this time, btit does not compare with the best English examples. Its flamboyant lines and its small tracery never obtained any foothold in England, though screens carved in this way (Colebrook, Devon) are sometimes to be found.|$|E
