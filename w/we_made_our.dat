To their credit they said, 'yes, we'll back it in' and that is when <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> move. We could've been sitting outside the finals and {{watching}} this game evolve." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} week, Blue Byte {{announced the}} slated December release {{had been pushed}} back to January 2001, with Thomas Hertzler (Blue Byte CEO and the series producer) explaining, [...] "we know that many gamers were particularly looking forward to The Settlers IV this year and, of course, we understand if Settlerss fans are disappointed. In the end, however, <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> decision with the players in mind. The Settlers IV will not be on shelves before Christmas, but fans will receive a game that corresponds to Blue Byte's high quality standard." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> {{reflection}} {{that this}} passage was probably {{out of the}} rejected contribution, {{but we did not}} say anything, and our visitor went on.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>made</b> dumb <b>our</b> {{anger and}} our honour; {{but it has}} not brought us peace.|$|R
30|$|We {{will now}} explain the main choices <b>we</b> <b>made</b> for <b>our</b> system {{regarding}} utterance selection and utterance verification procedures.|$|R
5000|$|On 25 March 2011, {{the video}} for single [...] "The Mess <b>We</b> <b>Made</b> Of <b>Our</b> Lives" [...] was released.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are betrothed, of course?" [...] Mrs. Klaas said to Hilda before me, {{with the}} curious tactlessness of her race, when <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> first arrangement.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> {{plans as}} to when and where we should meet and other matters, after which he departed, bowing himself away with many smiles.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} side, about the break of the poop, some half a fathom of rope-ladder trailed over the rail, {{and by this}} <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> entrance.|$|E
30|$|Finally, we {{note that}} <b>we</b> have <b>made</b> <b>our</b> {{implementations}} available for public access via an OpenSource repository at GitHub as particlefilter [30].|$|R

60|$|What {{an empty}} useless beauty the great Park possessed during those seasons of intermission! There were {{a score of}} places in it <b>we</b> had <b>made</b> <b>our</b> own....|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> {{way down}} into the garden, which they searched last. At the creek's side the boat was gone, and there were {{footsteps}} in the mud.|$|E
60|$|In {{a minute}} I {{was out of}} the house. Kate was close on my heels, and {{together}} <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> way to the orchard, followed by the others.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was not necessary," [...] {{the officer}} said, in a surly tone. [...] "There {{can be no}} mistake possible, {{considering}} {{the way in which}} <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> entries." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> had <b>made</b> <b>our</b> {{way about}} half the {{distance}} across {{one end of the}} great apartment when a low growl from the far end brought us to a startled halt.|$|R
2500|$|<b>We</b> have <b>made</b> <b>our</b> {{positions}} well known. Ghanaian societies frown {{on homosexuality}} ... if the people's interest {{is that we}} do not legalize homosexuality, I don't see how any responsible leader will decide to go against the wishes of his people. I heard what the secretary general said and I wasn't surprised because of where he is coming from, but we only listened to him. <b>We</b> have all <b>made</b> <b>our</b> positions well known. Nobody can say in Ghana we discriminate against homosexuality, there is no witch-hunting on homosexuality ... that is their own problem so we only listen and move on. The secretary general has made his views known and <b>we</b> have also <b>made</b> <b>our</b> views known so the value is the same.|$|R

60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> {{way to the}} {{hospital}} after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.|$|E
6000|$|We tracked our seal to {{his secret}} place, [...] We heard him scratch below, <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> mark, {{and we watched}} beside, [...] Out {{on the edge of}} the floe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr Davidson and I talked it over, and <b>we</b> <b>made</b> up <b>our</b> minds {{the first}} thing to do was to put down the dancing. The natives were crazy about dancing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{thousand}} pounds {{of my mother}} was very a propos," [...] said Lord Marney; [...] "I suppose it was a sop that will keep them all right till <b>we</b> have <b>made</b> <b>our</b> arrangements." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> have <b>made</b> <b>our</b> love, and gamed our gaming, [...] Dressed, voted, shone, and maybe, {{something}} more; [...] With dandies dined, heard senators declaiming; [...] Seen beauties {{brought to}} market by the score," ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> {{way across}} the sand of the beach, among the rocks and through the close matted scrub, beyond which an {{eminence}} of rugged boulders shut out the further view.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he resumed, [...] "I {{expect you}} know payment in part is {{sometimes}} allowed before {{a job is}} finished, but when <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> agreement nothing was stated about this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Grant slowly, [...] "he {{had done}} {{a good deal for}} me, but that would not have counted for very much with any one when <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> decision." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{walked away}} in the {{gathering}} darkness of evening very quietly. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> up <b>our</b> mind as we went that novel writing is not for us. We must reach the penitentiary in some other way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid, my friends, <b>we</b> have <b>made</b> <b>our</b> journey for nothing," [...] said he, [...] "for I {{shall be}} obliged to carry my playthings back home again without giving them to the {{children}} of this village." ...|$|R
5000|$|Stripper and erotic {{performance}} artist Honeysuckle Divine wrote a column, [...] "Diary of a Dirty Broad", for Screw in 1974. According to Goldstein, her act [...] "was unbelievably disgusting, so naturally, <b>we</b> <b>made</b> her <b>our</b> symbol." ...|$|R
6000|$|We tracked our seal to {{his secret}} place, [...] We heard him scratch below, [...] <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> mark, {{and we watched}} beside, [...] Out {{on the edge of}} the floe.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> {{way back}} to the drawing-room, I was hoping for a talk with Dolly (alas! I should not have many more), when I heard a voice which sounded strangely familiar.|$|E
60|$|At length {{we reached}} the {{outskirts}} of the town. Judge Penfold lived at the top of what was termed the Hill, the aristocratic district of the place, and thither <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>our</b> way.|$|E
6000|$|... "When morning came {{we found}} that it was blowing and {{drifting}} so hard that we could not venture to move; so <b>we</b> <b>made</b> up <b>our</b> minds to remain where we were until the weather should moderate.|$|R
60|$|We soon got {{acquaintance}} with these gentlemen, {{who were going}} to Paris, as well as we; so the next day <b>we</b> <b>made</b> up <b>our</b> company with them, and were a pretty troop of five gentlemen and four servants.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder why}} we all torture {{ourselves}} so unnecessarily. It really {{seems as if the}} chief use <b>we</b> <b>made</b> of <b>our</b> reason was to inflict as much pain upon ourselves and upon one another as we possibly could." ...|$|R
