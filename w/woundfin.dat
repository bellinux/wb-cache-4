50|$|<b>Woundfin</b> (Plagopterus argentissimus) Federally listed {{endangered}} species Size: 4″ (10.2 cm)One of the rarest species on earth, the endangered <b>woundfin</b> is {{found only in}} a small section of the Virgin River. <b>Woundfin</b> have large fins and scale-less, streamlined bodies that help them survive in swift, silty conditions. Although small, it is shark-like in both appearance and action as it feeds on small insects in shallow areas along the river. <b>Woundfin</b> live only {{one to two years}} and their survival depends upon sufficient flow within the river, especially during hot summer months.|$|E
50|$|The <b>woundfin</b> tolerates highly mineralized, turbid waters. It is {{typically}} found in warm, swift streams of high turbidity, preferring a stream speed {{of one to}} two feet per second and a depth of eight to eighteen inches. <b>Woundfin</b> lives in part of salty streams, avoiding clear waters and rarely {{can be found in}} quieter pools.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, the <b>woundfin</b> also {{occupied}} the lower Colorado River from the Virgin to Yuma, Arizona, and the Gila River from Yuma to its confluence with the Salt River, but habitat destruction through water development (including eight major dams which alter flow) {{and the introduction}} of several species (particularly the red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis), which competes for food and is known to prey upon the woundfin's eggs and young) have led to its extirpation in these regions as well as a decline in population in the Virgin River. Since 1970, the <b>woundfin</b> has been listed as an endangered species. Other listings include [...] "Vulnerable" [...] on the IUCN Red List and [...] "Critically Imperiled" [...] (the most critical classification) by NatureServe. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service lists the population status as [...] "declining."The Dexter National Fish Hatchery in Dexter, New Mexico studies the <b>woundfin</b> in an effort to help conserve the species, and has successfully spawned the fish in captivity. However, efforts to transplant the species into other rivers and creeks have failed due to reproduction not taking place.On July 11, 2007, approximately 50 <b>woundfin</b> were released into the Hassayampa River near Wickenburg, Arizona. The hatchery-raised fish were from wild Virgin River stock. The only wild population of the species is in the Virgin River.An aggressive program to eradicate red shiner from the Virgin River in Utah has all but removed red shiner from reaches previously dominated by red shiner. Fish barriers have been erected to prevent re-colonization by red shiner, and has allowed the reintroduction of hatchery raised <b>woundfin.</b> Several thousand of hatchery-raised <b>woundfin</b> were released in the fall of 2007 and 2008. With red shiner no longer a threat, low flows and high temperatures are the biggest threats still facing wounfin.Another minnow, the Virgin River chub (Gila seminuda), has much of the same range as the <b>woundfin</b> and thus faces the same threats of extinction, particularly competition from the red shiner and a decrease in water quality as the result of agricultural runoff.|$|E
50|$|The <b>woundfin</b> is omnivorous, and {{depending}} on availability will feed on detritus, algae, seeds, and aquatic insects and their larvae.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, the <b>woundfin</b> {{occupied}} much of {{the lower}} Colorado River basin, including two tributaries, the Virgin River {{and part of the}} Gila River; however, habitat destruction through dams and water development has led to its extirpation from these regions. In addition, several introduced species, most notably the red shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis) have contributed to a decrease in the woundfin's Virgin River population. The <b>woundfin</b> is currently federally listed as an endangered species, while the United States Fish and Wildlife Service lists the population status as [...] "declining." ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>woundfin</b> (Plagopterus argentissimus) is {{a species}} of minnow endemic to the Virgin River of the southwestern United States. It is the only species in the {{monotypic}} genus Plagopterus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Woundfin</b> {{is a small}} slender, silvery minnow, with a {{flattened}} head and belly, long snout, leathery skin, and no scales. There are barbels on the corners of its lips, and its common name likely comes from the first spinous ray of its dorsal fin, which is sharp-pointed. Its maximum length is rarely more than 7.5 cm (3 in). It can be distinguished from spikedace and spinedace by presence of barbels.|$|E
50|$|Virgin spinedace (Lepidomeda mollispinis mollispinis) State {{conservation}} species Size: 5″ (12.7 cm)The Virgin spinedace looks, feeds, and behaves like {{a miniature}} trout. This silvery minnow gets {{its name from the}} sharp spiny rays in its dorsal fin. Virgin spinedace are found only in the Virgin River Basin. Unlike the <b>woundfin</b> and chub, which live only in the Virgin River, spinedace are also found throughout many tributary streams. Virgin Spinedace prefer deep pools and runs and are at home in both clear and turbid water.|$|E
5000|$|In North America, {{introduced}} B. acheilognathi {{are also}} known to infect threatened native species like humpback chub (Gila cypha), Mojave tui chub (Siphateles bicolor mohavensis), Virgin roundtail chub (Gila robusta seminuda), <b>woundfin</b> minnow (Plagopterus argentissimus), Profundulus portillorum [...] and the crucian carp (Carassius carassius). The {{discovery of the}} tapeworm’s substantial infections within the crucian carp population in the UK is of particular concern because there have not been any known natural tapeworm parasites of these crucian carp. A plausible cause {{may be that the}} crucian carp have limited immunological defenses against this parasite. In Australia, introduced B. acheilognathi has caused fish kills of Western Carp Gudgeon and is strongly suspected of affecting other Australian freshwater fish species.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{flowing through}} an arid region, the Virgin River {{is home to}} a {{surprisingly}} diverse array of plants and animals. Southwestern Utah is located at the intersection of three physiographic regions: the Colorado Plateau, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert. The exceptional landscapes and habitats of this region harbor unique plant and animal communities and species found nowhere else in the world. Without the water of the Virgin River system, these species could not exist. The Virgin River directly supports hundreds of wildlife species including, <b>woundfin,</b> Virgin River chub, Virgin spinedace, flannelmouth sucker, desert sucker, speckled dace, and Southwestern Willow Flycatcher. Many of these species are endangered or are considered sensitive species within the State of Utah. The Virgin River Program was established to balance increasing human demand and maintain this unique system.|$|E
40|$|The {{abundance}} of the <b>woundfin</b> since 1983 has declined both above Quail Creek and below Washington diversion on the Virgin River. In that {{segment of the}} Virgin River the parasite load has increased (Deacon 1988). The <b>woundfin</b> is presumably extirpated from the lower basin by reductions in stream flow brought about by climactic phenomena, such as drought and erosion, plus water storage and diversions (Miller and Hobbs 1960). Seasonal drying of extensive reaches of the mainstream has reduced the habitable range of the <b>woundfin.</b> Introduced species have {{also contributed to the}} decline of <b>woundfin</b> populations in the lower river via predation and, presumably, competition. Downstream from Mesquite, <b>woundfin</b> abundance decreased as red shiner abundance increased. The decline of the <b>woundfin</b> may have been the result of competition with the red shiner (Cross 1978). Dams and dewatering have made most habitats unsuitable, while exotic species, especially red shiners, have out competed <b>woundfin</b> in the few remaining flowing streams (Poulos 1984). Presently water diversions during low flow periods are capable of removing entire river flow at the Quail Creek diversion. A short distance downstream where Ash and LaVerkin Creeks moderate the extreme effects of increased temperature and salinity, fish survived through 1985 but no species reproduced successfully (Deacon 1988).

40|$|The <b>woundfin</b> minnow (Plagopterus argentissimus) is {{a unique}} spiny-rayed minnow from the Colorado River system that was listed as Endangered in 1970 under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Prior to listing, the {{historical}} range was {{hundreds of miles of}} river that included the Gila, Colorado and Virgin Rivers in Arizona, Nevada and Utah. At the time of listing, <b>woundfin</b> were only found in approximately 80 miles of the Virgin River (Utah, Arizona, Nevada). Since listing, the <b>woundfin</b> has declined in the Virgin River due to non-native species (red shiner, Cyprinella lutrensis), extended drought, and water development (Federal Register 2000). <b>Woundfin</b> currently exist primarily in a 17 mile reach of the upper Virgin River between the Quail Creek Diversion/ Pah Tempe Springs and the Washington Fields Diversion near St. George, Utah. Both diversions are large structures that typically divert most of the water from the Virgin River during the summer. At the top of the reach a thermal spring (Pah Tempe Springs) adds approximately 10 cfs of hot water to the reach. Groundwater, two small tributaries, a small hydropower plant discharge and a reservoir release (in the middle of the reach) add additional flow to the river. <b>Woundfin</b> numbers in the 17 mile reach have been critically low in recent drought years (especially 2001 - 2003). <b>Woundfin</b> Recovery Team fishes monitoring data since the late 1970 ’s indicate that <b>woundfin</b> numbers are lowest in the upper portion of this reach (Below the Ash Creek/La Verkin Creek confluence) and <b>woundfin</b> numbers fluctuate due to water year type. <b>Woundfin</b> numbers are low during low flow years and higher during high flow years (UDWR unpublished data). During the extreme drought year of 2002 (lowest water year on record), only 7 <b>woundfin</b> were captured in over 40 seining locations during fall collections. The most recent sampling (fall 2005), which followed an extremely wet year, showed that the number of <b>woundfin</b> captured for the same seining effort increased significantly to 1, 384 young-of-year (YOY) fish and 14 adults (UDWR unpublished data). The exact cause of the decline in the <b>woundfin</b> population during low flow years is still speculative, but some hypotheses suggest that the decline is related to high temperature and low turbidity during the low summer flow period and low dissolved oxygen during Quail Creek Diversion sluicing events (Fridell and Morvilius 2005 a). Here we focus on the effect high temperature [...] caused by low natural flows, natural hot springs, and water diversions [...] may be having on the <b>woundfin</b> population. We present the results of a laboratory growth and critical temperature study and river temperature data that indicate during the low flow years acute thermal tolerance and longer-term chronic temperatures for <b>woundfin</b> are periodically being exceeded...|$|E
40|$|Critical thermal maxima (CTM) {{and thermal}} preferenda {{of the common}} fishes of the Virgin River were examined. Differences in final {{temperature}} preferenda and CTM for species with low thermal lability (speckled dace, spinedace, roundtail chub) correspond well with differences in their distribution and abundance in the river. These species shifted their acute thermal preferences relatively little as acclimation temperature increased. For thermally labile species (<b>woundfin,</b> red shiner, desert sucker, and fiannehnouth sucker), the final preferendum is a less precise indicator of probable distribution. The <b>woundfin,</b> an endangered fish, has a high CTM (39. 5 C at 25 C acclimation) and a labile acute preferendum (slope nearest 1) compared to other species in the system. The introduced red shiner likewise has a high CTM and a labile acute preferendum. In cooler temperatures, its acute preferendum shifts more rapidly than does that of the <b>woundfin.</b> At higher temperatures (above 15 C), the red shiner does not shift its acute preferendum as rapidly as does the <b>woundfin.</b> The red shiner, however, has a higher final preferendum. For thermally labile species, influence of acclimation temperature on mean preferendum, together with CTM, provides a better insight into distributional relationships within the system...|$|E
40|$|The Endangered Species Act of 1973 {{requires}} {{examination of}} impacts on all federally listed threatened, endangered, and candidate species. Section 7 of the ESA requires all {{federal agencies to}} consult with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure that any action authorized, funded, or {{carried out by the}} agency does not jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species or critical habitats. In addition, The 2006 Management Policies and DO- 77 : Natural Resource Management requires the NPS to examine the impacts on federal candidate species, as well as stated listed species. In 2010 the USFWS directed the National Park Service to their Information, Planning, and Conservation System (IPAC) on the internet to obtain a list of species that may occur in project area. The list included the following species: greater sage grouse, Mexican spotted owl, southwestern willow flycatcher, yellow-billed cuckoo, Virgin River chub, <b>woundfin,</b> Gierisch mallow, Jones cycladenia, Las Vegas buckwheat, Shivwits milk-vetch, Welsh’s milkweed, Utah prairie dog, desert tortoise, and California condor. Zion does not have the habitat components to support most of these species. Or the park has surveyed potential habitat for certain species and have not found them (southwestern willow flycatcher, yellow-billed cuckoo).

40|$|Heightened {{demands for}} water in Washington County Utah, {{primarily}} due to population increases, have directly influenced the instream temperature regime of the Virgin River. Two endangered species that are unique to the Virgin River have historically suffered from elevated instream temperatures (Virgin River Chub (Gila seminuda) and the <b>Woundfin</b> (Plagopterus argentissimus) and therefore, are of chief management concern. An improved dynamic temperature model (Two-Zone Temperature and Solute Model) was necessary to enhance our comprehension of the local scale energy and mass exchange processes taking place within this river. Detailed and relevant data were required to populate, calibrate, and corroborate the model. These data included: temperature time series in the main channel flow, dead zone, and sediments; shortwave radiation penetrating the water column, being reflected off the water surface, and entering the bed substrate; tracer solute behavior in main channel and dead zones; and boundary condition information such as headwater temperatures and flow, lateral surface inflow rates and temperatures, and the appropriate weather data. In addition to these data, thermal imagery of the Virgin River was collected using a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) thermal imagery camera simultaneously {{in an attempt to}} improve model population, calibration, and corroboration by determining the ability of the model to predict spatially representative instream temperatures. With the development of this mechanistically advanced modeling approach and the ability to test the model performance with these detailed data, it is anticipated that the increased accuracy of instream temperature predictions will provide for improved water management decisions...|$|E
40|$|Water {{temperature}} directly affects {{biological and}} chemical processes of fresh water ecosystems. Elevated instream temperatures are commonplace in the Virgin River of southwestern Utah during summer due to a hot desert climate and high water demands that result in low stream flows. This is of concern since the Virgin River is home to two endangered species, the Virgin River Chub (Gila seminuda) and <b>Woundfin</b> (Plagopterus argentissimus). Efforts to model instream temperatures within the Virgin River have been undertaken to help mitigate elevated instream temperatures including {{the development of a}} two-zone temperature and solute (TZTS) model. This model was developed to approximate the dominant processes that influence instream temperatures and used both temperature and solute data in parameter estimation. Past model applications highlighted two concerns: (1) how to confidently estimate the high number of parameters and (2) whether Rhodamine WT (RhWT) {{could be used as a}} conservative solute tracer within the Virgin River. To begin addressing these issues, spatially representative data were collected to facilitate the physical estimation of two previously calibrated parameters: total average channel width (BTOT) and the fraction of channel width associated with dead zones (β). Methods for analyzing multispectral and thermal infrared imagery were developed to provide estimates of these parameters at different resolutions. Three different TZTS model calibration cases were then evaluated to determine how decreasing the calibrated parameters and increasing the resolution and frequency at which these parameters are estimated improved model predictions and/or decreased parameter uncertainty. While temperature predictions did not change significantly in each of the calibrations, parameter uncertainty was reduced. The concern regarding the use of RhWT resulted in a series of studies to quantify the potential losses of RhWT within this system. A batch sorption study resulted in distribution coefficient values lower than those found in literature. A photodegradation study suggested possible photolysis; however, a dual tracer study conducted within the Virgin River comparing Br- (conservative tracer) with RhWT confirmed that there was insignificant RhWT loss within this system...|$|E
