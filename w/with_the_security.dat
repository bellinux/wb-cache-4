5|$|By {{the next}} day, Mackay {{realised}} {{that the position}} could not be held. He personally kept the enemy at bay with his rifle while new barricades were constructed. When he was satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of the new position he reported to the battalion commander, who sent him to have his wounds dressed. Mackay's injuries were severe {{enough for him to}} be evacuated to Malta and then England, and he did not rejoin his battalion until February 1916, by which time it had been withdrawn to Egypt. For his actions at Lone Pine, Mackay was nominated for the Victoria Cross. He was overlooked for the award, although he was later mentioned in despatches.|$|E
5|$|Jetfire {{then goes}} to the desert and finds a {{weakened}} Optimus, who flew his escape pod to Egypt. Shortly after arriving Jetfire becomes mortally wounded by Starscream and sacrifices himself to give Optimus power to defeat The Fallen. Ironhide destroys the security around the Sun Harvester, and Optimus defeats Megatron. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> down, Optimus battles The Fallen, destroying both him and the Sun Harvester. Megatron and Starscream get sucked into a space bridge, which transports them to The Fallen's throne room. At {{the end of the}} game, the Autobots rebuild the destroyed pyramid, and Megatron and Starscream observe the creation of a massive Decepticon army now under their control.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two and a}} {{half months}} later, though, the MTA stated that it was unable to open the subway {{extension}} for service until April to July 2015, due to the failure to get the inclined elevators to work properly. Problems <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> and fire alarm systems were also blamed for the delays. A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, just above the subway station, and the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA could open the station. Continuing trouble with the fire and security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E

5|$|Marvin {{spent five}} months {{scouting}} prisons across the United States and Canada, {{looking for a}} site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio {{to serve as the}} fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings. After nearly a century of use, the facility had been closed three years earlier on New Year's Eve, 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Throughout mid-1835, {{both governments}} {{continued}} their practice of one-upmanship, and constant skirmishes and arrests occurred. Citizens of Monroe County joined {{together in a}} posse to make arrests in Toledo. Partisans from Ohio, angered by the harassment, targeted the offenders with criminal prosecutions. Lawsuits were not only rampant, they served {{as a basis for}} retaliatory lawsuits from the opposite side.

5|$|During the {{following}} weeks, vignettes aired where he berated {{members of his}} own family, eventually being confronted by José Huertas González. On October 7, 2012, Savio Vega reappeared in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre, issuing yet another challenge. However, this time Colón fired back with a challenge of his own, inviting Vega to a special edition of Carlito's Cabana. The edition of Carlito's Cabana that featured Vega took place on October 14, 2012. In the segment, both traded insults and it finished <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> removing Vega when he tried to assault Colón after the former spat an apple in his face. At Halloween Wrestling Xtravaganza he was disqualified, assaulting his opponent after his father, who served as special referee, did not allow Huertas González to use his finisher. At Honor vs. Traición, Colón unsuccessfully challenged Ray González for the Universal Heavyweight Championship. A Hair vs. Hair rematch was immediately scheduled for Lockout, which will feature a guest referee elected by popular vote between Vega and Huertas González. The following night marked the first time that Colón participated in a match where his father was among his opponents, but he avoided facing him directly, instead requesting a tag and only entering later to pin González.|$|E

5|$|However, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> {{situation}} in South Vietnam continuing to deteriorate, the US increased its involvement to 200,000 combat troops by early 1965. Australia also committed ground forces, dispatching the 1 RAR {{to serve with}} the US 173rd Airborne Brigade in Bien Hoa province in June 1965 and it subsequently fought {{a number of significant}} actions, including Gang Toi, Operation Crimp and Suoi Bong Trang. In March 1966, the Australian government announced the deployment of a brigade-sized unit—the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—to replace 1 RAR. Included were a large number of conscripts, under the increasingly controversial National Service Scheme. Consisting of two infantry battalions as well as armour, aviation, artillery and other support arms, the task force was assigned primary responsibility for its own area and was based at Nui Dat, in Phuoc Tuy Province. Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No. 9 Squadron RAAF. At the Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966, D Company, 6 RAR with considerable artillery support held off and defeated a Viet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than itself. 18 Australians were killed and 24 wounded, while 245 communist dead were later recovered from the battlefield. The battle allowed the Australians to gain dominance over Phuoc Tuy Province and 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again. Regardless, during February 1967 the Australians suffered their heaviest casualties in the war to that point, losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week, the bulk during Operation Bribie.|$|E
5|$|The {{new town}} of Conwy was {{populated}} by English settlers, particularly from nearby Cheshire and Lancashire, {{and the town}} walls were in part designed to encourage immigrants to settle there in safety. The town of Conwy was only modestly successful, however; by 1312 it had 124 burgage tenements – properties paying rent to the king – making it more successful than neighbouring Caernarfon, but less so than Beaumaris. Welsh residents appear to have slowly arrived inside the town during the 14th century, and even then were subject to considerable suspicion. Protecting the town remained a priority and during this period the constable charged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of the castle was also the mayor of Conwy, although protecting the town walls was probably {{the duty of the}} citizens rather than the forces attached to the castle. The walls were guarded by crossbowmen, and improved firing positions for them were built into the town walls {{at the start of the}} 14th century.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Spears {{and her friends}} in a hotel room, where a tabloid {{reporter}} on television criticizes her for the sexy, revealing outfits she's often seen wearing publicly. Spears and her friends express their disagreement with the report. Spears, determined to be self-sufficient and unaffected by media comments, then makes {{a phone call to}} her bodyguard, and using a cloth to disguise the sound of her voice, coaxes him to leave the area so that her group may sneak out of the hotel and enjoy the day. They run into an elevator and fool around briefly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> cameras before going up to the main lobby. A strut down the lobby of the hotel and a short dance sequence follows. As they leave the hotel, they follow towards the dance club. However, before they arrive, they're caught in an alley by several paparazzi, and start to perform a dance routine {{in the middle of the}} rain. As they make their entrance, they're dripping wet, an image which makes for more sensationalist fodder for the tabloid reporter.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the overall}} command of Australian Major General Peter Cosgrove, INTERFET began {{arriving}} on 12 September 1999 and was tasked with restoring peace and security, protecting and supporting UNAMET, and facilitating humanitarian assistance operations. With {{the withdrawal of}} the Indonesian armed forces, police and government officials from East Timor, UNAMET re-established its headquarters in Dili on 28 September. On 19 October 1999, Indonesia formally recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping force, the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) was established, becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor during its transition to independence. The hand-over of command of military operations from INTERFET to UNTAET was completed on 28 February 2000. Australia continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1,500 and 2,000 personnel, as well as landing craft and Blackhawk helicopters and remained the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission. During these operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro-Indonesian militia and {{on a number of occasions}} Indonesian forces as well, especially along the border with West Timor. Significant actions occurred in Suai, Mota'ain and at Aidabasalala in October 1999. However, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> situation stabilised the bulk of the Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005. Two Australians died from non-battle related causes, while a number were wounded in action.|$|E
5|$|Vito Spatafore is outed as {{homosexual}} {{after running}} into {{a friend at}} a New York gay night club. The rumor spreads quickly, and once word gets to Meadow that everyone else knows, she tells Tony and Carmela about the incident between Finn and Vito <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> guard. Finn then has to {{sit in front of}} Tony's entire crew and tell them what happened with the guard, solidifying their thoughts on Vito's sexuality. Tony is urged {{to deal with the problem}} by Phil Leotardo, now acting boss of New York with Johnny Sack in prison. Once Vito is outed, he runs away from the city and hides out in a New Hampshire town where he claims to be writing a book and meets with the locals. Vito also starts a romantic relationship with a male cook at a local diner. Eventually, Vito returns to New Jersey and asks Tony to allow him to return to work, albeit in Atlantic City. He continues to maintain that he is not a homosexual. Tony mulls over the decision to let him work, as well as whether to let him live. When Tony fails to act, Phil intervenes and kills Spatafore. When one of the members of the New York family, Fat Dom Gamiello, pays a visit to the Jersey office and won't stop making jokes about Vito and his death, the two members of Tony's crime family who are present kill Fat Dom out of anger at the disrespect he has shown. Once more, it appears that the families are on the verge of all-out war.|$|E
