When Lennon married Cynthia Powell, on 23 August 1962, Epstein served as best man and paid for the couple's celebration lunch afterwards. During Cynthia's pregnancy Epstein paid for a private room in a hospital and offered the Lennons the sole use of his flat on Falkner Street, Liverpool, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a home.

5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 {{feet off the}} ground and covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E
5|$|Methods have {{included}} reducing {{the percentage of}} gold in coins, or substituting less precious metals for gold. However, until the 19th century, {{the proportion of the}} world's trade that occurred between nations was very low, so exchanges rates were not generally a matter of great concern. Rather than being seen as a means to help exporters, the debasement of currency was motivated by a desire to increase the domestic money supply and the ruling authorities' wealth through seigniorage, especially <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to finance wars or pay debts. A notable example is the substantial devaluations which occurred during the Napoleonic wars. When nations wished to compete economically they typically practiced mercantilism – this still involved attempts to boost exports while limiting imports, but rarely by means of devaluation. A favoured method was to protect home industries using current account controls such as tariffs. From the late 18th century, and especially in Britain, which, for much of the 19th century, was the world's largest economy, mercantilism became increasingly discredited by the rival theory of free trade, which held {{that the best way to}} encourage prosperity would be to allow trade to occur free of government imposed controls. The intrinsic value of money became formalised with a gold standard being widely adopted from about 1870–1914, so while the global economy was now becoming sufficiently integrated for competitive devaluation to occur there was little opportunity. Following the end of World War I, many countries other than the US experienced recession and few immediately returned to the gold standard, so several of the conditions for a currency war were in place. However, currency war did not occur as the U.K. was trying to raise the value of its currency back to its pre-war levels, effectively cooperating with the countries that wished to devalue against the market.|$|E

25|$|On 17 December 2007, Daimler {{announced}} that they were selling their entire complex of 19 buildings at Potsdamer Platz to SEB Asset Management, a Frankfurt-based subsidiary of the Swedish banking group SEB.

Whilst the amounts involved have not been publicly disclosed, it is believed that neither Daimler nor Sony recouped all of their original investments (what Daimler managed to get was reportedly well short). The long-term benefits (or otherwise) of these sales, remain to be seen, but whilst they may have baffled many people at the time, they may turn out to have been a shrewd move, as Daimler and Sony have avoided being saddled with something they might have found much harder to sell at a later date, just <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> the cash the most.|$|E

25|$|Although the wicket at the Gabba usually favours fast bowlers {{both teams}} used a leg spinner and two off-spinners in the match, Bob Barber, Fred Titmus and Dave Allen for England and Peter Philpott, Tom Veivers and Bob Cowper for Australia. Vice-captain Brian Booth took command as Bobby Simpson had broken his wrist, and elected to bat {{after winning the}} toss. The 19-year-old Doug Walters was called up for his Test debut after having made 129 for New South Wales against the {{tourists}} {{and so was the}} fast bowler Peter Allan on his home ground. Bill Lawry's Victorian teammate Ian Redpath was brought in to open instead of Simpson. The veteran batsman Peter Burge ensured his place with innings of 52, 50, 114 not out and 60 against the MCC. The tourists had had the best run of games of any MCC team since the war, beating Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, drawing with Queensland, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> two more wickets to win, and losing to Victoria by 32 runs after a run-chase. As a result, the bookies reduced the odds of their winning the Ashes from 7/2 to evens. The England vice-captain Colin Cowdrey was unable to play and was replaced by the in form Scottish opener Eric Russell.|$|E
25|$|Back in England in 1965, Smith beat a weak New Zealand 3–0, {{then lost}} 1–0 to South Africa, but was {{appointed}} captain for the MCC tour of Australia in 1965-66 with Cowdrey as vice-captain, despite {{support for the}} Kent captain at Lord's. Although the press labelled the England team as the weakest to go to Australia, their entertaining cricket won them favour with the crowds. They also made their runs faster than any other England team since the war and for once England batted faster than Australia, a refreshing contrast to other Ashes series of the era. The tourists had had the best run of games of any MCC team since the war, beating Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, drawing with Queensland, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> two more wickets to win, and losing to Victoria by 32 runs after an exciting run-chase. As a result, the bookies reduced the odds of their winning the Ashes from 7/2 to evens. England survived the follow on in the First Test and made 558 in the Second, both drawn. At Sydney in the Third Test England rattled up 488 and won by an innings and 93 runs {{to give them a}} 1–0 lead in the series. It was Australia's biggest defeat at home for nearly 50 years, but they fought back to win the Fourth Test by an innings and retained the Ashes. Rain ruined play in New Zealand and the three Test series was drawn 0–0 despite the home team suffering {{at the hands of the}} England bowlers. On his return to England Smith was dropped after losing the First Test against the West Indies in 1966 by an innings. He was replaced by Cowdrey and retired at the end of the following season.|$|E

The Daily Telegraphs Gavin Fuller referred to her exit as [...] "being a genuine, and saddening shock." [...] Jeffrey praised the character's death as a [...] "well-handled shocker", noting that all signs had indicated Rex would die instead. He felt it was [...] "cruel trick on the writers' part to off lovely Agent Drummond" [...] and [...] "all the crueler to keep viewings hanging until that first glimpse of her funeral." [...] He concluded by saying that [...] "this kind of emotional sucker-punch" [...] is something Torchwood has always excelled at. Neela Debnath of The Independent commented that her death was sad because the [...] "character went through so much" [...] and that [...] "there would have been room for more growth in subsequent series." [...] Conversely, Los Angeles Times correspondent Todd VanDerWerff opined that it was hard to invest in Esther, in addition to Rex and Oswald, and though her death was intended as the [...] "one big, emotional moment of the finale" [...] it came across to him as [...] "kind of a dud". He felt that throughout the fourth series Esther was used as [...] "simply a plot device, someone the writers used <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> something to go wrong or <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> the story to move in a certain direction." [...] Blair Marnell of CraveOnline also notes in his review of the series finale that [...] "Rex and Esther never really caught on as leading characters" [...] and felt {{that it would have been}} better had the characters departed in symmetry.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to a lawyer father and {{psychologist}} mother. He began his acting career {{as a child in}} 1949, in radio drama and summer stock theatre. His cousins Murray and Donald Davis ran the Straw Hat Players in Ontario in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and rehearsed in the basement of Davis' house. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a boy they gave William his first professional acting job. He went on from there to have a career as a boy actor on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio before his voice broke. [...] In 1955 he enrolled in the University of Toronto to study philosophy, but actively pursued a career as an actor alongside future actor Donald Sutherland. In 1959, he graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. While at university he switched his attention from acting to directing and with his partner, Karl Jaffary, took over and ran the Straw Hat Players for four years.|$|E
500|$|McCartney later {{gave up the}} flat, and it {{remained}} empty until Starr sub-let it to Hendrix with Kathy Etchingham, and Chandler with Lotta Null, in December1966, for £30 ($63) a month (£265.12—$ today). Hendrix and Echingham lived on the lower-ground floor, and Hendrix composed [...] "The Wind Cries Mary" [...] there, after an argument with Echingham about her cooking skills. For three months, between 1966–67, Hendrix shared the apartment with Gordon Haskell, a bassist who played with the psychedelic band Les Fleur de Lys. Unfortunately, when Hendrix was under the effects of LSD, he threw whitewash over the walls, forcing Starr to evict him. Starr also lent the flat to other pop stars and friends {{over the next few}} years, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> a place to stay in London.

Upon arrival, she offloaded Air Group 2, which then embarked for Korea again aboard Valley Forge. After a repair and refit in California, Boxer was prepared for a second tour in Korea. She embarked Carrier Air Group 101. The group was composed of Navy Reserve squadrons from Dallas, Texas, Glenview, Illinois, Memphis, Tennessee and Olathe, Kansas, {{and most of its}} pilots were reservists who had been called to active duty. She rejoined Task Force 77, and began operations in Korea on 29 March 1951, and her squadrons were the first Naval Reserve pilots to launch strikes in Korea. Most of these missions were airstrikes against Chinese ground forces along the 38th parallel, and this duty lasted until 24 October 1951. During this time, the carrier operated around [...] "Point Oboe", an area [...] off the coast of Wonsan.

500|$|The {{flights from}} Hong Kong to Chongqing began in early May 1946. At this time Chongqing had been {{isolated}} by Communist forces, and foreign embassies were being evacuated {{from the city}} ahead of its expected occupation by the Communists. No navigation aids were available to guide the Australian aircraft, and their crews had to use inaccurate road maps for navigation during the [...] trips between Chongqing and Hong Kong. The RAAF aircrew found the flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing to be challenging {{as a result of}} mountains around the Chinese city, as well as the expected lack of accurate weather forecasts and navigation aids. As the Australian legation was evacuated from Chongqing in early May, the RAAF aircrew slept at the British embassy <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to overnight in the city. The detachment was successful in flying out the pig bristles within the two weeks available, with eight return flights being made to Chongqing. In his memoirs Balfe attributed this success to [...] "reasonable weather and everyone's enthusiasm". After completing their task, the three Dakotas left Hong Kong bound for Australia on 14 May.|$|E

The new flame design enclosed the steel tubing of the flame (which concealed the bugler statue), looked more realistic and better matched the flames on the four smaller candles at the Christmas Candle's base. The 1952 Christmas Candle display included further expansions from the previous year, including the addition of 20 new plywood light standard plaques by the Easton High School, as well as decorations on the Bushkill Street Bridge in addition to the Northampton Street bridge. With the hopes of increasing nationwide publicity for the Christmas Candle, the Easton City Council started dubbing the structure, [...] "the world's largest Christmas candle". The Easton Area Christmas Committee continued raising the funds for the Christmas program up until 1957, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> to raise $3,500 from the public to make necessary repairs to the Christmas Candle for safety reasons.
