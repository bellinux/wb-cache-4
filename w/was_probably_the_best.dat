For 1977, he started {{the season with a}} year-old March 761 run by Bob Sparshott and entered under the name of his sponsor, Chesterfield Racing, but switched to a McLaren M23 after three races. In 1978, he stayed with the McLaren M23 and also tried an M26, but now entered by Sparshott's racing outfit, BS Fabrications.

500|$|McCabe made 27 in the rain-affected {{draw in the}} Fourth Test, the {{culmination}} of a quiet fortnight in which he failed to pass 30. He then scored fifties in three consecutive tour matches before the Fifth Test, which was timeless as the series was tied 11. McCabe scored 10 and 70 and took 2/5 in the second innings as Australia won the match by 562 runs to regain the Ashes 21. McCabe aggregated 483 runs at 60.37 and took four wickets in the Tests. At the time, Wisden said of him: [...] "He blossomed forth as an almost completely equipped batsman of the forcing type and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> exponentBradman himself scarcely excludedof the art of hitting the ball tremendously hard and safely." [...] Wisden said that McCabe had made [...] "immense strides" [...] in his batting technique. It said [...] "In 1930 he gave the impression of still having a good deal to learn; he was inclined to be somewhat slapdash in his methods. The intervening years had clearly made a great difference in him. Losing nothing of his power, he displayed a wider and safer range of strokes." [...] McCabe finished the tour with 108 against Kent and 124 in an innings win over HDG Leveson-Gower's XI a took 21 wickets for the entire season.|$|E
500|$|Although Canning {{wrote that}} [...] "the writers did {{a fine job}} of {{incorporating}} the tenure, Will's terrible Spanish and the songs into the storylines", Will's lack of Spanish skills was questioned by other reviewers.

Slezak also said Will, as evidenced by his [...] "La Cucaracha" [...] rendition for his class, was [...] "suddenly dumb as the cardboard box that Finn winningly turned into a robot head", and Chaney commented, [...] "Mr. Schuester always seemed a bit more sensitive than this." [...] VanDerWerff wrote of [...] "the weird, dark despair {{at the heart of}} Will's plight: He's a high school Spanish teacher, and he mostly is that because he doesn't know what else to do." [...] He added, [...] "I think this <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> episode for the character since early season one." [...] Canning stated that [...] "the tension between Will and Emma was a welcome change", and Votta commented on the episode's less dramatic ending with Will's apology and [...] "celebrating Emma's new-found tenure with a dinner" [...] with the conclusion, [...] "sometimes you don't need a big bang to get oomph out of an episode". Chaney, however, was puzzled as to why Emma was given teaching tenure [...] "when she's been working at McKinley as a guidance counselor and handing out absolutely horrifying self-made pamphlets".|$|E

[...] The initial 1991 demo presented a relatively simple, two-player tactical game then known as Laser Squad 2 (or Laser Squad II), which ran on the Atari ST. The Gollop brothers (Julian and Nick) approached three video game publishers, Krisalis, Domark and MicroProse, eventually brokering a deal with MicroProse.

2500|$|The Queen held {{audience}} with Jean {{and her family}} on September 6, 2005, at Balmoral Castle.

The weekend was informal; for one dinner, coincidentally on the eve of Jean's birthday, the Queen drove Jean and her family to a cottage on the Balmoral estate, where they were joined by Prince Philip and Prince Edward, who, along with the Queen, performed the cooking and washing up. Of it, Jean said [...] "t <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> birthday of my life."

2500|$|Revere's most {{personally}} challenging {{moment of}} his Civil War career came after the Battle of Chancellorsville when 'blame' was being assigned for the Union Army's loss. After charging the Confederate line, division commander Maj. Gen. Hiram Berry was mortally wounded and the command devolved on Revere. [...] In the chaos of a battle with no clear front line, Revere's decision to regroup his men, commanding them to reform at a point set by compass led to controversy. [...] This three-mile march, described by Revere as a [...] "regrouping effort" [...] and not a retreat, led to his being court-martialed. [...] Abraham Lincoln overturned the court's ruling and reinstated Revere but accepted Revere's resignation at the same time. As a lifelong member of the Democratic Party, that <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> deal Revere could expect from a Republican administration.

They have been variously interpreted as multiple accessory breasts, as eggs, grapes, acorns, or even bull testes. Excavation {{at the site of the}} Artemision in 1987–88 identified a multitude of tear-shaped amber beads that had adorned the ancient wooden cult image or xoanon. In Acts of the Apostles, Ephesian metalsmiths who felt threatened by Saint Paul's preaching of Christianity, jealously rioted in her defense, shouting “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” Of the 121 columns of her temple, only one composite, made up of fragments, still stands as a marker of the temple's location. The rest were used for making churches, roads, and forts.|$|E

2500|$|Harty was {{appointed}} permanent {{conductor of the}} Hallé in 1920. [...] Under his baton, the Hallé recovered the eminence it had previously enjoyed under the conductorship of its founder, Charles Hallé, and his successor, Hans Richter. Kennedy writes that under Harty it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> orchestra in England. [...] Harty's skill as a piano accompanist developed into a similar talent for conducting concertos. Writing of his skill as in accompanying either as a pianist or as a conductor, John F. Russell wrote in 1941, [...] "Anybody who heard Harty {{in his capacity as}} accompanist could never forget his extraordinary grasp of every nuance and expressive device. There was no question of a solo with accompaniment: unless the soloist was a very great artist the chances were that he would be submerged by the artistry of the accompanist." [...] Wilhelm Backhaus and others wished they could take the Hallé with them on their international travels. [...] During a Brahms concerto, Artur Schnabel accidentally skipped two bars, but Harty's rapport with and control of the Hallé was such that he kept up seamlessly with the soloist. Schnabel said afterward that he had never experienced such magnificent accompaniment, but tactlessly added that the Hallé was [...] "almost as good as the Berlin Philharmonic"; Harty corrected him: the Hallé was [...] "better by two bars".|$|E
2500|$|Gonzales, who is {{considered}} to be among the greatest tennis players of all time, always maintained that Hoad was the toughest, most skilful adversary that he had ever faced. [...] "He was the only guy who, if I was playing my best tennis, could still beat me." [...] said Gonzales in a 1995 New York Times interview. [...] "I think his game was the best game ever. Better than mine. He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique." [...] In a 1970 interview he stated that [...] "Hoad <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> and toughest player when he wanted to be. After the first two years on the tour, his back injury plagued him so much that he lost the desire to practice. He was the only man to beat me in a head-to-head tour, 15 to 13." [...] Kramer, however, had mixed feelings about Hoad's ability. In spite of calling him one of the 21 best players of all time, he also writes that [...] "when you sum Hoad up, you have {{to say that he was}} overrated. He might have been the best, but day-to-day, week-to-week, he was the most inconsistent of all the top players." [...] In a 1963 article in World Tennis Rosewall judges Gonzales to be a notch above Hoad but stated that [...] "...the latter is the greatest of all time when he is 'on'.", an opinion echoed by Frew McMillan.|$|E
