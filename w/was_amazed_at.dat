5|$|When Cope {{arrived back}} in the United States after his tour of Europe in 1878, he had nearly two years of fossil {{findings}} from Lucas. Among these dinosaurs was Camarasaurus, {{one of the most}} recognizable dinosaur recreations of the time. The summer of 1879 took Cope to Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and north to Oregon, where he <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the rich flora and the blueness of the Pacific Ocean. In 1879, the United States Congress consolidated the various government survey teams into the United States Geological Survey with Clarence King as its leader. This was discouraging to Cope because King named Marsh, an old college friend, as the chief paleontologist. The period of Cope's and Marsh's paleontological digs in the American West spanned from 1877 to 1892, by which time both men exhausted much of their financial resources.|$|E

Humayun <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> their work and asked if they would work for him if he were to regain the sovereignty of Hindustan: they agreed. With so much going on Humayun did not even meet the Shah until July, some six months after his arrival in Persia. After a lengthy journey from Herat the two met in Qazvin where a large feast and parties were held for the event. The meeting of the two monarchs is depicted in a famous wall-painting in the Chehel Sotoun (Forty Columns) palace in Esfahan.|$|E

I thought the idea of delving deep into the fashion world was very interesting and intriguing."

500|$|Lynch {{wrote in}} 1977 that The Homosexual Matrix [...] "had been widely criticized for many reasons", {{including}} for largely ignoring {{the gay rights}} movement and for expressing a negative view of women. According to Lynch, Tripp stated {{in an interview with}} Keith Howes in Gay News that he had not written about the gay liberation movement because he did not know enough about it to be able to discuss the subject, that he <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the accusation of sexism directed against his book, and that he believed the [...] "gay press" [...] had reacted with embarrassment to it, while Howes suggested that Tripp was hurt by the negative reaction to his book from some gay people.|$|E
500|$|Charlotte's {{pregnancy}} {{was the subject}} of the most intense public interest. [...] Betting shops quickly set up book on what sex the child would be. [...] Economists calculated that the birth of a princess would raise the stock market by 2.5%; the birth of a prince would raise it 6%. Charlotte spent her time quietly, spending much time sitting for a portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence. [...] She ate heavily and got little exercise; when her medical team began prenatal care in August 1817, they put her on a strict diet, hoping {{to reduce the size of}} the child at birth. [...] The diet, and occasional bleeding, seemed to weaken Charlotte. [...] Stockmar <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> a treatment he saw as outdated, and declined to join the medical team, believing that, as a foreigner, he would be blamed if anything went wrong.|$|E
500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> how Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think I could do it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E

Here Humayun went sightseeing and <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> the Persian artwork, military might and architecture he saw: much of this {{was the work of}} the Timurid Sultan Husayn Bayqarah and his ancestor, princess Gauhar Shad, thus he was able to admire the work of his relatives and ancestors at first hand.

2500|$|Although at {{the time}} of Zero-on Niikuni was not yet aware of the {{international}} avant-garde poetry movement, he arrived at the same methodology as the concrete poetry movement in countries that used the alphabet. When Pierre Garnier saw Zero-on, he <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> how similar works they strove for and produced although the languages they spoke differed so much. This was the beginning of their friendship. Later, Garnier and Niikuni collaborated on Nichifutsu Shishū (...) , producing works such as the Micropoem. Niikuni was noted abroad {{as an example of a}} writer that relied on ideographs (kanji), and requests to display his works kept coming in. Niikuni progressed to methods like graphic design and emphasizing communication after Zero-on, but he would not budge from expressing through kanji characters.|$|E
