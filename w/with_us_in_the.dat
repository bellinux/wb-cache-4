500|$|At one stage, Bradman went 13 {{first-class}} innings {{without a}} century, the longest such spell of his career, prompting suggestions that Bodyline had eroded his confidence and altered his technique. After three Tests, {{the series was}} one–one and Bradman had scored 133runs in five innings. The Australians travelled to Sheffield and played a warm up game before the Fourth Test. Bradman started slowly and then, [...] "...the old Bradman [...] back <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twinkling of an eye, almost". He went on to make 140, with the last 90runs coming in just 45minutes. On {{the opening day of}} the Fourth Test at Headingley (Leeds), England were out for 200, but Australia slumped to 3/39, losing the third wicket from the last ball of the day. Listed to bat at number five, Bradman would start his innings the next day.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Bristol City manager Gary Johnson stated his {{intention}} to send Myrie-Williams out on loan {{in order to gain}} more first-team experience. Johnson believed that Myrie-Williams would only benefit from a loan move to a League One club, given that he was playing in the third tier of English football prior to Bristol City's promotion to the Championship during the 2006–07 campaign. Two days {{before the start of the}} 2007–08 season, Myrie-Williams joined Cheltenham Town on a month's loan. He made his debut for Cheltenham in the club's 1–0 home win against Gillingham on the first day of the season, coming on as a substitute in the 68th minute. Myrie-Williams made a further substitute appearance in a 1–0 defeat at Millwall a week later, before starting his first game in a 1–1 draw with Swindon Town on 25 August 2007. After making four first-team appearances for Cheltenham, Myrie-Williams' loan was extended for a further month, running until 6 October 2007. Cheltenham Town manager John Ward said [...] "I am really pleased that Jennison will be staying <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> last two or three games he has started to show his tremendous pace and ability on the ball". His loan was extended yet again in October 2007, taking him into a third month with Cheltenham. He scored his first goal for Cheltenham in a 3–1 away win at Swindon Town in the Football League Trophy, scoring the first goal of the game, [...] "finishing neatly after a superb through ball from Craig Reid". He made his final appearance for Cheltenham in a 2–2 home draw with Crewe Alexandra, coming on as a substitute as Cheltenham scored two late goals to salvage a point. After the game, Myrie-Williams suffered a knee injury in training, ruling him out of first-team action for two weeks. He made 13 appearances for Cheltenham during his three-month loan spell, scoring one goal— he returned to his parent club in early November 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Having been Spain's closest colony to the United States until 1898, in {{the first}} part of the 20th century Cuba {{continued}} to benefit from big investments, creation of industries, and travel. Its proximity and close relation to the United States also helped Cuba's market economy prosper fairly quickly. As relations between Cuba and the United States deteriorated rapidly after the Cuban Revolution and the resulting expropriation and nationalization of businesses, the island became cut off from its traditional market by an embargo and a travel ban was imposed on U.S. citizens visiting Cuba. The tourist industry declined to record low levels within two years of Castro's accession to power. Unlike the US, Canada normalized relations with Cuba in the 1970s and Canadians increasingly visited Cuba for vacations. [...] Approximately one third of visitors to Cuba each year (in 2014) are Canadians. [...] The Cuban government has moderated its nationalization policies and allowed for private business since 2011. [...] It also pursues revitalization programs aimed at boosting tourism. [...] United States reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2015 and the tourism industry is expected to greatly benefit from normalized relations <b>with</b> <b>US</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near future.|$|E
