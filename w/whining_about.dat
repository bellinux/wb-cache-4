500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{praised the}} episode, comparing it positively to previous episodes [...] "Casino Night" [...] and [...] "Booze Cruise": [...] "not as heavy or emotional, certainly, {{but still a}} chance to see our Dunderheads in a charming and demonstrative not-quite-work environment." [...] Lyons also complimented a number of changes in the series the episode seemed to indicate, including shifting allegiances, goodwill where there used to be bad and a possible budding romance between Andy and Kelly. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode, [...] "started off seeming like a dumb and pointless idea before gradually revealing itself to be a fun, and even welcome, diversion." [...] Sepinwall said the episode was not as funny as other recent ones, but that he enjoyed seeing the characters interact this way together, and particularly liked seeing Dwight and Phyllis bond, [...] "even as he treated her like a racehorse". Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune in Scranton, Pennsylvania, described the episode as [...] "a wacky and wonderful little gem, one of those rare ones where it was just wall-to-wall happy, giddy fun, with not a drop of pathos, except for maybe Michael <b>whining</b> <b>about</b> having to eat lunch by himself." [...] McAuliffe also said he was glad to see Erin's [...] "cheerful, appealingly goofy personality" [...] continue to emerge.|$|E
2500|$|... "Monster" [...] {{received}} general acclaim upon release. Rolling Stone gave Monster {{four and}} a half stars. Critic Robert Palmer noted that Stipe's lyrics dealt with issues of identity ("The concept of reality itself is being called into question: Is this my life or an incredible virtual simulation?") and that occasionally the singer [...] "begins to sound not unlike the proverbial rock star, <b>whining</b> <b>about</b> all those fans who just won't let him alone." [...] He added, [...] "What's truly impressive about Monster is the way R.E.M. make an album with such potentially grave subject matter so much fun." [...] NME gave the album a seven out of ten rating. Reviewer Keith Cameron wrote, [...] "It’s fun, frequently, but we feel distanced, engaged only on a secondhand level. Moreover, the loudly trumpeted fox factor has been conspicuous by its absence." [...] Cameron concluded, [...] "At best stunning, at worst merely diverting, Monster sounds like the album they 'had' to make, to clear out their system, a simple prop to occupy our time..." [...] Allmusic rated the album {{two and a half stars}} out of five; Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, [...] "Monster doesn't have the conceptual unity or consistently brilliant songwriting of Automatic for the People, but it does offer a wide range of sonic textures that have never been heard on an R.E.M. album before." ...|$|E
2500|$|White Zombie {{announced}} in 1998 that the band had officially broken up, {{and it was}} confirmed that Rob had begun working on a solo debut album. Though acting as a solo artist, Zombie worked to find a band to record and tour with; Mike Riggs was selected to play guitar, Blasko played bass guitar, and John Tempesta played the drums. Tempesta {{had been a member of}} White Zombie, while Rob was introduced to Riggs through a mutual friend. On finding the guitar player, Zombie claimed [...] "Danny [...] was just like, ‘I know the perfect guy.’ He gave me Riggs’ phone number and I called him out of nowhere. I trusted Danny, so that was it. Riggs came out and he was great. We didn’t have a bass player yet. Riggs and I hung out and talked and I told him everything I wanted to do." [...] Work on the album began in August of 1997, prior to the announcement of White Zombie's separation. The album took an estimated ten months to complete. The majority of the album was recorded at The Chop Shop in Hollywood, California. Zombie described the finished product as a [...] "full-blown evil raging beast - a total Zombie extravaganza" [...] and claimed that album was [...] "no small, self-indulgent album filled with <b>whining</b> <b>about</b> deep feelings." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, quit fussing!" [...] Babbitt fussed. [...] "You {{never hear}} me <b>whining</b> <b>about</b> my Troubles, and yet {{if you had}} to run a {{real-estate}} office--Why, to-day I found Miss Bannigan was two days behind with her accounts, and I pinched my finger in my desk, and Lyte was in and just as unreasonable as ever." ...|$|E

Well, I can't help that, can I?... Very unpleasant, no doubt, but I rather fancy it will affect more important people than you. There is no use <b>whining</b> <b>about</b> it.... No, I couldn't possibly. You must take your chance.... That's enough, sir. Nonsense! I have something more important to do than to listen to such twaddle." ...|$|E

As the coat was the personal theatricals-equipment of Mr. Harris Hartwig, who was shaped like the dome of the county court-house, Lulu looked suspicious, but Harry was discovered making bread pills, and she was so engaged in telling him what she thought--Lord, what a thinker the little woman was!--that she forgot to follow the subject.|$|E

60|$|Clay, it seems, who is {{the worst}} {{specimen}} of self-pitier, had gone to Wilton, in whom, as a new-comer, he naturally saw a fine fresh repository for his tales of woe, and had opened with a long yarn of some misfortune or other. I forget which it was; {{it might have been}} any one of a dozen or so which he had constantly in stock, and it is immaterial which it was. The point is that, having heard him out very politely and patiently, Wilton came back at him with a story which silenced even Clay. Spencer was equal to most things, but even he could not go on <b>whining</b> <b>about</b> how he had foozled his putting and been snubbed at the bridge-table, or whatever it was that he was pitying himself about just then, when a man was telling him the story of a wrecked life.|$|E
6000|$|That is the truth. Now, you all {{remember}} {{that was a}} resolution censuring the President for {{the manner in which}} the war was begun. You know they have charged that I voted against the supplies, by which I starved the soldiers who were out fighting the battles of their country. I say that FICKLIN knows it is false. When that charge was brought forward by the Chicago Times, the Springfield Register [Douglas's organ] reminded the Times that the charge really applied to John Henry; and I do know that John Henry is now making speeches and fiercely battling for Judge Douglas. If the Judge now says that he offers this as a sort of setoff to what I said to-day in reference to Trumbull's charge, then I remind him that he made this charge before I said a word about Trumbull's. He brought this forward at Ottawa, the first time we met face to face; and in the opening speech that Judge Douglas made he attacked me in regard to a matter ten years old. Is n't he a pretty man to be <b>whining</b> <b>about</b> people making charges against him only two years old! ...|$|E
6000|$|Besides September, {{of which}} there is now little to be made except effervescence, we discern two sore-places where the Mountain often suffers: Marat and Orleans Egalite. Squalid Marat, for his own sake and for the Mountain's, is {{assaulted}} ever and anon; held up to France, as a squalid bloodthirsty Portent, inciting to the pillage of shops; of whom let the Mountain have the credit! The Mountain murmurs, ill at ease: this 'Maximum of Patriotism,' how shall they either own him or disown him? As for Marat personally, he, with his fixed-idea, remains invulnerable to such things: nay the People's-friend is very evidently rising in importance, as his befriended People rises. No shrieks now, {{when he goes to}} speak; occasional applauses rather, furtherance which breeds confidence. The day when the Girondins proposed to 'decree him accused' (decreter d'accusation, as they phrase it) for that February Paragraph, of 'hanging up a Forestaller or two at the door-lintels,' Marat proposes to have them 'decreed insane;' and, descending the Tribune-steps, is heard to articulate these most unsenatorial ejaculations: [...] "Les Cochons, les imbecilles, Pigs, idiots!" [...] Oftentimes he croaks harsh sarcasm, having really a rough rasping tongue, and a very deep fund of contempt for fine outsides; and once or twice, he even laughs, nay 'explodes into laughter, rit aux eclats,' at the gentilities and superfine airs of these Girondin [...] "men of statesmanship," [...] with their pedantries, plausibilities, pusillanimities: [...] "these two years," [...] says he, [...] "you have been <b>whining</b> <b>about</b> attacks, and plots, and danger from Paris; and you have not a scratch to shew for yourselves." [...] (Moniteur, Seance du 20 Mai 1793.)--Danton gruffly rebukes him, from time to time: a Maximum of Patriotism, whom one can neither own nor disown! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If," [...] said she, emphatically, [...] "if I liked Dr. John till I was fit {{to die for}} liking him, {{that alone}} could not license me to be {{otherwise}} than dumb--dumb as the grave--dumb as you, Lucy Snowe--you know it--and you know you would despise me if I failed in self-control, and <b>whined</b> <b>about</b> some rickety liking that was all on my side." ...|$|R
5000|$|Max Brantley {{said after}} Clinton lost the {{election}} in 1980: [...] "The guy was like {{a death in the}} family. He was really destroyed after that election". Rudy Moore also added: [...] "He never blamed anybody else. He accepted the responsibility. He didn't <b>whine</b> <b>about</b> it. In fact, it was within days, we were {{trying to figure out what}} we could to do to improve his political life after that" ...|$|R
5000|$|Individuals {{are often}} {{singled out for}} abuse by Czar or Empress. Verbal abuse is {{frequently}} heaped upon writers of remarkably obscene or distasteful entries, and individuals who <b>whine</b> <b>about</b> the judging (see Russell Beland) or overtly lobby for their own entries. The Empress is constantly on the look out for flagrant plagiarism (defined as [...] "being in touch with one's inner Google"), the penalty for which is severe admonition and retribution.|$|R
6000|$|That {{is a hard}} {{lesson to}} learn and practise, though not a very {{difficult}} one to understand. I will try now to make you understand it--God alone can teach you to practise it. I pray and hope, and I believe too, that He will--that these very hard times are meant to teach people REALLY to believe in God and Jesus Christ, and that they WILL teach people. God knows we need, and thanks be to Him that He DOES know that we need, to be taught to believe in Him. Nothing shows it to me more plainly than the way we talk about God's visitations, as if God was usually away from us, and came to us only just now and then--only on extraordinary occasions. People have gross, heathen, fleshly, materialist notions of God's visitations, as if He was some great earthly king who now and then made a journey about his dominions from place to place, rewarding some and punishing others. God is not in any place, my friends. God is a Spirit. The heaven and the heaven of heavens could not contain Him if He wanted a place to be in, as, glory be to His name, He does not. If He is near us or far from us, {{it is not that}} He is near or far from our bodies, as the Queen might be nearer to us in London than in Scotland, which is most people's notion of God's nearness. He is near, not our bodies, but our spirits, our souls, our hearts, our thoughts--as it is written, [...] "The kingdom of God is WITHIN you." [...] Do not fancy that when the cholera was in India, God was nearer India than He was to England, and that as the cholera crawled nearer and nearer, God came nearer and nearer too; and that now the cholera is gone away somewhere or other, God is gone away somewhere or other too, to leave us to our own inventions. God forbid a thousand times! As St. Paul says: [...] "He is not far from any one of us." [...] "In Him we live and move and have our being," [...] cholera or none. Do you think Christ, the King of the earth, is gone away either--that while things go on rightly, and governments, and clergy, and people do right, Christ is there then, filling them all with His Spirit and guiding them all to their duty; but that when evil times come, and rulers are idle, and clergy dumb dogs, and the rich tyrannous, and the poor profligate, and men are crying for work and cannot get it, and every man's hand is against his fellow, and no one knows what to do or think; and on earth is distress of nations with perplexity, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for dread of those things which are coming on the earth--do you think that in such times as those, Christ is the least farther off from us than He was at the best of times?--The least farther off from us now than He was from the apostles at the first Whitsuntide? God forbid!--God forbid a thousand times! He has promised Himself, He that is faithful and true, He that will never deny Himself, though men deny Him, and say He is not here, because their eyes are blinded with love of the world, and covetousness and bigotry, and dread lest He, their Master, should come and find them beating the men-servants and maid-servants, and eating and drinking with the drunken in the high places of the earth, and saying: [...] "Tush! God hath forgotten it"--ay, though men have forgotten Him thus, and-- worse than thus, yet He hath said it--"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." [...] Why, evil times are the very times of which Christ used to speak as the [...] "days of the Lord," [...] and the [...] "days of the Son of man." [...] Times when we hear of wars and rumours of wars, and on earth distress of nations with perplexity--what does He tell men to do in them? To go <b>whining</b> <b>about,</b> and say that Christ has left His Church? No! [...] "Then," [...] He says, [...] "when all these things come to pass, then rejoice and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh." ...|$|E
