40|$|A simple {{analytical}} method {{has been introduced}} for aerohydrodynamic load analysis of an airborne configuration during <b>water</b> <b>ditching.</b> The method employs an aerodynamic panel code, based on linear potential flow theory, to simulate the flow of air and water around an aircraft configuration. The free surface separating the air and water region is represented by doublet sheet singularities. Although all the theoretical load distributions are computed for air, provisions are made to correct the pressure coefficients obtained on the configuration wetted surfaces {{to account for the}} water density. As an analytical tool, the Vortex Separation Aerodynamic (VSAERO) code is chosen to carry out the present investigation. After assessing the validity of the method, its first application is to analyze the <b>water</b> <b>ditching</b> of the Space Shuttle configuration at a 12 degree attitude...|$|R

The communists managed to found seven ships and begun the crossing immediately, and the 7th Regiment and the 9th Regiment of the communist 3rd Brigade successfully crossed the river at Yakou (垭口) crossing point.

50|$|The castle {{originally}} {{acted as}} a motte castle to monitor and guard the historic roads and {{to serve as a}} base for military escorts. It also probably fulfilled the function of a border fortress in this Franconian-Bavarian border region. For that it was extended with the construction of several defensive ramparts, in order to create room for troops to be quartered. Traces of these outer ramparts are still visible. The provision of these troops could have come from the hamlet of Neuhaus, to which a <b>water</b> <b>ditch</b> was laid from the area of the Kreuzstein which has survived into the present day.|$|E
5000|$|The Château des Réaux castle {{had been}} in possession, in the fourteenth century, of Amaury Péau, Jeanne de Montejean, Countess of Sancerre, Antoine de Breuil and Gilles de Brye in 1455. Ruined in the fifteenth century, it was {{acquired}} by the Grand Father Jean Briçonnet, first mayor of Tours. The influence of the old fortified castle appears on the general plan of the building: it is situated on an island totally surrounded by a large <b>water</b> <b>ditch</b> which served for security reinforcement.The present castle {{was built on the}} site of the old fortified castle by the grandson Jean Briçonnet, son of Guillaume Briçonnet, lord of the sites then called Plessis-Rideau. He was also inhabited by Thibaut de Longuejoue and their descendants, the family Taveau. In 1595 a marriage has brought the castle into possession of the Béraudière family. François de La Béraudière has inherited it and then sold for an amount of one hundred and fifteen thousand pounds in 1650 to the writer and poet Tallemant des Réaux for whom the castle became home and his family name was attributed to the castle since the 30 of July 1653 by a royal charter of the king ...|$|E

50|$|House Unterbach was {{probably}} {{established in the}} times of the Carolingian dynasty. Probably from fear for the Hungarians, who burned down Gerresheim and its neighboring places nearly completely, the area was {{for the first time}} removed around 900 AD to the castle. As a knight's seat it is recorded in 1169 for the first time. Probably around 1300 it came then to the today's substantial development of the attachment with encircling walls up to 1.20 meters thick, four towers with walls up to two meters thick, surrounded by a broad <b>water</b> <b>ditch.</b> Parts of the circulating wall and three of the towers are still perceptible today, i.e. a gate tower, a court tower and a round tower. A further round tower, which was formerly on the left, was torn off {{at the height of the}} manor-house and integrated into this. Parts of the course bridge mechanism are likewise still to be seen in the gate tower. Beside it are still further authentic knight material stores in the towers. The towers are 10 meters high up to 9 meters in diameter. Probably one of them was in former times once higher. The garden plantings of the castle and the surrounding area were created by the well-known landscape architect Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe, to whose numerous works also belongs the Hofgarten and the world-famous Königsallee.|$|E
50|$|The castle of Trumau is a moated {{castle in}} Trumau in Lower Austria. From the {{beginning}} {{it has been in}} the ownership of the Zisterzienserstift Heiligenkreuz. The castle was a present from the Babenberg’s Margrave Leopold IV. in 1138. In the 12th century, a grange was built by the Zisterzienser at the place where the castle is standing nowadays. At that time there has also probably been a <b>water</b> <b>ditch,</b> an overflow spillway and a mill with a mill stream. The Zisterziensers practiced agriculture, viniculture and sheep-breeding there. Towards the end of the 1st Austrian Türkenkrieg the courtyard was rebuilt from 1548 to 1558 because the estate had been totally destroyed in 1548. The building was burnt down by Hungarian rebels in 1621 during an anti-Habsburg riot. In 1650, abbot Michael Schnabel arranged the rebuilding to a castle, which was finished in 1667. Emperor Leopold I. lingered several times at Castle Trumau. Since 1959, the castle also has a sundial. During the 5th Austrian Türkenkrieg the castle was heavily damaged in 1683. In course of the rebuilding, the towers were gravely changed. Further fires like in 1811 and 1880 damaged the castle again and again. The last restorations took place from 1993 until 1995. Two sundials were discovered in the inner yard. In 2009, the International Theological Institute moved into the castle Trumau.|$|E
