After attending a party at Manson's house, Syme was given a lift home; Manson claims she was taken home by a designated driver. After she got home she got {{behind the wheel of}} her own vehicle and was killed when she crashed it into three parked cars. Manson is reported to have said there were no alcohol or other drugs at the party. St. John's lawyer asked [...] " [...] there were no drinks, no drugs, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> need a designated driver?" ...|$|E

"Thank you, Conrade, but I can't; I {{promised to}} be at home at four," [...] said Rachel, who had all this time been {{watching}} with curious interest which influence would prevail--whether Alick would play for Fanny's sake, or Fanny abstain for Alick's sake. She was best satisfied as it was, but she had still to parry Bessie Keith's persuasive determination. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> go home? it certainly was to inspect the sketches of the landscape-painter. [...] "You heard, Alick, of the interesting individual who acted the part of Rachel's preserver," [...] she added.|$|E

60|$|Down went Scully to dinner. There were dukes on {{his right}} hand and earls on his left; there were but two persons without title in the midst of that {{glittering}} assemblage; the very servants looked like noblemen. The cook had done wonders; the wines were cool and rich, and Lady Gorgon was splendid! What attention did everybody pay to her and to him! <b>Why</b> <b>WOULD</b> <b>she</b> go on gazing into his face with that tender imploring look? In other words, Scully, after partaking of soup and fish (he, during their discussion, had been thinking over all the former love-and-hate passages between himself and Lady Gorgon), turned very red, and began talking to her.|$|E

She interrupts him and tells him where his plane ticket is, because she is waiting for him with his son.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{original}} production, {{and in the}} film version, the famed dance number [...] "Steam Heat" [...] was danced by Gladys. In the 2006 revival, the number was made with Mae (Joyce Chittick), instead of Gladys. Kathleen Marshall explains: [...] "Hines accuses Gladys of being a flirt, and she's not. So {{does it make sense}} that she'd go and strut her stuff {{in front of the whole}} union? Hines would say, 'Aha, you floozy, I caught you!' Also, she's the boss's secretary, so <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> be at a union meeting? I think it's much more fun that Gladys doesn't really let go until she goes out with Sid, gets real drunk, and throws caution to the wind." ...|$|E

5000|$|Gregory of Nyssa {{interpreted}} Mary's {{response to}} the angel, when told that she will conceive ("How will this be, since I am a virgin?) as indicating that Mary had taken a lifelong vow of virginity, even in marriage: [...] "For if Joseph had taken her to be his wife, {{for the purpose of}} having children, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have wondered at the announcement of maternity, since she herself would have accepted becoming a mother according to the law of nature?". Howard Marshall rejects this view: [...] "It is impossible to see how the text can yield this meaning". Taylor shares Marshall's view and points to Lightfoot's acknowledgement that the expressions used here and in Luke 2:7 [...] "would have been avoided by writers who believed in the perpetual virginity of Mary".|$|E
50|$|Holly {{shows up}} to Tyler's house on Sunday {{telling him that}} Ali knows what {{happened}} between them.

Tyler starts suspecting that Holly is dangerous, especially when meeting her stepmom, Corinne, who reveals that she takes medication and Holly lied to him about where she's from. Holly gives Lydia the wrong smoothie on purpose, causing an allergic reaction that puts her in the hospital after she heard Lydia telling Ali that she doesn't buy her story {{and is going to}} find out what's going on. Tyler has a nightmare about Holly killing him and she doesn't show up to school for the next few days. Gil is hurt because Holly hadn't been in contact with him for awhile, and doesn't know what he did wrong.|$|E

5000|$|Speaking of the storyline where Glenda and Roxy {{attempt to}} steal back Roxy's money from Phil, Barber {{explained}} that Glenda is [...] "a woman scorned, {{and wants to}} fleece Phil for everything he's got." [...] Phil frames Glenda for stealing the money, on which Barber told Inside Soap that Glenda is devastated that her daughter believes Phil: [...] "Glenda doesn't think that Roxy will take Phil's word over hers, so she's devastated when she does. It makes no sense—Glenda is broke, so <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> leave a pile of money in her bedroom cupboard? She instantly knows that Phil planted the cash there. Glenda's so hurt that Roxy believes him instead of her." [...] This leads to Glenda revealing her affair with Phil. Barber told Buzz that Shirley regrets {{this for a moment}} but needs to show Roxy why Phil would frame her. She added that Glenda felt at one point that she and Phil would be a couple, but that she was [...] "deluded" [...] to think that, and that Glenda would leave Walford for her daughters, choosing them over money, though the offer of cash to leave would [...] "soften the blow". When Shirley discovers the affair, she attacks Glenda, on which a spokesperson told the Daily Star, [...] "Glenda has had it coming for months. She finally gets what's coming to her." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Art of Love" [...] is a ballad co-written by Sebastian and Adam Reily. In an {{interview}} with Undercover Sebastian {{said it was a}} song that wasn't actually written for the album. [...] "I was writing it as a pitch. I was just going to pitch it to another artist who was more maybe R&B. But after writing it I thought 'I don't care if stylistally it doesn't really fit'". The song was originally written as a duet, and Sebastian said they had Jordin Sparks in mind when writing it. [...] "I wrote it with a friend Adam Reily.... I remember us sitting down writing it and thinking 'Jordin, she would be great for this. She would be awesome'. But in the back of our minds, both our minds we're like 'but it's Jordin Sparks. She's a big American, well global star...and some random Aussie. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do it'?" [...] He said they never expected her to agree to do the song, so they didn't contact her originally. In {{an interview}} with the Daily Telegraph in October 2009 Sebastian said, [...] "We didn't even go there, didn't even ask her." [...] He approached Australian artists, but none were interested, and because of this [...] "Art of Love" [...] was originally recorded as a solo for the album. Sebastian then decided to submit the song to Sparks. He said, [...] "I thought deep down that it was supposed to have Jordin on there so I sent it to her. Literally overnight, she came back and said she loved the song and would love to do it as soon as she came off tour with Britney." [...] The album release was delayed so Sebastian could fly to New York to record Sparks' vocals. He returned to the US in November 2009 to film the video with her. Sebastian included an acoustic solo version of [...] "Art of Love" [...] on his album Twenty Ten released in November 2010.|$|E

5000|$|The {{relationship}} between the two began to develop when Danielle fell pregnant, and was supported in seeking an abortion by Ronnie. Treadwell-Collins has explained that Danielle's pregnancy was a plot-device to bring the two closer together, discussing the tragedy of Ronnie being unaware she was encouraging the aborting of her own grandchild. Of Danielle's emotions during this period, Crace illuminated: [...] "Having Ronnie show her some affection and willingly offering to come with her and to help her and give her advice, it was a huge thing for Danielle, because from always being knocked back by Ronnie, from always being knocked back by everybody, suddenly someone out of the blue offered to help her, and it was the one person in the world that she wants to be there." [...] When Ronnie failed to attend Danielle's second clinic appointment, Danielle was, in Crace's opinion, [...] "hurt and distraught", describing the development as [...] "a step back for Danielle" [...] whereby [...] "she probably feels less willing than ever to tell Ronnie the truth than before". On Ronnie's part, Janus assessed that [...] "Ronnie knows she wants to help this young girl but she's not sure why they have this bond". She explained: [...] "Ronnie knows that Danielle is very vulnerable and is in Walford with no family and only a few friends. As Ronnie gave her a job in R&R maybe she thinks that Danielle interpreted that that as more than it was." [...] Asked if Ronnie had noticed the resemblance between herself and Danielle, Janus responded: [...] "She has never thought about any resemblance - <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>she?</b> As far as Ronnie is aware her baby passed away so the thought would never have crossed her mind." [...] Following Ronnie's failure to attend her second appointment, the character briefly departed from the series, said to have returned to her native Telford.|$|E

40|$|Willa Cather and William Faulkner {{represent}} an intriguing and potentially productive pairing for comparative study. Their works and careers are {{located at the}} rich intersection between regional ism and modernism, and both early 20 th-century writers often looked back to the 19 th century in their fiction. Even {{in the absence of}} influence or intertextual reference, these commonalities would give a literary historian much to say. However, in her study of these two authors, Merrill Maguire Skaggs exhaustively catalogs similarities and differences as proof of a decades-long competition between the authors at the expense of depth and subtlety in her analysis of individual texts. Even more troubling, her claims for influence and what she calls (adapting the title of a Faulkner novel) 2 ̆ 2 reiving 2 ̆ 2 (literary theft) often depend on unstoppable claims about knowledge and access. Although their novelistic careers overlapped for two decades, Cather was a generation older than Faulkner. Cather was middle aged when she published her first novel, Alexanders Bridge, in 1912, while a relatively young Faulkner published his first novel, Soldier s Pay, in 1926. Furthermore, as Skaggs concedes, Cather acknowledged Faulkner 2 ̆ 7 s existence only once (in an odd, backhanded reference in an essay in Not Under Forty in 1936), while Faulkner named Cather publicly several times {{as one of the greatest}} novelists of the 20 th century. These facts seem to establish a higher probability of Cather 2 ̆ 7 s influence on Faulkner rather than vice versa, especially before the 1930 s, but Skaggs nevertheless begins her study in the 1920 s with a claim that a minor character in Cather 2 ̆ 7 s One of Ours (1922) is William Faulkner. Indeed, this character, Victor Morse, is something like the young Faulkner [...] an American who trained as pilot with the Royal Air Force in World War I and who takes on British airs and manners but Skaggs 2 ̆ 7 s claim that Cather must have met Faulkner in the fall of 1921 rests on chronological coincidence alone [...] both Cather and Faulkner were physically present in Greenwich Village in New York City for an overlapping period of a few weeks. Even if Cather met Faulkner, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>she</b> incorporate this young nobody from Mississippi (not yet an author) into her novel? And even more to the point, what does literary history gain from reading Victor Morse as a portrait of William Faulkner...|$|E
