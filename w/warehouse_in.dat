40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a continuous-time {{model for a}} multi-echelon {{inventory}} system. Items stored in the inventory are deteriorating and deteriorated items are screened out continuously from the inventory. Lateral transshipments are allowed among the <b>warehouses</b> <b>in</b> the same echelon. The transshipment rate depends on the inventory level of the corresponding <b>warehouses.</b> <b>In</b> this study, we give some sufficient conditions for the equilibrium points of the system to be stable. By aggregating the <b>warehouses</b> <b>in</b> an echelon, a procedure is developed for finding the equilibrium value of inventory level at each warehouse.
