500|$|Tillman {{had been}} re-elected in 1901 and 1907. By 1912, the Democratic nominee, {{who would be}} elected by the {{overwhelming}} Democratic majority in the legislature, was determined by a primary. A primary was also used for governor, and Tillman ran {{at the same time}} as Governor Cole Blease, who also sought re-election. Blease, also an outspoken white supremacist, had entered politics as a Tillmanite legislator in 1890, and breaking from him, adopted similar techniques to Tillman's to appeal to poor farm workers and mill hands. Tillman faced two opponents in his re-nomination bidâ€”his control over South Carolina politics had deteriorated over the years, and he had moved towards the Conservatives. He had not endorsed Blease in 1910. The two men reached an agreement that Tillman would remain neutral in the governor's race in 1912, but Tillman became convinced Blease could not win against former state chief justice Ira B. Jones. Both sides claimed to have letters from Tillman endorsing their candidate, but three days before the primary, Tillman condemned Blease and endorsed Jones. Blease, outraged, alleged betrayal, accused Tillman of [...] "insane jealousy", and said of the senator, [...] "possibly his mind has become more diseased of late than it was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> last talk with his confidential physician". Both men were re-elected.|$|E

Please excuse the veil." ...|$|E

"You {{never can}} {{know just how}} much of a thing {{children}} have taken in, or how much they have understood," [...] she continued, repeating herself, as she did throughout, [...] "and I had to keep this in mind <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> talks with Fay about her father. She wanted to write to him at first, and of course I let her--" ...|$|E

60|$|There {{were two}} simpering plaster figures--a Shepherd and Shepherdess--nearly half my height on the chimney-piece, whom I {{particularly}} detested; also an enlarged photograph in a discoloured frame on the wall--that of a thick-necked, formidable man, with a bush of whisker on either cheek, and a high, quarrelsome stare. He {{made me feel}} intensely self-conscious. It was like a wolf looking all day into a sheep-fold. So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> meals, I invariably turned my back on his portrait.|$|E
60|$|I {{was now in}} a quite {{different}} climate from my beloved island, where I never felt cold, except <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> ague; on the contrary, I {{had much to do}} to bear my clothes on my back, and never made any fire but without doors, for my necessity, in dressing my food, &c. Now I made me three good vests, with large robes or gowns over them, to hang down to the feet, and button close to the wrists, and all these lined with furs, to make them sufficiently warm.|$|E

Every one of these chaps was a man of fashion and honour; and the Marky and the Countess of the first families in France.

60|$|I was not {{surprised}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> talk out with Mrs. Wickson and Mrs. Pertonwaithe. They were society women.* Their homes were palaces. They had many homes scattered over the country, in the mountains, on lakes, and by the sea. They were tended by armies of servants, and their social activities were bewildering. They patronized {{the university and the}} churches, and the pastors especially bowed at their knees in meek subservience.** They were powers, these two women, what of the money that was theirs. The power of subsidization of thought was theirs to a remarkable degree, as I was soon to learn under Ernest's tuition.|$|E

You are, not to compliment you, a marked figure, Master Peveril--though something of the tallest, as was your father's case; I think, I could scarce have seen you anywhere without remembering you." ...|$|E

I wish to see him--and I do see him!--as my fancy drew his picture {{in the first days}} of our love. My blindness is my blessing. It has given me back my old delightful sensation when I touch him; it keeps my own beloved image of him--the one image I care for--unchanged and unchangeable. You will persist in thinking that my happiness depends on my sight. I look back with horror at what I suffered <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> sight--my one effort is to forget that miserable time. Oh, how little you know of me! Oh, what a shock it would be to me, if I saw him as you see him! Try to understand me, and you won't talk of my loss--you will talk of my gain." ...|$|E
6000|$|I cannot now {{remember}} when I first made his acquaintance, but I {{was not quite}} six, though very near it, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> first view of his house. In the chapter on [...] "Some Early Bird Adventures," [...] I have described my first long walk on the plains, when two of my brothers {{took me to a}} river some distance from home, where I was enchanted with my first sight of that glorious waterfowl, the flamingo. Now, as we stood on the brink of the flowing water, which had a width of about two hundred yards at that spot when the river had overflowed its banks, one of my elder brothers pointed to a long low house, thatched with rushes, about three-quarters of a mile distant {{on the other side of}} the stream, and informed me that it was the estancia house of Don Evaristo Penalva, who was one of the principal landowners in that part.|$|E
6000|$|The old {{man stood}} {{for some time}} thinking, and {{presently}} said, [...] "I do but little except in live stock. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> daughter with me I did {{a good deal of}} stuffing, for there is a considerable trade hereabout. The sailors bring home skins of foreign birds, and want them stuffed and put in cases, as presents for their wives and sweethearts. You work fast as well as skillfully. I have known men who would take a fortnight to do such a group as that, and then it would be a failure. It will be quite a new branch for my trade. I do not know how it will act yet, but to begin with I will give you twelve shillings a week, and a room upstairs. If it succeeds we will make other arrangements. I am an old man, and a very lonely one. I shall be glad to have such a companion." ...|$|E
