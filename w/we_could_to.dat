5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs of}} the album are noted for their {{changing}} dynamics – with [...] "middle sections [...] turn into this mass orchestrated swarm and ridiculous time signatures" [...] which include musical references to 1970s soft rock bands such as Wings, Eagles and Bread - summed by Hawkins by saying the band [...] "wanted {{to make sure that}} everything 'built' on this record, that each instrument started somewhere and went somewhere else {{in the course of a}} song". The drummer attributed this to the acoustic tour leading the band to [...] "shed some of the fear of incorporating mellower stuff with the heavy stuff", and Grohl added that [...] "we wanted the stops to be pin-drop silent before exploding. If we had a beautiful melody, we'd throw a fucking string quartet in there. So we did everything <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> really magnify all those elements and that was fun. Usually you have a few parameters you're afraid to pass but, this time, there was no fear of going too far." [...] Mix engineer Rich Costey added that his work ...|$|E
2500|$|Pietro Palazzini, who {{was later}} {{appointed}} a Cardinal and recognised as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem, endangered {{his life in}} his efforts to save the Jews of Rome. As assistant vice rector of the Seminario Romano (which was Vatican property), he hid Italian Jews for several months in 1943 and 1944. In accepting his title from Yad Vashem, Palazzini said that [...] "the merit is entirely Pius XII's, who ordered us to do whatever <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> save the Jews from persecution." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{passengers}} {{asserted that}} the crew did not help or were untrained in launching the lifeboats. This allegation was denied by the crew, one of whom stated, [...] "The crew members, whether Filipino or Colombians or Indians, tried {{to the best of}} our ability to help passengers survive the shipwreck. Comments by some of the passengers that we were unhelpful have hurt us." [...] A third engineer officer from the ship's engine room also pointed out that [...] "Unlike the captain, we were there until the end. We did all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> avoid catastrophe." [...] Costa Cruises CEO Pier Luigi Foschi praised the crew and personnel, despite difficulties resulting from the apparent lack of direction from the ship's officers and problems in communication.|$|E
2500|$|Among the ACA's other provisions, Price {{is opposed}} to the bill's elimination, under most health {{insurance}} plans, of co-pays for birth control. Price defended his position on this issue in a 2012 interview, by suggesting {{that there are no}} women in the country who have ever struggled to pay for birth control. He said, [...] "Bring me one woman who has been left behind. Bring me one. There's not one." [...] Numerous media outlets have refuted this assertion. In 2017, during his confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Health and Human Services, Price was questioned about this comment and responded, [...] ""What I meant is that when I had patients in my office who could not afford a medication we did everything <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> make sure they could have it. There are avenues in the heath care system that doctors and hospitals take to make sure people can get the health care they need." ...|$|E

As we spun along, out of nowhere this skinny blond kid was on our back wheel. He looked about 14. He was still there 15 minutes later, so we picked up speed. He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 12, 2007, the PGA Tour {{announced}} that Timberlake, an avid golfer who plays to a 6 handicap, {{would become the}} host of the tour's Las Vegas tournament starting in 2008. With Timberlake's agreement to host the tournament, its name was changed to the Justin Timberlake Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. He played in the celebrity pro-am on the day before the competitive tournament and hosted a charity concert during the week of the tournament. The activity was a success, and was repeated in 2009. A review of the value of celebrities to fundraising concluded that Timberlake's contribution to Shriners Hospitals for Children was the single most valuable celebrity endorsement in the U.S. during 2009, and worth over $US9 million. However, in 2012, the event's chair Raoul Frevel told reporters Timberlake would no longer be involved with the event: [...] "We tried everything <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> get him more involved with our kids and the hospitals. But it seemed that when the TV cameras weren't on, he disappeared." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Teen Kings went to Sun Studio in Memphis, where Phillips {{wanted to}} record [...] "Ooby Dooby" [...] again, in his {{superior}} studio. Orbison had grown {{weary of the}} song and rankled quietly as Phillips dictated what the band would play {{and how he was}} to sing it. With Phillips's production, however, the record broke into the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies. The Teen Kings toured with Sonny James, Johnny Horton, Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing [...] "everything <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> get applause because we had only one hit record". The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including [...] "Go! Go! Go!" [...] and [...] "Rockhouse". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there. They stayed in Phillips's home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice. A ballad Orbison wrote—"The Clown"—met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer Jack Clement told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fourth day}} of the {{competition}} had started earlier with another withdrawal, as fifth seed and 2007 Masters Cup semifinalist Andy Roddick announced he was {{pulling out of the}} event, after injuring his ankle during a practice session on the previous day. [...] "Yesterday in the warm-up during practice I just went over on it. [...] We tried the best <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> get it better but I can't really stop and start on it very quickly." [...] commented Roddick. The American's withdrawal allowed 26th-ranked Radek Štěpánek, who accepted the invitation to Shanghai as first alternate, after sixteen players ranked above him, and below last qualifier Gilles Simon, refused to come to the Masters Cup. Roddick said he had called Štěpánek, before deciding not to play, to tell him he might enter the competition : [...] "I called Štěpánek earlier today to let him know where my head was at, and then just told him when I came off the practice court. So he knew as early as anybody else." [...] Štěpánek's unexpected appearance (Murray had commented [...] "Štěpánek's turned up without his own racquets, he borrowed some socks off me earlier and he hasn't got his contact lenses either") marked the Czech's first career participation to the year-end championships.|$|E

2500|$|Sun News Network ceased {{operations}} on February 13 at 5:00a.m. EST, {{with news of}} the closure being broken hours before. There was neither an advance announcement by management, nor any on-air announcement by the channel. After its last program, a repeat of Byline with Brian Lilley, and following a promo for Pat Bolland's program, the channel aired a silent static card of the channel's logo for 30 seconds, then went to a black screen leaving cable operators to announce the closure themselves. A segment from Michael Coren's The Arena with Sun News [...] contributor Rachael Segal was the last segment ever recorded (it aired a few hours later) while David Akin's Battleground was the last live broadcast on the Sun News Network. [...] The closure meant the loss of 150 full-time jobs and affected an additional 50 freelancers and contributors. Management released a statement following the closure: [...] "This is an unfortunate outcome; shutting down Sun News was certainly not our goal," [...] according to Julie Tremblay, President and CEO of Media Group and Sun Media Corporation. [...] "Over the past four years, we tried everything <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>to</b> achieve sufficient market penetration to generate the profits needed to operate a national news channel. Sadly, the numerous obstacles to carriage that we encountered spelled {{the end of this}} venture... We thank all employees for their daily efforts and the talent they have contributed to the channel. We wish them all the best in their future endeavours," [...] she concluded.|$|E
