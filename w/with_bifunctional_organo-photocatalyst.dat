40|$|The genetic {{mechanism}} of the rare occurrence of Cis-AB expression, that is, AB and/or O offspring from AB X O parents, has not been fully understood. The synthesis of blood group A and B substances are controlled by N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (A-enzyme) and galactosyltransferase (B-enzyme). Therefore, the genetic {{mechanism of}} Cis-AB expression may be elucidated by examining the characteristics of A- and B-enzymes in Cis-AB plasma. In a previous study, we presented evidence that Cis-AB expression in one case examined was due to unequal chromosomal crossing over producing a single chromosome with the genes for A. and B-enzymes, rather than to a structural mutation producing a single abnormal enzyme <b>with</b> <b>bifunctional</b> activity. In contrast to the previous case, the present two Cis-AB plasma contained a single abnormal enzyme that can transfer both N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and galactose (Gal). Moreover, the subjects' plasma also contained an enzymatically inactive, but immunologically cross-reacting material.

40|$|Catalysis by {{purified}} avian 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA lyase {{is critically}} {{dependent on the}} reduction state of the enzyme, with less than 1 % of optimal activity being observed with the air-oxidized enzyme. The enzyme is irreversibly inactivated by sulfhydryl-directed reagents with the rate of this inactivation being highly dependent upon the redox state of a critical cysteine. Methylation of reduced avian lyase with 1 mM 4 -methylnitrobenzene sulfonate results in rapid inactivation of the enzyme with a k(inact) of 0. 178 min- 1. The oxidized enzyme is inactivated at a sixfold slower rate (k(inact) = 0. 028 min- 1). Inactivation of the enzyme with the reactive substrate analog 2 -butynoyl-CoA shows a similar dependence upon the enzyme's redox state, with a sevenfold difference in k(inact) observed with oxidized vs. reduced forms of the enzyme. Chemical cross-linking of the reduced enzyme with stoichiometric amounts of the bifunctional reagents 1, 3 -dibromo- 2 -propanone (DBP) or N,N'-ortho-phenylene-dimaleimide (PDM) coincides with rapid inactivation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of enzyme treated <b>with</b> <b>bifunctional</b> reagent reveals a band of twice the molecular weight of the lyase monomer, indicating that an intersubunit cross-link has been formed. Differential labeling of native and cross-linked protein with [1 - 14 C]iodoacetate has identified as the primary cross-linking target a cysteine within the sequence VSQAACR, which maps at the carboxy-terminus of the cDNA-deduced sequence of the avian enzyme (Mitchell, G. A., et al., 1991, Am. J. Hum. Genet. 49, 101). In contrast, bacterial HMG-CoA lyase, which contains no corresponding cysteine, is not cross-linked by comparable treatment <b>with</b> <b>bifunctional</b> reagent.
