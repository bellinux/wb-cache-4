40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{consumption}} of wood pellets as energy source for residential heating has increased, not only as fuel for stoves, but also for small-scale residential boilers that produce hot water used for both space heating and domestic hot water. Reduction of fuel consumption and pollutant emissions (CO, dust, HC) is an obvious target of <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> manufacturers, however they are also quite interested in producing low-maintenance appliances. The need of frequent maintenance turns in higher operating costs and inconvenience for the user, and in lower boiler efficiency and higher emissions also.

Furthermore, with this model, it is possible to pay more attention to the influence of the boiler control strategy.

40|$|Abstract Background Biomass {{combustion}} {{contributes to}} the production of ambient particulate matter (PM) in rural environments as well as urban settings, but relatively {{little is known about the}} health effects of these emissions. The aim of this study was therefore to characterize airway responses in humans exposed to wood smoke PM under controlled conditions. Nineteen healthy volunteers were exposed to both wood smoke, at a particulate matter (PM 2. 5) concentration of 224 ± 22 μg/m 3, and filtered air for three hours with intermittent exercise. The wood smoke was generated employing an experimental set-up with an adjustable <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> system under incomplete combustion. Symptoms, lung function, and exhaled NO were measured over exposures, with bronchoscopy performed 24 h post-exposure for characterisation of airway inflammatory and antioxidant responses in airway lavages. Results Glutathione (GSH) concentrations were enhanced in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) after wood smoke exposure vs. air (p = 0. 025), together with an increase in upper airway symptoms. Neither lung function, exhaled NO nor systemic nor airway inflammatory parameters in BAL and bronchial mucosal biopsies were significantly affected. Conclusions Exposure of healthy subjects to wood smoke, derived from an experimental <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> operating under incomplete combustion conditions with PM emissions dominated by organic matter, caused an increase in mucosal symptoms and GSH in the alveolar respiratory tract lining fluids but no acute airway inflammatory responses. We contend that this response reflects a mobilisation of GSH to the air-lung interface, consistent with a protective adaptation to the investigated wood smoke exposure. </p...|$|E

40|$|Emissions from {{residential}} combustion appliances vary significantly {{depending on}} the firing behaviours and combustion conditions, in addition to combustion technologies and fuel quality. Although <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> combustion in residential heating boilers is efficient, the combustion conditions during start-up and stop phases are not optimal and produce significantly high emissions such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon from incomplete combustion. The emissions from the start-up and stop phases of the <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers</b> are not fully {{taken into account in}} test methods for ecolabels which primarily focus on emissions during operation on full load and part load.  The objective of the thesis is to investigate the emission characteristics during realistic operation of residential <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers</b> in order to identify when the major part of the annual emissions occur. Emissions from four residential <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers</b> were measured and characterized for three operating phases (start-up, steady and stop). Emissions from realistic operation of combined solar and <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> heating systems was continuously measured to investigate the influence of start-up and stop phases on total annual emissions. Measured emission data from the pellet devices were used to build an emission model to predict the annual emission factors from the dynamic operation of the heating system using the simulation software TRNSYS.  Start-up emissions are found to vary with ignition type, supply of air and fuel, and time to complete the phase. Stop emissions are influenced by fan operation characteristics and the cleaning routine. Start-up and stop phases under realistic operation conditions contribute 80 – 95 % of annual carbon monoxide (CO) emission, 60 – 90 % total hydrocarbon (TOC), 10 – 20 % of nitrogen oxides (NO), and 30 – 40 % particles emissions. Annual emission factors from realistic operation of tested residential heating system with a top fed wood pelt boiler can be between 190 and 400 mg/MJ for the CO emissions, between 60 and 95 mg/MJ for the NO, between 6 and 25 mg/MJ for the TOC, between 30 and 116 mg/MJ for the particulate matter and between 2 x 1013 and 4 x 1013 /MJ for the number of particles. If the boiler has the cleaning sequence with compressed air such as in boiler B 2, annual CO emission factor can be up to 550 mg/MJ. Average CO, TOC and particles emissions under realistic annual condition were greater than the limits values of two eco labels. These results highlight the importance of start-up and stop phases in annual emission factors (especially CO and TOC). Since a large or dominating part of the annual emissions in real operation arise from the start-up and stop sequences, test methods required by the ecolabels should take these emissions into account. In this way it will encourage the boiler manufacturers to minimize annual emissions.  The annual emissions of residential pellet heating system can be reduced by optimizing the number of start-ups of the <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler.</b> It is possible to reduce up to 85 % of the number of start-ups by optimizing the system design and its controller such as switching of the boiler pump after it stops, using two temperature sensors for boiler ON/OFF control, optimizing of the positions of the connections to the storage tank, increasing the mixing valve temperature in the boiler circuit and decreasing the pump flow rate. For 85 % reduction of start-ups, 75 % of CO and TOC emission factors were reduced while 13 % increase in NO and 15 % increase in particle emissions was observed...|$|R

Raymond Danforth Library, Gilmore Dining Hall, and Bridges Gymnasium. The College worked with Granite State Plumbing & Heating, LLC, located in Weare, New Hampshire on this project. The solar panels are manufactured by Heat Transfer; the product is Heat Transfer 30 -tube collector panels (Evacuated Tube Type) with stainless steel hardware. The interior equipment includes Super Stor Ultra stainless steel super insulated storage tank, Taco 009 Bronze circulator pump, Solar Relay Control Pack, and a Taco Thermal Expansion Tank. The primary goals, objectives, and outcomes of this initiative will allow the College to utilize the sun as an energy resource. These solar hot water panels and systems will alleviate our dependency on fossil fuel as our primary fuel resource and provide a reliable energy source that supplies the hot water needs for sanitation, dishwashing at our dining facilities, and shower facilities for our athletes. This project initiative was completed on June 30, 2010.

40|$|Policies {{to decarbonize}} heat {{provision}} involve {{the diffusion of}} low carbon thermal technologies (e. g. ground-source heat pumps and <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers).</b> In domestic buildings, such efforts presume the compatibility of novel technologies with practices of home-making, in terms of comfort, cosiness and sociability. However, research on engagement with low carbon technologies post-installation is limited, particularly with older adults, a growing social group in an ageing society. This study explores how older adults living with low carbon thermal technologies represent thermal comfort, drawing on in-depth interviews in diverse UK home environments (owner-occupied and rented; extra-care, sheltered and care homes; urban and rural). Findings indicate that cosiness and glow are highly valued by and for older adults, and achieved in diverse ways that may run counter to policy goals. In owner-occupied, rural homes, wood-burning stoves were retained after installation of under-floor heating/heat pumps to provide a visible glow and hospitality to guests. In care homes, fake fireplaces provide cosiness and glow without compromising concerns about risk. The research suggests that presumed emissions savings from the deployment of low carbon heating technologies may be overestimated, as home-making practices lead to the supplementing of these devices to provide comfort, cosiness and sociability...|$|R

The biomass energy supply in Scotland was forecast to reach 450 MW or higher, (predominantly from wood), with power stations requiring 4,500–5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity. However a 2011 Forestry Commission and Scottish government follow-up {{report concluded}} that: [...] "...there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic wood fibre resource."

The first study gathered data on Irish people’s general awareness of microgeneration technologies and was conducted in March 2009. The second and main survey targeted Irish home owners {{in order to understand}} their perceptions of and attitudes to microgeneration. The survey was designed based on the findings from a series of exploratory face-to-face interviews with home owners and an extensive review of the available evidence around microgeneration. Both studies were administered by TNS MRBI via computer-assisted telephone interviews. The report is structured as follows. Part I presents the research methodology and findings from an awareness study, discussing differences in the level of awareness between the respective microgeneration technologies and consumer segments. Part II presents the findings from the large-scale field survey, breaking the analysis into four parts. It discusses Irish home owners’ WTP for the respective microgeneration technologies and analyses differences in WTP between socioeconomic groups. The findings show significant differences in WTP between the technologies. Part III compares home owners’ attitudes and perceptions of product characteristics between the four microgeneration technologies. Part IV takes a different perspective, evaluating differences in attitudes and perceptions between three distinct groups of home owners, i. e. potential adopters, undecided and rejecters. Part V evaluates Irish home owners’ intention to buy these technologies and tests the influence of some of the perceptions, attitudes and social norms that have been discussed.

40|$|AbstractIn multi-apartment buildings, {{changes in}} energy demand may {{influence}} cost-optimal heat supply options. District heat based on {{combined heat and power}} production {{has proved to}} be cost- and primary energy-efficient option for heating purposes in the residential sector. However, for customers with a low heat demand, local heat supply options may be more cost-efficient than district heat supply options. In this study, we investigated cost-optimal options to supply heat to a multi-apartment building in Växjö city, Sweden. We considered biomass-based alternatives for district heating and local heating based on <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> and ground-source electric heat pump, also combined with solar heating systems. Furthermore, we evaluated how a varied yearly heat demand influences the cost and primary energy efficiency of the different heat technologies. We found that both fuel costs and initial investment costs of heating systems play an important role for the cost efficiency of the different heat supply options. District heat is not always cost efficient for multi-apartment buildings especially for low energy buildings with minimum heat demand. There is also a tradeoff between heating cost and primary energy use in supplying heat to multi-apartment buildings...|$|E
40|$|The {{project is}} made in {{cooperation}} with Lolland municipality, which has set a series of ambitious goals in relation to reducing the CO 2 emissions in the municipality. One of the challenges faced by the municipality in this connection is to achieve a cleaner heat supply. The collective heat supply is almost 100 % CO 2 -neutral, as the district heating plants primarily use CO 2 -neutral fuel. However, {{there are a great}} number of households outside the collective heat supply, which are heated by means of an oil-fired boiler. It is precisely these households that are subject matter for this project. Overall, the project encompasses two levels, namely a technological level and an implementation level. At the technological level, seven different heating technologies that can function as a supplement or an alternative to an oil-fired boiler, which is presupposed to be from 1985, have been selected. Following heating technologies have been selected: Air-to-water heat pump, water-to-water heat pump, solid fuel boiler, <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler,</b> solar heating system, biofuel boiler and a new oil-fired boiler. The criteria for the selection have been that these technologies emit less greenhouse gases than an oil-fired boiler from 1985, they are compatible with the systems of heat emission of the houses and they are cost competitive to the current oil-fired boiler. Financial calculations have been carried out for all the heating technologies {{on the basis of the}} annuity principle, as well as calculations of the energy efficiency of the technologies, and calculations of the technologies’ annual emissions of greenhouse gases. These calculations show that the annual costs are lowest when using the air-to-water pump, followed by the solid fuel boiler, solar heat combined with the existing oil-fired boiler, water-to-water pump, <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler,</b> the current oil-fired boiler alone, solar heat combined with <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler,</b> a new oil-fired boiler and the current oil-fired boiler with a new biofuel boiler. The greenhouse gas emissions are lowest when using the biofuel plants, followed by the air-to-water pump, water-to-water pump, solar heat combined with the existing oil-fired boiler, a new oil-fired boiler and highest when using the current oil-fired boiler alone. On the level of implementation, it will be examined how Lolland municipality can, through strategic communication, optimise their chances in encouraging as many citizens as possible of the individual heat supply to adopt a heating technology that reduces greenhouse gases. Seven individual qualitative interviews have been carried out with citizens of Lolland municipality, which at present warm up their houses by means of an oil-fired boiler. The interviews seek to uncover at which level citizens have set up barriers in relation to an implementation of a cleaner way of heating, but also where there might be any possible incentives. The questions for the interview have been designed on the basis of the classical communication theory “diffusion of Innovations” and a theoretical campaign model, which springs from theory and empirical results from behaviourism and social psychology. The interviews enable a segmentation of the target group and a specification of the factors, which hinder the target group from choosing to implement a heating technology that reduces greenhouse gases. The analysis shows especially that there is a significant lack of knowledge of the existing alternative options to the oil-fired boiler. Furthermore, the citizens do not know where to obtain guidance concerning alternative heating options. The analysis also shows that the target groups place great emphasis on the fact that a heating technology must not be demanding and it must be cheap in relation to the current oil-fired pump. The identified barriers and incentives for the choice of alternative heating technologies of the target groups, as well as their weighting of which heating technologies seem to be attractive, are incorporated in the communication planning, so that the barriers are minimised and incentives maximised. It is recommended that the communication product focuses on implementation of the heating technologies that can contribute in meeting the environmental objectives of the municipality in the best way possible. At the same time, they have to be attractive for the citizens and there will be given instructions on how the municipality should address to the citizens efficiently with this information. In the project’s final recommendations to Lolland municipality, it will be considered how the further work with the communication planning should proceed in order to achieve the best results possible...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the impacts of technical and market changes on the economic feasibility of using wood biomass to produce heat for an average-sized greenhouse in British Columbia. A previous techno-economic analysis determined that the installation of a wood pellet or a wood residue boiler to generate 40 % of the greenhouse heat demand is more economical than using a natural gas boiler alone to generate all the heat [1]. As the techno-economic analysis contained forecasted parameters, a thorough sensitivity analysis is needed for sound decision making. This paper extends the previous techno-economic study by assessing the effect of fuel price, wood biomass energy contribution, and greenhouse size changes on the net present value (NPV) when using a wood pellet or wood residue boiler with or without an electrostatic precipitator (ESP). The results indicate that the attractiveness of using wood biomass will increase if the price of fossil fuels increases more than 3 % per year or carbon taxes and regulations are applied. Increasing the biomass energy contribution by 20 % (to provide 60 % of the total heat demand) would still be economical. The installation of a <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> or a wood residue boiler is economical for average (7. 5 Â ha) or large (15 Â ha) greenhouses.

5000|$|A 2007 report {{concluded}} that wood fuel exceeded hydroelectric and wind {{as the largest}} potential source of renewable energy. Scotland's forests, which made up 60% of the UK resource base, were forecast {{to be able to}} provide up to 1 million tonnes of wood fuel per annum. The biomass energy supply in Scotland was forecast to reach 450 MW or higher, (predominantly from wood), with power stations requiring 4,500-5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity. However a 2011 Forestry Commission and Scottish government follow-up {{report concluded}} that: [...] "...there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic wood fibre resource." [...] A plan to build in Edinburgh a 200 MW biomass plant which would have imported 83% of its wood, was withdrawn by Forth Energy in 2012. The energy company E.ON has constructed a 44 MW biomass power station at Lockerbie using locally sourced crops while the smaller EPR Westfield power plant in Fife produces 9.8 MW of output using chicken litter as fuel. The Scottish Executive and the Forestry Commission issued a Scottish Biomass Action Plan in 2007. The Scottish Government set up the Scottish Biomass Support Scheme in 2006 with a £7.5 million grant, later increased to £10.5 million, to support biomass energy. £6 million of grants were drawn down by the time the scheme finished in March 2008 and a 2009 review of results concluded that the scheme had [...] "...achieved limited success against its strategic aims objectives." [...] A 2007 article by Renew Scotland claimed that automatic <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers</b> could be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems. These boilers might be cheaper to run and, by using locally produced wood fuel, could try to be as carbon neutral as possible by using little energy for transportation.|$|R
40|$|Biomass is {{increasingly}} used for energy generation since {{it represents a}} useful alternative to fossil fuel in order to face the pollutions and the global warming problem. It can be exploited for heating purposes and for supplying domestic hot water. The most common applications encompass <b>wood</b> and <b>pellet</b> <b>boilers.</b> The economic aspect is becoming an important issue {{in order to achieve}} the ambitious targets set by the European Directives on Renewable Sources. Thus, the present paper deals with the economic feasibility of biomass boiler plants with specific regard to an existing residential building. An Italian case study is further investigated, focusing the attention on European and national regulations on energy efficiency and considering the recent public incentives and supporting measures. The main thermoclimatic parameters—that is, heating degree days (HDDs), building thermal insulation and thermal needs—are taken into account. Moreover, the following economic indicators are calculated: cumulative cash flow, discounted cumulative cash flow, payback period (PP), net present value (NPV), Internal rate of return (IRR), discounted payback period (DPP), and profit index (PI) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to perform a techno-economic analysis on a typical wood pellet and wood residue boiler for generation of heat to an average-sized greenhouse in British Columbia. The variables analyzed included greenhouse size and structure, boiler efficiency, fuel types, and source of carbon dioxide (CO 2) for crop fertilization. The net present value (NPV) show that installing a wood pellet or a wood residue boiler to provide 40 % of the annual heat demand is more economical than using a natural gas boiler to provide all the heat at a discount rate of 10 %. For an assumed lifespan of 25 years, a <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler</b> system could generate NPV of C$ 259, 311 without electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and C$ 74, 695 with ESP, respectively. While, installing a wood residue boiler with or without an ESP could provide NPV of C$ 919, 922 or C$ 1, 104, 538, respectively. Using a wood biomass boiler could also eliminate over 3000 Â tonne CO 2 equivalents of greenhouse gases annually. Wood biomass combustion generates more particulate matters than natural gas combustion. However, an advanced emission control system could significantly reduce particulate matters emission from wood biomass combustion which would bring the particulate emission to a relatively similar level as for natural gas.

40|$|International audienceThe {{residential}} sector {{is responsible for}} more than 35 % of the final energy consumption in the European Union, and is increasingly constrained by thermal regulations, resulting in a significant rise of new efficient heating technologies. This paper presents {{a comparison of the}} energetic and environmental performances of six heating systems installed in a low energy house: a gas-fired condensing boiler, a <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> <b>boiler,</b> a micro-combined heat and power (MCHP), an air-to-water electric heat pump, an air-to-water gas absorption heat pump and an exhaust air-to-air electric heat pump. The comparison is made with respect to the annual primary energy consumption and the annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and carried out under various climates and electricity generation mixes. The results indicate that, based on an ideal sizing, the MCHP and the absorption heat pump achieve the highest energy performances. However, both technologies suffer from small size unavailability, leading to significant oversizing which impacts their performances. Based on current size availability, the air-to-water electric heat pump benefits from the previous systems oversizing and thus appears as the most efficient technology. However, current sizing practice also causes significant oversizing which impacts the performances of thermodynamic systems. Without significant sizing practice improvements, the air-to-water electric heat pump merit decreases in favor of the MCHP. In terms of environmental impact, the wood boiler causes the lowest GHG emissions, whatever the electricity generation mix considered...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{residential}} wood pellet boilers {{were tested}} for the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), dust and combustion efficiency in real life and standard laboratory conditions and values were compared with the permissible values of Blue Angel, Swan Mark and EN- 303 - 5. The test setup consisted of six boilers equipped with bottom feed burner (BF), one with top feed (TF) and two with horizontally feed burner (HF). Wood pellets used as fuel were DINplus certified. In real life conditions, 20 Â kW bottom feed boiler had the best performance. Emissions of dust from bottom and horizontal feed boilers were better in real life conditions than in standard laboratory conditions. All boiler technologies had lower combustion efficiencies in real life condition (2 - 5 % less) than in standard laboratory condition. Top feed boiler emitted maximum CO (1566 Â mgÂ NÂ m- 3); and dust particles from concerned boiler contained {{a considerable amount of}} elemental carbon. Almost similar NOx emissions were reported with all technologies in real life conditions. All the boilers met emissions and efficiency requirements of Swan Mark (except top feed boilers for CO) and EN- 303 - 5, in both conditions. In laboratory conditions, all bottom feed boilers satisfied emissions and efficiency requirements of Blue Angel, however, in real life situation only 20 Â kW bottom feed and horizontal feed boilers could meet the concerned requirements. Bottom and horizontal feed boiler technologies have advantage over top feed, having lower emissions and higher efficiency. Keeping in mind minor variation in quality of considered wood pellets, different burner configurations clearly lead to important differences in the emissions and efficiencies.

40|$|This report {{studies the}} {{feasibility}} of replacing natural gas with <b>wood</b> <b>pellets</b> for UBC <b>boilers.</b> A gasification system is proposed to be installed in the UBC boiler house to convert <b>wood</b> <b>pellets</b> into syngas {{that can be used}} to displace the energy required from natural gas to produce steam. The environmental impact and the cost of implementation between <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> technology (case 2) and natural gas technology (case 1) are compared. The environmental impact for the two cases is compared with life-cycle assessment (LCA). The life cycle of natural gas is divided into the following stages: production, transmission, and final use. The life cycle of <b>wood</b> <b>pellets</b> is divided into the following stages: harvesting, transportation, pellet production, and final use. The environmental and human impacts of each stage are evaluated in terms of global warming potential (GWP), smog formation potential (SF), acid rain potential (ARP), and health impact. Moreover, the operating cost of using <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> as the energy source is examined. In addition, potential air emission reduction units that help further minimize the emissions from using <b>wood</b> <b>pellets</b> are investigated. It is found that most local air emissions, especially carbon dioxide, decrease when <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> is used. However, when the entire life-cycle is taken into the consideration, the VOC, SOx, and PM emissions increase significantly. Also, a preliminary economic analysis showed that implementation of the new system which utilizes <b>wood</b> <b>pellets</b> and natural gas for the production of steam generates an annual saving of approximately $ 2 million. Different valuation methods show that using <b>wood</b> <b>pellets</b> is an improvement over natural gas. i...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe "positive energy building" concept {{combines}} {{energy saving}} and electricity production using renewable resources, aiming a positive primary energy balance on a yearly basis. Compared to other concepts of high energy performance buildings, {{it is very}} ambitious on an energy point of view, but more materials and components are used, {{this is why the}} environmental relevance of this concept has to be questioned. In order to contribute to answer this question, a life cycle assessment (LCA), including the fabrication of components, construction, operation, maintenance, dismantling and waste treatment, has been used to evaluate the environmental impacts of two high energy performance buildings: a renovated multi-family social housing building and two passive attached houses. Both buildings are located in North of France. For the purpose of this study, renewable energy production has been assumed to achieve nearly positive energy balances. For these buildings, four different heating solutions have been studied: an electric heat pump, a <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> condensing <b>boiler,</b> a <b>wood</b> <b>pellet</b> micro-cogeneration unit, and district heating. Modeling and simulation have been performed using the building thermal simulation tool COMFIE, to evaluate the heating load and thermal comfort level, and the LCA tool EQUER to evaluate twelve impact indicators.
