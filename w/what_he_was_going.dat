500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of the 24 April, in Hamburg for the press conference the following day, Trevor-Roper asked Heidemann for the name of his source: the journalist refused, and gave a different story of how the diaries had been acquired. Trevor-Roper was suspicious and questioned the reporter closely for over an hour. Heidemann accused the historian of acting [...] "exactly like an officer of the British army" [...] in 1945. At a subsequent dinner the historian was evasive when asked by Stern executives <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say at the announcement the following day.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Bass {{stated that}} he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 {{decision}} to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has {{also said that he}} has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has [...] "made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon." [...] Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: [...] "At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, I’m really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don’t hate him at all. And I understand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us." ...|$|E
500|$|Saari {{left behind}} two {{handwritten}} {{notes in his}} school dormitory indicating {{that he had been}} planning the massacre for six years. A police spokesperson commented: [...] "Saari left notes saying he had a hatred for mankind, for the whole of the human race, and that he had been thinking about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do for years. The notes show he was very troubled and he hated everything." [...] Police said that although most of the victims were female, the motive {{did not seem to be}} a hatred of women. One of Saari's friends noticed a change in his behaviour two years before the shootings, when Saari began expressing a fondness for guns and an admiration of the school shootings in the United States. He said that around 18 months previously Saari had sent him a message saying that he would carry out a school shooting the next day. Saari reportedly denied being serious about carrying out his threat.|$|E

They agree that someone should drop by later to make sure Dave is okay, but they all have things to do so Katherine tells them that she will get Mike to go over. When Mike stops by with Katherine's lasagne, he tries {{to tell him that}} he'll get through it and understands <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> through which causes Dave to lash out saying Mike should go back to his happy life with Katherine and to leave him alone. Mike leaves saying he [...] "doesn't have any idea <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> through." ...|$|R
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what he was or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Greg Ryan, Keogh was [...] "unanimously {{regarded as}} the best back in the colony" [...] and also [...] "one of the most gifted, colourful and ultimately controversial figures of early New Zealand rugby." [...] While rugby writer Terry McLean wrote of Keogh in 1987 that he was [...] "one of those rare birds of rugby, the genuine 'freak'." [...] A correspondent for Christchurch paper The Sun, lamenting a perceived decline in back play, wrote in 1917 that Keogh [...] "was probably the greatest half-back the rugby world has ever produced. His success was due entirely to his versatility in methods. Neither opponents nor spectators knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do next. He was {{the first player to}} bounce the ball on the head of an opponent on a line-out, catch it, and streak down the field. He was an adept in kneeing the ball over the head of an opposing player; he feinted, he hurdled, he kicked; his play was never the same two minutes together." [...] While a teammate of Keoghs from the Natives, George Williams, said in 1925 that he had never seen Keogh's equal. William McKenzie, known as [...] "Off-Side Mac", who played 20 matches for New Zealand in the 1890s, said of Keogh in 1910: [...] "Keogh is {{regarded as the}} trickiest and most brilliantly attacking back ever turned out of the New Zealand school." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the meeting}} of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done. He called her not only the mother of the king but the mother of the state. Henry did not tell Catherine of his plan for a {{solution}} to his problems. On 23 December 1588, he asked the Duke of Guise to call on him at the Château de Blois. As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died {{at the foot of the}} king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, Louis II, Cardinal of Guise, whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons. Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, [...] "Please forgive me. Monsieur de Guise is dead. He will not be spoken of again. I have had him killed. I have done to him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do to me." [...] Catherine's immediate reaction is not known; but on Christmas Day, she told a friar, [...] "Oh, wretched man! What has he done?... Pray for him... I see him rushing towards his ruin." [...] She visited her old friend Cardinal de Bourbon on 1 January 1589 to tell him she was sure he would soon be freed. He shouted at her, [...] "Your words, Madam, have led us all to this butchery." [...] She left in tears.|$|E

500|$|On December 14, 2012, {{academic}} and writer Judith Reisman stated {{in a piece}} for WorldNetDaily that in her view Wales had received revenue from a website which dealt in pornography. Relatively soon after the article was published, Wales wrote to WorldNetDaily to object to this characterization: [...] "This is absolutely and categoricallly [...] false. I have never made any 'fortune', as a pornography trafficker or otherwise, and I have never been a 'pornography trafficker' at all. ... I demand an immediate edit to that story to remove the lie about me." [...] WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah personally replied to Wales to explain that Wikipedia's coverage {{of the history of}} Bomis acknowledged at the time that: [...] "Bomis ran a website called Bomis Premium at premium.bomis.com until 2005, offering customers access to premium, X-rated pornographic content." [...] Wales sent an email to Farah stating Wikipedia: [...] "doesn't say anything remotely like me making a 'fortune' from 'pornography." [...] Wales inquired to Farah <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do next about what Wales characterized as [...] "libel". Farah responded to Wales' reply with a subsequent email asking: [...] "Let me get this straight: You admit making money from pornography, but you feel defamed because you didn’t make enough for it to be considered a 'fortune'?" [...] Wales then repeated his original request to Farah and again asserted the original article was [...] "defamatory", writing in an email: [...] "This is a defamatory falsehood. I have never made any 'fortune' as a 'porngraphy [...] trafficker.' Fix it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kulwicki {{started his}} rookie season in 1986 with Terry. After Terry decided to end support for his racing team mid-season, Kulwicki fielded his own team. He started out as {{essentially}} a one-man team {{in a time when}} other teams had dozens of people in supporting roles. Initially the driver, owner, crew chief, and chief mechanic, Kulwicki had difficulty acquiring and keeping crew members because he found it difficult to trust them to do the job with the excellence that he demanded, and because he was hands on in the maintenance of racecars {{to the point of being}} a [...] "control freak". He sought out crew members who had owned their own racecars, believing they would understand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through: working long hours and performing his own car maintenance with a very limited budget. Notable crew members include his crew chief, Paul Andrews, and future Cup crew chiefs, Tony Gibson and Brian Whitesell. Future crew chief and owner, Ray Evernham, lasted sixweeks with Kulwicki in 1992. Evernham later said, [...] "The man was a genius. There's no question. It's not a matter of people just feeling like he was a genius. That man was a genius. But his personality paid for that. He was very impatient, very straightforward, very cut-to-the-bone." [...] With onecar, twoengines, and twofull-time crew members, Kulwicki won the 1986 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award. He had competed in 23 of 29events, with fourtop10 finishes, three races not completed (DNF), an average finish of 15.4, and had only one result below 30th place. Kulwicki finished 21st in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E
