5|$|M. spinosissima {{thrive in}} well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH ranging from acidic to neutral. They prefer low {{humidity}} and full, filtered sun.

40|$|<b>Water</b> {{reclamation}} and reuse {{provides a}} unique and viable opportunity to augment traditional <b>water</b> supplies. As a multi-disciplined and important element of <b>water</b> resources development and management, <b>water</b> reuse can help to close the loop between <b>water</b> supply and wastewater disposal. Effective <b>water</b> reuse requires integration of <b>water</b> and reclaimed <b>water</b> supply functions. The successful development of this dependable <b>water</b> resource depends upon close examination and synthesis of elements from infrastructure and facilities planning, wastewater treatment plant siting, treatment process reliability, economic and financial analyses, and <b>water</b> utility management. In this paper, fundamental concepts of <b>water</b> reuse are discussed including definitions, historical developments, the role of <b>water</b> recycling in the hydrologic cycle, categories of <b>water</b> reuse, <b>water</b> quality criteria and regulatory requirements, and technological innovations for the safe use of reclaimed <b>water.</b> The paper emphasizes the integration of this alternative <b>water</b> supply into <b>water</b> resources planning {{and the emergence of}} modern <b>water</b> reclamation and reuse practices from wastewater to reclaimed <b>water</b> to repurified <b>water...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Technological advancements {{within the}} {{industry}} allow for incorporating timers to limit the operations during specific {{hours of the day}} to reduce energy waste by only operating when occupants are likely to use hot <b>water.</b> Additional advancements in technology include pumps which cycle on and off to maintain hot <b>water</b> temperature versus a continuously operating pump which consumes more electrical energy. Reduced energy waste and discomfort is possible by preventing occurrences of hot <b>water</b> line siphoning in open-loop hot <b>water</b> circulation systems which utilize the cold <b>water</b> line to return <b>water</b> back to the <b>water</b> heater. Hot <b>Water</b> Line Siphoning occurs when <b>water</b> from within the hot <b>water</b> line siphons or is forced into the cold <b>water</b> line due to differences in <b>water</b> pressure between the hot and cold <b>water</b> lines. Utilizing [...] "normally closed" [...] solenoid valve significantly reduces energy consumption by preventing siphoning of non-hot <b>water</b> out of hot <b>water</b> lines during cold <b>water</b> use. Using cold <b>water</b> instantly lowers the <b>water</b> pressure in the cold <b>water</b> lines, the higher <b>water</b> pressure in the hot <b>water</b> lines force <b>water</b> through [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic crossover valves and backflow check valves (which only prevent cold <b>water</b> from flowing into hot <b>water</b> line), increasing the energy demand on the <b>water</b> heater.|$|R

All organised resistance ceased ten minutes later and as darkness fell, sporadic firing petered out, while prisoners were rounded up, horses collected and <b>watered</b> at the captured wells.

5|$|Gallium is {{used for}} {{neutrino}} detection. Possibly the largest amount of pure gallium ever collected in a single spot is the Gallium-Germanium Neutrino Telescope used by the SAGE experiment at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in Russia. This detector contains 55–57 tonnes of liquid gallium. Another experiment was the GALLEX neutrino detector operated in the early 1990s in an Italian mountain tunnel. The detector contained 12.2 tons of <b>watered</b> gallium-71. Solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of 71Ga to become radioactive 71Ge, which were detected. This experiment showed that the solar neutrino flux is 40% less than theory predicted. This deficit was not explained until better solar neutrino detectors and theories were constructed (see SNO).|$|E

40|$|Although <b>water</b> {{supply systems}} include {{activities}} such as <b>water</b> intake; <b>water</b> purification; and <b>water</b> distribution, many <b>water</b> supply organizations are not always equipped with all three activities. In fact, Japan has two types of <b>water</b> companies: one that operates <b>water</b> intake and <b>water</b> purification (type 1); and the other which mainly operates <b>water</b> distribution (type 2). Many previous studies have attempted to identify scale economies for <b>water</b> supply organizations, but have failed {{to take into account}} which <b>water</b> supply systems operate. In this analysis we categorize Japanese <b>water</b> supply organizations into three types: type 1 - which operates <b>water</b> intake and <b>water</b> purification; type 2 a - which not only operates <b>water</b> distribution, but also operates <b>water</b> intake and <b>water</b> purification; and type 2 b - which operates <b>water</b> distribution, but purchases <b>water</b> from type 1 companies. After that, we estimate scale economies for each type of <b>water</b> supply organization using translog cost function. Furthermore, we take into account their <b>water</b> sources, especially type 1 and type 2 a, because we consider that differences of <b>water</b> sources might affect the cost structure of <b>water</b> supply systems. ...|$|R
