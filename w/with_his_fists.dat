5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal sparring with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists.</b> With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E
25|$|After McLoren was stabbed, Farris {{entered the}} fort and became {{involved}} in the melee. Farris confronted Jason, who turned and, without hesitation, stabbed Farris twice in the torso. Immediately thereafter, McLoren observed Hein beating Farris in the head and face <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists.</b> Farris did not resist or otherwise defend himself from the blows administered by Hein.|$|E
25|$|In Scott's first appearance, {{his body}} would glow green or be {{bathed in a}} green light {{whenever}} he used his power, such as passing through a wall or flying. During his earliest appearances, he would project a beam of green light from his ring that could do {{a variety of things}} such as move objects, melt metal, shrink objects, or put out fires. He rarely used it as an actual weapon and preferred to fight <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> like any other pulp-adventure hero would do. The ring made him invulnerable to any weapon not made of wood.|$|E

25|$|During combat, {{the player}} {{character}} is Agrippa, who can use various gladiatorial weapons such as swords, scimitars, maces, spears, bows, slingshots and flails. If Agrippa has severed {{the arm of}} an enemy, he can {{pick it up and}} also use it as a weapon. However, weapons can only be used for {{a certain amount of time}} before they break. During combat, a meter indicates the remaining vitality of Agrippa's weapon(s) and helmet (if he has one equipped). Agrippa can attack with his main weapon, his sub-weapon or shield, or with a two-handed weapon. The player can lock on to enemies to make Agrippa target them. Agrippa can also throw weapons at his enemies, and can fight <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> using strong and soft punches as well as shoulder tackles. If timed correctly, Agrippa can also steal weapons from his enemies, or knock their weapons out of their hands using a shoulder tackle. He can also attack from the ground by flinging sand into an approaching enemy's face, and he can attack downed enemies by stomping on them or stabbing them. If Agrippa stands behind a groggy enemy he can perform a suplex on them.|$|E

2500|$|Bittaker then traded {{places with}} Norris, who drove in an aimless manner for {{in excess of}} an hour as Bittaker {{remained}} with Ledford {{in the back of}} the van. After removing the construction tape from the girl's mouth and legs, Bittaker tormented Ledford: initially slapping and mocking her, then beating her <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> as he repeatedly shouted for her to [...] "say something", then, as Shirley Ledford began screaming, shouting for her to [...] "scream louder". As Ledford continued screaming, Bittaker began asking her as he struck her: [...] "What's the matter? Don't you like to scream?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Tito Ortiz and Antônio Rogério Nogueira then {{participated in}} their light heavyweight fight. [...] Ortiz started the fight <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> flying pushing Nogueira back early. [...] Nogueira finally countered Ortiz's attack and {{reversed}} the situation pushing Ortiz back. [...] Nogueira then dropped Ortiz {{with a knee}} to the body and began pounding on him. Nogueira threw punches to Ortiz's body and when Ortiz {{failed to respond to}} the attack, the referee stopped the fight. [...] The result was Antônio Rogério Nogueira earning a technical knockout victory over Tito Ortiz at 3:15 of the first round.|$|E
2500|$|Beckjord's firm {{belief that}} Bigfoot and similar {{entities}} were inter-dimensional shape-shifters who could [...] "manipulate the light spectrum {{so that people}} can't see them" [...] brought him into conflict not only with skeptics, but other Bigfoot researchers as well, who argued for proof of physical remains. He had what is described as [...] "well-publicized arguments" [...] with writers of the Skeptical Inquirer and certain members of the International Society of Cryptozoology and was considered [...] "a person non grata among more conventional Bigfoot researchers." [...] He would, literally, fight for his beliefs <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> and was banned from contributing to online forums because of postings that were allegedly abusive.|$|E
2500|$|Nathan Phelps, Fred Phelps' estranged son, {{claims he}} never had a {{relationship}} with his abusive father when he was growing up, and that the Westboro Baptist Church is an organization for his father to [...] "vent his rage and anger." [...] He alleges that, in addition to hurting others, his father used to physically abuse his wife and children by beating them <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> and with the handle of a mattock to the point of bleeding. Phelps' brother Mark has supported and repeated Nathan's claims of physical abuse by their father. Since 2004, over 20 members of the church, mostly family members, have left the church and his family.|$|E

2500|$|After marching inland, the Brigade {{took part}} in the battle of El Teb. It was at this battle that Captain Arthur Knyvet Wilson of [...] earned the Victoria Cross for his {{conspicuous}} bravery in fighting <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> and saving one corner of the British square from being broken. After the battle of El Teb, the General Commanding issued a general order in which he especially thanked the Naval Brigade for their cheerful endurance during the severe work of dragging the guns over difficult country, and for their ready gallantry and steadiness under fire. On 11 March, the Naval Brigade advanced from Suakin with the troops for the dispersal of the Arab forces who were beleaguering Sinkat.|$|E
2500|$|As Shirley Ledford {{began to}} cry, she pleaded with Bittaker, saying, [...] "No, don't touch me." [...] In response, Bittaker again {{ordered her to}} scream as loud as she wished, then began {{alternately}} striking her with a hammer, beating her breasts <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> and torturing her with pliers both between and throughout instances when he raped and sodomized her. Repeatedly, Ledford can be heard pleading for the abuse to cease and making statements such as, [...] "Oh no! No!" [...] as sounds of Bittaker alternately extracting either the sledgehammer or the pliers from the toolbox can be heard on a tape recorder he had switched on after entering {{the rear of the}} van. Norris later described hearing [...] "screams ... constant screams" [...] emanating {{from the rear of the}} van as he drove.|$|E
2500|$|Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill)—the misanthropic {{head of the}} Bundy household; {{afflicted by}} the [...] "Bundy curse" [...] that consigns him to an unrewarding career selling women's shoes and a life with a family that mocks and disrespects him, but who still enjoys the simple things in life. He {{constantly}} attempts to relive his high-school Big Man On Campus days, {{when he was the}} [...] "All State Quarterback". His most noted achievement was having scored four touchdowns in a single game for Polk High. His favorite things in life are the local nudie bar, his collection of [...] "BigUns" [...] magazine, his television, his Dodge car with almost 1 million miles on the odometer, and a television show called [...] "Psycho Dad." [...] Despite his family's contempt for him, and his for them, Al is always ready to defend Bundy honor (often <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists),</b> and he is fiercely protective of daughter Kelly, his [...] "little girl" [...] who rarely had a boyfriend Al didn't beat up.|$|E

2500|$|John Thaw starred as Detective Inspector John [...] "Jack" [...] Regan, a tough police officer, often {{frustrated}} by Scotland Yard's red tape. Originally from Manchester (like Thaw himself), {{he has been}} in London for several years, so his accent has modified, but traces of his northern origins are still evident. He also refers to his northern roots every now and again (his poor upbringing, his father's work on the Manchester Ship Canal), which brings banter from George Carter, a Londoner, such as humming [...] "The Red Flag". A heavy drinker and smoker (comically, he is sometimes seen stealing other people's cigarettes), Regan has some success with the ladies – although not as much as Carter, or in one episode, DCI Haskins. He can be seen as quick <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists.</b> He has an ex-wife, Kate, and daughter, Susie, and in the last episode of the first series, [...] "Abduction", Susie is kidnapped.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 January 1945, Dennis {{had been}} ordered out to collect sticks. He came home {{shivering}} with {{only a handful of}} sticks and was forced out again by Gough using his stick. He stood in the yard crying and was dragged to the [...] by his hair by Mrs Gough. That night he was thrashed for taking a bite from a swede. The following day he was stripped naked by Gough and thrashed with a stick so hard that it broke; Gough then thrashed him with another stick until his legs were blue and bleeding. The next day he was unable to stand up and when Terence came home from school he found his brother locked in a cubbyhole in the kitchen. His feet were by now in a terrible condition and Gough hit him to try to make him stop crying. Dennis complained that his back hurt. Gough beat him <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> again the following morning; he died in the afternoon.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Rollins, in {{his journal}} {{collection}} Get in the Van, notes that Pettibon's artwork became synonymous with Black Flag and that before Rollins joined the band he would collect photocopies of their flyers that had circulated from California to Washington, D.C. The album cover for Nervous Breakdown had a particularly strong impact on Rollins: [...] "The record's cover art said it all. A man {{with his back to}} the wall baring his fists. In front of him another man fending him off with a chair. I felt like the guy <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists</b> up every day of my life." [...] Another image which drew considerable attention was the artwork created for the [...] "Police Story" [...] single, showing a police officer being held with a gun in his mouth with the speech blurb [...] "Make me come, faggot!" [...] The image was plastered on flyers all around Los Angeles and added to the police pressure on the band. Pettibon later remarked that [...] "my values are relativistic, and I'll give a cop the benefit of the doubt. If that's me with my gat – my gat's larger than the one depicted – we can have a discussion, and he can answer me just as well with my [...]357 barrel in his mouth, or on his cheek, or on his adenoids, or down his throat. I'll listen to his whimpering cries." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{is widely}} hailed {{as one of}} the most {{influential}} pianists in the history of rock and roll. [...] In an often quoted tribute, Elvis Presley once said that if he could play the piano like Lewis he would quit singing. [...] Lewis's pivotal role in popularizing the piano in rock and roll is indisputable. [...] Up until his arrival, the music had been primarily associated with guitars, but his early Sun recordings and television appearances pushed the instrument to the forefront. [...] Lewis was also an incendiary showman who often played <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fists,</b> elbows, feet, and backside, sometimes climbing on top of the piano during gigs and even apocryphally setting it on fire. [...] Like Chuck Berry's guitar playing, Lewis's piano style has become synonymous with rock and roll, having influenced generations of piano players. [...] In a 2013 interview with Leah Harper, Elton John recalls that up until [...] "Great Balls of Fire," [...] "the piano playing that I had heard had been more sedate. [...] My dad collected George Shearing records, but this was the first time I heard someone beat the shit out of a piano. When I saw Little Richard at the Harrow Granada, he played it standing up, but Jerry Lee Lewis actually jumped on the piano! This was astonishing to me, that people could do that. Those records had such a huge effect on me, and they were just so great. I learned to play like that." [...] Lewis is primarily known for his [...] "boogie woogie" [...] style, which is characterized by a regular left hand bass figure and dancing beat, but his command of the instrument and highly individualistic style set him apart. [...] Appearing on Memphis Sounds with George Klein in 2011, Lewis credited his older piano-playing cousin Carl McVoy as being a crucial influence, stating, [...] "He was a great piano player, a great singer, and a nice looking man, carried himself real well. [...] I miss Carl very much." [...] Lewis also cited Moon Mullican as a source of inspiration. [...] Although almost entirely self-taught, Lewis conceded to biographer Rich Bragg in 2014 that Paul Whitehead, a blind pianist from Meadville, Mississippi, was another key influence on him in his earliest days playing clubs, confiding, [...] "Paul Whitehead done a lot. [...] His lesson was worth a billion dollars to me...He taught me. [...] I'd sit beside him, and say, 'Mr. Paul, can you show me exactly how you do that?' [...] Mr. Paul was good to me." ...|$|E
