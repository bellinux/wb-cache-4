5|$|Adult {{pelicans}} rely on visual {{displays and}} behaviour to communicate, particularly using their wings and bills. Agonistic behaviour consists of thrusting and snapping at opponents with their bills, or lifting and waving their wings in a threatening manner. Adult pelicans grunt <b>when</b> <b>at</b> the colony, but are generally silent elsewhere or outside breeding season. Conversely, colonies are noisy as chicks vocalise extensively.|$|E

A naval signal light demanded their identification.|$|E
5|$|Following the Caliph's instructions, Yazid {{proceeded}} to Caesarea, {{and once again}} laid siege to the port city.

Caesarea, however, could not be taken until 640, <b>when</b> <b>at</b> last, the garrison surrendered to Muawiyah I, then a governor of Syria. With an army of 17,000 men, Abu Ubaidah and Khalid set off from Jerusalem to conquer all of northern Syria. This ended with the conquest of Antioch in late 637. In 639, the Muslims invaded and conquered Egypt.|$|E

Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the Battle of Jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes, defeating him in the Battle of Gabai. After the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace.|$|E

5|$|The second version, with blue-green filters {{over the}} projectors, was trialled {{on board the}} {{corvette}} HMCS Chambly in May 1941.

5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. <b>When</b> <b>at</b> rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E

All the alkylamino derivatives showed the highest fluorescence intensity in polar protic solvents; thus 2 -N-methylaminopyrimidine (highest fluorescence intensity <b>at</b> 377 nm <b>when</b> excited <b>at</b> 282 nm) and 2 -N-ethylaminopyrimidine (highest fluorescence intensity <b>at</b> 375 nm, <b>when</b> excited <b>at</b> 286 nm) showed the highest fluorescence in methanol.
