30|$|The same radiosynthesis was {{explored}} using {{solid phase}} extraction (SPE) cartridge after semi-prep HPLC purification of the crude reaction mixture to skip evaporation of the mobile phase at high temperature (70 – 80 [*]°C) to avoid radiolysis. The HPLC collected product fraction was diluted with 50 [*]mL {{of water and}} loaded on a SEP-PAK-C 18 <b>cartridge</b> (<b>Waters).</b> The SEP-PAK-C 18 cartridge was pre-conditioned with 10 [*]mL of EtOH (99.9 %) and 10 [*]mL of water prior to use. The trapped product, ([11 C]AZ 12204657), in the SEP-PAK-C 18 cartridge was washed with water (10 [*]mL) and eluted with EtOH (1 [*]mL) in to PBS (9 [*]mL). When using this method, no sodium-l-ascorbate needed to be added in the HPLC mobile phase, since no radiolysis was observed during SPE isolation.|$|R
