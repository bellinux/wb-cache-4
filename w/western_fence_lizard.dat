Fewer wildlife species tend {{to be found in}} these habitats, because of their higher elevation and lower complexity. Species likely to be found include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, hermit thrush, and northern goshawk.

40|$|Summary. The {{effect of}} malarial {{parasitism}} {{on the ability}} of male <b>western</b> <b>fence</b> <b>lizards,</b> Sceloporus occidentalis, to compete for access to females was assessed experimentally. Pairs of male lizards, one infected with the malarial para-site, Plasmodium mexicanum, and the other not infected, were matched by size and color and placed in large semina-tural outdoor enclosures along with an adult female lizard. Infected males displayed to females and to other males less often than did noninfected male lizards. Noninfected lizards were dominant in social interactions more often than malar-ious animals, based on duration and intensity of agonistic encounters toward the other male, and time spent with the female. Thus, malarial infection hinders the ability of male <b>fence</b> <b>lizards</b> to compete for mates...|$|R

50|$|The northwestern <b>fence</b> <b>lizard</b> is {{a lesser}} known {{creature}} threatened by mining expansion. (Preserve Our Islands). The lizards themselves {{are far from}} endangered, even though South Maury Island {{is one of their}} only habitats in the Puget Sound area. However, removing these lizards from South Maury Island could be detrimental. The full effects of their absence on the island are unknown, but it is speculated that the insect populations that they feed on could rise without their natural predator, the effects of which could be anywhere from being a nuisance to destroying local flora. Also, <b>Western</b> <b>Fence</b> <b>lizards</b> are thought to diminish the danger of Lyme disease because when the ticks feed on the lizards, the Lyme disease bacteria is killed.|$|R
40|$|In {{northern}} California, <b>western</b> <b>fence</b> <b>lizards,</b> Sceloporus occidentalis, {{are frequently}} parasitized by Plasmodium mexicanum, which causes malaria. Animals with this naturally occurring malarial infection are anemic; immature erythrocytes in peripheral blood become abundant (1 to 30 percent), and blood hemoglobin concentration decreases 25 percent. Maximal oxygen consumption decreases 15 percent and aerobic scope drops 29 percent in infected lizards; both correlate with blood hemoglobin concentration. Running stamina, but not burst running speed, is reduced in malarious lizards. There is a hierarchical relation between infection with malaria and effects on hematology, physiological function, and behavioral capacity. The {{results suggest that}} malarial infection may have significant effects on the ecology of lizard hosts...|$|R
40|$|Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS 222) {{injected}} into the intracoelomic cavity of reptiles was evaluated as a chemical euthanasia method. Three <b>western</b> <b>fence</b> <b>lizards,</b> 2 desert iguanas, 4 garter snakes, and 6 geckos were euthanized by intracoelomic injection of 250 to 500 mg/kg of 0. 7 % to 1 % sodium-bicarbonate–buffered MS 222 solution followed by intracoelomic injection of 0. 1 to 1. 0 ml unbuffered 50 % (v/v) MS 222 solution. A simple 2 -stage protocol for euthanasia of reptiles by using MS 222 is outlined. In addition, the conditions for safe use of MS 222 are discussed.

They are brown to black in color (the brown may be sandy or greenish) and have black stripes on their backs, but their most {{distinguishing}} characteristic is their bright blue bellies. The ventral sides of the limbs are yellow. These lizards also have blue patches on their throats. This bright coloration is faint or absent in both females and juveniles. In some populations the males also display iridescent, bright turquoise blue spots on the dorsal surface. The scales of S. occidentalis are sharply keeled, and between the interparietal and rear of thighs, there are 35-57 scales.|$|R
40|$|Question: What is {{the basis}} for {{geographic}} variation in microhabitat use in <b>fence</b> <b>lizards?</b> Hypothesis: Population differences in microhabitat use reflect behavioural plasticity rather than genetic or experiential differences. Organisms: <b>Western</b> <b>fence</b> <b>lizards</b> (Sceloporus occidentalis). Field site: Three sites (desert, valley, and mountain) in southern California, USA. Methods: We compared habitat use by free-ranging lizards in three field populations. We also collected lizards from these three populations and studied their microhabitat use in experimental enclosures at a single field site. Results: In the wild, lizards chose higher and shadier perches at the hottest (desert) site, lower and sunnier perches at the coolest (mountain) site, and intermediate perches at the thermally intermediate valley site. However, lizards collected from the three source populations did not differ in microhabitat use in experimental enclosures at a common field site, supporting our hypothesis. Microhabitat choice is an important thermoregulatory mechanism in this species...|$|R
40|$|Perch height {{selection}} was studied in juvenile <b>western</b> <b>fence</b> <b>lizards</b> (Sceloporus occidentalis) and sagebrush lizards (Sceloporus graciosus) {{in the field}} and in the laboratory. In nature juvenile S. occidentalis were more arboreal than were juvenile S. graciosus. In laboratory experiments with lab-reared 3 - 4 wk old lizards, S. occidentalis perched off the ground more frequently. Differences between these two species in habitat preference are inferred to be at least partly innate, and emerge at an early age. Within each species, juveniles from different field populations differed in habitat use in the wild: lizards were more terrestrial at higher elevations. However, lab-reared juveniles from different populations of each species did not differ in laboratory tests of perch selection. In S. occidentalis there was evidence of individual variation in perch selection in the laboratory, but no among-family variation was detected...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal {{variability}} in intensities of ectoparasites of <b>western</b> <b>fence</b> <b>lizards</b> (Sceloporus occidentalis) was quantified in spring, summer, and autumn 2008. Lizards were suspended over pans {{of water in}} the laboratory to enumerate replete western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus) and mites. Intensity of ectoparasites was greatest in spring. On average, mites comprised the greatest proportion of ectoparasites, followed by larval and nymphal ticks, respectively. Mites were on lizards year-round. Overall intensity of ticks was greatest in spring, but low during summer and autumn. Males were more heavily parasitized by ticks than females in spring, whereas females had greater intensities of mites in autumn. There was a slight, positive relationship between size of lizard and intensity of ticks, but not with intensity of mites. We report greater intensities of ectoparasites on S. occidentalis than several other studies, which may be due to differences in habitats and methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —Flight {{initiation}} distance (FID) is {{the distance}} to which a predator is permitted to approach before the prey initiates flight behavior. This can be influenced by factors including predator density and distance to cover. We measured flight initiation distances in two populations of <b>Western</b> <b>fence</b> <b>lizards</b> (Sceloporus occidentalis), one in a rural and one in an urban environment. Lizards at the rural site initiated flight at significantly longer distances than those at the urban site. These results support the prediction that lizard behavior can be influenced by differences in human exposure and predator recognition in their environments. Lizards develop tolerance to humans in urban areas {{in order to maximize}} fitness by reserving energy and utilizing resources for longer periods of time. The findings from this study demonstrate that researchers should be aware of differences in human exposure between populations of study animals and should choose study sites appropriately when designing FID studies...|$|R
