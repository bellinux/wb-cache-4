While she was Senior Assistant Mistress, she began studying phonetics in the evenings part-time at the University College Phonetics Department in order to improve her teaching of French pronunciation. In 1917, Armstrong received a Diploma with Distinction in French Phonetics; she got a Diploma with Distinction in English phonetics the following year.|$|E
5|$|Eta Hydri is {{the other}} optical double, {{composed}} of Eta1 and Eta2. Eta1 is a blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B9V that was suspected of being variable, and is located just over 700 light-years away. Eta2 has a magnitude of 4.7 and is a yellow giant star of spectral type G8.5III around 218 light-years distant, which has evolved off the main sequence and is expanding and cooling on its <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>becoming</b> a red giant. Calculations of its mass indicate it was most likely a white A-type main sequence star {{for most of its}} existence, around twice the mass of our Sun. A planet, Eta2 Hydri b, greater than 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter was discovered in 2005, orbiting around Eta2 every 711 days at a distance of 1.93 astronomical units (AU).|$|E

5|$|Most of Rainilaiarivony's {{children}} {{failed to}} achieve their full potential. One son, Rafozehana, died young of delirium tremens, and sons Ratsimandresy and Ralaiarivony both met violent ends while still in their youth. Randravalahy, to whom Rainilaiarivony later ascribed the name Radilifera, was sent to France to study but returned before earning his diploma and faded into obscurity among the upper classes of Imerina. Ramangalahy studied medicine and was on his <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>becoming</b> a successful doctor, but died of illness in his twenties. Three brothers turned to crime: Rajoelina, who violated the laws of his country to enrich himself by selling contraband gold to an English company; Penoelina, who studied in England before health issues recalled him to Madagascar, {{where he and his}} friends engaged in sexual assault and theft; and Ramariavelo (Mariavelo), who organized a group of bandits to rob the houses of common citizens. One of Rainilaiarivony's daughters died in her twenties following a self-induced abortion, and the rest married and lived quiet lives out of public view.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant envisaged Canberra one day {{becoming}} a university town like Oxford or Cambridge. A {{threat to the}} future of the University arose in the wake of the 1949 election, when the Liberal Party of Australia led by Robert Menzies won. Many Liberals were opposed to the University, which they saw as an extravagance. Menzies defended it, but in 1954 he announced that it had entered a period of consolidation, with a funding ceiling, ending the possibility of successful competition with universities in Europe and North America. A further blow came in 1959, when the Menzies government amalgamated it with the Canberra University College. Henceforth, it would no longer be a research university, but a regular one, with responsibility for teaching undergraduates. Nonetheless, parts of the university stayed committed to the old mission, and the ANU remained a university where research is central to its activities. Despite the setbacks, by 2014 the vision of Canberra as a university town would be well on its <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>becoming</b> a reality.|$|E

5|$|The constellation's two {{brightest}} stars—Alpha and Epsilon Antliae—shine with {{a reddish}} tinge. Alpha is an orange giant of spectral type K4III {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. It is located 370 ± 20 light-years away from Earth. Estimated to be shining with around 480 to 555 times the luminosity of the Sun, it is most likely an ageing star that is brightening and on its <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>becoming</b> a Mira variable star, having converted all its core fuel into carbon. Located 710 ± 40 light-years from Earth, Epsilon Antliae is an evolved orange giant star of spectral type K3 IIIa, that has swollen to have a diameter about 69 {{times that of the}} Sun, and a luminosity of around 1279 Suns. It is slightly variable. At the other end of Antlia, Iota Antliae is likewise an orange giant of spectral type K1 III.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1950s, with {{economic}} {{recovery from the}} Second World War, production of diesel locomotives had begun in many countries and the diesel locomotive was on its <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>becoming</b> the dominant type of locomotive. It offered greater flexibility and performance than the steam locomotive, as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs, other than where electric traction was in use due to policy decisions. Currently, almost all diesel locomotives are diesel–electric, although the diesel–hydraulic type was widely used between the 1950s and 1970s.|$|E

25|$|After a cloud, for instance, {{has started}} its <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>becoming</b> a {{lightning}} generator, atmospheric water vapor {{acts as a}} substance (or insulator) that decreases {{the ability of the}} cloud to discharge its electrical energy. Over a certain amount of time, if the cloud continues to generate and store more static electricity, the barrier that was created by the atmospheric water vapor will ultimately break down from the stored electrical potential energy. This energy will be released to a locally, oppositely charged region in the form of lightning. The strength of each discharge {{is directly related to the}} atmospheric permittivity, capacitance, and the source's charge generating ability.|$|E

Similar projects followed. The densely commercial Coast Street was refurbished with retro paving stones and custom curbs. Two cement archways were constructed over the approach to the Turnaround and behind the Visual Arts Center.|$|E

Despite this setback, he never missed playing a single test or one-day game on fitness grounds (save for his disciplinary ouster in the 3rd test at Calcutta during the 1984/85 series against England). Though he lost some of his bite, he remained an effective bowler for another ten years and became the second bowler ever to take 400 wickets in Test cricket in 1991–92 when he took Mark Taylor's wicket in a series versus Australia in Australia.

25|$|While many saw {{his work}} as fanciful or even blasphemous (because Hebrew was the holy {{language}} of the Torah and therefore some thought {{that it should not}} be used to discuss everyday matters), many soon understood the need for a common language amongst Jews of the British Mandate who {{at the turn of the}} 20th century were arriving in large numbers from diverse countries and speaking different languages. A Committee of the Hebrew Language was established. After the establishment of Israel, it became the Academy of the Hebrew Language. The results of Ben-Yehuda's lexicographical work were published in a dictionary (The Complete Dictionary of Ancient and Modern Hebrew). The seeds of Ben-Yehuda's work fell on fertile ground, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Hebrew was well on its <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>becoming</b> the main language of the Jewish population of both Ottoman and British Palestine.
