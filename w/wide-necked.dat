50|$|Ecteinascidia turbinata is {{a colonial}} sea squirt. The {{individual}} zooids can grow to {{a height of}} 2.5 cm and are shaped like <b>wide-necked</b> bottles. They are connected by a stolon at the base through which blood circulates between the zooids and which serves to attach the colony to the substrate. The walls of the zooids are known as tunics and are strengthened with cellulose, which is unusual for an animal. They {{are connected to the}} outside water by siphons. The walls of the tunic are translucent and the pharyngeal basket can be seen through them. The siphon margins are orange because of the deposition of carotenoids there. This is a warning colour, for E. turbinata is distasteful, and deters predators. Colonies can reach a width of 14 cm.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} uses detachable coils made of platinum {{that are}} {{inserted into the}} aneurysm using the microcatheter. A variety of coils are available, including Guglielmi Detachable Coils (GDC) which are platinum, Matrix coils which are coated with a biopolymer, and hydrogel coated coils. Coils are also available {{in a variety of}} diameters, lengths, and cross sections. A coil is first inserted along the aneurysm wall to create a frame, with the core then being filled with more coils. A series of progressively smaller coils may also be used. Success is determined by injecting a contrast dye into parent artery and qualitatively determining if dye is flowing into the aneurysm space during fluoroscopy. If no flow is observed, the procedure is considered completed. In the case of <b>wide-necked</b> aneurysms a stent may be used.|$|E

40|$|Background: A <b>wide-necked</b> {{aneurysm}} {{is defined}} as the one with a neck greater than 4 mm in diameter. Embolisation of <b>wide-necked</b> aneurysms is a great challenge for neuroradiologists. To overcome possible complications of endovascular treatment of this type of aneurysms, methods like intracranial stents, balloon remodelling, the double microcatheter and the microcatheter protective technique have been developed. Case Report: We report a case of embolisation of a 63 -year-old woman with a <b>wide-necked</b> aneurysm using the double microcatheter technique. Introduction of the second microcatheter into the aneurysm allowed for crossing two coils and prevented protrusion into the parent vessel, which resulted in successful treatment without postprocedural complications. Both postembolic and follow-up angiography showed complete exclusion of the aneurysm. Conclusions: The double microcatheter technique, owing to creation of a stable coil frame across the neck o...|$|E
40|$|Context: Stent-assisted coiling of <b>wide-necked</b> {{and complex}} {{intracranial}} aneurysms {{is an effective}} and feasible treatment option. The self-expanding, fully retrievable Solitaire AB (eV 3, Irvine, CA, USA) stent is the latest neurovascular remodeling device available. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there are no studies of Solitaire AB-assisted coiling of <b>wide-necked</b> intracranial aneurysms from India. Aim: Solitaire AB-assisted coiling of <b>wide-necked</b> intracranial aneurysms. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in a tertiary care center with a dedicated Interventional Neurology division from 2009 to 2013. Consecutive patients with <b>wide-necked</b> aneurysms who underwent coiling assisted by the Solitaire AB stent were enrolled in the study. Axium 3 D and Helix (eV 3, Irvine, CA, USA) platinum coils were used to densely pack the aneurysm sac after deploying the stent across the neck. All patients were pretreated with antiplatelets according to protocol. Subsequently, dual antiplatelets were given for 6 months followed by continued aspirin. Outcome was assessed at 3 months using the modified Rankin Scale. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 17. 0 software. Results: A total of 16 patients underwent stent-assisted coiling. The most common site was the internal carotid artery (nine patients), median aneurysm size was 7 mm and median neck diameter was 5 mm. Thirteen patients presented with ruptured aneurysms. We achieved complete occlusion in all patients with no major complications. Thirteen patients were followed up, all have an mRS score of zero or one. Conclusion: We conclude that for <b>wide-necked</b> aneurysms, stent-assisted coiling using the Solitaire AB is a safe and effective treatment option...|$|E
40|$|Endovascular {{treatment}} of intracranial aneurysms by coiling {{has become an}} accepted alternative to surgical clipping 1. In cases of <b>wide-necked</b> and sidewall aneurysms, selective embolization is difficult {{because of the risk}} of coil protrusion into the parent vessel. The use of three-dimensional coils, stents 2, and balloon remodeling have all aided the attempt to adequately manage such lesions. However, compared with sidewall aneurysms, bifurcation aneurysms are more challenging from an endovascular standpoint. Because of their specific anatomy and hemodynamics, the tendency to recur and rerupture is higher. Several authors have reported successful {{treatment of}} these complex and <b>wide-necked</b> bifurcation aneurysms by using Y-configured dual stent-assisted coil embolization 3, 4, the double microcatheter technique 5, a more compliant balloon remodeling technique 6, the TriSpan neck-bridge device 7, or the waffle cone technique 8. We describe two cases of <b>wide-necked</b> bifurcation aneurysms in which the waffle cone technique was used for coil embolization. The waffle cone technique was first described in 2006; however, the small number of published cases and the lack of follow-up prevent one from assessing this technique's durability and the probability of recanalization. We report the cases of two patients harboring unruptured <b>wide-necked</b> bifurcation aneurysms that were treated and followed-up for six months...|$|E
40|$|The Solitaire AB stent {{is one of}} many {{assistant}} stents {{used for}} treating <b>wide-necked</b> cerebral aneurysm, and has been used since 2003. However, large sample studies on its safety and effectiveness are lacking. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the Solitaire AB stent in the coil embolization of <b>wide-necked</b> cerebral aneurysms. Retrospective review of the clinical and image data of 116 patients with <b>wide-necked</b> cerebral aneurysms who had been enrolled at six interventional neuroradiology centers from February 2010 to February 2014 and had been treated by coil embolization; in total, 120 Solitaire AB stents were used. The degree of aneurysm occlusion was examined using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) immediately after the procedure and during follow-up, and was graded using the modified Raymond classification. We also observed complications to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this therapy. The 120 Solitaire AB stents (4 mm × 15 mm, four stents; 4 mm × 20 mm, 16 stents; 6 mm × 20 mm, 36 stents; 6 mm × 30 mm, 64 stents) were inserted to treat 120 <b>wide-necked</b> cerebral aneurysms. All stents were inserted successfully. DSA immediately post-surgery revealed 55 cases of complete occlusion, 59 cases of neck remnant, and six cases of aneurysm remnant. Perioperatively, there were four cases of hemorrhage and four cases of stent thrombosis. The follow-up spanned 3 - 37 months; of 92 patients examined by DSA at the 6 -month follow up, 12 had disease recurrence. The Solitaire AB stent is effective with a good technical success rate and short-term effect for assisting coil embolization of <b>wide-necked</b> cerebral aneurysms...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Stent-assisted coiling (SAC) is an {{alternative}} to surgical clipping {{for the treatment of}} <b>wide-necked</b> intracranial aneurysms (IA). However, little information is available concerning the long-term results of this treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} report the long-term clinical and anatomical findings in 32 patients with 34 <b>wide-necked</b> IA treated by SAC. METHODS: A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database identified all patients followed up for <b>wide-necked</b> IA treated by SAC. The clinical charts, procedural data, and angiographic results were reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with 34 IA were identified including 25 asymptomatic patients, four with cranial nerve palsies, two with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, and one with transient ischemic attacks. Mean aneurysm size was 10. 2 mm (range 3. 5 to 26 mm). Embolization was successful in all patients and no procedure-related neurological morbidity or mortality was observed. Immediate anatomical results included nine complete occlusions (26. 5 %), two neck remnants (6 %), and 23 incomplete occlusions (67. 5 %). Mean imaging follow-up of 20 months showed 18 further thrombosis (53 %) and 16 stable results (47 %). Finally, 27 aneurysms were completely occluded (79 %), three had a neck remnant (9 %), and four were incompletely occluded (12 %). Asymptomatic and nonsignificant in-stent stenosis occurred in seven patients (22 %). CONCLUSIONS: SAC is safe and effective for the treatment of <b>wide-necked</b> IA. Despite unsatisfying immediate aneurysm occlusion, the adjunctive effect of the stent is stabilizing or significantly improving long-term anatomical results.

40|$|Summary: We {{describe}} a remodeling technique {{in which two}} compliant balloon catheters were used to treat large, <b>wide-necked</b> bifurcation aneurysms distal to the circle of Willis in two patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Al-though vasospasm and interaction between the constrained catheters in the small distal arteries added to the complex-ity of the procedure, placement of a balloon catheter in each side branch prevented coil encroachment and enabled embolization of these aneurysms. Coiling of <b>wide-necked</b> aneurysms at vascular bi-furcations remains as a fundamental problem in in-terventional neuroradiology (1).

40|$|Summary: <b>Wide-necked</b> {{bifurcation}} aneurysms {{remain a}} formidable {{challenge to the}} neuroendovascular surgeon.

40|$|Renal artery {{aneurysm}} {{is a rare}} disorder with a high {{mortality rate}} {{in the event of}} rupture, the most frequent complication, which can also occur in lesions smaller than those indicated for treatment by current criteria. Surgery is still the first-line treatment, although a growing trend toward endovascular management of visceral artery aneurysms has emerged because of the high efficacy and low invasiveness that has been demonstrated by several authors. Treatment of <b>wide-necked</b> aneurysms and, depending on location, those at renal artery bifurcations or distal branches is more complex and may require invasive surgical techniques, such as bench surgery. We describe the successful use of a new neurointerventional coil to treat an enlarging <b>wide-necked</b> segmental-branch renal aneurysm in an elderly woman who was not a candidate for surgery because of several comorbidities. The technique described allowed safe, successful treatment of a <b>wide-necked</b> aneurysm in an unfavorable vascular territory, reducing the risk of downstream artery embolization and consequent parenchymal damage and decreased renal function.
