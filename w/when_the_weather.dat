5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring with laughter as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|The reserve's {{location}} {{means that}} migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities, including a western sandpiper in 2012, a displaying great snipe in 2011, a trumpeter finch in 2010 and a collared pratincole in 2009. In {{order to maintain}} a good habitat, parts of the reed bed are cut and sold for thatch each year to establish a mosaic of plants of different ages.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{story about}} an aloviti man, who is {{described}} as unusually tall, thin, bony-faced, and with a long beard and moustache. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> was nice, he worked and behaved like the other people in his village, {{but as soon as the}} dark clouds covered the sky, he used to close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone and in a trance as long as the bad weather and thunder lasted. Historical persons believed to be aloviti men are Stefan Nemanja, and Stefan Dečanski.|$|E

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> improved, work {{commenced}} outside. The cap circle {{was mostly}} constructed {{before the first}} work-in commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first work-in, the fantail posts and braces were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time.|$|E
5|$|Ale can be {{defeated}} by zmajeviti men, {{who have a}} human mother, but a dragon father. They look like ordinary people except for little wings beneath their armpits; such men are always born at night after a twelve-month term. Much like a zduhać, a zmajeviti man lives like everybody else <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> is nice, but when an ala leads threatening clouds into sight, he falls into a trance and his spirit {{comes out of his}} body and flies up to the clouds to fight with the ala, just like a dragon would do. A story from Banat, which was held as true until the 1950s, says that before World War I, an exhausted ala {{in the form of a}} giant snake fell from the clouds onto a road. The explanation of the event was that the ala was defeated in her fight with a zmajeviti man; people gave her milk to help her recover.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} blue colour, the mythical creatures {{look much like}} humans, and {{are about the same}} size. They have the power to create storms, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> is fine they float {{sleeping}} on or just {{below the surface of the}} water. The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea, twisting and diving as porpoises do. They are able to speak, and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse. If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it.|$|E
50|$|The first {{installment}} of <b>The</b> <b>Weathering</b> Continent {{was published in}} Monthly Dragon Magazine in April 1988, {{with a total of}} 28 collected novels released from November 1990 to April 2006. An anime feature film based on the novels was also released theatrically in Japan on July 18, 1992. It is available in the United States courtesy of Media Blasters. During the novels' original run, several side stories were published. A short, sequel series also followed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> original <b>The</b> <b>Weathering</b> Continent ended.|$|R

5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E
5|$|Borchgrevink was not {{a trained}} scientist, and his {{incompetence}} with equipment and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern {{to some of the}} party. However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the hut <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a sauna in the snowdrifts alongside the hut. A concert was arranged, including lantern slides, songs and readings. During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk set fire to the hut and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fire fumes as they slept.|$|E
5|$|Italy began {{operations}} in the Mediterranean, initiating a siege of Malta in June, conquering British Somaliland in August, and making an incursion into British-held Egypt in September 1940. In October 1940, Italy started the Greco-Italian War because of Mussolini's jealousy of Hitler's success but within days was repulsed with few territorial gains and a stalemate soon occurred. The United Kingdom responded to Greek requests for assistance by sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece. Hitler decided that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> improved he would take action against Greece to assist the Italians and prevent the British from gaining {{a foothold in the}} Balkans, to strike against the British naval dominance of the Mediterranean, and to secure his hold on Romanian oil.|$|E
50|$|Owing to its {{location}} in the valley of River Benue, Makurdi experiences warm temperatures most of the year. The period from November to January, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> harmattan <b>weather</b> is experienced is, however, relatively cool.|$|R

50|$|JG 1 {{was rushed}} from Ypres to Cambrai by 23 November 1917, {{following}} {{the launch of}} the British offensive, and did much to stabilise the air war over <b>the</b> battlefield <b>when</b> <b>the</b> bad <b>weather</b> permitted.|$|R
5|$|Most ants are univoltine, {{producing}} {{a new generation}} each year. During the species-specific breeding period, new reproductives, females, and winged males leave the colony in {{what is called a}} nuptial flight. The nuptial flight usually takes place in the late spring or early summer <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> is hot and humid. Heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests. Males typically take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males, storing the sperm in their spermathecae.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 2015 the World Championships {{were moved}} to their new home, one of the cycle track bridges over the river Windrush in Langel Common, near to the Cogges Manor Farm Museum in Witney, Oxfordshire. The new {{location}} still retains a rural atmosphere while being {{only a few minutes}} walk from Witney town centre with its convenient public transport links to Oxford. Car Parking is also much closer than at the original venue, which was a factor that influenced the choice of venue. As this was the first year at the new location, the organizers decided not to hold the 2015 team games.. However, the team games were restored in 2016. The move to the new venue has also allowed the event to move to June <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> is likely to be better.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{competed in}} the 1899 Open Championship at Royal St George's Golf Club located in Sandwich, England. He played as an amateur, scored 89 and 90 and missed the cut by 8 strokes. By 1902 he had become the {{professional}} at the Gog Magog Golf Club near Cambridge. In a friendly match against Tom Vardon at Sandwich on 27 May 1903, Strong made a hole-in-one (likely wind assisted) on a par 4 hole. He entered the 1903 Open Championship held at Prestwick Golf Club, South Ayrshire, Scotland, but failed to advance past the half-way cut. In the 1904 Open Championship, again held on his home course at Sandwich, Strong opened with a first round 93—in windy and cold conditions—but could only improve to 88 in round two <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> improved. He ended up missing the cut, by 13 strokes, which came at 168.|$|E
60|$|Perronel scolded and exhorted him, {{and told}} him he would be {{stronger}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> hot <b>weather</b> was over, but Ambrose only smiled, and Stephen saw a change in him, even in this fortnight, which justified his forebodings.|$|R
