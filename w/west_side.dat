5|$|The park {{is built}} on the disused {{southern}} viaduct section of a New York Central Railroad line called the <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Line. Originating in the Lower <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> of Manhattan, the park runs from Gansevoort Street – three blocks below 14th Street – in the Meatpacking District, through Chelsea, to {{the northern edge of}} the <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Yard on 34th Street near the Javits Center. Formerly, the <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Line went as far south as a railroad terminal at Spring Street, just north of Canal Street. However, most of the southern section was demolished in 1960, with another small portion being demolished in 1991.|$|E

5|$|As the SAS {{operation}} concluded, the Chinooks ferried {{prisoners and}} bodies from Gberi Bana to the Jordanian battalion of UNAMSIL. From there, the bodies would {{be identified and}} buried, and those prisoners identified as <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Boys would be {{handed over to the}} Sierra Leonean Police. Operation Barras also freed 22 Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held captive by the <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Boys—the men were used as servants and put through crude military training by the <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Boys, possibly with the intention of forcing them to fight in the future, while the women were used as sex slaves. Planners had been concerned that <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Boys might try to conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to the Jordanian peacekeepers' base to be identified. A 23rd civilian was caught in the crossfire and killed during the assault.|$|E

5|$|It {{was again}} {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

After a proposal for the <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Stadium, an Olympic stadium to be located above the nearby <b>West</b> <b>Side</b> Yard, was rejected in 2005, New York City quickly lost their Olympic bid.|$|E
