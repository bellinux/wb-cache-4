25|$|I kept {{my money}} in a 'grouch bag'. This was a small chamois bag that actors used to wear around their neck to keep other hungry actors from {{pinching}} their dough. Naturally, you're going to think that's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my name from. But that's not so. Grouch bags were worn on manly chests long {{before there was a}} Groucho.|$|E
25|$|I {{preferred}} {{to open the}} batting or bat in the top order somewhere. But I probably wasn't good enough to bat at No. 3 or No. 4, which is why I was where I was – down at the bottom. It just depended if we had couple of good openers so I wasn't {{going to get a}} go there and at No. 3 or No. 4 or even at 5, 6, so 7 is <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a go in the international side.|$|E
500|$|However, Piłsudski {{believed}} that {{as head of}} state he must be above partisan politics. The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as [...] "Comrade" [...] ("Towarzysz") and asked his support for their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: [...] "Comrades, I took the red streetcar of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> off. You may keep on to the final stop if you wish, but from now on let's address each other as 'Mister' !" [...] He declined to support any one party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government. He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding his nickname, Hatton said, [...] "I've {{always been}} a fan of Tommy Hearns, and {{everybody}} associates that that's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it from, but everybody's a Tommy Hearns fan. I got the nickname the first day I walked in the gym. I was 10 years old and put a pair of gloves on and started walloping the bag, and my amateur coach said, [...] "Look at him, look how evil he is. He's a little Hitman." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meier {{explained}} {{the story behind}} [...] "Domingo", saying, [...] "Domingo is a false preacher who, with a few sentences, is trying to impress the people there, and then the choir chants 'Domingo, you showed us just nothing like no one before', it means 'you didn't show us anything either, it's all nonsense what you said, but somehow you did it right'. Domingo de Santa Clara actually existed. There was an Abraham a Sancta Clara, he was some religious fanatic. I don't know <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it from, but the name pleased me very much: Abraham a Sancta Clara. And since the name Domingo pleases me as well, I called him Domingo." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{father was}} a river boat captain and, by 1870, was a {{fertilizer}} manufacturer. The elder Fish died in 1875 at the Sixth Street Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Washington, D.C. of a heart attack. The Congressional Cemetery records show that Randall died on October 16, 1875, and was buried on October 19, 1875, in grave R96/89. Fish's mother then put her son into Saint John's Orphanage in Washington, where he was frequently abused. He began to enjoy the physical pain that the beatings brought. Of his time at the orphanage, Fish remarked, [...] "I was there 'til I was nearly nine, and that's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> started wrong. We were unmercifully whipped. I saw boys doing many things {{they should not have}} done." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, Tempest's girlfriend entered Force in the Swedish rock talent contest Rock-SM. Competing against 4000 bands, {{they won}} the contest thanks to two songs, [...] "In the Future to Come" [...] and [...] "The King Will Return". The reward was a record deal with Hot Records. Tempest won the {{individual}} award for Best Lead Singer, and Norum won the award for Best Guitarist. Just before the contest, Force changed their name to Europe. Tempest {{came up with the}} name. [...] "After Deep Purple did Made in Japan, they did Made in Europe, which is maybe not as good as Made in Japan, but we listened to both of them. And that’s <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the name Europe from. It was really funny when I told the guys, John Leven and John Norum, about my idea of the name for the band that night [...]|$|E
2500|$|For 1999, Irvine was {{confident}} {{heading into the}} season, saying: [...] "After last year's results <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my best ever championship finish with 4th place overall, now, for this year, I want to do even better". His season {{got off to a}} good start: after 81 Grand Prix, Irvine scored his maiden Formula One victory at the season opening round in Australia, giving him the lead of the World Drivers' Championship for the first time. In the following race in Brazil an unscheduled pitstop, due to blocked radiators, cost Irvine a podium finish, and he ultimately finished fifth. Three weeks later in the San Marino Grand Prix, Irvine would miss out on another podium finish, after his car suffered an engine failure on lap 47 (of 62) while in a comfortable third place, losing him the lead of the Drivers' Championship to teammate Schumacher. Irvine finished second at Monaco, behind Schumacher, giving Ferrari its first one-two finish of the season, and first ever in the Principality. At the next round in Canada, Irvine set fastest lap (his career one and only) and survived a collision with McLaren driver David Coulthard {{on the way to a}} third-place finish.|$|E
2500|$|Drummer Tony Williams was {{an early}} influence. [...] "The first drummer I ever saw, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to feel the impact up close, was Tony Williams", Blackman said. [...] "When I was 16, Tony came to my local drum store with a bassist and did a [...] clinic that left a {{powerful}} impression on me. And that's what I thought drumming should be: drummers should {{have a lot of}} impact and a great sound, without being limited to a conventional role in the band—the drums should speak just as freely as anybody." [...] Blackman says that the way that Williams used all four limbs to attack the drums strongly influenced her. [...] "I just love and loved everything about Tony", says Blackman. [...] "To me, not only was he a master technician, a master drummer, the innovator of the age, but also, he was a sound innovator. He had so many things that elevated the sound and the level of skill required to play this kind of music." [...] But although Blackman is sometimes referred to as a disciple of Tony Williams, she follows her own path. [...] "On the one hand, it doesn't bother me at all to be associated and in line with a master of the instrument like that – Okay, I might not be where I want to be, but I'm on the right track", says Blackman. [...] "On the other hand, I don't plan on being a clone. What I'm doing is always looking to expound on something that he's done, or push the music in a different way".|$|E

2500|$|In 1974, he {{sold out}} the Pavilion Theatre {{in his home}} town. In 1975, the rapidity and extent of Connolly's {{breakthrough}} was used to secure him a booking on Britain's premier TV chat show, the BBC's Parkinson. Connolly {{made the most of}} the opportunity and, ignoring objections from his manager, told a bawdy joke about a man who had murdered his wife and buried her bottom-up so he'd have somewhere to park his bike. This ribald humour was unusually forthright on a primetime Saturday night on British television in the mid-1970s, and his appearance made a great impact. He became a good friend of the host, Michael Parkinson, and now holds the record for appearances on the programme, having been a guest on fifteen occasions. Referring to that debut appearance, he later said: [...] "That programme changed my entire life." [...] Parkinson, in the documentary Billy Connolly: Erect for 30 Years, stated that people still remember Connolly telling the punchline to the 'bike joke' three decades after that TV appearance. When asked about the material, Connolly stated, [...] "Yes, it was incredibly edgy for its time. My manager, on the way over, warned me not to do it, but it was a great joke and the interview was going so well, I thought, 'Oh, fuck that!!' I don't know <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the courage in those days, but Michael did put confidence in me." [...] Connolly's UK success spread to other English-speaking countries: Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. [...] However, his broad Scottish accent and British cultural references made success in the US improbable.|$|E
2500|$|He {{slowed down}} his {{feelings}} about the album after that saying [...] "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That {{was one of those}} instances <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in a zone, like, [...] "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.|$|E
60|$|That's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{my first}} shock. He wasn't there. I pleaded {{with them to}} think again, and they thought again, {{but it was no}} good. No Augustus Mannering-Phipps on the premises.|$|E

He asked me <b>where</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> it, and when I said that it was no business of his, but that it had been paid me by a French Huguenot gentleman, who had lately arrived, and for whom I had been doing some work; and as there are many of these Huguenots in London, he was satisfied, and changed it for me.|$|R
5000|$|McKee has not benefited financially to {{the extent}} he might have: [...] "I signed a {{contract}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> only <b>got</b> a one-off payment and no repeat fees, but I've done quite well {{from a number of}} other things and I'm still exhibiting paintings." [...] Unfortunately, according to Mr Benn's Little Book of Life, very little of McKee's original artwork created for the television episodes exists today, as most of it was thrown into a rubbish skip in the 1970s.|$|R

500|$|Later in June, Biden {{participated in}} another debate, this time {{featured}} on PBS and set at Howard University in Washington D.C.
