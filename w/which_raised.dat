5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, <b>which</b> <b>raised</b> the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the 1890s, the CCE struggled unsuccessfully to raise the capital it needed to fund the construction. Whilst it did so it continued to develop its route proposals. In 1899, parliamentary permission was obtained to modify the route so that the Euston branch was extended northwards to connect to the main route {{at the south end of}} Camden High Street. The section of the main route between the two ends of the loop was omitted. In 1900, the CCE was taken over by a consortium led by American financier Charles Yerkes <b>which</b> <b>raised</b> the necessary money.|$|E

5|$|To the east, the Washington, D.C. {{area was}} {{particularly}} affected, and considerable flooding {{was reported in}} the Virginias and Maryland. Much of the grounds of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD were flooded and the Midshipmen were put to work the next day cleaning up debris. New Jersey escaped major flooding as the high tide was low enough, but to the south in Chesapeake Bay, the majority of crab pots were destroyed.
