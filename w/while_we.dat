5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{with regard}} to punitive psychiatry, the nature of psychiatry is of such a sort that using psychiatrists against opponents of authorities is always tempting for the authorities, because it is seemingly possible not {{to take into account}} an opinion by the person who received a diagnosis. Therefore, the issue will always remain relevant. <b>While</b> <b>we</b> do not have government policy of using psychiatry for repression, psychiatrists and former psychiatric nomenklatura retained the same on-the-spot reflexes.|$|E
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>we</b> did {{not always}} {{see eye to eye}} on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the {{existence}} and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} <b>while</b> <b>we</b> were all enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E

5|$|The story {{takes place}} in Kolkata. As the credits roll, scenes from {{erstwhile}} Calcutta are displayed along with the narrator's (Amitabh Bachchan) introduction of the era. The narration focuses {{on the night of}} the marriage of Shekhar and Gayatri Tantiya, a rich industrialist's daughter. The audience is introduced to Naveen Roy as Shekhar's father <b>while</b> <b>we</b> see Shekhar grooming himself for the occasion. While he is doing so, images of Lalita calling him by his name flash through his mind. Downstairs, musical celebrations begin as Shekhar meets Vasundhara, a widow from his neighbourhood, who is thankful to her son-in-law, Girish (Sanjay Dutt), for supporting their family after the death of her husband, Gurcharan. Lalita, who is present there, playfully confronts Shekhar as to why he is being indifferent to her. Shekhar admonishes her for speaking so in spite of being married.|$|E
5|$|We give an acre for a cow or sheep willingly, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> shut our {{children}} and our chickens up in too limited spaces, and they suffer in consequence. Schools of the future must be provided with estates where the children will be surrounded with many natural and beautiful things. Part of the practical work was growing food for the school. In 1944 the daily two-course dinner, for staff and over 90 students, was mostly the school's farm's produce. After the war, from c.1948–55, the school received child migrants from Belgium, Greece and the United Kingdom. The school was known as Hagley State School until 1936, Hagley Farm School until 1976 and Hagley Farm Primary School since.|$|E

50|$|It {{all began}} in 1941 <b>while</b> <b>Wes</b> {{was working as}} a {{counselor}} at a YMCA Boy's Camp on the Chesapeake Bay.

50|$|Muir {{believes}} the film itself {{was part of}} another trend of the time. Horror films which were both postmodernist films and self-reflective.

25|$|It {{is clear}} to just about {{everyone}} but the die-hard neoconservatives within this administration that shifting our focus away from Osama bin Laden to Saddam Hussein was perhaps the biggest strategic blunder in our nation's history.

25|$|<b>While</b> <b>we</b> {{know about}} the types of {{cytokine}} patterns helper T cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided. Various {{evidence suggests that the}} type of APC presenting the antigen to the T cell has a major influence on its profile. Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, but our understanding is nowhere near complete.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposition}} {{was made}} by me that since our books were often referr'd to in our disquisitions upon the inquiries, it might be convenient {{for us to have}} them altogether where we met, that upon occasion they might be consulted; and by thus clubbing our books to a common library, we should, <b>while</b> <b>we</b> lik'd to keep them together, have each of us the advantage of using the books of all the other members, which would be nearly as beneficial as if each owned the whole.|$|E
25|$|Taqī al-Dīn {{tried to}} {{disprove}} the widely held belief that light is emitted by {{the eye and}} not the object that is being observed.
