5|$|According to Rajamouli, {{the film}} unit {{consulted}} a 3D {{video of the}} storyboard before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and re-recording procedures <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> simple greyscale animation. An Arri Alexa camera, a prime lens, and Scorpio and Strada cranes {{were used for the}} principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the macro photography. Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used GoPro cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.|$|E
5|$|Most {{parts of}} the {{fortress}} were finished during the First World War, and many minor works were started and completed {{during the course of}} the war. Even though Sweden remained neutral during the First and Second World War, the start and outcome of both had large impact on the fortress. Finland's independence during the First World War created a buffer state between Sweden and Imperial Russia's successor state, the Soviet Union, which radically changed the strategic value of northern Sweden, put the usefulness of Boden Fortress into question. Only the most basic needs were satisfied during the interwar period; even apparent needsbased on the experiences from the warsuch as better air defence and fortifications to halt or temporarily impede attacks by armoured forces were neglected. Thanks to local commanders, construction of new fortifications and improvements to already existing ones <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the help of garrisoned troops. Engineer companies built new shelters and trenches as training, and the telephone network was improved and completed by the garrisoned telegraph company. This cut the cost drastically as the only expenditure was the needed material.|$|E
5|$|POV (point of view) shots <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> the Tiger Moth biplane. During {{one such}} {{time at the}} end of summer, by which time the grass around Booker Airfield had turned brown, members of the effects team {{rectified}} the colour by applying green paint. Some time later, the production team received a message that a furious farmer's prize ram (an uncastrated sheep) had died, and when the animal was cut open, there was a large amount of green paint inside it. Concluding that no one else but them were responsible for the death, the production team did a lot of explaining and funded the cost of the incident. Production manager Norman Foster gave the farmer's wife a big bunch of flowers.|$|E

Methodology:- 60 single rooted premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were collected. Periapical radiographs were taken from the proximal view to eliminate any teeth with double canal morphology. Each specimen was decoronated 2 mm coronal to cementoenamel junction with the help of diamond disc Specimens were divided into 6 groups of 10 teeth each and instrumentation <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> files of different designs by Crown-down technique.

5|$|The {{production}} facility for Daicon IV {{was in a}} dedicated studio in a building called the Hosei Kaikan that was owned by a textile union. Takeda defined it as a literal anime sweatshop, the building was shutdown at 9:00 pm {{and a majority of}} the staff would be locked inside and working through the night without air conditioning. The Daicon IV film officially credits a production crew of twelve people. Hiroyuki Yamaga directed the production of Daicon IV with Hideaki Anno and Takami Akai as animation directors. Toru Saegusa did the artwork and the animations <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, Mahiro Maeda, Norifumi Kiyozumi; additional animation was provided by Ichiro Itano, Toshihiro Hirano, Narumi Kakinouchi, Sadami Morikawa, Kazutaka Miyatake. Originally, Daicon IV was supposed to be fifteen minutes long, but the difficult production resulted in the cut time.|$|E
5|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} sand for the Sandman, experiments <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> twelve types of sand, such as splashing, launching it at stuntmen, and pouring it over ledges. The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman. For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied. With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corncobs were used as a substitute instead. Because of its resemblance to the substance, sand from Arizona {{was used as the}} model for the CG sand. In a fight where Spider-Man punches through Sandman's chest, amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire's place in filming the scene. Humby, whose right hand was amputated at birth, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman's chest.|$|E

Furthermore, according to Samuel Pezzillo, LATI had been able to pick up much of the mail traffic that German Lufthansa had provided to South America prior to ending its service in August, 1939: it was the main carrier of postal services between Western Europe occupied by the Axis and South America until December 1941.|$|E

In 1988, Bad Brains signed with Caroline Records, who released their fourth album Quickness the following year. Since vocalist H.R. and his brother, drummer Earl Hudson were unavailable for the recording sessions, Quickness was originally recorded with Taj Singleton on vocals and Mackie Jayson on drums but before Quickness was ready for mastering, H.R. returned, rewrote the lyrics and overdubbed the vocals for Quickness replacing Taj Singleton's recorded lyrics and vocals.|$|E

Stultz himself planned to be the pilot of the Columbia and defected to Byrd's crew. After several failed attempts days earlier, on June 17, the “Friendship” took off from the bay at Trepassey, Newfoundland with Earhart on board while the crew of the Columbia were grounded for five days due to the weather.

25|$|Having {{painted the}} young Princess Victoria (1832–3; destr.; oil sketch, Brit. Royal Col.), Hayter {{was not a}} {{surprising}} choice as the new Queen’s 'Portrait and Historical Painter'. But {{on the death of}} Sir David Wilkie in 1841 Hayter's appointment as Principal Painter in Ordinary to the Queen caused some annoyance at the Royal Academy as this appointment had historically been the preserve of the President, then Sir Martin Archer Shee. In 1842 Hayter was knighted. He painted several royal ceremonies including Queen Victoria’s coronation of 1838 and marriage of 1840 and also the Christening of the Prince of Wales of 1843 (all Brit. Royal Col.). He also painted several royal portraits including his most well known work the State Portrait of the new Queen Victoria. Several versions of this portrait <b>were</b> <b>done,</b> <b>with</b> the assistance of the artist's son Angelo, to be sent as diplomatic gifts. Hayter's active period at court was short-lived however, because Albert preferred German painters such as F. X. Winterhalter.|$|E
25|$|According to the Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences, {{a branch}} of the Government of Jalisco, {{violence}} between organized crime groups and security forces increased in Jalisco after the May 1. From that date to April 25, 2016, Jalisco registered 1,195 homicides. The year before the attacks, from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2015, only 1,094 homicides were registered. This meant that violence in Jalisco increased nine percent in a year after the May 1 attacks. According to the state government, the increase in violence was an aftermath caused by the arrests carried out by security forces against the criminal groups' leadership structures, as organized crime groups are destabilized and have to restructure – often violently – after their leaders are taken down. In 2016 alone, Jalisco recorded 1,152 homicides, compared to 1,017 in 2015. Of the 2016 amount, 786 of them <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> firearms: 223 of them were recorded in Guadalajara, 123 in Zapopan, 94 in Tlajomulco de Zúñiga, 62 in Tlaquepaque, and the remaining figures in other municipalities. In addition, around 5,000 car thefts were reported in Jalisco that year.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 Marriott {{was back}} on the road with Jim Leverton (bass, backing vocals), former Steppenwolf keyboardist Goldy McJohn and Chicago born drummer Fallon Williams III. This {{grouping}} was originally set to be called The Official Receivers, The Three Trojans (after McJohn departed) or The Pie but ended up being billed by promoters as Humble Pie. McJohn was let go after suffering drug troubles and the remaining trio toured Australia in October 1982 billed mostly as Small Faces to entice patrons. In January 1983 Leverton ran into trouble at US Immigration and was deported back to England. Marriott based himself in the Atlanta, Georgia area, since that was where his second wife, Pamela Stephens, was from, and continued to tour clubs as Humble Pie. Atlanta musician Keith Christopher (from The Brains) took over bass and a young guitarist from Tennessee, Tommy Johnson, joined as well. And after a hoped for deal with Capricorn Records in nearby Macon fell through after that label's second collapse, this line-up went into Pyramid Eye Studios in Chattanooga, Tennessee to record three songs for a projected album, but nothing further came from it. After Johnson missed a show, he was replaced by Phil Dix. The band was then scheduled to record demos with Yes/ELP producer Eddy Offord at Eddy's studio in Atlanta with Rick Richards (also from The Brains and soon to find fame with the Georgia Satellites) as the new guitarist. But when Rick and Keith missed rehearsals, Steve was so mad that he not only fired Rick but Keith as well. The recordings <b>were</b> <b>done</b> <b>with</b> Fallon on drums and Dave Hewitt (ex-Babe Ruth) on bass. But when these demos failed to attract another record deal and Pamela left Steve for another man, Steve disbanded this version of the Pie and departed the US to return to England in late 1983.|$|E
