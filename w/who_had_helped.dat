5|$|In 1910, Curie {{succeeded in}} {{isolating}} radium; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named {{for her and}} Pierre: the curie.

5|$|Around 376BC, Timanoridas of Corinth and Eukrates of Lefkada paid thirty minae to {{purchase}} Neaira from Nikarete, {{at the high}} end of prices for hetaerae. When the men married, they agreed to let Neaira buy her freedom for twenty minae, which, with the aid of gifts and loans from her former customers, she did. As part of this deal, Neaira agreed to no longer work as a prostitute in Corinth, and so left the city for Athens with Phrynion, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> her buy her freedom.|$|E
5|$|Having had {{the crown}} {{restored}} to her daughter, Elizabeth immediately proceeded to reward those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> her, giving a castle in Gimes to Blaise Forgách, {{the master of}} the cupbearers, who had mortally wounded Charles. In April, Sigismund was brought to Hungary by his brother Wenceslaus and the queens were pressured into accepting him as Mary's future co-ruler by the Treaty of Győr. Having Charles murdered did not help Elizabeth as much as she hoped it would, however, as Charles's supporters immediately recognized his son Ladislaus as heir and fled to Zagreb. Bishop Paul pawned church estates in order to collect money for an army against the queens.|$|E

5|$|In late August 1949, Nixon {{embarked}} on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California, where he was less well known, to see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran. With many of his closest advisers urging him to do so, Nixon decided in early October to seek the Senate seat. He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon's first congressional race.|$|E
5|$|Reamon, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> guide Brooks from Newport News to the University of Virginia, helped Michael {{with his}} SATs {{and helped him}} and his family choose between Syracuse University and Virginia Tech.

Reamon sold Michael on the school's proximity to family and friends, and Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech. As he left the Newport News public housing projects in 1998 with a college football scholarship in hand, Vick was seen in the Newport News community as a success story.|$|E
5|$|Richard H. Fallon {{reviewed}} {{the book for}} Harvard Magazine, and characterized Freedom for the Thought That We Hate as a clear and captivating background education to U.S. freedom of speech legislation. Fallon praised the author's ability to weave descriptions of historical events into an entertaining account. Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press. She observed that the book forcefully presented the author's admiration of brave judges <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as a defense against censorship.|$|E

5|$|The Mint building, {{which was}} {{constructed}} in red brick, was designed by architect William Strickland in the Greek Revival style, like most 19th-century public buildings in the United States. Strickland was {{a student of the}} architect Benjamin Latrobe, a disciple of Neoclassicism <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> design the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Strickland himself, based in Philadelphia, had already designed the Philadelphia Mint building and the Second Bank of the United States, and would design the Charlotte and Dahlonega facilities, making him the architect of the first four U.S. mint buildings. Martin Gordon supervised the building's construction, which was undertaken by Benjamin F. Fox, the master carpenter and joiner, and John Mitchell, the master stonemason and builder.|$|E
5|$|The Sauks {{were divided}} {{about whether to}} resist {{implementation}} of the disputed 1804 treaty. Most Sauks decided to relocate west of the Mississippi rather than become involved in a confrontation with the United States. The leader of this group was Keokuk, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> defend Saukenuk against the Americans during the War of 1812. Keokuk was not a chief, but as a skilled orator, he often spoke {{on behalf of the}} Sauk civil chiefs in negotiations with the Americans. Keokuk regarded the 1804 treaty as a fraud, but after having seen the size of American cities on the east coast in 1824, he did not think the Sauks could successfully oppose the United States.|$|E

5|$|This sincere {{attitude}} {{seems to}} have largely prevailed in practice. Theophilus Lindsey, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> establish Unitarianism in Britain, wrote to the Reverend Newcome Cappe to express his displeasure at a review in {{the first issue of}} the Analytical, demonstrating that Unitarian theology was not being promulgated by the journal. Furthermore, Johnson chose as his theological reviewer, not a Dissenter as his friend Joseph Priestley urged, but Alexander Geddes, a talented Scot who had been ordained in Paris as a Roman Catholic priest. However, modern scholars have suggested that he did so not for religious reasons, but because Geddes lived in London and had close connections both to Wollstonecraft and Johnson's friend, Henry Fuseli.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>helped</b> him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was {{very much a part of}} the landed aristocracy that formed the backbone of the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E
