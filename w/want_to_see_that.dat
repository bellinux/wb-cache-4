You can’t approach them. It {{is one of those things}} where they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it’s a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are." ...|$|E
500|$|Physicist Isidor Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's disconcerting triumphalism: [...] "I'll {{never forget}} his walk; I'll {{never forget the}} way {{he stepped out of}} the car... his walk was like High Noon... this kind of strut. He had done it." [...] At an {{assembly}} at Los Alamos on August 6 (the evening of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima), Oppenheimer took to the stage and clasped his hands together [...] "like a prize-winning boxer" [...] while the crowd cheered. He noted his regret the weapon had not been available in time to use against Nazi Germany. However, he and many of the project staff were very upset about the bombing of Nagasaki, as they did not feel the second bomb was necessary from a military point of view. He traveled to Washington on August 17 to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned. In October 1945 Oppenheimer was granted an interview with President Harry S Truman. The meeting, however, went badly, after Oppenheimer remarked he felt he had [...] "blood on my hands". The remark infuriated Truman {{and put an end to}} the meeting. Truman later told his Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> son-of-a-bitch in this office ever again." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite general favor from female viewers' perspective, {{reaction}} from most male viewers was negative. The music video {{was presented to}} a crowd during a promotional party at the Chelsea nightclub Centro-Fly, thrown in celebration of Voodoos January 2000 release. According to a New York Times correspondent, one female viewer at the party [...] "recalled sitting at home, staring at the video, while her boyfriend snapped, 'Turn the channel — I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> gay stuff'". D'Angelo made an appearance at the WQHT Hot 97 studio as the DJ's Angie Martinez and Funkmaster Flex fielded calls from listeners about the video. Tracy Cloherty, program director for the radio station at the time, later commented on the divided reaction to the music video in an interview for The New York Times in 2000, stating [...] "Of course, {{most of the women}} loved it. Some of the men said things like: 'We don't wanna see that kind of stuff. Why do {{we have to look at}} that?' Men definitely seem to be threatened by male nudity". Some viewers and music writers have attributed the male discomfort of the video to fear of male sexual objectification and homophobia. In a 2000 phone interview for The New York Times, D'Angelo maintained a neutral attitude towards general viewer opinion of the video, stating [...] "With men, if there's any negative reaction, I'm not really going to get an honest feedback ... women love it, most definitely. But for me personally, the response I've got from both men and women has been pretty cool".|$|E

500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Savage {{participated in}} the UK edition of The X Factor and {{advanced}} to the final 24 while attending the aforementioned music school. While participating in the popular music competition franchise, she had difficulty dealing with the limelight. Savage was quoted as saying, [...] "You have to always realize that people are watching. When I got the bad news that I wasn't getting through [...] {{it was a really}} painful time. But you still {{have to learn how to}} hold that until you get home. Because you don't want to just let everything out. People admire you and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> you're strong; they don't want to see you breaking down." ...|$|E

2500|$|The BBC {{needs to}} {{know there is a}} degree of dissatisfaction among the public. I think people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> EastEnders is {{populated}} by many different ethnic groups. Black people in real life run businesses, fall in and out of love, have fascinating and exciting lives. So why can't we in EastEnders. We are not all losers or nobodies so why can't the BBC show that?...I really felt so ineffectual as a character because I had nothing to get my teeth into - there were no great dramatic scenes or relationships. My character was never given anything meaningful to say and that was such a wasted opportunity. My son said I should get out of EastEnders because it wasn't doing me any good as an actress or as a black woman...I have got to speak out so that things can change." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{his review}} of the film Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, BBC radio film critic Mark Kermode remarked that the general plot of the film was so similar to the Harry Potter series that it may {{as well have been}} called Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins.

The name came from Doug Church while Mills, according to Church, came up with the acronym on the spot.|$|R
