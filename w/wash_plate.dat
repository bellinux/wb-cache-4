5000|$|Spin-dry effectiveness: Front-loaders (and European {{horizontal}} axis top loaders) offer much higher maximum spin speeds {{of up to}} 2000 RPM, although home machines tend {{to be in the}} 1000 to 1400 RPM range, while top-loaders (with agitators) do not exceed 1140 RPM. High-efficiency top-loaders with a <b>wash</b> <b>plate</b> (instead of an agitator) can spin up to 1100 RPM, as their center of gravity is lower. Higher spin speeds, along with the diameter of the drum, determine the g-force, and a higher g-force removes more residual water, making clothes dry faster. This also reduces energy consumption if clothes are dried in a clothes dryer.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{possible}} methods of washing {{that are being}} employed, the [...] "simple washing" [...] and the [...] "thorough washing". For simple washing, the wash liquor flows through the same channel as the slurry with high velocity, causing erosion of the cakes near the point of entry. Thus the channels formed are constantly enlarged and therefore uneven cleaning is normally obtained. A better technique is by thorough washing in which the wash liquor is introduced through a different channel behind the filter cloth called <b>washing</b> <b>plates.</b> It flows through the whole thickness of the cakes in opposite direction first {{and then with the}} same direction as the filtrate. The wash liquor is normally discharged through the same channel as the filtrate. After washing, the cakes can be easily removed by supplying compressed air to remove the excess liquid.|$|R
