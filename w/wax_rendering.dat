The melting <b>wax</b> <b>rendered</b> {{four of the six}} recordings completely unusable and left an audible click on the pressings of [...] "Ory's Creole Trombone".|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{manufacturing}} in space, {{it is useful}} to conduct analog experiments where possible so that problems that are apt to be encountered may be identified and planning toward their solution considered. An example is presented involving containerless casting in a near zero gravitational field using paraffin wax as the material cast surrounded by a heated fluid immiscible with the <b>wax</b> that <b>renders</b> it neutrally buoyant...|$|R
40|$|The neotropical flat bug species Dysodius lunatus and Dysodius magnus show a {{fascinating}} camouflage principle, as their appearance renders the animal hardly {{visible on the}} bark of trees. However, when getting wet due to rain, bark changes its colour and gets darker. In {{order to keep the}} camouflage effect, it seems that some Dysodius species benefit from their ability to hold a water film on their cuticle and therefore change their optical properties when also wetted by water. This camouflage behaviour requires the insect to have a hydrophilic surface and passive surface structures which facilitate the liquid spreading. Here we show morphological and chemical characterisations of the surface, especially the cuticular waxes of D. magnus. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the animal is covered with pillar-like microstructures which, in combination with a surprising chemical hydrophilicity of the cuticle <b>waxes,</b> <b>render</b> the bug almost superhydrophilic: water spreads immediately across the surface. We could theoretically model this behaviour assuming the effect of hemi-wicking (a state in which a droplet sits on a rough surface, partwise imbibing the structure around).  Additionally the principle was abstracted and a laser-patterned polymer surface, mimicking the structure and contact angle of Dysodius wax, shows exactly the behaviour of the natural role model – immediate spreading of water and the formation of a thin continuous water film changing optical properties of the surface...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} physically-inspired model of wax crayons, which synthesizes {{drawings}} from collections of user-specified strokes. Paper {{is represented by}} a height-field texture, and a crayon is modelled with a 2 D mask that evolves as it interacts with the paper. The amount of wax deposition is computed based on the crayon contact profile, contact force, and friction. Previously deposited wax is smeared by crayon action, based on wax softness and contact information. Deposited wax can also be carved from the paper by the crayon and redeposited at another location. The distributed <b>wax</b> is <b>rendered</b> using a simplified Kubelka-Monk model, which approximates light transmission and scattering effects...|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding {{the absence}} of all comfort and {{convenience}} in their habitations, and the general squalidness of their appearance, the Shoshokoes {{do not appear to}} be destitute of ingenuity. They manufacture good ropes, and even a tolerably fine thread, from a sort of weed found in their neighborhood; and construct bowls and jugs out of a kind of basket-work formed from small strips of wood plaited: these, by the aid of a little <b>wax,</b> they <b>render</b> perfectly water tight. Beside the roots on which they mainly depend for subsistence, they collect great quantities of seed, of various kinds, beaten with one hand out of the tops of the plants into wooden bowls held for that purpose. The seed thus collected is winnowed and parched, and ground between two stones into a kind of meal or flour; which, when mixed with water, forms a very palatable paste or gruel.|$|R
50|$|When beekeepers {{extract the}} honey, they {{cut off the}} wax caps from each {{honeycomb}} cell with an uncapping knife or machine. Its color varies from nearly white to brownish, but most often a shade of yellow, depending on purity, the region, {{and the type of}} flowers gathered by the bees. Wax from the brood comb of the honey bee hive tends to be darker than wax from the honeycomb. Impurities accumulate more quickly in the brood comb. Due to the impurities, the <b>wax</b> must be <b>rendered</b> before further use. The leftovers are called slumgum.|$|R
40|$|In {{their time}} <b>wax</b> {{cylinders}} <b>rendered</b> a great service to those studying {{the world of}} sounds. It was owing to the gramophone and phonophone recordings that the world found out about Georgian folk multipart singing. My paper is intended to acquaint the audence with the project of transferring wax cylinders on to digital carriers, which was implemented last autumn (1995); I am sure it is very significant for studying the traditional Georgian singing culture. Pre-History of the Project For {{quite a long time}} the Department of Folk Music at Tbilisi Conservatoire has had in its possession greatly valuable relics of the past, wax cylinders and two no longer functioning phonographs. The condition they are in excludes the possibility of ever making them sound. As it seemed quite hopeless, until last autumn it had not even been known how many wax cylinders existed in Georgia, where and in whose possession they were. Despite the assiduous attempts of the late Kukuri Chokhonelidze, {{the former head of the}} Georgian Musical Folklore Department and Anzor Erkomaishvili, owing to th...|$|R
5000|$|Except for {{the unusual}} disc size and speed, the {{physical}} record-making process {{was the same}} one employed by contemporary record companies to make smaller discs for home use. The recording lathe cut an audio-signal-modulated spiral groove into the polished surface of a thick round slab of wax-like material rotating on a turntable. The wax was much too soft to be played in the usual way, but a specially supported and guided pickup {{could be used to}} play it back immediately in order to detect any sound problems that might have gone unnoticed during the filming. If problems were found, the scene could then be re-shot while everything was still in place, minimizing additional expense. Even the lightest playback caused some damage to the wax master, so it was customary to employ two recorders and simultaneously record two waxes, one to play and the other to be sent for processing if that [...] "take" [...] of the scene was approved. At the processing plant, the surface of the <b>wax</b> was <b>rendered</b> electrically conductive and electroplated to produce a metal mold or [...] "stamper" [...] with a ridge instead of a groove, and this was used to press hard shellac discs from molten [...] "biscuits" [...] of the raw material.|$|R
40|$|I {{will prepare}} {{a new chapter}} and draft another for my second book. “Flowers of Evil, Corporeal Waxworks: Orientalist Curiosity Cabinets,” enlists {{research}} materials I garnered from archives such as the Bibliothèque Nationale Française and the Musée de Moulages at the Hôpital Saint Louis, including medical treatises and images of artistically <b>rendered</b> <b>wax</b> mold models of the diseased body from {{the late nineteenth century}} through the postwar period. These artifacts, although presented as medical teaching materials, literally and figuratively also place on exhibit the underside of official French narratives and policies concerning virtue and legitimacy. The secret fantasies and anxieties regarding vice, the blossoming of forbidden desires, and exoticism are projected onto bodies outside the respectable spaces of bourgeois life, in consonance with poet Charles Baudelaire’s conflation of beauty and horror. These insights complement a second chapter I will draft, “A Dangerous Romance: Transgressing Cultural Spectacles of Gender and Nation. ...|$|R
40|$|Vegetation plays a {{key role}} in the {{environmental}} cycling and fate of many organic chemicals. A compound's location on or within leaves will affect its persistence and significance; retention in surface compartments (i. e., the epicuticular <b>wax</b> and cuticle) <b>renders</b> the compound more susceptible to photodegradation and volatilization, while penetration into the epidermal cell walls or cytoplasm will enhance susceptibility to metabolism. Here, for the first time, methodologies which combine plant and PAH autofluorescence with two-photon excitation microscopy (TPEM) are used to visualize and quantify compound photodegradation on and within living plant leaves. Anthracene, fluoranthene, and phenanthrene were introduced to living leaves of Zea mays and monitored in real time, in control treatments, and when subject to UV-A radiation. Compound photodegradation was observed directly; different degradation rates occurred for different compounds (anthracene > fluoranthene > phenanthrene) and in different locations (at the leaf surface > within the epidermal cells). Results suggest that photodegradation on vegetation may be a more important loss mechanism for PAHs than previously thought. Compound fate in vegetation is potentially highly complex, influenced by diffusion into and location within leaf structures, the rates of supply/loss with the atmosphere, exposure to sunlight, and other environmental conditions. The techniques described here provide a real-time tool to advance insight into these issues...|$|R
40|$|Microporous polymer {{scaffolds}} {{decorated with}} nanoparticles could provide functional membranes {{that are needed}} in solar-to-fuel technologies. Therefore, efficient prodn. processes are needed for high surface area, porous membranes with distinct catalytic nanoparticles {{on opposite sides of}} a support that resists oxidn. and separates the products, e. g., hydrogen and oxygen. Breath figure (BF) patterning is an established method to create microstructured honeycomb-patterned porous polymer films. This research shows that surfaceactive nanoparticles can self-assemble onto the interfaces between the templating BF water droplets and the polymer soln. to control micrometer and nanometerscale hierarchical structure. Here, amphiphilic "Janus" nanoparticles serve as both solid surfactants and Pickering emulsion stabilizing agents, thus able to optimize ordering degree of the honeycomb structures and nanoparticle enrichment in the pore walls. Janus nanoparticles were synthesized using literature methods (with improvements that will be presented) : functionalizing only the exposed surface of particles embedded on the surface of <b>wax</b> microspheres (colloidosomes) <b>renders</b> half of the particle hydrophobic. They were then employed in the BFs templating method for the first time, resulting in regular, porous films with uniform, high nanoparticle d. Humble materials (silica and polystyrene) demonstrate the method, and can now be replaced by catalyst nanoparticles (e. g., nickel, molybdenum sulfide, or cobalt-based) embedded in a semiconducting polymer to create membranes for photocatalytic water splitting...|$|R
5000|$|Bette Noir: A female crime fighter who augments her uncanny aim with {{customized}} {{ammunition for}} dealing with specific threats. Her bullets are capable of blowing buildings apart. Married to Gilgamos, but has an affair with the Plutonian prior to his fall. As {{a result of the}} affair, Bette possesses candle <b>wax</b> capable of <b>rendering</b> the Plutonian a mortal man, used to allow them to consummate their relationship. She attempts to kill the Plutonian with a bullet crafted from the magic wax but fails due to Qubit's interference. Unable to deal with the guilt of allowing millions to die by not acting sooner, she goes into hiding. [...] Bette is discovered by the Plutonian in Irredeemable #29, living a hedonistic lifestyle while awaiting death. Bette is later possessed by Modeus. In Issue #35, Modeus unlocks Bette's true potential, physics altering gravity singularities. Bette was unaware of her full abilities, using them only to enhance single bullets. By chemically altering Bette's frontal lobe, Modeus gains enough strength to manipulate gravity on a scale capable of overpowering the Plutonian's ability to fly or move. Modeus is able to use her power to open wormholes of limitless range, enabling him to consume entire star systems, granting Bette's body enough power to physically injure and overwhelm the Plutonian. According to Modeus, each blow capable of injuring Plutonian requires the death of a single star system. At Qubit's request, Bette's body is eventually destroyed by Plutonian.|$|R
40|$|Calanoid copepods are a {{rich source}} of n- 3 highly {{unsaturated}} fatty acids (HUFA) for potential use in aquafeeds. However, as copepod oil is primarily composed of wax esters (WE), there are concerns over the efficiency of wax ester, versus triacylglycerol (TAG), digestion and utilisation in fish. As smoltification represents a period of major physiological adaptation, the present study examined the digestibility of a high wax ester diet (Calanus oil; 230 g kg- 1 diet; 48 % WE, 26 % TAG), compared to a triacylglycerol diet (fish oil; 230 g kg- 1 diet; 58 % TAG), in Atlantic salmon freshwater pre-smolts and seawater post-smolts, of similar age (9 months) and weight (112 g and 141 g initial respectively), over a 98 day period at constant temperature and lighting regimes. Fish grew significantly better, and possessed lower feed conversion ratios (FCR), in seawater than freshwater. However, total lipid apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC) values were significantly lower in seawater fish, as were total fasted bile volumes. Dietary Calanus oil also had a significant effect, reducing growth and lipid ADC values in both freshwater and seawater groups. Post-smolts fed dietary Calanus oil had the poorest lipid ADC values and analysis of faecal lipid class composition revealed that 33 % of remaining lipid was wax ester and 32 % fatty alcohols. Dietary prevalent 22 : 1 n- 11 and 20 : 1 n- 9 fatty alcohols were particularly poorly utilised. A decrease in major bile acid, taurocholate, concentration was observed in the bile of dietary Calanus oil groups which could be related to the lower cholesterol content of the diet. It is suggested that, following smoltification and rapid growth in seawater, there is a lag phase in digestive function where bile production is not sufficient to emulsify and <b>render</b> <b>wax</b> esters available for hydrolytic action by luminal lipases. These effects appear {{to be related to the}} life stage of the fish and could also represent an upper limit of wax ester inclusion in diets...|$|R
