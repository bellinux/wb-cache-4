500|$|Also defined herewith: eggshell, yolk, albumen; chalaza. The organic vessel {{containing}} the zygote, in which birds develop until hatching. Eggs are usually oval in shape, {{and have a}} base white colour from the predominant calcium carbonate makeup of the outer shell, called the eggshell, though [...] birds especially may have eggs of other colours, such as through deposition of biliverdin and its zinc chelate, which give a green or blue ground colour, and protoporphyrin which produces reds and browns. A viable bird egg (as opposed to a non-viable egg: see [...] ) consists {{of a number of}} structures. The eggshell is 95–97% calcium carbonate crystals, at least in chickens, stabilized by a protein matrix, without which the crystalline structure would be too brittle to keep its form; the organic matrix is thought to have a role in deposition of calcium during the mineralization process. The structure and composition of the avian eggshell serves to protect the egg against damage and microbial contamination, prevention of desiccation, regulation of gas and <b>water</b> <b>exchange</b> for the growing embryo, and provides calcium for embryogenesis. Inside the eggshell are two shell membranes (inner and outer), and at the center is a yolk—a spherical structure, usually some shade of yellow, to which the fertilized gamete attaches and which the embryonic bird uses as sustenance as it grows. The yolk is suspended in the albumen (also called egg white or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the chalazae. The albumen protects the yolk and provides additional nutrition for the embryo's growth, though it is made up of approximately 90% water in most birds. Prior to fertilization, the yolk is a single cell ovum or egg cell; one of the few single cells that can be seen by the naked eye.|$|E

O 3 uptake was markedly decreased during cellular dehydration, was slightly decreased during cellular overhydration, and was maximum at the water content of erythrocytes when suspended in a medium isotonic with plasma. The concept of the mammalian erythrocyte acting as a simple osmometer changing its water content and shape in response to osmotic gradients has been modified in recent years. Although some question exists as to whether nucleated mammalian cells are isotonic with the extracellular fluid (1), it appears from the work of WiUiams et al. (2) that the mammalian erythrocyte is isotonic with the plasma. Previous studies by Olmstead (3, 4) have shown that rabbit erythrocytes respond to hypertonic and hypotonic osmotic gradients equidistant from intracellular osmolarity with a greater water influx than water efflux.

40|$|AbstractDetermining the {{maintenance}} and control mechanisms {{of the energy}} and <b>water</b> <b>exchanges</b> over the desert riparian forest zone in the lower Tarim River of China could improve our understanding of land surface processes of the groundwater-dependent ecosystems in the hinterland area of the Eurasian continent under hyper-arid climate. Nearly three years of continuous measurements of meteorological factors, surface water and energy fluxes, soil water content, and groundwater table were carried out over a riparian Tamarix spp. stand in the lower Tarim River basin. Because of scarce precipitation and low air humidity, the diurnal and seasonal variations of most meteorological factors exhibited simple unimodal dynamics. However, the seasonal variation of latent heat exchange (LE) was distinctly related to plant phenology. The sensible heat exchange (H) exhibited reverse course with the LE seasonal course, which suggested seasonal variation of the H was controlled by the LE course. In the daytime, a good linear relationship existed between evapotranspiration (ET) and reference evapotranspiration. The yearly ET over the tamarisk stand was approximately 500 mmyear− 1, and the mean daily ET is about 3. 85 mmd− 1 in a vibrant growing season. The groundwater table and the soil water content (SWC) near the groundwater table exhibited obvious seasonal and diurnal variations in the growing seasons but SWC in the shallow soil layer did not, suggesting the groundwater was the water source of the tamarisk. Our analysis indicated that under a hyper-arid climate, the energy and <b>water</b> <b>exchanges</b> over riparian tamarisk stands in the lower Tarim River basin showed certain features: (1) plant transpiration accounted {{for most of the}} surface ET, with soil evaporation weak and negligible; (2) the seasonal processes of surface energy and <b>water</b> <b>exchanges</b> were highly related with plant phenology; (3) the diurnal processes of ET resulted from the comprehensive effects of all atmospheric factors; and (4) ET depends on groundwater, rather than precipitation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{aquifers}} with variable permeability, the <b>water</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{between high}} and low permeability regions are controlled by the hydraulic head gradient. Past studies have addressed this problem mainly considering steadystate hydraulic conditions. To study such exchanges during water-table fluctuations, a spring was equipped with a water-gate that creates 10 -meter artificial fluctuations of the water table. The <b>water</b> <b>exchanges</b> are discussed with respect to hydrochemical and pressure measurements in the groundwater. With successive water-table fluctuations the mineralization and pH decrease, but the bicarbonate content increases in response to carbon dioxide dissolution. At this scale of single fractures and surroundings, the hydrochemistry allows water flows from low or high permeability discontinuities to be discriminated. During hydraulic head fluctuations, the waters from low and high permeability discontinuities become mixed. During water-table rise, the low-permeability matrix contributed to the refilling of the permeable faults and to the mixing of the waters. Dynamic flows in the opposite direction to the hydraulic gradient can expel mineralized water, pushing it towards permeable discontinuities. This mechanism could be the cause of the peak in the mineralisation recorded in some karst springs at the start of flood events...|$|R
