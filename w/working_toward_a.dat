5|$|In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office began <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> new stadium, {{with the}} city {{identifying}} three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on {{the north end of}} The Gulch, the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulphur Dell), and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still preferred the Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean preferred the Sulphur Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37million downtown ballpark at Sulphur Dell. Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time {{for the start of the}} 2015 season.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, Austria outlawed {{experiments}} on any apes, {{unless it is}} conducted {{in the interests of}} the individual animal. In 2002, Belgium announced that it was <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> ban on all primate use, and in the UK, 103 MPs signed an Early Day Motion calling for an end to primate experiments, arguing that they cause suffering and are unreliable. No licenses for research on great apes have been issued in the UK since 1998. The Boyd Group, a British group comprising animal researchers, philosophers, primatologists, and animal advocates, has recommended a global prohibition on the use of great apes.|$|E
25|$|In these years, {{more workers}} in the city were {{organized}} in unions than ever before. There was a 400 percent increase in union membership from 1915 to 1918. At the time, {{workers in the}} United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, were becoming increasingly radicalized, with many in {{the rank and file}} supportive of the recent revolution in Russia and <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> similar revolution in the United States. In the fall of 1919, for instance, Seattle longshoremen refused to load arms destined for the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Russia and attacked those who attempted to load them.|$|E

25|$|As an {{incentive}} to sell, Girl Scouts are offered recognitions, such as stuffed animals, trinkets, coupons, credits toward Girl Scout camp, activities, or uniforms. These recognitions vary from Girl Scout council to council. The recognitions are usually cumulative, so that a girl who earns the recognition for selling 50 boxes of cookies will also get the 25- and 20-box items. In some councils, girls may choose to earn more money for their troop instead of recognitions if they are <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> troop goal such as a trip or other expensive activity. This type of fund raising is intended to teach Girl Scouts valuable skills in planning, teamwork, finance, organization, communication, and goal setting.|$|E

25|$|Following graduation, James {{wished to}} enter the priesthood. He could not study at the Jesuit novitiate in Maryland, {{as it was a}} slave state. With the help of John Bernard Fitzpatrick, James entered a Sulpician seminary in Montreal. In 1852, he {{transferred}} to study at Saint Sulpice Seminary in Paris, <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> doctorate and a career as a seminary professor. After a change of heart, he decided to become a pastor. On June 10, 1854, he was ordained at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris as a priest to serve in Boston, Massachusetts. He was the first African American to be ordained a Roman Catholic priest; at the time he identified as and was accepted as white Irish Catholic. During the 19th century, numerous Americans studied for the priesthood in Paris.|$|E

25|$|Margaret was <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> {{union of}} Sweden with Denmark and Norway by having Olaf {{elected to the}} Swedish throne. She {{was on the verge}} of {{achieving}} this goal when Olaf IV suddenly died. However, Denmark made Margaret temporary ruler upon the death of Olaf. On 2 February 1388, Norway followed suit and crowned Margaret. Queen Margaret knew that her power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place. She settled on Eric of Pomerania, grandson of her sister. Thus at an all-Scandinavian meeting held at Kalmar, Erik of Pomerania was crowned king of all three Scandinavian countries. Thus, royal politics resulted in personal unions between the Nordic countries, eventually bringing the thrones of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden under the control of Queen Margaret when the country entered into the Kalmar Union.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Saret Koheh {{made good}} on the threats of the “Night Letter” posted in Kamdesh {{beginning}} the campaign season of 2007. It also confronted Lieutenant Colonel Kolenda commanding American forces {{in the area in}} Naray, with the fact that COIN operations in Nuristan were facing a crisis. AAF operations in the area were expanding, involving a greater proportion of the local population, and were being supported by Taliban organizations in Pakistan. American forces were strung out in a thinly held and poorly supplied picket line from Naray to Kamdesh along the Landay-Sin River. The American forces were too outnumbered to survive in sustained combat with the local population. Something had to be done to put the Americans and the Afghans of Nuristan on the same side. The first effort in a new COIN campaign was made by First Lieutenant Dave Roller. He decided that the appearance of American soldiers in their “battle rattle” war gear gave the impression of soulless killing machines. Encased in armor, helmets, and weapons, Americans appeared to be looking for a fight. As a contrast Dave attended his next meeting with the Kamdesh village leaders dressed in a T-shirt and shorts. When he spoke to them he discussed their common values as leaders of families and communities <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> better future for their children. Mawlawi Abdul Rahman of Kamdesh was a local elder much impressed with this new approach. He began building a consensus of village elders in support of the Afghan government. Through {{the rest of the summer}} and fall of 2008, Captain Joey Hutto, the new commander of COP Keating, and his troops expanded this initiative. Hutto had worked for years on COIN campaigns in Central America, and put his skills to good use in Nuristan.|$|E
500|$|Passed midshipmen {{awaiting}} promotion often {{elected to}} become master's mates, a high-ranking petty officer who assisted the master with his duties, served on watch as deputy to the lieutenants, and commanded small boats. A midshipman who became master's mate earned {{an increase in}} pay from £25s to £316s per month but initially reduced his chances at a commission because master's mates, along with masters, were assumed to have a working-class background. [...] Over time, however, appointment to master's mate became considered {{a normal part of}} the path to a commission; the situation caused some confusion during {{the last part of the}} 18th century, when two parallel roles– master's mates trying to become masters, and former midshipmen <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> commission– held the same title and responsibilities aboard ship.|$|E

500|$|The Huffington Post's Bob Sassone, while {{reviewing}} the show retrospectively in 2006, praised the [...] "intelligent writing, fast-paced dialogue, {{and a strong}} ensemble cast of smart, moral characters all <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> common goal." [...] He also pointed out links betweenSports Night and Aaron Sorkin's next production, the critically acclaimed The West Wing. The Washington Post called Sports Night [...] "the best new ABC sitcom of the season" [...] and also commented [...] "Aaron Sorkin... certainly got a knack for snappy, and occasionally moving, dialogue." [...] They were {{among a number of}} publications to point out how the show would appeal to sports fans and non-sports enthusiasts alike. The Associated Press marked Sports Night out {{as one of the few}} potential successes amongst the freshman shows for the 1998–99 season. Entertainment Weekly believed that the season as a whole deserved to be nominated for best comedy at the Emmys.|$|E
500|$|Elsewhere in the world, pacifist {{women were}} forced {{to adjust to the}} realities of war. After [...] "the guns of August", Rosika Schwimmer, a native of Austria–Hungary working in England but {{prevented}} by war from returning home, outlined her idea for an international conference of neutrals to mediate between warring nations. In September 1914, Stritt wrote to Catt in America with [...] "deep personal regret" [...] for the [...] "terrible war". The pacifist women of Germany were forced by war to withdraw their invitation to host the annual IWSA congress which was to have been held nine months later in Berlin. In December 1914, Canadian Julia Grace Wales, a professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, published her views about <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> mediated peace in a pamphlet entitled [...] "Continuous Mediation Without Armistice", popularly known as the Wisconsin Plan. Taking these messages as her inspiration, Catt proposed that, rather than holding a woman suffrage convention in Berlin, an international peace congress of women should meet in The Hague for four days beginning 28 April 1915.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the first}} seven episodes of the season {{revolved}} around the characters organizing a harvest festival, which had previously been a Pawnee tradition before it ended. The storyline stemmed from serious budget problems facing Pawnee and the major cuts threatened to the parks department, which prompts Leslie to bring the harvest festival back and stake {{the future of the}} entire department on its success and failure. The festival served as a device to bring all the characters together <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> common goal, similar to efforts to turn a construction pit into a park during the first two seasons. Schur said the harvest festival story arc was written in part because the first six episodes were written and filmed early, so the writing staff felt having one concise storyline to tie them together kept the show focused. Schur also said the writers were fatigued from working on six third-season episodes immediately after the second season, so the harvest festival story arc helped [...] "organize our tired, end-of-the-year brains".|$|E
50|$|In 1979-1980, anti-Ba'ath riots {{arose in}} the Iraq's Shia areas by groups who were <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>an</b> Islamic {{revolution}} in their country. Saddam and his deputies believed that the riots had been inspired by the Iranian Revolution and instigated by Iran's government. On 10 March 1980, when Iraq declared Iran's ambassador persona non-grata, and demanded his withdrawal from Iraq by 15 March, Iran replied by downgrading its diplomatic ties to the charge d'affaires level, and demanded that Iraq withdraw their ambassador from Iran.|$|R
50|$|ISAR's founder, {{the late}} Helen Jones, {{was one of}} the early and few pioneers in what would decades later become known as the animal rights movement.

500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me they were taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It would be best for the show if I were to leave." [...] That's when I tendered my resignation.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{made several}} other changes going from season one to season two, {{including}} making the scripts more focused around the entire cast {{rather than just}} Leslie. They also tried to make Leslie appear more intelligent in the second season after receiving audience feedback that she appeared [...] "ditzy", which Michael Schur said was never their intention. Schur said, [...] "In the end, we just felt that Amy is an enormously likable presence on screen, so as the season went on we just tried to create situations where that would shine through." [...] During the episode [...] "Kaboom", a major subplot was resolved when the large construction pit that Leslie had long sought {{to turn into a}} park was filled with dirt and turned into a lot. The pit was first established in the premiere episode and had been a focal point of the series since the show began. Schur said while the pit project was originally conceived as a device to bring all the characters together <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> common goal, and it was expected to only become a park during the series finale. However, Schur said he felt the early episodes were too focused on the pit and had led viewers to believe the entire show was about filling the pit, which was not the writers' intention, so they accelerated the resolution of that story arc. The idea of Ben and Chris, two state auditors who come in from outside Pawnee to help the town deal with budget problems, was conceived from news reports at the time of a number of states considering shutting down schools, parks and other services due to the global recession.|$|E
500|$|While Retro Studios {{tried to}} create [...] "the {{ultimate}} first-person experience" [...] with the Metroid Prime series, Sakamoto's approach with gameplay was different, particularly for the story Other M intended to tell. When Sakamoto met Team Ninja, he said his intent was a game with [...] "controls as simple as those of a NES game", so it would appeal to modern players. Team Ninja agreed with that approach, as they felt control schemes with excessive buttons were possibly turning players off the action genre, {{and tried to make}} the game employ only the Wii Remote, without resorting to the Nunchuk expansion. The development team also tried to use the simpler controls to provide flashy action, with varied special attacks that would need few button inputs to be executed. Sakamoto focused on 2D-like gameplay because he considered it more [...] "comfortable" [...] for audiences, particularly during shifts from gameplay to cutscenes, as he thought 2D [...] " [...] have the same distractions when you want to give them story sequences". While the developers felt no need to integrate everything from the Prime series as they were games with different concepts, a few of the elements that [...] "made those games unique" [...] were implemented into Other M, such as the [...] "immersive sight" [...] of the first-person mode. When questioned if Other M would be too similar to Ninja Gaiden, Hayashi responded that while the new game will feature heavy action-based sequences, there will still be the exploration-based sequences characteristic of other Metroid games. Sakamoto said that Other Ms story progression was {{in the same manner as}} Metroid Fusion, and stated that the collaboration between Nintendo and Team Ninja is [...] "unlike anything that's ever been done at Nintendo; it's more than just a collaborative effort — it's one group <b>working</b> <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> common goal".|$|E
