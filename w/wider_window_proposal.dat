A <b>wider</b> <b>window</b> {{for the standard}} deviation could cover {{the end of a}} noisy segment and the beginning of a voiced segment and thus, overestimating the presence of noise {{at the beginning of the}} voiced segment. Therefore, a short window seems necessary to quickly adapt the standard deviation estimate in transients. On the other hand, using a <b>wider</b> <b>window</b> for the mean allows to obtain a more robust estimate of the source shape in transients where harmonic sinusoidal parameters are less reliable than in voiced segments.|$|R

50|$|Zero-window {{searches}} hit a cut-off {{sooner than}} wide-window searches. They are therefore more efficient, but, in some sense, also less forgiving, than wide-window searches. Because MTD(f) only uses zero-window searches, while Alpha-Beta and NegaScout also use <b>wide</b> <b>window</b> searches, MTD(f) is more efficient. However, <b>wider</b> search <b>windows</b> are more forgiving for engines with large odd/even swings and fine-grained evaluation functions. For this reason some chess engines have not switched to MTD(f).In tests with tournament-quality {{programs such as}} Chinook (checkers), Phoenix (chess), and Keyano (Othello), the MTD(f) algorithm outperformed all other search algorithms.|$|R

The book includes seven new illustrations, and the third part of a serial supplement entitled The Cornucopian Cavalcade, which features a 13-part comic by Michael Kupperman entitled The Spoily Brats, an advice column written by Lemony Snicket, and, as in The Bad Beginning or, Orphans! and The Reptile Room or, Murder!, (the final) part of a story by Stephen Leacock entitled Q: A Psychic Pstory of the Psupernatural. This edition {{was the last of}} the paperback rereleases of the series - there have not been any more of these as of this edit for unknown reasons.|$|R
