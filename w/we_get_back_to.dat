2500|$|Early in 2004, {{lead singer}} James Hetfield {{revealed}} that Metallica {{had been playing}} new material during studio sessions, but {{that there was no}} mention of plans for a ninth studio album at that time. Select music from the jam sessions may be used on the album, as Lars Ulrich stated, [...] "I definitely look forward to sifting through some of that stuff when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the studio in January." [...] On that note, by October 2004, the band had already compiled nearly 50 hours of pre-set jamming, with hundreds of riffs, chord progressions and bass lines. On September 30, 2004, Launch Radio revealed from an interview with Hetfield that the band hoped to return to the studio in spring of 2005 to begin recording their ninth studio album for Warner Bros. Records.|$|E
60|$|ERMYNTRUDE. Captain Duval, I don't {{want to be}} unsympathetic; {{but suppose}} <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--er--Jeeves, I think that, on the whole, if {{you were}} to--as it were--freeze on to that parcel until <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London----" ...|$|E
60|$|At this {{there came}} to me a glimmering of courageous hope. If the steamer had {{remained}} afloat so long, it was probable that on account of water-tight compartments, or for some other reason, her sinking had reached its limit, and that if <b>we</b> could <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her <b>we</b> might be saved. But, alas, how were <b>we</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her? This boat would sink long, long before I could row that distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Divil a map have I {{ever looked}} at since I was at school," [...] O'Grady said. [...] "Then if <b>we</b> can't <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Portugal, where shall <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to?" ...|$|R
5000|$|After the {{wireless}} mobile bubble bursts this year, <b>we</b> will <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> stringing fibers ... bathrooms are still predominantly plumbed. For {{more or less}} the same reason, computers will stay wired.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anan!--Why you know, gal, we go {{to bring}} off Hist, the Sarpent's betrothed--the maid he means to marry, as soon as <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the tribe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I move <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the yacht. We {{have come}} a good distance, {{and it will be}} more than dinner time before we can make it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{it always}} leave a mark?" [...] said Richard. [...] "I am afraid they will call me Richard of the scarred cheek, when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Normandy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you suppose, if {{we made a}} drag for Tom, that <b>we</b> could <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Dawson somehow?" [...] {{questioned}} Sam, {{after all}} had been outside {{to look at the}} sky.|$|R
6000|$|... "But our {{luck was}} out. We lost many days in finding these islands, and when <b>we</b> did <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> them, hardly had {{we got on}} board than the weather broke up.|$|R
5000|$|When Savio {{returned}} to Berkeley after {{his time in}} Mississippi, he intended {{to raise money for}} SNCC, but found that the university had banned all political activity and fundraising. He told Karlyn Barker in 1964 that it was a question as to whose side one was on. [...] "Are we {{on the side of the}} civil rights movement? Or have <b>we</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the comfort and security of Berkeley, California, and can we forget the sharecroppers whom we worked with just a few weeks back? Well, we couldnâ€™t forget." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{that will}} give us {{something}} to do--when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Oak Hall!" [...] cried Phil. [...] "We'll organize a posse to round up the wild man!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Too bad. Maybe if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> your bunker we {{can find}} some." [...] The other boot fell. Tasso reached up for the light cord. [...] "Good night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are in a}} run of bad luck," [...] said Dick. [...] "I {{really believe}} we will {{have all sorts of}} trouble before <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the United States." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means, Dias," [...] Harry said; [...] "for the present, I {{have seen}} {{enough of this}} side of the mountains. <b>We</b> will <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Cuzco and make a fresh start from there." ...|$|R
5000|$|From [...] "When {{will this}} change be over so <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work?" [...] to [...] "What can I do to help?"Get them {{involved}} {{in implementing the}} change. Help them {{to become part of}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like to {{look for}} the watch," [...] said Snap. [...] "But if <b>we</b> don't <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp Whopper and Tommy will worry about us---and there is no telling what the Spink crowd will do in our absence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No racing to-day!" [...] warned Jack. [...] "You {{save your}} breath, Andy. We expect to skate and tramp {{a good many}} miles to-day before <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She'll {{hear all}} about it some day," [...] said Billy. [...] "You've no notion what a splendid story I'll make out of all this when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Cove!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know that. Still, I cannot {{bring myself}} to take their lives--and we can't stop to take them along as prisoners. The sooner <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the fort the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, mother, {{somebody}} {{has got to}} fight the French," [...] insisted the son. [...] "If we don't fight them, and whip them, how shall <b>we</b> ever <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our home? I don't want to give all that up, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Close in, Luke; <b>we</b> must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house; there's no show of {{our being}} able to do {{anything}} here," [...] Mark cried to his brother, as he set the example by leading Susan {{in the direction of the}} stockade.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop, Shep! I am blue enough already. I'll {{tell you}} what it is: By hook or by crook, <b>we</b> must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp before to-night. If we don't the others will be worried to death about us, I am sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And now, gentlemen,' said Joe, {{who seemed}} to be the {{spokesman}} of the party, for all the rest were silent; 'the sooner <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Black Lion, the better, perhaps.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And the man may {{be caught}} before <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Oak Hall," [...] said Roger. He {{crossed the room}} and peered into a closet. [...] "Has anybody seen my {{baseball}} shoes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm not croaking," [...] {{answered}} the smaller {{member of the}} Gun Club. [...] "I shall be satisfied if <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> camp alive with such a snow all around us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By all means, sonny my boy! We will advance. But {{with common}} sense. We must never {{go so far}} that <b>we</b> can't <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our base. Above all, we must never, unless it is life or death, fire off our guns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it sounds}} well," [...] commented Martin, critically. [...] "If I know {{anything}} of those Spaniards, <b>we</b> shan't <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Leyden without something happening. But I don't like that {{bit about the}} women; as likely as not they will spoil everything." ...|$|R
50|$|Eventually, <b>Wes</b> <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his apartment, {{only to find}} Samantha {{there to}} his shock and surprise. She apologizes and tells Wes she stole the {{diamonds}} from Isaac and that Isaac won't stop until they are dead {{and he has the}} diamonds but Wes is still heartbroken that she would betray him like that as he felt guilty {{for not being able to}} help her and believed that she was dead for so long. Samantha also tells him that Nicole wants the diamonds as well and tells him to meet her under a bridge. Just then, one of Isaac's henchmen shows up, and Samantha kills him after much effort. Wes is frightened, and leaves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he isn't that breed, that's why," [...] {{answered}} Phil. [...] "He {{hates to}} see another fellow become popular. Dave, you take my advice and watch him, when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> school." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{were off}} the trail--it's the campfire told them where," [...] went on the former teacher. [...] "Now, {{what are we going}} to do when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> town, tell me that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll have a {{story or}} two to tell, when <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Oak Hall," [...] {{continued}} Dave. [...] "I wish {{we could have had}} one of the deer stuffed for the museum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is out of}} the question," [...] Neal replied decidedly, {{speaking}} quickly, as if afraid Jake might {{agree to}} the scheme. [...] "You know <b>we</b> must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our own country as soon as possible, for if father is alive he will suffer great anxiety concerning us." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{felt the}} {{pressure}} of Cavor's hand upon my arm. He spoke in an undertone, as though he feared to wake some sleeping thing. [...] "Let us keep together," [...] he whispered, [...] "and look for the sphere. <b>We</b> must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the sphere. This is beyond our understanding." ...|$|R
60|$|In Leghorn, as {{everywhere}} else, we were chilled to the heart, {{except when}} the sunshine fell directly upon us; and {{we returned to}} the steamer with a feeling as if <b>we</b> were <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our home; for this life of wandering makes a three days' residence in one place seem like home.|$|R
