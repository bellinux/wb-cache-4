5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their <b>wings</b> <b>only</b> loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – rippling the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E

25|$|After the {{caterpillar}} {{becomes a}} butterfly, the toxins shift to {{different parts of}} the body. Since many birds attack the wings of the butterfly, having three times the cardiac glycosides in the wings leaves predators with a very foul taste and may prevent them from ever ingesting the body of the butterfly. In order to combat predators that remove the <b>wings</b> <b>only</b> to ingest the abdomen, monarchs keep the most potent cardiac glycosides in their abdomens.|$|E
25|$|When it was {{discovered}} in 1937 that the RAF was planning eight-gun batteries for its new Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters, {{it was decided that}} the Bf 109 should be more heavily armed. The problem was that the only place available to mount additional guns was in the <b>wings.</b> <b>Only</b> one spot was available in each wing, between the wheel well and slats, with room for only one gun, either a 7.92mm MG 17 machine gun, or a 20mm MG FF or MG FF/M cannon.|$|E
25|$|The TB was a {{seaplane}} {{with twin}} fuselages, situated 10ft (3.35m) apart, with the pilot in one fuselage and the observer in the other, having {{no means of}} communication other than hand signals. Each of the twin fuselages was a wooden structure with fabric covering, with a tractor engine {{in front of each}} fuselage. It had fabric-covered, wooden unstaggered, unswept and unequal-span wings. The upper wing extension was wire braced to steel pylons above the wing. The Blackburn had ailerons on the upper <b>wings</b> <b>only.</b>|$|E

25|$|Then, on March 3, 1929, {{a serious}} {{military}} coup took place, led by General José Gonzalo Escobar and heeded by various other generals. In these days, the air force's remaining airplanes consisted of worn and shot Bristol F.2 Fighter, Bristol Boarhound, de Havilland DH-4B and Douglas O-2C, {{a force that}} was not suitable to defeat Escobar's power. In this context, the Mexican government convinced the U.S. government to promote the peace south of its border and quickly make available twelve new OU-2M Corsair with the 400hp Wasp engine, nine Douglas O-2M, four Stearman C3B and six Waco Taper <b>Wings.</b> <b>Only</b> two weeks after making the request, the U.S. government agreed, and several Mexican pilots travelled to Brownsville, Texas, and New York {{to pick up the}} new aircraft. The key victory was decided in late March 1929 at the Battle of Jiménez, Chihuahua, where after several days of air raids, Escobar was defeated by General Calles, taking about 6000 prisoners. This rebellion was quite serious, since a third of the officials and nearly 30,000 soldiers rebelled; in two months, more than 2000 men had been killed.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred. Murphy noted:On December 20th, 1912, I photographed a pair of teals feeding in a trickle of water which ran through tall tussock grass from the melting edge of a glacier. The birds were well hidden by the screen of grass, and I almost stumbled over them before seeing them. They appeared quite unconcerned, however, and continued prodding about in the mud. When I had come within two steps of them, they raised their heads and waddled farther off among the hummocks, from where they peered out through drooping grass. All but the bright eyes and yellow bills blended completely with the surroundings. Matthews has well said that their pattern fits in so thoroughly with the environment that it is sometimes only {{the movement of the}} conspicuous yellow bill that calls one’s attention to their presence. Many observers have noted the birds’ preference to lose themselves in the grass when they are approached, rather than to seek safety in the air, and it is likely that before the arrival of men and guns at South Georgia they used their <b>wings</b> <b>only</b> for relatively short and infrequent flights.|$|E
25|$|By the summer, 1944 the Germans {{had lost}} the Crimean {{campaign}} and the Soviets were able to pursue operations that would break into Eastern Europe. German fighter units continued to take a heavy toll of Soviet aviation. However, the entry of types, such as Lavochkin La-7 and Yak-3, presented a problem for German fighters. With <b>wings</b> <b>only</b> 9.8 metres long, {{it was one of}} the lightest and smallest fighters of the war. The Yak-3 was faster and more manoeuvrable than the Bf 109 and the Fw 190. According to Soviet tests with captured German fighters, the Yak-9U also out performed the Fw 190. Further, the liberation of the Donbass region improved metal supplies. The IL-2’s weakness was its wing and tail structure, which was now made from metals. This contributed to a reduction in losses. The Luftwaffe had a small number of Fw 190s on the Eastern Front by this time. SG 3 and SG 5 was equipped with Fw 190s in June 1944. II./SG 2 was fully equipped with Fw 190s, while III./SG 2 was a mixed unit of Ju 87s and Fw 190s. By June 1944, the German fighter order of battle contained mostly the Bf 109. 1. Fliegerdivision, Luftflotte 6, contained SG 1 and 10 totalling 76 Fw 190s. JG 54, attached to Jagdabschnittfuhrer Ostland (Fighter Area East) of Luftflotte 1 had on strength 32 Fw 190s. 3 Fliegerdivision contained mixed units, including the Fw 190, which were 64 aircraft strong, although the number of Fw 190s is unknown. Luftflotte 4, I. Fliegerkorps contained units from SG 2, 10 and 77 numbering 27, 29 and 33 respectively.|$|E

2500|$|The A.W.14 Starling was {{developed}} by Armstrong Whitworth {{to meet the requirements}} of Specification 28/24, for a single-seat fighter capable of operating in day and night-time conditions to replace Armstrong Whitworth's earlier Siskin. It was a single-bay sesquiplane (a biplane with the lower wing much smaller than the upper) with staggered unequal span wings. The fuselage had a bolted steel-tube structure, while the wings had steel spars and wooden ribs and were fitted with ailerons on the upper <b>wings</b> <b>only.</b> The wings used the experimental RAF 30 aerofoil section, which is symmetrical, with zero camber. Armament was two synchronised [...]303 in Vickers machine guns.|$|E
2500|$|The C.101 was {{designed}} to be a deep reconnaissance aircraft with the performance of contemporary fighters and able to carry some offensive weapons. [...] The military classification was Grandes Raids (G.R.) (English: major flights). It was a wooden single bay sesquiplane with strongly outward leaning interplane struts. A tandem pair of inverse V-form cabane struts supported the upper wing over the fuselage. In plan both upper and lower fabric covered wings were rectangular apart from angled tips and a semi-circular cut-out in the upper trailing edge to improve the pilot's upward view. The lower wings were almost a 63% scaled copy of the upper ones, with the same aspect ratio. There were ailerons on the upper <b>wings</b> <b>only.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The SA-100 Starduster was {{designed}} by Louis A. Stolp and George M. Adams as a light sports aircraft for homebuilding from plans. [...] It is a single bay biplane with fabric covered, wooden framed staggered wings, each pair braced by a single, wide chord interplane strut aided by bracing wires. [...] A total of eight centre section struts join the upper wing to the fuselage, basically two pairs in N-form but with the forward strut doubled. The lower wing is unswept and has 1.5° of dihedral; the upper wing has 6° of sweep on its leading edge, no dihedral and a greater span. [...] There are ailerons on the lower <b>wings</b> <b>only,</b> but no flaps.|$|E

2500|$|An all-metal, {{stressed-skin}} wing of duraluminium (a DERD specification {{similar to}} AA2024) {{was introduced in}} April 1939 and was used {{for all of the}} later marks. [...] "The metal skinned wings allowed a diving speed that was [...] higher than the fabric-covered ones. They were very different in construction but were interchangeable with the fabric-covered wings; one trials Hurricane, L1877, was even flown with a fabric-covered port wing and metal-covered starboard wing. The great advantage of the metal-covered wings over the fabric ones was that the metal ones could carry far greater stress loads without needing so much structure beneath." [...] Several fabric-wing Hurricanes were still in service during the Battle of Britain, although a good number had had their wings replaced during servicing or after repair. Changing the <b>wings</b> <b>only</b> required three hours work per aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The Blackburn B-2 was {{developed}} by Blackburn as a successor for its earlier Bluebird IV trainer, retaining the layout and side-by-side seating of the earlier aircraft, but having a semi-monocoque all-metal fuselage, instead of the metal and fabric-covered fuselage used by the earlier aircraft. The single-bay biplane wings were of similar structure {{to those of the}} Bluebird IV and could be folded for easy storage. Leading edge slots were fitted to the upper wing to improve low-speed handling, with ailerons on the lower <b>wings</b> <b>only.</b> The conventional landing gear was fixed, with the mainwheels supported on telescopic legs and a spung tailskid. The prototype B-2 (registered G-ABUW) first flew on 10 December 1932, powered by a [...] de Havilland Gipsy III engine, although the [...] de Havilland Gipsy Major and 120hp Cirrus Hermes IV engines were also fitted to production aircraft. Testing proved successful, with the aircraft proving to be very manoeuvrable, and the first production aircraft flew in 1932.|$|E
2500|$|Many sesquiplanes have flown, {{the great}} {{majority}} of types having a smaller lower wing than upper. [...] The CLA.4, unusually, was an inverted sesquiplane with a smaller upper wing, joining a small group of aircraft like the Fiat CR.1 of 1924 and the later Caproni Ca.100, Caproni Ca.164 and Levasseur PL.15, all military machines. [...] There is a small aerodynamic penalty for this arrangement, but the advantages for a club machine are good vision, and ease of escape, from both cockpits. [...] In the case of the CLA.4, the upper wing had a span of 80% of the lower and 83% of its chord. [...] The wings were straight, unswept and of constant chord apart from at the rounded tips, with ailerons on the lower <b>wings</b> <b>only.</b> The CLA.4 was a single bay biplane with inward leaning single wide chord interplane struts with wide, faired roots. [...] Two pairs of centre section struts held the upper wing well clear of the fuselage; the absence of stagger made wing-folding easy. [...] Like {{much of the rest of}} the aircraft, the wings were of fabric covered wood.|$|E

2500|$|Dorothy L. Sayers {{notes that}} Satan's three faces are thought {{by some to}} suggest his control over the three human races: red for the Europeans (from Japheth), yellow for the Asiatic (from Shem), and black for the African (the race of Ham). All interpretations {{recognize}} that the three faces represent a fundamental perversion of the Trinity: Satan is impotent, ignorant, and full of hate, {{in contrast to the}} all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving nature of God. Lucifer retains his six wings (he originally belonged to the angelic order of Seraphim, described in Isaiah 6:2), but these are now dark, bat-like, and futile: the icy wind that emanates from the beating of Lucifer's <b>wings</b> <b>only</b> further ensures his own imprisonment in the frozen lake. He weeps from his six eyes, and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins. Each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor. Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths, respectively, for their involvement in the assassination of Julius Caesar (March 15, 44 BC) – an act which, to Dante, represented the destruction of a unified Italy and the killing of the man who was divinely appointed to govern the world. In the central, most vicious mouth is Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Christ. Judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors: his head is gnawed inside Lucifer's mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by Lucifer's claws. According to Dorothy L. Sayers, [...] "just as Judas figures treason against God, so Brutus and Cassius figure treason against Man-in-Society; or we may say that we have here the images of treason against the Divine and the Secular government of the world".|$|E
