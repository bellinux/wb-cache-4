40|$|Northern <b>corn</b> <b>rootworms,</b> Diabrotica barberi Smith and Lawrence, and <b>western</b> <b>corn</b> <b>rootworms,</b> D. virgifera virgifera LeConte, are {{perennial}} {{insect pests}} of corn, Zea mays L., {{grown in the}} same field for successive years. The primary control tactics used against <b>corn</b> <b>rootworms</b> in Iowa are soil insecticides and crop rotation. However, in some regions of the Corn Belt, over-reliance on both tactics has resulted in control failures, indicating that alternative strategies need to be incorporated for sustainable management of these pests. The first objective {{was to determine if}} row spacing and plant population of <b>corn</b> influenced <b>corn</b> <b>rootworm</b> survival, larval injury, and plant tolerance to the injury. Although beetle survival was greater in 38 -cm compared to 76 -cm rows, the increase did not translate into greater root injury. There were no differences in tolerance to <b>corn</b> <b>rootworm</b> injury between row spacings. However, tolerance was suppressed at the high plant population. Growers who reduce row spacing from 76 cm to 38 cm to maximize grain yield should not increase the potential for <b>corn</b> <b>rootworm</b> injury. The second objective was to develop and validate models that accurately predicted adult <b>corn</b> <b>rootworm</b> emergence in Iowa. The models predicted adult emergence from the first day a beetle emerged in a field (biofix). Degree-days post-biofix explained 85 % of the variability in total <b>corn</b> <b>rootworm</b> emergence over five years, and the model explained 89 % of the variability in emergence observed in the validation year. The PheroconRTM CRW Trap (Trece, Inc. Salinas, CA 93907) was highly efficient at determining the biofix. The third objective was to use female ovarian development to determine if scouting could be made more efficient. Based on emergence, population estimates taken on plants, and ovarian development, the period between 120 and 400 degree-days post-biofix was the optimum time for scouting <b>corn</b> <b>rootworm</b> adults in Iowa. This represents approximately one third of the total time beetles could be present in the field.

40|$|Parental RNAi (pRNAi) is an RNA {{interference}} response {{where the}} gene knockdown phenotype is {{observed in the}} progeny of the treated organism. pRNAi has been demonstrated in female <b>western</b> <b>corn</b> <b>rootworms</b> (WCR) via diet applications and {{has been described as}} a potential approach for rootworm pest management. However, it is not clear if plant-expressed pRNAi can provide effective control of next generation WCR larvae in the field. In this study, we evaluated parameters required to generate a successful pRNAi response in WCR for the genes brahma and hunchback. The parameters tested included a concentration response, duration of the dsRNA exposure, timing of the dsRNA exposure with respect to the mating status in WCR females, and the effects of pRNAi on males. Results indicate that all of the above parameters affect the strength of pRNAi phenotype in females. Results are interpreted in terms of how this technology will perform in the field and the potential role for pRNAi in pest and resistance management strategies. More broadly, the described approaches enable examination of the dynamics of RNAi response in insects beyond pRNAi and crop pests...|$|R
40|$|Predatory mites are {{important}} components of subterranean food webs and may help regulate densities of agricultural pests, including <b>western</b> <b>corn</b> <b>rootworms</b> (Chrysomelidae: Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). Implementing conservation and/or classical biocontrol tactics could enhance densities of specialist or generalist predatory mites {{and lead to}} pest suppression, but first relevant mite species must be identified and their predatory capabilities evaluated. We conducted lab assays to quantify consumption of immature rootworms and oviposition rates of various mite species. Our study indicates that rootworms are a sub-optimal food source for the mite taxa tested. However, all mite species fed upon rootworms to some degree, although consumption by nematophagous Eviphis ostrinus was extremely low. Predators consumed more rootworm larvae than eggs, and mite size was correlated with prey consumption, with larger predators eating more prey. Four mite taxa (Gaeolaelaps sp., S. miles, Gl. americana, and G. aculeifer) had detrimental effects on survival of rootworm larvae, and the latter two species also had negative impacts on densities of pest eggs.

A nondiapause colony developed through artificial selection in the early 1970 s is particularly attractive for many studies because its generation time is much shorter than that of typical diapause colonies. However, the nondiapause colony has been in culture for ≈ 190 generations without out-crossing. We compared variation at six microsatellite loci among individuals from the NCARL nondiapause colony (≈ 190 generations), main diapause colony (≈ 22 generations), four regional diapause colonies (3 - 8 generations), and four wild populations. Genetic diversity was very similar among the diapause laboratory colonies and wild populations. However, the nondiapause colony showed ≈ 15 - 39 % loss of diversity depending on the measure. Pairwise estimates of FST were very low, revealing little genetic differentiation among laboratory colonies and natural populations. The nondiapause colony showed the greatest genetic differentiation with an average pairwise FST of 0. 153. There was little evidence that the laboratory colonies had undergone genetic bottlenecks except for the nondiapause colony. The nondiapause colony has suffered a moderate loss in genetic diversity and is somewhat differentiated from wild populations. This was not unexpected given its history of artificial selection for the nondiapause trait, and {{the large number of}} generations in culture.

Two varieties of popcorn (M 140, 105 d and M 3374 Y, 118 d), one mixture of popcorn (50 % 105 d and 50 % 118 d), and field corn (DK 580, 108 d) were evaluated. Significantly higher densities of O. nubilalis larvae were found in popcorn than field corn. Moth oviposition and larval distribution were evaluated using 105 d popcorn embedded in several cornfields across Iowa. Significantly more egg masses and larvae {{were found in the}} popcorn compared with field corn. One or two rows of field corn adjacent to popcorn tended to have higher numbers of egg masses and larvae compared with background field corn. Number of eggs per egg mass was significantly higher in popcorn than field corn. These data suggests more O. nubilalis are produced in popcorn than field corn. Popcorn has no effect on O. nubilalis egg mass and larval distribution after 1. 5 m. The second objective was to determine if popcorn can influence <b>corn</b> <b>rootworm</b> distribution. Two varieties of popcorn (105 -d and 118 -d), one mixture of popcorn (50 %: 105 -d and 118 -d), and field corn (108 -d) were evaluated. Significantly higher numbers of <b>western</b> and northern <b>corn</b> <b>rootworm</b> adults were captured from popcorn plots in 2000 and 2002.

40|$|Pherocon AM (PhAM) {{trapping}} {{and visual}} counting are two commonly used methods for identifying maize {{fields in the}} USA that contain {{a sufficient number of}} adult <b>western</b> <b>corn</b> <b>rootworms</b> (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte to cause economic root damage by larvae the following year. Therefore, the estimation of adult WCR population {{plays an important role in}} management decisions (rotation or treatment). The goals of this study were (1) to compare adult WCR data obtained by PhAM trapping to “whole plant count” data in different maize developmental stages, (2) to determine the period in which the data obtained by both methods show the highest correlation, (3) to determine the regression curve between capture of WCR on PhAM as an independent variable and number of WCR observed by visual plant count, and (4) to determine if the “whole plant count” method can serve as a substitution for PhAM trapping under European conditions. Three samplings were conducted in 2006 in 38 fields in Croatia and one sampling was conducted in 22 fields in Serbia. Sampling in Croatia was conducted when maize plants were in the R 65 - 69, R 73 - 77 and R 79 - 85 developmental stages according to BBCH identification keys of maize. Sampling in Serbia was conducted when maize plants reached R 69 - 71 developmental stages. Three to six PhAM traps were placed in each 0. 5 to 4 ha maize field seven days prior to sampling. Visual counts were conducted on the same day as trap inspections. Adult WCR densities in the PhAM traps were correlated to adult densities on whole plants. Statistical analyses comparing the results of PhAM trapping with the visual “whole plant count” method showed that there is a significant medium to strong correlation between them. Correlation coefficients varied depending on the data used in the analysis. When sampling was conducted in the first half of August (maize developmental stages R 69 - 77), the correlation coefficients were the highest (r (R 6971) = 0. 8677 and r (R 73 - 77) = 0. 706). Coefficients of determination were the highest as well [r 2 (R 69 - 71) = 0. 753; r 2 (R 73 - 77) = 0. 4984]. Therefore, the most appropriate period for sampling is during the first half of August. At that time, the majority of the maize plants were between the R 69 and R 77 developmental stages. According to the results, 0. 5 – 1 visually determined adult/plant corresponds to 40 adults/trap/week. This shows that both methods are equally useful for estimating the population densities of WCR in the Central European region...|$|R
