The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers {{were able to go}} out on a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last to go out in Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time towards the end of the session.|$|E

5|$|Modeled on The Lord of the Rings, the Ice and Fire {{story begins}} with a tight focus on a small group (<b>with</b> <b>everyone</b> in Winterfell, except Daenerys) and then splits into {{separate}} stories. The storylines are to converge again, but finding the turning point in this complex series has been difficult for Martin and has slowed down his writing. Depending on the interview, Martin {{is said to have}} reached the turning point in A Dance with Dragons, or to not quite have reached it yet in the books. The series' structure of multiple POVs and interwoven storylines was inspired by Wild Cards, a multi-authored shared universe book series edited by Martin since 1985. As the sole author, Martin begins each new book with an outline of the chapter order and may write a few successive chapters from a single character's viewpoint instead of working chronologically. The chapters are later rearranged to optimize character intercutting, chronology, and suspense.|$|E

Usher and the clubbers then perform a final organised choreography, mainly krumping, and the video ends.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a scene of a leopard with glowing blue eyes (later {{revealed}} to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway.

Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.|$|E
5000|$|Tradition {{of songs}} - Singing a song {{together}} in an Eaglet Circle is a sacred moment, and it cannot be just any song.

This tradition also extends to any tasks done; similarly to singing, tasks have to be done from the beginning to the end.
