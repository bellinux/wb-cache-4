Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E

In this paper, a simple and efficient encoding algorithm and its implementation are presented to reveal the hidden information in the binary matrix of a <b>weave</b> pattern and thus {{to find a solution}} to determine features of the <b>weave</b> pattern. By compiling the 32 components with different shapes of yarn cross-sections, it is possible to quickly produce the required <b>weave</b> geometries and <b>weave</b> textures at different levels of detail. A set of frequency matrices of a <b>weave</b> pattern can be considered as the fingerprint where each <b>weave</b> pattern is uniquely endowed with a set of frequency spectra.

40|$|In textile design, fabric <b>weave</b> pattern {{indexing}} {{and searching}} require extensive manual operations. There {{has been little}} or no research on index and efficient search algorithms for fabric <b>weave</b> patterns.

The paper uses pattern clusters, boundary description code, neighbor transitions, Entropy and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) directionality as a hybrid approach for the cognitive analysis of fabric texture. Then, we perform a comparison and classification {{of a wide variety}} of <b>weave</b> patterns. There are three common patterns used in textile design: (1) plain <b>weave,</b> (2) twill <b>weave,</b> and (3) satin <b>weave.</b> First, we classify <b>weave</b> patterns into these three categories according to the industrial <b>weave</b> pattern definition and <b>weave</b> point distribution characteristics.

Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were <b>woven</b> to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than <b>woven</b> raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E

40|$|Motorway {{capacity}} is constrained by turbulent sections such as merging, diverging and <b>weaving</b> areas. A motorway <b>weaving</b> section is {{a segment of}} the road in which an on-ramp is followed by an off-ramp with limited spacing between them. Various equations have been adopted to determine the capacity of such <b>weaving</b> sections. Some of these include factors such as <b>weaving</b> ratio (R), volume ratio (VR) and <b>weaving</b> configuration which influence the <b>weaving</b> capacity. In this paper, drivers’ behaviours at <b>weaving</b> sections were studied in order to assess the effect on capacity of such sections and to aid {{in the development of a}} micro-simulation model to evaluate the performance of these sections for various configurations. Factors such as VR, R, the upstream traffic characteristics, the frequency of lane changes (FLC), the percentage of the pre-segregation for the upstream traffic of <b>weaving</b> section and the length of <b>weaving</b> section were investigated. Therefore, seven sites of <b>weaving</b> sections with different configurations and lengths have been selected. The results of the analysed data indicated that the FLC differs according to the configuration of the <b>weaving</b> section. For example, in the case of ramp <b>weaving</b> sections (i. e. lane gain/lane drop), the results indicated that the maximum FLC in every 76 metres (i. e. equivalent to 250 feet) within the <b>weaving</b> section is up to 1500 per hour. This value was found to be much higher than those reported in other studies. In addition, the effective length that is used by those <b>weaving</b> vehicles is also influenced by the type of <b>weaving</b> configuration. For short <b>weaving</b> sections (i. e. 150 metres or less) the effective length is basically the whole length, whereas, for relatively longer <b>weaving</b> sections (i. e. 300 metres or more), the effective length is found to be equal to 200 metres or less...|$|R
