5|$|As a goaltender, Lehman was {{a strong}} skater and good puckhandler. He chased down loose pucks, {{and was able to}} pass the puck to his forwards, {{surprising}} the other team's defenders. Playing in the OPHL, Lehman scored a goal by shooting the puck in the opponent's net. The first NHL goaltender to duplicate such a feat was Ron Hextall, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in 1987.|$|E

Nova won the National League's Pitcher of the Month Award for April 2017, after he led the league with an 0.75 WHIP, was second with 36 innings pitched and a 1.50 ERA, and threw two complete games (one shutout). After throwing six shutout innings against the Miami Marlins on June 11, Nova became the first Pirate to throw at least six innings in his first thirteen starts to begin a season since Eddie Solomon in 1981, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> seventeen times. Nova's streak {{came to an end}} at fifteen starts, after pitching five innings of two run ball in a 6-2 win over the Rays in his sixteenth start of the year. By the All-Star break Nova was 9-6 with a 3.21 ERA in 120⅔ innings, with a WHIP of 1.09.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees chose Ruffing {{as their}} {{starting}} pitcher for Opening Day in 1931. During the 1931 season, Ruffing had a 16–14 win-loss {{record with a}} 4.41 ERA. The Yankees finished the season in second place. On August 13, 1932, Ruffing threw a complete game shutout and {{hit a home run}} in the tenth inning off of Washington Senators' pitcher Tommy Thomas to give the New York Yankees a 1–0 victory. Ruffing became the first pitcher in major league history to win a game 1–0, hit a home run in the game, and strike out ten or more batters. Two other pitchers have since achieved this feat: Early Wynn in 1957, and Yovani Gallardo, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> in 2009. Ruffing won 18 games during the 1932 season. He had a 3.09ERA, second in the AL only to Lefty Grove's 2.84. Ruffing had 190 strikeouts, which led the AL. The Yankees won their first pennant since 1928. Ruffing won his first World Series game during the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs. He started Game One, and the Yankees swept the Cubs four games to zero.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make such an arrangement work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

25|$|Maddux's second stint {{with the}} Chicago Cubs lasted until mid-2006, {{when he was}} traded {{for the first time}} in his career, to the Los Angeles Dodgers. At the time, the Dodgers were in the thick of a playoff race. In his first Dodger start, Maddux threw six no-hit innings before a rain delay {{interrupted}} his debut. In his next start, Maddux needed just 68 pitches to throw eight shutout innings. On August 30, 2006, he won his 330th career game, passing Steve Carlton to take sole possession of 10th on the all-time list. On September 30, 2006, Maddux pitched seven innings in San Francisco, allowing two runs and three hits in a 42 victory over the Giants, clinching a postseason spot for the Dodgers and notching another 15-win season. It was Maddux's 18th season among his league's Top 10 for wins, breaking a record he'd shared with Cy Young and Warren Spahn, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> 17 times apiece. However, the Dodgers were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Mets. Maddux started the third and final game, throwing an ineffective no-decision. Maddux was honored with a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding pitcher in MLB for 2006.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{began the}} 2017 season on April 3 at Dodger Stadium against the San Diego Padres.

He allowed one unearned run in seven innings, while striking out eight. The Dodgers won 14–3 and Kershaw remained undefeated in openers. Joc Pederson hit a grand slam {{home run in the}} third inning, the first grand slam hit by a Dodger on opening day since Raúl Mondesí hit one in 1999. Switch-hitting Yasmani Grandal homered twice, one from each side of the plate. The first Dodger in history to do so on opening day and only the third to hit two opening day homers for the Dodgers in the same game, joining Mondesí (<b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> twice, in 1995 and 1999) and Roy Campanella (1954). Clayton Richard pitched eight scoreless innings as the Padres evened the series with a 4–0 win in game two. Rich Hill allowed one run in five innings and Yasiel Puig hit his first home run of the season as the Dodgers won the next game 3–1. He hit two more homers the next day as the Dodgers took the series with a 10–2 rout of the Padres.|$|E

25|$|When modern {{political}} parties {{were created in}} Serbia, in 1881, the Progressive Party {{turned out to be}} the only of the three Serbian parties (the other two being the mostly pro-Russian Liberal Party and very pro-Russian Radical Party) that was ready to make an agreement with Austria-Hungary, which became the most influential country in Serbia after the Congress of Berlin in 1878. The ruler decided to open a new page in Serbian foreign policy and arranged that a secret convention should be signed with the Habsburg Monarchy. Mijatović was gradually entrusted by the ruler to complete this task and on June 28, 1881 he signed the Secret Convention by which Serbia got the diplomatic and political backing of the Habsburg Empire but abandoned her independence in the field of Foreign Policy. When the two other most prominent members of the Cabinet, Prime Minister Piroćanac and Home Minister Garašanin learned about the exact contents of the Convention they decided to resign but had to accept the new reality in the end. In return Mijatović had to resign his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs and kept only his tenure at the Ministry of Finance. His last act as Minister of Foreign Affairs was to sign a Consular Convention and a Commercial Agreement with the United States of America on October 14. 1881. During talks that preceded the signing of the Secret Convention Mijatović was well received in Vienna by the Emperor Francis Joseph and other dignitaries of the Empire. The Emperor later decorated him with the first class of the Order of the Iron Crown, which entitled its bearer to become Austro-Hungarian count. Serbian citizens were banned by the Serbian constitution to accept any nobility titles. It is not clear if Mijatović ever officially submitted application to become an Austro-Hungarian count, yet he used this title openly since 1915, being the only Serb from the Kingdom of Serbia <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
