40|$|S u m m a r y: An aseptic {{dual culture}} of grape {{phylloxera}} (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae FITCe) and grape vine (Vitis spp.) was developed. This method permits continuous observation of phylloxera feeding {{and the whole}} plant response on a dynamic basis. The plant/parasite interaction ofthreetestplants (V. vinifera L., var. Riesling, SO 4 (V. berlandieri PLANCH. xV riparia L.) and V. riparia, var. Gloire de Montpellier) are demonstrated by observing post-infectious reactions of the host- and population dynamics of the parasite. Different stages of phylloxera could be observed including nymphs, <b>winged</b> <b>phylloxera</b> (alatae) and sexual male phylloxera. Several potential applications for this aseptic dual culture are demonstrated. K e y w o r d s: Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, phylloxera, Vitis, aseptic dual culture...|$|E
