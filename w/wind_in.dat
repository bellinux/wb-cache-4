In 1998, she traveled to New York to help promote a special showing of Gone with the <b>Wind.</b> <b>In</b> 2003, she appeared as a presenter at the 75th Academy Awards. In 2004, Turner Classic Movies produced a retrospective piece called Melanie Remembers {{in which she was}} interviewed for the 65th anniversary of the original release of Gone with the <b>Wind.</b> <b>In</b> June 2006, she made appearances at tributes commemorating her 90th birthday at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.|$|E
5|$|Much {{is still}} unknown about the radius of maximum <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> {{tropical}} cyclones, including {{whether or not}} it can be predictable.|$|E
5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E

5|$|From November28 to November30, {{the storm}} brought light rains {{to most of}} eastern Cuba. Although the cyclone had {{tropical}} storm-force winds at the time, the highest recorded <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> Cuba was 12mph (18km/h) in Havana and only 0.22in (5.58mm) of rain fell in the city. The Swan Islands, off the northern coast of Honduras, recorded 2.36in (59.94mm) of precipitation during a three-day span.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of February24, a house caught fire and the flames were spread to other {{buildings}} by the <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> two hours, most of Holmden Street, and parts of Brown and Second Streets, were reduced to smoldering ashes.

5|$|Into the 1990s, Bathurst gained wider {{recognition}} from television audiences, first as writer Mark Taylor in Joking Apart from 1993 to 1995, then as David Marsden in Cold Feet from 1998 to 2003.

40|$|When seen at frost cap minimum, Martian north polar erg dunes {{north of}} 80 deg N record east winds, while those south of that {{latitude}} record west winds. Many of the transverse dunes {{are considered to}} be reversing dunes, and dunes in the two fields may have reversed at least once during the lifetime of the Viking Orbiters. It is proposed that the average polar winds are strong, off-pole northwest <b>winds</b> <b>in</b> the fall, moderate west <b>winds</b> <b>in</b> winter, latitude-dependent weak-to-strong off-pole northeast <b>winds</b> <b>in</b> spring, and weak west <b>winds</b> <b>in</b> summer, as has been largely confirmed by Viking images of near polar clouds. Over millenia, the combination of reversing west and east winds could produce the biomodal distributions of dune orientations observed at the north pole...|$|R

5|$|On television, the American Broadcasting Company aired it for {{the first}} time right after its 1979 re-release. The first U.S. {{broadcast}} attracted 57 percent of the total audience, the second highest televised movie share at the time behind Gone with the <b>Wind.</b> <b>In</b> the United Kingdom, 23 million people watched its inaugural broadcast in October 1981, the second biggest TV audience ever for a feature film behind Live and Let Die.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett's {{earliest}} inspirations were The <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> the Willows by Kenneth Grahame, and {{the works}} of Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. His literary influences have been P.G.

5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the determination of the windspeed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or wind shear. This demanded an accurate determination of the <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> the general area of the target, and would normally be highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods of determining the <b>wind.</b> <b>In</b> the case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method of determining the wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.|$|E

5|$|The {{solar wind}} is quite {{different}} from a terrestrial <b>wind,</b> <b>in</b> that its origin is the sun, and it is composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the planetary wind is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres. Over long periods of time, the planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres.|$|E
5|$|A {{fungus gnat}} from New Zealand, Arachnocampa luminosa, {{lives in the}} predator-free {{environment}} of caves and its larvae emit bluish-green light. They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects, and <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> their fishing-lines when prey becomes entangled. The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function. Orfelia fultoni builds sticky little webs and emits light of a deep blue colour. It has an inbuilt biological clock and, even when kept in total darkness, turns its light on and off in a circadian rhythm.|$|E
5|$|As the Ju 87s {{reached the}} coast, the {{respective}} groups split off {{and headed for}} their assigned targets. By this time, some 15 miles off the Isle of Wight, the Bf 109s had caught up and were now zigzagging around the dive-bombers. Bode led III./StG 77 to attack from the northwest, dead into <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> order to bomb accurately. Usually the Ju 87s attacked in line astern, but Bode chose to attack in groups of three to split the anti-aircraft fire. To keep the enemy's heads down, he fired his machine guns in an 80-degree dive. He soon left an altitude of 13,000feet, releasing his bombs and pulling out at 2,275feet. The rest of his unit followed.|$|E

5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar <b>wind</b> <b>in</b> magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|Aspiring {{musician}} and scenester Bob Markley managed {{to join the}} group the Laughing <b>Wind</b> <b>in</b> exchange for his connections {{in the music industry}} and substantial bankroll. The original five-piece line-up consisted of Michael Lloyd (rhythm guitar, vocals), Shaun Harris (bass guitar, vocals, Danny Harris (lead guitar, vocals), John Ware (drums), and Markley (tambourine, vocals). Although Markley possessed the least musical talent, his expertise in law enabled him to assume control of the group's name and publishing, which generated a divide in the WCPAEB's creative mindset.|$|E
