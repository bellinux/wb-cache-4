5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{security}} after the 2016 election, {{there have been}} some detentions and arrests that have been related to the increased security at the tower. On December 6, a woman managed to bypass security and go to the 24th floor—two floors below Donald Trump's office—before being stopped by Secret Service officers. A week later on December 13, a Baruch College student who was arrested at Trump Tower was found to have multiple weapons, including knives, a garrote, and firecrackers. The next day, another man reportedly got angry after he wanted to meet Donald Trump at the tower, and after throwing a <b>wine</b> <b>glass</b> onto the floor of the tower's lobby, was subsequently detained by the NYPD.|$|E
25|$|A wine's {{color is}} better judged by putting it against a white background. The <b>wine</b> <b>glass</b> is put {{at an angle}} {{in order to see}} the colors. Colors can give the taster clues to the grape variety, and whether the wine was aged in wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{bouquet of}} wine is best {{revealed}} by gently swirling the wine in a <b>wine</b> <b>glass</b> to expose it to more oxygen and release more aromatic etheric, ester, and aldehyde molecules {{that comprise the}} essential components of a wine's bouquet.

50|$|Most common <b>wine</b> <b>glasses</b> can {{be divided}} into three types: red <b>wine</b> <b>glasses,</b> white <b>wine</b> <b>glasses</b> and {{champagne}} flutes. Wine tumblers (without stems) are also increasing in popularity.|$|R

5000|$|Most <b>wine</b> <b>glasses</b> have stems, {{although}} [...] "stemless" [...] <b>wine</b> <b>glasses</b> are {{now available}} {{in a variety of}} sizes and shapes as well. These glasses are typically used more casually than their traditional counterparts, as they negate the benefits of using stemmed <b>wine</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|R
25|$|Anyway, in the {{southern}} coastal areas the presence of Mediterranean merchants from the 6th century BC onward, would have occasioned an increase in social inequality, bringing {{a large number of}} importations (fine pottery, fibulae, <b>wine,</b> <b>glass</b> and other products) and technological innovations, such as round granite millstones, which would have merged with the Atlantic local traditions.|$|E
25|$|To ensure {{impartial}} {{judgment of}} a wine, {{it should be}} served blind – that is, without the taster(s) having seen the label or bottle shape. Blind tasting may also involve serving the wine from a black <b>wine</b> <b>glass</b> to mask {{the color of the}} wine. A taster's judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, price, reputation, color, or other considerations.|$|E
25|$|Brandy is {{traditionally}} served {{at room temperature}} (neat) from a snifter, a <b>wine</b> <b>glass</b> or a tulip glass. When drunk at room temperature, it is often slightly warmed by holding the glass cupped in the palm or by gentle heating. Excessive heating of brandy may cause the alcohol vapour to become too strong, causing its aroma to become overpowering. Brandy drinkers who like their brandy warmed may ask for the glass to be heated before the brandy is poured.|$|E

25|$|The Seder {{table is}} {{traditionally}} set with the finest place settings and silverware, {{and family members}} {{come to the table}} dressed in their holiday clothes. There is a tradition for the person leading the Seder to wear a white robe called a kittel. For {{the first half of the}} Seder, each participant will only need a plate and a <b>wine</b> <b>glass.</b> At the head of the table is a Seder plate containing various symbolic foods that will be eaten or pointed out during the course of the Seder. Placed nearby is a plate with three matzot and dishes of salt water for dipping.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the American Revolution, the British began taxing American colonies {{to raise}} revenue. Residents of South Carolina were {{outraged by the}} Townsend Acts that taxed tea, paper, <b>wine,</b> <b>glass,</b> and oil. To protest the Stamp Act, South Carolina sent the wealthy rice planter Thomas Lynch, twenty-six-year-old lawyer John Rutledge, and Christopher Gadsden to the Stamp Act Congress, held in 1765 in New York. Other taxes were removed, but tea taxes remained. Soon {{residents}} of South Carolina, {{like those of the}} Boston Tea Party, began to dump tea into the Charleston Harbor, followed by boycotts and protests.|$|E
25|$|The Flame of Liberty {{was erected}} in 1989 on the Place de l'Alma in Paris above the {{entrance}} to the tunnel in which the fatal crash later occurred. It has become an unofficial memorial to Diana. In addition, there are two memorials inside Harrods department store, commissioned by Dodi Fayed's father, who owned the store from 1985 to 2010. The first memorial is a pyramid-shaped display containing photos of the princess and al-Fayed's son, a <b>wine</b> <b>glass</b> said to be from their last dinner, and a ring purchased by Dodi the day prior to the crash. The second, Innocent Victims, unveiled in 2005, is a bronze statue of Fayed dancing with Diana on a beach beneath the wings of an albatross.|$|E

25|$|Although {{most of the}} {{communities}} of this period had mostly self-sufficient isolated economies, one important change was the return of trade with the Mediterranean by the now independent Carthage, a thriving Western Mediterranean power. Carthaginian merchants brought imports of <b>wine,</b> <b>glass,</b> pottery and other goods {{through a series of}} emporia, commercial post which sometimes included temples and other installations. At the same time, the archaeological register shows, through the finding of large quantities of fibulae, pins, pincers for hair extraction, pendants, earrings, torcs, bracelets, and other personal objects, the ongoing importance of the individual and his or her physical appearance. While the archaeological record of the Castro Iron Age show suggests a very egalitarian society, these findings imply the development of a privileged class with better access to prestige items.|$|E
25|$|After pairing, {{both will}} {{search for a}} {{suitable}} breeding site. The female has the final say on nest location. Some males {{have been known to}} feed their paired females for up to 2–3 weeks before and during the selection of the nest site and building of the nest. Their breeding sites are mainly in rainforest regions or sheltered, humid gulies with an abundance of dense cover such as trees, saplings, shrubs and vines. The nest, will usually be built at the fork between two nearly horizontal tree branches in proximity to a water source, such as a stream. The structure of the nest is often compared to a <b>wine</b> <b>glass</b> with a broken bottom stand. The nest is built, usually in November, December and January, using thin strips of tree bark, grass, moss rootlets and decayed wood.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{engagement}} Graham commissioned William Hogarth to paint as a conversation picture a cabin portrait {{to celebrate his}} victory, probably using the cabin of the Nottingham as a setting. Hogarth painted Graham smoking his pipe in his cabin before dinner, while listening to pipe and tabor music played by his black servant, while his chaplain and clerk sing. Two dogs are visible, one is Graham's own, which joins in the singing. The other is Trump, Hogarth's dog, which is shown wearing Graham's wig, holding a scroll, and reading from a sheet of music propped against a <b>wine</b> <b>glass.</b> A steward, holding a plate of fowl, looks out of the painting at the viewer with a smile, and drops gravy {{down the back of}} the chaplain's neck. The painting has several political and social allusions in Hogarth's satirical style. Cabin scenes in oil are rare, and Hogarth's is considered by the current owner, the National Maritime Museum, to be the most famous in British art.|$|E

25|$|The {{day before}} Reese and Bianca's wedding, Kendall refuses {{to attend the}} ceremony. Zach tries to {{convince}} her to change her mind, saying that she is acting childish, but Kendall explains that he and Bianca betrayed her. Bianca receives word that Kendall will not be coming to her wedding and immediately rushes to Kendall's home to insist she attend. Kendall says that she will only come to the wedding as long as Bianca promises to leave for Paris soon afterward and take Reese and baby Gabrielle with her. Bianca reluctantly agrees. Later that night, Reese and Bianca have a wedding rehearsal. Kendall picks up a <b>wine</b> <b>glass</b> and makes a snarky toast to Reese and Bianca but particularly to Reese. Reese becomes upset; she grabs a bottle of wine, a glass, and walks off. Bianca follows her, but Reese wants to be alone. Zach later finds Reese and consoles her. He pulls her into a hug and then kisses her passionately; Reese kisses back. After a few moments, with Ryan having witnessed their kiss, unknown to them, they agree that the kiss never happened and that they already have people they are deeply in love with. Ryan later confronts Zach about the kiss, but Zach says it was nothing and nonchalantly walks away from Ryan.|$|E
25|$|A Gin Pennant {{means that}} the wardroom is {{inviting}} officers from ships in company to drinks. The origins of the Gin Pennant are uncertain, {{but it seems to}} have been used since the 1940s and probably earlier. Originally it was a small green triangular pennant measuring approximately , defaced with a white <b>wine</b> <b>glass,</b> nowadays the gin pennant is a Starboard pennant defaced with a wine or cocktail glass. Its colour, size and position when hoisted were all significant as the aim was for the pennant to be as inconspicuous as possible, thereby having fewer ships sight it and subsequently accept the invitation for drinks. The Gin Pennant is still in regular use by Commonwealth Navies, such as the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Within the RAN it is common practice, whilst in port, for junior officers of one ship to attempt to raise the Gin Pennant on the halyard of another ship, thereby forcing that ship to put on free drinks for the officers of the ship that managed to raise the pennant. If, however the junior officers are caught raising the pennant, then it is their ship that must put on free drinks within their Wardroom. Usually this practice is restricted to Commonwealth Navies; however, prior to increased force protection, RAN officers have successfully raised the Gin Pennant on a number of units in the USN.|$|E
25|$|Graham {{is seated}} {{to the right}} of the picture, on the left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing {{forwards}} though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. Ronald Paulson identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain. The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a pipe and tabor. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat. The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own pug, Trump. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a <b>wine</b> <b>glass</b> in front of him.|$|E

500|$|After dismissing Anthony Julius, a Mishcon de Reya lawyer, Mills stated {{she would}} {{represent}} {{herself in the}} upcoming divorce hearing, with help from her sister Fiona, David Rosen, a solicitor-advocate, and Michael Shilub, an American attorney. In leaked documents, Mills complained that McCartney was often drunk, smoked cannabis, stabbed her with a broken <b>wine</b> <b>glass,</b> pushed her over a table, and pushed her into a bathtub when she was pregnant. Referring to her part in the marriage, Mills {{said that she had}} been a full-time wife, mother, lover, confidante, business partner and psychologist to McCartney. McCartney's lawyers studied Mills's book: Life Balance: The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing (2006), as it contradicted many of her claims, such as when she praised McCartney for [...] "Bringing me breakfast in bed every morning, no matter how he feels, and I do the dinner, so we've got that agreement. It's thoughtfulness". Mills's father reconciled with his daughter after meeting her and McCartney, when they introduced him to his granddaughter, Beatrice. After their separation, he said that it [...] "took guts to represent yourself at the High Court", and that he was proud of his daughter, even though he thought she would be [...] "torn to shreds" [...] by McCartney's lawyers.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} 10 deleted scenes where Homer {{turns on the}} radio {{listening}} to a song about a trucker who crashed his truck out on I-95, and one more {{where some of the}} truckers try to flatten Homer's truck. In order to animate Barclay's truck in [...] "Maximum Homerdrive", Scott bought a model truck, which he also based the design of Barclay's truck on. According to storyboard consultant Mike B. Anderson, the trucks in the episode were very difficult to animate, as the Simpsons animators were still working with traditional cel animation at the time and did not have access to computer tools. In a scene in The Slaughterhouse, an employee is shown killing a number of cows with a captive bolt pistol, however the death of the cows are not shown. Originally, the writers wanted to show the cows being killed, however when Scott saw the scene in the storyboards, the Simpsons staff instead decided to make the deaths [...] "indirect". During the meat eating contest, Homer becomes exhausted and sees two <b>wine</b> <b>glass</b> holding cows, who appear as [...] "wavy" [...] figures. In order to achieve the [...] "wavy" [...] effect, the Simpsons animators put a ripple glass on the cels and moved it around while shooting the scene. After the contest, Barclay dies of [...] "beef poisoning". The Fox censors were uneasy with including any mention of [...] "beef poisoning" [...] in the episode, as talk show host Oprah Winfrey had recently been sued by [...] "some Texas ranchers" [...] for defaming the beef industry. In a scene in the episode, Homer buys a jar of [...] "Stimu-Crank" [...] pills in order to stay alert while driving during the night. He swallows all the pills at once, to the clerk's dismay. Homer replies, [...] "No problem, I'll balance it out with a bottle of sleeping pills", and proceeds to swallow an entire jar's worth of sleeping pills. According to Scully, the censors had [...] "a lot of trouble" [...] with the scene, but it was included anyhow.|$|E
