5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go}} out for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
5|$|Mostow, an {{immigrant}} from Uzbekistan {{with a history}} of involuntary commitment, is charged with killing seven men by mutilating their faces. Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) become involved in the investigation when Mostow insists that he was possessed during the killings; his claims are given credence when another murder occurs after his arrest. Mostow draws a gargoyle and claims it made him kill. The agents meet with Patterson <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> three years on the case. Mulder knows Patterson from his time in the Investigative Support Unit at Quantico. Their relationship is tense, and Patterson is skeptical of Mulder's theories. Mulder and Scully go to Mostow's studio and discover a hidden room full of gargoyle sculptures, finding corpses within them.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Northern Water Tribe, Katara {{continues}} teaching Aang Waterbending while the group searches for an Earthbending teacher. They meet Toph Beifong, a twelve-year-old, blind tomboy and Earthbending prodigy who wants independence from her upper-class family. Pursued by Azula, Zuko and Iroh lead new {{lives in the}} Earth Kingdom as wanderers and refugees {{in the capital city}} of Ba Sing Se. At a library guarded by the spirit Wan Shi Tong, Aang and his group learn that an imminent solar eclipse could let them stop the Fire Nation before Sozin's Comet arrives. They journey to Ba Sing Se to inform the Earth King of this information. In the city, they find that the Earth King Kuei is being manipulated by Long Feng, leader of the Dai Li secret police. After Aang's group exposes Long Feng's political machinations, Toph is captured but manages to escape by learning to bend metal. The Dai Li join Azula to instigate a coup d'état of Ba Sing Se, and Zuko, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> his time in Ba Sing Se trying {{to come to terms with}} his identity, ultimately sides with his sister Azula. During a face off in the catacombs underneath the ancient city, Azula nearly kills Aang, forcing the protagonists to retreat with help from Iroh, leaving the Earth Kingdom under the control of the Fire Nation.|$|E

25|$|November 2: The Braves {{announced}} several internal roster {{moves that}} allowed for additional {{space on the}} forty-man roster. After spending the month of September 2011 with the Major League club, the team outrighted catcher J. C. Boscán, right-handed pitcher Stephen Marek, and outfielders Antoan Richardson and Wilkin Ramírez to the triple-A affiliate Gwinnett Braves. In addition, the Braves filled one roster spot with starting pitcher Todd Redmond, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> the previous three seasons pitching for Gwinnett. Accumulating a record of 10–8 with a 2.92 ERA in 2011, Redmond is unlikely to have playing time with the Major League club due to existing pitching depth.|$|E

500|$|When {{he finally}} decided to abandon Fountain City, Chabon recalls staring at his blank {{computer}} for hours, before suddenly picturing [...] "a 'straitlaced, troubled {{young man with a}} tendency toward melodrama' trying to end it all." [...] He began writing, and within a couple of days, had written 50 pages of what would become his second novel, Wonder Boys. Chabon drew on his experiences with Fountain City for the character of Grady Tripp, a frustrated novelist <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> years working on an immense fourth novel. The author wrote Wonder Boys in a dizzy seven-month streak, without telling his agent or publisher he'd abandoned Fountain City. The book, published in 1995, was a commercial and critical success.|$|E
500|$|Vukovar was {{systematically}} looted {{after its}} capture. A JNA soldier who fought at Vukovar told the Serbian newspaper Dnevni Telegraf that [...] "the Chetnik [...] behaved like professional plunderers, {{they knew what}} to look for in the houses they looted." [...] The JNA also participated in the looting; an official in the Serbian Ministry of Defence commented: [...] "Tell me of even one reservist, especially if he is an officer, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> more than a month at the front and has not brought back a fine car filled with everything that would fit inside the car." [...] More than 8,000 works of art were looted during the battle, including the contents of the municipal museum, Eltz Castle, which was bombed and destroyed during the siege. Serbia returned 2,000 pieces of looted art in December 2001.|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{appeared}} as a correspondent on The Daily Show between 1997 and 2005. During this time, the comedian developed the character that would later {{form the basis for}} his Colbert Report persona, one that its creator calls a [...] "fool <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> a lot of his life playing not the fool". Colbert frequently cites Stone Phillips — whom he describes as having [...] "the greatest neck in journalism" [...] — as a source of inspiration for the character, as well as Geraldo Rivera, [...] "because he's got this great sense of mission... He just thinks he's gonna change the world with this report". As a correspondent, Colbert was regularly pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, fellow correspondent Steve Carell, or host Jon Stewart in scripted exchanges which typically revealed the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he was discussing. Other Daily Show correspondents have since adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two".|$|E

500|$|Unlike Stewart, who {{essentially}} hosted The Daily Show as himself, Colbert {{developed a}} correspondent character for his {{pieces on the}} series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as [...] "a fool <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> {{a lot of his}} life playing not the fool– one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with". Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing. Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two". Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated [...] "I just decided I was going to do my best Stephen Colbert impression".|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>spent</b> time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E

Her 17th birthday {{at the beginning of the}} game marks her official ascension into the Adlehyde royal family and departure from the school. Before she is able to leave, however, she is contacted by a mysterious voice who beckons her to a hidden library deep within the abbey. It is there that she confronts and defeats a demon using her fledgling magic skills, and frees a powerful entity known as a [...] "Guardian" [...] from a sealed book. The Guardian informs Cecilia that her royal blood allows her to be a medium between the real world and the spirit dimension occupied by the avatars of all the world's elemental forces, and that she will be instrumental in securing the future and reconstruction of the barren planet. Throughout her life she has disliked being just a figurehead known as [...] "Cecilia the princess" [...] and not as [...] "Cecilia the girl". One of her reasons for joining Rudy and Jack was so she would not be lonely. It is hinted that she may be in love with Rudy. [...] In Alter Code F, it is also shown that Jane harbors a crush on Rudy as well.|$|E
