60|$|The {{doctor was}} in and disengaged. He came at once into the waiting-room, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shown--a respectable family practitioner, with {{intelligent}} face and courteous manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had always}} been fond of female society. My experience, however, had {{hitherto}} been among the rough daughters of the backwoodsmen; and I felt an awe of young ladies in 'store clothes,' and delicately brought up. Two or three of the married ladies of Bardstown, who had heard me at the debating club, determined that I was a genius and undertook to bring me out. I believe I really improved under their hands; became quiet <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> shy or sulky, and easy <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> impudent.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was the {{beginning}} of it all. Oh dear, oh dear; when I think of it I find it so hard to see <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> right, and <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> wrong. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> very wrong all this evil could not have come upon me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The fact is,' resumed Nicholas, 'that before I {{left the}} country, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{for some time}} past, I {{undertook}} to deliver a message to you.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. [Playing {{with her}} fan.] But have we really met before, Lady Chiltern? <b>I</b> canâ€™t {{remember}} <b>where.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> out of England for so long.|$|R
60|$|Then {{came the}} first {{assembly}} of the year. I got back from Bentley Manor, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a-visiting the Fotheringays, {{just in time to}} call for Patty in Gloucester Street.|$|E
6000|$|... "An' ye {{had been}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> [...] Ye wad na be sae cantie, O; [...] An' ye had seen what I ha'e seen' [...] On the braes o' Killiecrankie, O." ...|$|E
60|$|My mother {{spread out}} the skins near the fireplace, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in the custom of sleeping, and Paul dutifully laid himself down, while his father {{remained}} at the table evidently in a brown study.|$|E
6000|$|... "I return here, O Umbezi, {{to speak}} with the white chief, Macumazahn. As to <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> that is my affair, and not yours or Masapo's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have learned," [...] said Hester, [...] "that nothing {{matters in}} all God's universe, except love. There <b>is</b> no pride <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> and no false ideals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a shamed man, Freydisa," [...] I said, [...] "and can {{no longer}} stay in this land <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made one for {{children}} to mock at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "August 29th.--I {{returned}} yesterday from Carclew, Sir C. Lemon's fine {{place about}} five miles off; <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> staying a couple of days, with apparently the heartiest welcome. Susan was asked; but wanting a Governess, could not leave home.|$|E
60|$|We {{were half}} {{hidden by the}} clump of bushes {{in the garden of}} the {{dwelling}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> screened from view of Elias Macomber, when we saw a man approaching leisurely, and looking from side to side in search of some one.|$|E
60|$|Travelling {{some little}} time {{back in a}} wild part of Connemara, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> for fishing and seal-shooting, I had the good luck to get {{admission}} to the chateau of a hospitable Irish gentleman, and to procure some news of my once dear Ottilia.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{called himself}} my guardian. I {{believe that when}} I was very young {{he took me to}} the convent <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ever since. Two days ago he came to fetch me away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} it very improbable," [...] I answered. [...] "I have made out {{a list of}} all the people <b>I</b> <b>have</b> met in America, and the house in Lenox <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> staying." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{my return}} from Ireland, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{travelling}} a few weeks, I found your present of George Peele's works, and the obliging letter accompanying it; {{for both of}} which I offer my cordial thanks.|$|R
60|$|Approaching {{the door}} of our lodgings, I saw my husband walking {{backward}} and forward before it, evidently waiting for my return. If he asked me the question, I decided to tell him frankly <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> and what had passed between his mother and myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hunting," [...] replied Striped Chipmunk, and shivered. [...] "He {{was hunting}} me. He had found my tracks <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{gathering}} beechnuts, {{and he was}} following them with his nose just the way Bowser the Hound follows Reddy Fox. I nearly died of fright when I saw him." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{accepted}} his suggestion, {{and by his}} assistance and {{the help of the}} rough window-frame, I got into the hole feet first, and soon ejected myself into the midst of my alarmed companions. When they heard <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> and what I had seen, they were naturally astounded.|$|E
6000|$|And see {{the town}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was born! [...] Around those happy fields we span [...] In boyish gambols;--I <b>was</b> lost [...] <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> {{but on this}} coast [...] I feel I am a man. [...] 70 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> out," [...] she admitted. [...] "I do not think, Capitaine Rotherby, that I {{must tell}} you <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> but <b>I</b> went to the one place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> thought that <b>I</b> might <b>have</b> news of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] she cried. [...] "There is {{the proper}} station, there <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{manoeuvring}} to bring you." [...] And then, suddenly, [...] "Kep,"[21] said she, flung me a folded billet, and ran from the apartment laughing.|$|R
60|$|I had {{all along}} {{maintained}} a quiet post {{at a corner}} of the table, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able to indulge my humour undisturbed: listening attentively when the story was very good, and dozing a little when it was rather dull, which I consider the perfection of auditorship.|$|E
60|$|The {{light from}} the big window fell right on the picture. I took {{a good look at}} it. Then I shifted a bit nearer and took another look. Then I went back to <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> at first, because it hadn't seemed quite so bad from there.|$|E
60|$|He {{wasted no}} time. With a hook-like clutch {{that was almost}} a blow, so swift was it, he flung me bodily out of the rear end of the wagon. I had barely time to crawl out from under when father, mother, and the baby came down pell-mell <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been.</b>|$|E
60|$|MRS. JONES. Yes, your Worship, and {{of course}} if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> let him into the house it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very wrong of me; and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never done such a thing {{in any of the}} houses <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> employed.|$|R
60|$|One of the {{few places}} that my soul will haunt, when I am dead, will be this. Among the trees here near Ebersteinburg, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> alone and written this book. I can't leave these trees. They have taken some of my soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "The letter {{which was}} written to me about you was sent to me in Belgium, at Brussels, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> living--a town near {{the place where the}} famous Battle of Waterloo was fought; and as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> run away from Waterloo it {{followed}} me to England.|$|R
60|$|I took {{to my bed}} in the two-roomed {{thatched}} hut <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> comfortably established, {{and sent}} for a gallon of rum. That was not for myself. Drunk, Stamford was the best doctor between the Andes and the Pacific. He came, sat at my bedside, and drank himself into condition.|$|E
60|$|Still unsatisfied, the Induna {{questioned}} me as to {{the places}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> during this journey of mine in the Zulu country. I told him with the utmost frankness, mentioning among others--because I was sure that already he knew all my movements well--the town of the People of the Axe.|$|E
60|$|At the {{appointed}} time, we {{stood at the}} door--the door of that house <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> a few days since, so happy: where my youthful confidence and warmth of heart had been yielded up so freely: which was closed against me henceforth: which was now a waste, a ruin.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A stranger!' she returned, {{stopping}} {{between each}} short reply, {{and looking at}} the fire. 'Yes. Ten or a dozen years a stranger. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> no almanack <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been.</b> Ten or a dozen years. I don't know this part. It's much altered since I went away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} {{a great deal about}} Mr Stumfold," [...] {{continued}} Mr Rubb, not appearing to observe the lady's altered manner, [...] "not only here and <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> for the last few days, but up in London also. He is quite a public character, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] he said. [...] "This isn't {{interesting}} to you, of course. As you say, {{the business side}} is the more important. I will {{see you at the}} hotel to-morrow night. Considering <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> this evening, it is scarcely wise for us to be seen together." ...|$|R
