5|$|In 1991 a {{research}} {{group led by}} Clarence A. Ryan, isolated an 18 amino acid polypeptide from tomato leaves that induced the production of protease inhibitor proteins (PIs) in response to <b>wounding.</b> Experiments using synthetic radio-labelled forms of the polypeptide demonstrated that {{it was able to}} travel systemically through the plant and induce PI production in unwounded leaves. Because of the systemic nature of the <b>wounding</b> signal, it was named systemin, it was the first polypeptide found to function as a hormone in plants. mRNA encoding for systemin is found in all tissues of the plant except the roots. Later studies identified homologs of tomato systemin in other members of the Solanaceae including potato, black nightshade and bell pepper. Systemins have only been identified in the Solaneae subtribe of the Solanaceae, but other members of the family, such as tobacco, also respond to <b>wounding</b> by systemically producing protease inhibitors.|$|E

40|$|AbstractÐSeveral <b>wound</b> healing rate {{measures}} have been introduced with the main goal of enabling quanti®cation {{of the effects of}} various therapeutic modalities on the healing of open <b>wounds.</b> Different de®nitions of <b>wound</b> healing rate render comparison of clinical results dif®cult. The goal {{of the present study was}} to propose a measure of <b>wound</b> healing rate that is independent of initial <b>wound</b> extent and to present a method of <b>wound</b> healing rate prediction. Comparisons were made of <b>wound</b> healing rate de®ned as absolute area healed per day, percentage of initial area healed per day and advance of the <b>wound</b> margin towards the <b>wound</b> centre per day. Analysis was performed on 300 <b>wound</b> cases. A disadvantage of <b>wound</b> healing measures that either use absolute area healed per day or percentage of initial area healed per day is their very limited use for comparing healing rates of <b>wounds</b> with different initial sizes. This disadvantage was overcome by incorporating a <b>wound</b> perimeter; thus obtaining a measure of the advance of the <b>wound</b> margin towards the <b>wound</b> centre. A de®nition of healing rate expressed as the greatest average <b>wound</b> margin distance from the <b>wound</b> centre divided by the time to complete <b>wound</b> closure is proposed. Because not all <b>wounds</b> are closed in the observation period, the time to complete <b>wound</b> closure has to be predicted. A method of <b>wound</b> healing rate prediction is presented based on a delayed exponential model the parameters of which are obtained from at least ®ve weekly <b>wound</b> area measurements. Paired ttests between actual time needed to complete <b>wound</b> closure and the predicted time resulted in p ˆ 0. 062 after four, 0. 484 after ®ve and 0. 900 after six weeks of observation.

5|$|Systemin and AtPEP1 {{are found}} in the cell cytosol. The {{precursor}} to tomato systemin is transcribed as a 200 amino acid polypeptide. It does not contain a putative signal sequence suggesting that it is synthesised on free ribosomes in the cytosol. The precursor to AtPEP1 is a 92 amino acid polypeptide and also lacks a signal sequence. In tomato, mRNA encoding the precursor for systemin is present at very low levels in unwounded leaves but accumulates upon <b>wounding,</b> particularly in the cells surrounding the sieve elements of the phloem in vascular bundles of mid veins. The precursor accumulates exclusively in the phloem parenchyma cells of leaves in tomato after <b>wounding.</b> The precursor to potato systemin is also localised in a similar manner suggesting it is under the same cell-type-specific regulation in both species.|$|E
