5|$|Analysis of the {{spectrum}} can also reveal the surface gravity of the star. This is usually expressed as log g, the base-10 logarithm of the gravitational acceleration given in CGS units, in this case, cm/s². Beta Pictoris has logg=4.15, implying a surface gravity of 140 m/s², <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> half of the gravitational acceleration at {{the surface of the}} Sun (274m/s²).|$|E

In the 15th century, St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio, was built to serve as a chapel of ease for St Ceidio's. In 2006, one author noted that St Ceidio's had not been {{regularly}} used for some years, but restoration work had been carried out by local people. St Mary's, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 0.75miles (1.25km) to the west, is no longer used for services either, but is in ruins.|$|E
5|$|Berkelium-247 can {{maintain}} chain reaction both in a thermal-neutron {{and in a}} fast-neutron reactor, however, its production is rather complex and thus the availability is much lower than its critical mass, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 75.7kg for a bare sphere, 41.2kg with a water reflector and 35.2kg with a steel reflector (30cm thickness).|$|E
5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> {{the speed of a}} human sprinter.

5|$|During the flyby of July 14, 2005, the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) found a warm region {{near the}} south pole. Temperatures {{in this region}} ranged from 85–90 K, with small areas showing as high as , much too warm to be {{explained}} by solar heating, indicating that parts of the south polar region are heated from the interior of Enceladus. The presence of a subsurface ocean under the south polar region is now accepted, but it cannot explain {{the source of the}} heat, with an estimated heat flux of 200mW/m2, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating alone.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted. The {{lethal dose}} {{for an adult}} human is 30mg/kg, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 2.1–2.4grams for a human {{weighing}} 70 to 80kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E

5|$|HAT-P-33b is {{a planet}} that has 0.764 Jupiter masses and 1.827 Jupiter radii.

HAT-P-33b orbits its star at an average distance of 0.0503 AU, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> 5% of the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This orbit is completed every 3.474474 days (83.39 hours). HAT-P-33b has an equilibrium temperature of 1838 K, which is almost fifteen times hotter than the measured equilibrium temperature of Jupiter (124 K).|$|E

5|$|In the {{six years}} leading up to 2013, more than 10 million {{beehives}} were lost, often to CCD, nearly twice the normal rate of loss. To put this in perspective, according to U.N.

5|$|Near the coast, {{halfway between}} the Quantocks and the Mendips, and lying {{parallel}} to them, is the low ridge of the Polden Hills. On either side is a coastal plain and wetlands area known as the Somerset Levels, an area of about , much of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> above sea level. The northeasterly part of the Levels is drained by the Axe and Brue, and the southwesterly part by the Parrett and its main tributary, the Tone. This part of the Levels has traditionally been known as Sedgemoor, and to the east is Glastonbury Tor, an isolated hill projecting from the low-lying plain.|$|E

5|$|The Nigerian {{health care}} system is {{continuously}} faced with a shortage of doctors known as 'brain drain', because of emigration by skilled Nigerian doctors to North America and Europe.

5|$|The {{embryonic}} heart begins beating {{at around}} 22 days after conception (5 {{weeks after the}} last normal menstrual period, LMP).

The embryonic heart rate then accelerates and reaches a peak rate of 165–185 bpm early in the early 7th week (early 9th week after the LMP). After 9 weeks (start of the fetal stage) it starts to decelerate, slowing to around 145 (±25) bpm at birth. There is no difference in female and male heart rates before birth.|$|E
