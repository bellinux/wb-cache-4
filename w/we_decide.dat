The commission received thousands of letters both supporting Bryant's stance and condemning the commission; {{at one point the}} U.S. Postal Service installed bomb detection equipment for the mail collected for delivery to the Florida Citrus Commission. The publicity director for the Florida Department of Citrus told a reporter from the Associated Press, [...] "The whole Anita thing is a mess.

500|$|Other {{philosophers}} {{of biology}} argue instead that biological teleology is irreducible, and cannot be removed by any simple process of rewording. Francisco Ayala argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of. Karen Neander similarly {{argued that the}} modern concept of biological 'function' depends on natural selection. So, for example, {{it is not possible}} to say that anything that simply winks into existence, without going through a process of selection, actually has functions. <b>We</b> <b>decide</b> whether an appendage has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, Neander argues, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection, function must be defined by reference to the history of a species, and teleology cannot be avoided. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr likewise stated that [...] "adaptedness... is an a posteriori result rather than an a priori goal-seeking." ...|$|E

2500|$|Here’s an example: Suppose we {{see before}} us {{a parking lot}} full of {{hundreds}} of cars. <b>We</b> <b>decide</b> {{to go around the}} entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After an hour or so we have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some cars have bad tires”. Or we could say: “It’s not true that ‘All the cars have good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the cars have good tires”. Let us go to another lot. Here we discover that “All the cars have good tires.” We might say, “There’s not a single instance of a car having a bad tire.” [...] Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{his attack}} is {{directed}} against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reasons don't cause you to do anything, because having sufficient reason wills (but doesn't force) {{you to do that}} thing. So in any decision situation we experience a gap between our reasons and our actions. For example, when <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> to vote, we do not simply determine that we care most about economic policy and that we prefer candidate Jones's economic policy. We also have to make an effort to cast our vote. Similarly, every time a guilty smoker lights a cigarette they are aware of succumbing to their craving, not merely of acting automatically as they do when they exhale. It is this gap that makes us think we have freedom of the will. Searle thinks whether we really have free will or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says: [...] " [...] All rational activity presupposes free will [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|How then, are [...] "fictitious" [...] {{forces to}} be {{separated}} from [...] "real" [...] forces? It is hard to apply the Newtonian definition of an inertial frame without this separation. For example, consider a stationary object in an inertial frame. Being at rest, no net force is applied. But in a frame rotating about a fixed axis, the object appears to move in a circle, and is subject to centripetal force (which is made up of the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force). How can <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> that the rotating frame is a non-inertial frame? There are two approaches to this resolution: one approach is to look for the origin of the fictitious forces (the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force). We will find there are no sources for these forces, no associated force carriers, no originating bodies. A second approach is to look at a variety of frames of reference. For any inertial frame, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force disappear, so application of the principle of special relativity would identify these frames where the forces disappear as sharing the same and the simplest physical laws, and hence rule that the rotating frame is not an inertial frame.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{campaigns have}} been {{particularly}} controversial. Newkirk was criticized in 2003 for sending a letter to PLO leader Yasser Arafat asking him to keep animals out of the conflict, after a donkey was blown up during an attack in Jerusalem. The group's 2003 [...] "Holocaust on your Plate" [...] exhibition—eight [...] panels juxtaposing images of Holocaust victims with animal carcasses and animals being transported to slaughter—was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League, which said, [...] "the effort by Peta to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews {{to the issue of}} animal rights is abhorrent" [...] and [...] "ather than deepen our revulsion against what the Nazis did to the Jews, the project will undermine the struggle to understand the Holocaust and {{to find a way to}} make sure such catastrophes never happen again." [...] In July 2010, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that PETA's campaign was not protected by free speech laws and banned it within Germany as an offense against human dignity. The exhibit, however, had been funded by an anonymous Jewish philanthropist and created by Matt Prescott, who lost several relatives in the Holocaust. Prescott said: [...] "The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possible—that we can do anything we want to those <b>we</b> <b>decide</b> are 'different or inferior'—is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We're asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in factory farms." [...] And analogies between animal rights and the Holocaust had been initiated by the prominent Jewish author Isaac Bashevis Singer. In 2005, the NAACP criticized the [...] "Are Animals the New Slaves?" [...] exhibit, which showed images of African-American slaves, Native Americans, child laborers, and women, alongside chained elephants and slaughtered cows.|$|E
