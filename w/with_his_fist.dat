5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b>|$|E
5|$|A large robotic craft arrives {{searching for}} Finn. When Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) finally {{encounters}} it, Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) destroys it <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b> Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) examines the wreckage and discovers its location of origin; this engenders in Finn {{a desire to}} discover the craft's creators. Finn thus resolves to travel across the sea from whence the craft came, but before leaving, he tells Fern (voiced by Hayden Ezzy) to stay and look after Ooo for him. Princess Bubblegum, Marceline (voiced by Olivia Olson) and Fern see Finn, Jake and Susan Strong (voiced by Jackie Buscarino) off on their voyage. Initially, the journey is easy and uneventful, but soon, Finn, Jake, and Susan encounter a sea dragon named Whipple (voiced by Josh Fadem), who {{turns out to be}} rather annoying. BMO (voiced by Niki Yang), who unbeknownst to the others was stowing away on their boat, angrily tells Whipple off, which causes the sea dragon to summon a storm and destroys their boat. This predicament forces Jake to use his magical powers and take on the shape of a boat for the rest to ride. Unfortunately, {{below the surface of the}} water, a species of jellyfish latches onto him, which causes Jake to begin hallucinating. Eventually, after much struggle, Finn and Susan are able to remove them, which causes the hallucinations to end. At this point, Jake complains about wanting to return home, but Finn reveals how important this trip is to him. Whipple overhears Finn's lament and begins to feel sorry for his actions; he then uses his powers to blow the group over the dangerous waters.|$|E
25|$|Germany's {{opponent}} in the semifinals was Italy. The Italians had the better chances to score but Lehmann made several spectacular saves, including one in extra time where he dived out of goal to intercept an Italian player who had broken loose from the defence, punching the ball clear <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> and temporarily knocking out the Italian in the process. He allowed two goals within a minute of each other {{with only a few}} seconds remaining in extra time, which put Italy into the World Cup final. The retiring Oliver Kahn was given the honour of starting in the third place play-off match, an offer made by Lehmann himself. Kahn was made captain for that game due to the injury to Michael Ballack. Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 for the third place (bronze) medals.|$|E

25|$|On July 20, 2017, it was {{revealed}} that Lamplighter bouncer Adam Sobanski had been charged with two counts of aggravated battery after his role in the incident, a felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison. Prosecutors state that the video provided by TMZ clearly shows Sobanski choking Chislof, detailing that Sobanski had rushed Chislof, put him in a headlock, and then choked him while pinning him up against a wall before eventually pushing him to the ground and striking him <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist.</b> Prosecutors also revealed that Sobanski admitted to a history of physical violence and had previously choked other bar patrons, contributing to a demotion within the bar due to his behavior. Sobanski appeared in court on August 11, 2017, where he was indicted on two counts of aggravated battery.|$|E
25|$|On May 16, 1562, Adham Khan, Akbar's {{general and}} foster brother, was defenestrated twice for murdering a rival general, Ataga Khan, {{who had been}} {{recently}} promoted by Akbar. Akbar was woken up in the tumult after the murder. He struck Adham Khan down personally <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> and immediately ordered his defenestration by royal order. The first time, his legs were broken {{as a result of}} the 12 meter fall from the ramparts of Agra Fort but he remained alive. Akbar, in a rare act of cruelty probably exacerbated by his anger at the loss of his favorite general, ordered his defenestration a second time, killing him. Adham Khan had wrongly counted on the influence of his mother and Akbar's wet nurse, Maham Anga, to save him as she was almost an unofficial regent in the days of Akbar's youth. Akbar personally informed Maham Anga of her son's death, to which she famously commented, 'You have done well.' She died 40 days later of acute depression.|$|E
25|$|Murphy {{opened the}} 2013 season on 2 February with nine points against Kildare {{in the opening}} league game at Croke Park. Analysts praised the skills he {{displayed}} throughout that game; {{at one point in}} the second half he stretched high into the air to meet a miscalculated free from Paddy McBrearty and gave it an almighty thump <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> over the bar, while on another occasion he left the Kildare defender stumbling along the ground as he sidestepped him and casually at an angle from distance, with the appearance of little effort whatsoever, kicked the ball over the bar. Against Tyrone on 3 March, he scored 3 from 4 of Donegal's points and then, shortly before half-time, having had a penalty saved by TG4 Man of the Match Niall Morgan, Murphy struck out and was issued with a second yellow card by Joe McQuillan. Against Kerry on 10 March, man of the match Murphy dispatched a penalty and five points in Donegal's comfortable victory over the league's whipping boys.|$|E

500|$|When this failed, {{it seems}} Sejanus turned his {{attention}} toward eliminating Drusus. By AD 23 the enmity {{between the two men}} had reached a critical point. During an argument Drusus had struck the prefect <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> and he openly lamented that [...] "a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor's son was alive". With Tiberius already in his sixties, there was a real possibility of Drusus succeeding his father in the near future. To secure his position, Sejanus secretly plotted against Drusus and seduced his wife Livilla. With her as an accomplice, Drusus was slowly poisoned and died of seemingly natural causes on September 13, AD 23.|$|E
500|$|Apple Records issued Ringo on 2 November 1973 with [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] sequenced as {{the opening}} track. Combined with the closing song, [...] "You and Me (Babe)", written by Harrison and Mal Evans, [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] {{provided}} the album with a loose concept {{in the form}} of a stage show. The same theme was reflected in the painting used for the LP cover, which showed the album title spelt out in bright lights on a theatre stage, and Voormann, Ono, Lennon, Harrison and Perry among the characters along the front row of the theatre's balcony. Among his lithographs appearing in the LP booklet, Voormann represented [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] with an image of Starr as a statue, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> raised, towering high above an open space filled with minuscule figures. Recalling the release in 1981, Woffinden said the lithograph reflected the album's [...] "quintessentially Ringo" [...] quality, whereby Starr's gifts were revealed in his ability to unite his supposedly more talented colleagues.|$|E

500|$|By {{this time}} the enmity between Drusus and Sejanus had reached a {{critical}} point: Drusus had struck the prefect <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> and openly lamented that [...] "a stranger was invited {{to assist in the}} government while the emperor's son was alive". According to Levick, there is nothing to suggest bad relations between the two before this point, especially not as far back as 14, during their expedition to Pannonia. She says, however, {{it may have been the}} clash between theatrical claqueurs and the Praetorian Guard in 15 that began the quarrel, but not enough is known to say for certain. Of more concern to Drusus was, perhaps, that in 20 his father mentioned Sejanus to the Senate in terms that treated him as his partner in power. For Drusus, the heir of that exact position, this was a legitimate cause for concern. [...] At the time, Tiberius was in his sixties, so there was a realistic possibility of Drusus succeeding his father in the near future. In the account of Tacitus, Sejanus began plotting against Drusus in secrecy to secure his position.|$|E
500|$|After {{working with}} the cover for the album, {{provisionally}} titled Runaway Train, Levy went on vacation and travelled with Pearl Jam on their 2008 tour. After a concert in Washington D.C., Levy {{came up with the}} idea [...] "to do it all graphic black on black" [...] and sketched what would become the yellow artwork. The record company liked it and requested he do two more in the same style, which became the red and white versions. During the promotional photography sessions, Levy made the deluxe edition art. The tracks on the album did not have much influence on the artwork as Levy had heard [...] "maybe 5 songs at that point", but he found it curious that his artwork fit the title track [...] "Black Ice", which was not among the tracks he had heard. Levy said that since the album had many similarities with Back in Black – [...] "Black" [...] in the title, dark covers, and AC/DC resurfacing with a sound based on the band's early work – the art was [...] "like a time travel, which is why there are so many psychedelic drawings". The artwork's resemblance to a train, echoing lead single [...] "Rock N' Roll Train", was a coincidence, given Levy [...] "never thought of it that way". Atop the image there is a cog with an image of Angus <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> in the air resembling the statue on Stiff Upper Lip, because Levy [...] "just thought it was great as a continuing icon." [...] The photographs for the booklet and promotional photography were taken by music photographer Guido Karp, in August 2008 in London.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, Gable and Josephine Dillon were divorced. A {{few days}} later, he married Texas socialite Maria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham, nicknamed [...] "Rhea". After moving to California, {{they were married}} again in 1931, {{possibly}} {{due to differences in}} state legal requirements. [...] "His ears are too big and he looks like an ape", said executive Darryl F. Zanuck, then at Warner Bros., about Gable after testing him for the lead in the studio's gangster drama Little Caesar (1931). The same year, in Night Nurse, Gable played a villainous chauffeur who was gradually starving two adorable little girls to death, then knocked Barbara Stanwyck's character unconscious <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist,</b> a supporting role originally slated for James Cagney until the release of The Public Enemy abruptly made Cagney a leading man. After several failed screen tests for Barrymore and Zanuck, Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's Irving Thalberg. He became a client of well-connected agent Minna Wallis, sister of producer Hal Wallis and a very close friend of Norma Shearer.|$|E

2500|$|Chapter 6 {{continues}} to intersperse songs amongst the prose. [...] "When old corruption", sung by Quid, is a satire {{on the medical}} profession {{and may have been}} suggested by The Devil Upon Two Sticks (1768), a three-act comedic satire by Samuel Foote, which was itself based on the satirical Alain-René Lesage novel Le Diable boiteux (1707). The Devil Upon Two Sticks had been revived on the London stage in 1784, so it would have been topical at the time of writing. The poem also seems to parody parts of Book II of the John Milton epic Paradise Lost (1667), particularly the scenes outlining the genealogy of the sentries of the Gates of Hell, Sin and Death. Chapter 6 is also an important chapter for Suction, insofar as it is here he outlines his primary philosophy; [...] "Ah hang your reasoning I hate reasoning I do every thing by my feelings." [...] The satire in this section comes from Sipsop's discussion of the surgery of Jack Tearguts, and how his patients react; [...] "Tho they cry ever so he'll Swear at them & keep them down <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>fist</b> & tell them that he'll scrape their bones if they don't lie still & be quiet." [...] The inherent but unacknowledged irony here recalls Sigtagatist's proud recollection of Minister Huffcap in Chapter 4.|$|E
