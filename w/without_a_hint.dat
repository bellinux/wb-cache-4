Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains {{about the lack of}} sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E

LGT was the most prominent band of a classic rock style that was very popular, along with Illés, Bergendy and Zorán, while there were other bands like The Sweet and Middle of the Road who catered to the desires of the Song Committee, producing rock-based pop music <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of subversion. Meanwhile, the disco style of electronic music produced such performers as the expensively produced and managed Neoton Familia, Beatrice and Szűcs Judit, while the more critically acclaimed progressive rock scene produced bands like East, V73, Color and Panta Rhei.|$|E

Instead of following the straightforward correct path, Marty is forced to select between two unpalatable choices. Reviewer Matt Berman of The Times-Picayune believed that the book's main moral is that [...] "nothing is as simple as it seems".

Love was shown as something violent and frightening, and Nico's internal conflict unfolded <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of irony or disrespect." [...] Lee was also surprised by the role given to Bob and confessed to having cried at the end given to the character. To close her analysis, she said: [...] "The best lesson that one can take away from reading this book: {{that even the most}} terrible person can have a change of heart and make their own choices to do what is right." ...|$|E

500|$|Author Yvonne Tasker, in {{her book}} Working Girls: Gender and Sexuality in Popular Cinema (2002), notes that Cher's film roles often mirrors her public image as a rebellious, sexually autonomous, and self-made woman. In her films, she recurrently serves as a social {{intermediary}} to disenfranchised male characters, such as Eric Stoltz's elephantiasis victim in Mask (1985), Liam Neeson's mute homeless veteran in Suspect (1987), and Nicolas Cage's socially isolated baker with a wooden hand in Moonstruck (1987). Film critic Kathleen Rowe wrote of Moonstruck that the depiction of Cher's character as [...] "a 'woman on top' [...] enhanced by the unruly star persona Cher brings to the part'. Jeff Yarbrough of The Advocate wrote that Cher was [...] "one of the first superstars to 'play gay' with compassion and <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of stereotyping", as she portrays a lesbian in the 1983 film Silkwood.|$|E

In a review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott claimed that [...] "Line for line, scene for scene, {{it is one of}} the best-written American film comedies in recent memory." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt that Enough Said demonstrated [...] "Holofcener's gift for portraying life as it is lived", while David Denby, writing for The New Yorker, wrote that it [...] "approaches novelistic richness". In The New York Times Book Review, Francine Prose praised Holofcener for having written characters [...] "with sufficient depth and wisdom that ... the actors never seem to be movie stars impersonating people.

In the opinion of not a few, it was, {{in every sense of the}} word, the best scene in the play.

500|$|Modern Vampires of the City was {{met with}} {{widespread}} acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 51 reviews. In The Independent, Simon Price called it Vampire Weekend's [...] "most cohesive and convincing effort yet" [...] featuring their most accessible compositions, while Ryan Dombal from Pitchfork said the singing suited the music fluidly on songs that sounded more natural and dynamic than the band's previous work. Alexis Petridis, lead critic for The Guardian, believed Vampire Weekend successfully avoided the gimmicky sounds of their previous albums and wrote more genuine lyrics dealing with mortality rather than [...] "arch depictions of moneyed young Wasp lives". Slant Magazines Jesse Cataldo said the songs may sound dense and wordy, but they would be [...] "immediately potent on a purely visceral level" [...] for listeners, [...] "striking a perfect balance that makes for what's perhaps the best album of the year". Nathan Brackett of Rolling Stone said the album featured a particular spirit and songcraft evocative of urban life, while Robert Christgau appreciated how many twists the coming of age themes revealed. In his review for MSN Music, Christgau found the record similar to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) because of how each lyric and musical element was [...] "pleasurable in itself and aptly situated in the sturdy songs and tracks, so that the whole signifies <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of concept". Greg Kot was more critical in the Chicago Tribune, writing that the group occasionally blundered in an attempt at ingenuity with the songs [...] "Ya Hey" [...] and [...] "Finger Back" [...] while finding the album [...] "darker, slower and weirder" [...] than their previous records. NME journalist John Calvert believed Vampire Weekend had sacrificed [...] "the sonic smarts that made them" [...] on what was an otherwise [...] "gorgeous album".|$|E
500|$|Crash Bandicoot {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics, {{with much of}} the positive comments going to the graphics. Dave Halverson of GameFan referred to the visuals as [...] "the best graphics that exist in a game" [...] and the design and animations of the title character as [...] "100% perfection". Crispin Boyer of Electronic Gaming Monthly said it had the best graphics of any PlayStation game to date. A Next Generation critic summarized that [...] "it's bright and colorful, includes a lot of impressive graphic flourishes, controls well, and, in the strictest sense, uses a 3D environment to good effect <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of draw-in." [...] John Scalzo of Gaming Target described the environments as [...] "colorful and detailed" [...] and mentioned the snowy bridge and temple levels as his favorites. However, he noted that the boss characters appeared to be noticeably polygonal compared to the other characters due to their large size. He added that this flaw was excusable because of the game's age and that the game's graphics were near perfect otherwise. A reviewer for Game Revolution singled out the scaling technology for praise and declared it to be [...] "the new standard for Playstation action games the same way SGI did for 16-bitters after Donkey Kong Country." [...] Additionally, he described the texture-mapping precision as [...] "awesome", the shading as [...] "almost too well done" [...] (the reviewer claimed it made the game more difficult by making the pits appear to be shadows and vice versa), the polygon movements as [...] "very smooth and fluid", the [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] of the title character as [...] "always refreshing" [...] and the backgrounds as [...] "breathtakingly beautiful (especially the waterfall stages)". However, the reviewer said that the ability to adjust the camera angle even slightly [...] "would have been a definite plus (at times the ground itself is at 75 degree angle while Crash constantly moves at 90 degrees, putting a slight strain on the eyes)." [...] This echoed Tommy Glide of GamePro, who said [...] "Trying to judge distances from the mostly static view behind Crash is one of the game's main flaws", while highly praising the scenery and effects. A reviewer for IGN noted that [...] "gorgeous backgrounds and silky smooth animation make this one of the best-looking titles available for the PlayStation." ...|$|E
500|$|Lage Raho Munna Bhai was an {{acclaimed}} film. Subhash K.

The sequences, all fiercely and famously path-breaking have us in splits [...] Watch the love-lorn Munnabhai answer a Gandhian quiz on a phone-in radio quiz with the help of kidnapped professors' it's one of the most comically animated sequences seen in the movies of the new millennium." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film four out five stars, calling it [...] "a sparkling example of qualitative cinema" [...] arguing that it [...] "not only entertains, it also enlightens." [...] Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India observes that [...] "Vidhu Vinod Chopra gives the great Indian family one more let's-go-goodwill-hunting entertainer, even as director Raju Hirani proves that sequels needn't have the been there-done that feel..." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it four out of five stars and states: [...] "Like those good old-fashioned Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, it also reinforces the importance of human goodness and basic niceties. Even if you might argue that some of Gandhi's principles seem outdated today, you cannot help but cheer for Munna and his gang as they achieve the impossible with love and kindness. And that is where this film transcends conventional boundaries. It entertains you, yes, but it also makes you yearn for a perfect world. Judge it by any yardstick that you may, Lage Raho Munnabhai emerges a clear winner. Much of that credit must go to its actors who pull out all stops to make it an enjoyable ride." [...] Poonam Joshi of the BBC gave four out of five stars stating that, [...] "everything about this film works [...] It's rare to see a film that bounces between humour and sentiment so seamlessly. And it is rarer still to see characters become etched in the memory so enduringly that audiences become almost protective of them. It's testimony both {{to the quality of the}} writing and the performances, that Munna and Circuit have taken on a life of their own." [...] Vinayak Chakravorty of The Hindustan Times gave four out of four stars stating that it [...] "cleverly works its way around the obvious hurdle that almost all sequels face: The film recreates an original milieu <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of the déjà vu downer. And that precisely ranks Munna Bhai 2 as one of the best entertainers this year." [...] He commended the it for showing [...] "the heights Hindi cinema can scale despite staying within its masala parameters. Lage [...] raho, guys." ...|$|E

With ‘Burning At Both Ends’, the Bay Area sextet have further underlined their second-to-none pop-punk pedigree". Gregory Heaney of AllMusic, who gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, said [...] "While the album is a solid specimen of melodic hardcore/pop-punk, the one major misstep comes by way of “Product of the 80’s,” which feels more like forced nostalgia than a leisurely stroll down memory lane, cramming the pop culture of the '80s down the listener's throat <b>without</b> even <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of subtlety" [...] and continued [...] "All blunders aside, Burning at Both Ends is an album that has a lot to offer for Set Your Goals devotees, and might even make converts out of the uninitiated".|$|R

And as for Mr. Ruskin's world's being a place--his world of art--where we may take life easily, woe to the luckless mortal who enters it with any such disposition. Instead of a garden of delight, he finds a sort of assize court in perpetual session. Instead of a place in which human responsibilities are lightened and suspended, he finds a region governed by a kind of Draconic legislation. His responsibilities indeed are tenfold increased; the gulf between truth and error is for ever yawning at his feet; the pains and penalties of this same error are advertised, in apocalyptic terminology, upon a thousand sign-posts; and the rash intruder soon begins to look back with infinite longing to the lost paradise of the artless. There can be no greater want of tact in dealing with those things with which men attempt to ornament life than to be perpetually talking about [...] "error." [...] A truce to all rigidities is the law of the place; the only thing absolute there is that some force and some charm have worked.

5000|$|John Howard has in {{his early}} fifties reached a point of {{creative}} maturity few achieve, especially after almost twenty-five years in the [...] "dump-bin" [...] {{and it is a}} further irony that this album is entitled Navigate Home. During the period of its gestation, he was a temporary resident of transitory homes: the home of the past, the home within his head, and a home as yet unbuilt. Waiting to emigrate to Spain, he realized a series of songs sublimely inhabited by English ghosts, a haunting and restful work, completed and refined in his new country, but <b>without</b> even <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of sunshine or sangria, only suggestions of clouds and summer showers. Knowing he was leaving England allowed him to plunder his past with a fresh and concise perspective. These songs have a longing and a sense of focused regret. Nostalgia is too obvious and unsubtle a label. There is a strange air of resolution and refinement present. It is a gathering up of half a century's memories, his most personal album so far, but free of anger and misery. Tranquil in tone, but pulled by the magnets of retrospection and anticipation, these songs have a striving but restful nature, a certain sadness, but balanced by a spirit of joyful projection. These are kindly conversations sung into an unsuspecting ear.|$|R
