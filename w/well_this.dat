5|$|Feminist economists {{also point}} out that agency is not {{available}} to everyone, such as children, the sick, and the frail elderly. Responsibilities for their care can compromise the agency of caregivers as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> is a critical departure from the homo economicus model.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with the Central American squirrel monkey. The birds follow the monkeys {{in an attempt to}} prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and trogons do so as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process of}} learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{after the}} {{workshop}} concluded, an 1884 {{edition of the}} Cyrus Cylinder by E. A. Wallis Budge came to Irving Finkel's attention. This publication used an idiosyncratic typeface and featured a handcopy for only {{a section of the}} whole cylinder. However the typeface in that edition matched the paleography on the bone inscriptions and the extract of the cylinder published in the book matched that of the bone as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> convinced Finkel that the bone inscriptions were early modern forgeries and that has remained the majority opinion since then.|$|E
5|$|In 491 BC, Darius sent emissaries {{to all the}} Greek city-states, {{asking for}} a gift of 'earth and water' in token of their {{submission}} to him. Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> meant that Sparta was also effectively at war with Persia.|$|E

5|$|In the 1900, a final {{attempt to}} {{increase}} the attendance of the camp meetings at Mountain Grove Campground {{was made by the}} Board of Managers. As well as general renovation, this included an addition of a building called the Preacher's Home, which was situated behind the auditorium. The purpose of this was to attract preachers to attend, thus inspiring locals to attend as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> plan was not successful.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Egyptian {{beliefs about the}} gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation's scribes and priests. These people were the elite of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, {{most of whom were}} illiterate. Little is known about how <b>well</b> <b>this</b> broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature.|$|E

5|$|S. ciliata is most {{commonly}} called the 'sand whiting' {{in reference to}} its preference for sandy substrates compared to {{some members of the}} genus which prefer muddy, silty, or grassy substrates. Other common names include the 'blue-nose whiting' in reference to the colour of the nose in fish of larger sizes, and 'summer whiting', a name often applied to S. analis as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> name is applied to these species as they move from deeper offshore waters into shallow beach and estuarine waters in summer, where they become a target for recreational fishers.|$|E

She then fractured a bone in her left leg, which set off dystrophy in that leg as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> resulted in her needing a wheelchair for mobility. She plays the saxophone in a band. She attended University of New South Wales and Sydney University, where she took classes in Cognitive Science, English, and Philosophy.

5|$|The {{peak in the}} {{brightness}} just inside of the Amalthea's orbit and, therefore, the vertical asymmetry the Amalthea gossamer ring {{may be due to}} the dust particles trapped at the leading (L4) and trailing (L5) Lagrange points of this moon. The particles may also follow horseshoe orbits between the Lagrangian points. The dust may be present at the leading and trailing Lagrange points of Thebe as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> discovery implies that there are two particle populations in the gossamer rings: one slowly drifts in the direction of Jupiter as described above, while another remains near a source moon trapped in 1:1 resonance with it.|$|E
5|$|The {{win over}} Virginia Tech gave the Eagles a 2–1 conference record, and they {{appeared}} to be destined for a bid to the ACC Championship Game. But Boston College lost its next two games, both against conference opponents, dropping its record to 2–3. Despite the losses, Boston College still had a chance to win the Atlantic Division—but only if other teams lost as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> happened on November 6, when fellow Atlantic Division team Maryland lost to Virginia Tech, and the Eagles recovered from their losing streak with an out-of-conference win against Notre Dame.|$|E

A.×wherryi showed the same pattern, as it also contains chromosomes from both of those species. A specimen of A.stotleri was subsequently shown to form the same chromatograms as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> showed that it was not descended to A.pinnatifidum, whose chromatograms contain compounds inherited from walking fern (A.rhizophyllum), and verified that A.stotleri was simply a form of A.bradleyi. Allozyme analysis in the 1980s also supported these hybrid origins of A.bradleyi.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, {{with the}} wounded hospitalised in Zanzibar, Goliath and Fox {{returned}} to Dar-es-Salaam and reduced {{most of the}} seafront to rubble, setting fire to several other districts of the town as <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> reprisal served only to turn the hitherto neutral local populace against the British. Feelings ran high in both camps following the raid, with the British claiming that white flags flying from several shore installations should have prevented any German attack, and the Germans insisting that the British had attempted to capture their merchant vessels' crews despite promises not to do so. According to Stephen Snelling in The Naval VCs, both sides had entered the operation {{with the intention of}} breaching the predetermined agreements.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{was born}} {{in the small town of}} Tolosa, Gipuzkoa, Basque Country, into a family known for its footballing prowess. His father, Periko Alonso, won La Liga twice in {{successive}} seasons with Real Sociedad and a third time after he joined Barcelona. He also featured in the national team, winning 21 caps over the course of his career. Xabi Alonso lived in the city of Barcelona for the first six years of his life and moved to San Sebastián (Donostia) thereafter. It was here that his passion for football began as he whiled away his childhood playing at Playa de la Concha (Shell Beach). On the Basque sands, Alonso befriended a fellow resident of Calle Matia, Mikel Arteta, and the two would battle each other in exhibitions of technical ability. He was immersed in football and his father would often bring him and his older brother, Mikel, to CE Sabadell's training ground to practice together. Alonso was influenced by his father's playing, taking more pleasure in passing the ball well than shooting at goal. At an early age, he decided to play as a defensive midfielder, a role which helped him learn how to distribute the ball <b>well.</b> <b>This</b> talent would later prove to be an integral part of his club and international career.|$|E
