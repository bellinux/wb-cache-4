5|$|Gerard {{agreed to}} a {{compromise}} {{on the matter of}} obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a <b>witnessed</b> <b>oath</b> from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office. Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, seven state constitutions include {{religious}} {{tests that}} would effectively prevent atheists from holding public office, {{and in some}} cases being a juror/witness, though these have not generally been enforced since the early twentieth century. The U.S. Constitution permits an affirmation in place of an oath to allow atheists to give testimony in court or to hold public office. However, a United States Supreme Court case reaffirmed that the United States Constitution prohibits States and the Federal Government from requiring any kind of religious test for public office, in the specific case, as a notary public. This decision is generally understood to also apply to <b>witness</b> <b>oaths.</b>|$|R

5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this topic is the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions.

It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|R

500|$|Born in Beckingham, {{which itself}} had a {{satellite}} church of Peterborough Abbey {{his relations with}} the Abbey {{seem to have been}} close. Prior to their appointment of him as a parish priest at Warmington in 1281, they had appointed him to Northborough parish twelve years earlier; but his second parish was by far the most lucrative. In him, it has been said, [...] "Peterborough had found a royal justice, bound in loyalty by the grant." [...] For example, in 1288 he granted the Abbey his manor of Southorpe, and when eventually the Abbey came to buy it, Beckingham lent them some of the cash to do so. In this way, contemporaries noted, Beckingham enabled the Abbey to circumvent the king's statute against land passing to the Church. As some point he appears to have also acted as agent and money lender for the Abbey, as well as hearing their cases that came before him personally in court, for instance, in the Abbey's purchase of Polebrook manor and when the Abbey found itself in dispute with the bishop of Lincoln and other Abbeys. He also acted administratively such as <b>witnessing</b> <b>oaths</b> of homage to the Abbey.|$|R
