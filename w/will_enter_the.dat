5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem to be its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together.

5|$|Just {{south of}} Oslo Central Station, {{each of the}} two tracks will diverge, and follow {{different}} routes. The inbound track will hook up with the Østfold Line at Sjursøya, while the outbound track will diverge at Loenga. An additional connection to the Østfold Line will be made at Nordstrand. The Østfold Line connects to the Hoved Line and Loenga–Alnabru Line before reaching Oslo Central Station (OsloS). If the Kolbotn-alternative for the Follo Line is chosen, the Østfold Line will be rebuilt to follow a similar path to the Kolbotn station, which will require a new station building to accommodate the two lines. For this alternate route the two lines <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> Kolbotn station at two levels, with the Follo Line running in a tunnel below, and the Østfold Line running at-grade above.|$|E
5|$|The male wanders as {{an adult}} and in August or September goes looking for the females' webs to mate. The male <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> female's web and vibrate the silk as he {{approaches}} her. The female is usually aggressive at first and will chase the male from the web. The Courtship process consists of the male bobbing, plucking and tweaking the web along with periods of cautious approach and being chased by the female. Eventually, when she becomes docile and allows him to approach, the male will then approach the female as she hangs quietly upside down in the web. The male moves onto her ventral abdomen, tapping her rapidly until she moves to align his abdomen above hers. He then inserts his palps one at a time, leaving the female between each insertion. Copulation occurs over 10 to 30 minutes. After mating, the male retreats to groom, which is performed by running his palps and legs through his fangs and wiping them over his body. The male is not eaten by the female unlike some other widow spiders.|$|E
