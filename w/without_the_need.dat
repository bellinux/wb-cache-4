5|$|Brookwood {{was one of}} the few cemeteries {{to permit}} burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend {{funerals}} <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to take a day off work.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about West Alseks {{subsequent}} civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers for testing purposes. Coal pulverizers would take coal—often cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable for marine use—and grind them into coal dust. This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically injected into the boilers <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.|$|E
5|$|Production {{processes}} for {{primary and secondary}} lead are similar. Some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead, and this trend {{is likely to increase}} in the future. Given adequate techniques, secondary lead is indistinguishable from primary lead. Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean and is re-melted <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for smelting, though refining is sometimes needed. Secondary lead production is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.|$|E

40|$|The Gravitational Motor is a {{new type}} of motor that can {{substitute}} the conventional motors with large advantage. This motor works <b>without</b> <b>the</b> use of any type of fuel. It converts energy from the Earth’s gravitational field directly into rotational mechanical energy, and can have a very high-power (several thousand of HP), occupying only a volume smaller than one cubic meter. When a Gravitational Motor of this type is coupled to a conventional generator of electrical energy, the system Motor-Generator can supply several thousand kilowatt-hours of electrical energy, similarly to hydroelectric plants, but <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> to use of water of the rivers...|$|R
