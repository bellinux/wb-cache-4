50|$|The <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> {{lives in}} {{tropical}} dry forests, tropical wet forests, {{primary and secondary}} forests. It prefers the edges of forests, close to streams.|$|E
50|$|Large mammals {{found in}} the rain forests or {{wetlands}} include Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus leucopus), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi), crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris colombianus), red brocket (Mazama americana), gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus).Endangered mammals include black-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps), Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), red-crested tree-rat (Santamartamys rufodorsalis), <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus leucopus) and cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> uses scent glands to mark its territory. It {{lives in}} a group with its {{extended}} family of four to fifteen individuals. It lives in trees and is active during the day. Very agile in the trees, it uses all four limbs (quadrupedal) to aid in maneuvering through the branches.|$|E

50|$|The <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> {{exhibits}} polyandrous reproduction, meaning {{one female}} will mate {{with more than}} one male. Gestation cycle is 130-150 days. Females will give birth to one to three young and males have a role in rearing the young and carrying them on his back. Maturity is 12-18 months old. Two birthing seasons have been recorded, one between May and June and the other between October and November.|$|E
5000|$|The {{forests in}} which the <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> lives are disappearing rapidly as the land is used for logging and mining, cleared for {{agriculture}} and {{for the construction of}} roads and dams. Populations of the tamarin are declining and some animals are sold in local markets as pets. As a result of these factors, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the animal's conservation status as being [...] "endangered".|$|E
50|$|The Cauca Valley montane forests {{ecoregion}} is rich {{in species}} of fauna, including 200 of butterflies.Butterflies such as the subtribe Pronophilina have closely related species at different elevations and on different slopes of the mountains.There are 120 mammal species.The spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus) and mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque) are of special concern.Other endangered mammals include the black-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps), Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), Handley's slender opossum (Marmosops handleyi) and <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus leucopus).|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} endemic {{subspecies}} including the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia tolimae), crested bobwhite (Colinus cristatus leucotis), velvet-fronted euphonia (Euphonia concinna) and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus purgatus).Endangered mammals include the <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus leucopus) {{and the mountain}} tapir (Tapirus pinchaque).Endangered reptiles include the Magdalena River turtle (Podocnemis lewyana).The region {{is home to the}} endangered tropical rattle snake Crotalus durissus.Other endemic or endangered species from the humid forests of the foothills include the Colombian weasel (Mustela felipei).|$|E
50|$|Northwestern Colombia {{encompasses}} an area {{of great}} diversity in wildlife. During the Pleistocene era {{at the height of}} the Atrato river, where it intersected the Cauca-Magdalena, the area was covered by a sea. It is proposed that this created a geographic barrier that may have caused many species to diverge through the process of allopatric speciation. For example, Philip Hershkovitz proposed that the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) and the <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus leocopus) diverged by the Atrato, and are today principally separated by the river.|$|E
50|$|Large {{vertebrates}} are the cougar (Puma concolor), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), {{spectacled bear}} (Tremarctos ornatus), Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), brown woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagothricha), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque), little red brocket (Mazama rufina), pacarana (Dinomys branickii), mountain paca (Cuniculus taczanowskii) and Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus).The brown woolly monkey, mountain tapir and spectacled bear are of special concern.Endangered mammals include black-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps), red-crested tree-rat (Santamartamys rufodorsalis), Handley's slender opossum (Marmosops handleyi), <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus leucopus) and mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque).Endangered reptiles include Daniel's large scale lizard (Ptychoglossus danieli) and Colombian lightbulb lizard (Riama columbiana).|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> {{exhibits}} a silvery pale brown back with lighter streaks. The front is russet colored. The tail is brown, sometimes {{with a white}} tip. Feet and hands are also white. The face is only thinly furred with white hairs. Thick brown hair is around the neck and between the ears. Its forelimbs are shorter than its hindlimbs. Its vision, auditory, and olfactory senses are very sharp. Average adult male can weigh 494 g and the average adult female is only slightly smaller, weighing 490 g. Other primates have nails on each digit but tamarins have claws on all digits except the big toe.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin</b> (Saguinus leucopus) is a tamarin species {{endemic to}} Colombia. It is a silvery brown colour with pale streaks and russet underparts, {{and is very}} similar in {{appearance}} to the cotton-top tamarin, from which it is separated by the Atrato River. It is thought that the two species diverged during the Pleistocene, {{at a time when}} a sea occupied the area between their present ranges. This tamarin is an arboreal species, living in small family groups in the canopy. Females give birth to one to three young after a gestation period of about 140 days. This species has a relatively small range and is under threat from destruction and fragmentation of the forest in which it lives and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as [...] "endangered".|$|E
40|$|The <b>white-footed</b> <b>tamarin,</b> Saguinus leucopus, is an endemic primate of Colombia whose vocal {{communication}} {{has been}} little studied. For {{a period of a}} month we applied behavior sampling with continuous record, recording tamarins’ vocalizations, and the behavioral contexts associated with them. The study took place at the “José Celestino Mutis” forest in Mariquita, Tolima department (Colombia). We compiled a vocal catalogue showing some acoustic properties of the vocalizations (i. e. duration and frequency). We identified 19 phonemes associated with different behavioral contexts. Young individuals emitted vocalizations of higher frequency than adults. We discuss the relevance of the tamarins’ acoustic displays on their social and ecological interactions </div...|$|E
