5|$|Louis Jean-Marie Daubenton {{assisted}} Buffon on the quadrupeds; Philippe Guéneau de Montbeillard {{worked on}} the birds. They were joined, from 1767, by Barthélemy Faujas de Saint-Fond, the abbot Gabriel Bexon and Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt. The whole descriptive and anatomical part of l’Histoire des Quadrupèdes <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Daubenton and Jean-Claude Mertrud.|$|E

5|$|The Altar of Forgiveness {{is located}} {{at the front of the}} central nave. It is the first aspect of the {{interior}} that is seen upon entering the cathedral. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Spanish architect Jerónimo Balbás, and represents the first use of the estípite column (an inverted triangle-shaped pilaster) in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} {{series of}} foundation rituals preceded construction. A further set of rituals followed the temple's completion, dedicating {{it to its}} patron god. These rites were conducted, at least in theory, by the king {{as part of his}} religious duties; indeed, in Egyptian belief all temple construction was symbolically his work. In reality, it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of hundreds of his subjects, conscripted in the corvée system. The construction process for a new temple, or a major addition to an existing one, could last years or decades.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} Masolino {{was joined by}} another artist, the {{eighteen}} years younger Masaccio. Masolino eventually left, either for Hungary in 1425 or for Rome in 1427, leaving {{the completion of the}} chapel to Masaccio. In 1427 or 28, before the chapel was completed, Masaccio joined Masolino in Rome. Only in the 1480s <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> finished, by Filippino Lippi. The Tribute Money, though, is considered Masaccio's work entirely.|$|E
50|$|The chancel screen, the font {{cover and}} {{the cross and}} candlesticks on <b>the</b> altar <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of George Bainbridge Reynolds, while <b>the</b> rood <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of an unknown artist from Oberammergau.|$|R
50|$|The 1881 robbery of the Sexton Bank at Riverton was {{initially}} suspected to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Jesse James, {{but it was}} soon determined to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of <b>the</b> outlaw Poke Wells.|$|R

5|$|Bruce's {{new house}} was {{complete}} by 1699, and was worked on {{by many of}} the same craftsmen who were engaged by Bruce at nearby Hopetoun House, which was under construction at the same time. Craftsmen included the plasterers John McKay and Thomas Albur, cabinet maker William Scott, plumber Joseph Foster, smith Alexander Gardener, and the wright Andrew Barclay. The staircase, with its wrought-iron balustrade decorated with roses, thistles, tulips and oak leaves, bears many similarities to the one at Caroline Park, Granton, and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of the smiths James Storrie and James Horne.|$|E
5|$|Estate house design {{declined}} in {{importance in the}} twentieth century. An exception <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890, he undertook a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller in the Adam style. Skibo Castle was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912–14) for {{the owner of a}} Moscow department store. There was a lull in building after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural country houses.|$|E
5|$|Film scores, {{although}} they are secondary to the film, are often critically acclaimed and very popular in their own right. Among early music for Italian films from the 1930s <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Riccardo Zandonai with scores for the films La Principessa Tarakanova (1937) and Caravaggio (1941). Post-war examples include Goffredo Petrassi with Non c'e pace tra gli ulivi (1950) and Roman Vlad with Giulietta e Romeo (1954). Another well-known film composer was Nino Rota whose post-war career included the scores for films by Federico Fellini and, later, The Godfather series. Other prominent film score composers include Ennio Morricone, Riz Ortolani and Piero Umiliani.|$|E

50|$|The parish of Saint-Pantaléon de Valpelline is {{regarded}} as one of the most ancient of the Great St Bernard Valley. First documented in 1176 it included the settlements of Bionaz, Oyace and Ollomont. The current church, built in 1722, has three important chapels: the first, dedicated to Our Lady of <b>the</b> Snows, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Vignettes (1755); the second, dedicated to Saint Roch, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Semon (1640); and the third, dedicated to Saint Barbara, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Thoules (1663).|$|R
5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral {{immunity}} and cellular immunity. Particularly important <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many state}} parks in north central Pennsylvania, {{development}} of the facilities at Cherry Springs <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), a work relief program for young men from unemployed families. Established in 1933as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, the CCC was designed to combat unemployment during the Great Depression. It operated in every U.S. state, and established ten CCC camps in the Susquehannock State Forest, of which eight were in Potter County.|$|E
5|$|Mauretania was {{a client}} kingdom of Rome ruled by Ptolemy of Mauretania. Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and then {{suddenly}} had him executed. Mauretania was annexed by Caligula and subsequently divided into two provinces, Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis, separated by the river Malua. Pliny claims that division <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Caligula, but Dio states that in AD 42 an uprising took place, which was subdued by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and Gnaeus Hosidius Geta, and the division only took place after this. This confusion might mean that Caligula decided to divide the province, but the division was postponed because of the rebellion. The first known equestrian governor of the two provinces was Marcus Fadius Celer Flavianus, in office in AD 44.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} serious post-war studies of Meyerbeer and grand opera was Crosten's 1948 book Grand Opera: An Art and a Business which laid out the themes and {{standards}} for much subsequent research. A major contribution to revival of interest in Meyerbeer <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of the scholar Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer's complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert Letellier has translated the diaries and undertaken {{a wide range of}} Meyerbeer studies. Not least, the establishment of a 'Meyerbeer Fan Club' in America has stimulated interest.|$|E
5|$|Particularly {{influential}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of William Wallace, the king's {{master mason}} from 1617 {{until his death}} in 1631. He worked on the rebuilding of the collapsed North Range of Linlithgow from 1618, Winton House for George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton and began work on Heriot's Hospital, Edinburgh. He adopted a distinctive style that applied elements of Scottish fortification and Flemish influences to a Renaissance plan like that used at Château d'Ancy-le-Franc. This style can be seen in lord's houses built at Caerlaverlock (1620), Moray House, Edinburgh (1628) and Drumlanrig Castle (1675–89), and was highly influential until the baronial style gave way to the grander English forms associated with Inigo Jones in the later seventeenth century, which were used to produce classically inspired and comfortable country houses.|$|E

5|$|Research at the Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought Carson {{into contact}} with medical {{researchers}} investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of National Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, {{with the help of}} NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.|$|E
5|$|The Baronial style peaked {{towards the}} end of the nineteenth century, and the {{building}} of large houses declined in importance in the twentieth century.

5|$|The Diary of a Nobody <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of George Grossmith and {{his brother}} Weedon Grossmith, the sons of a court {{reporter}} and part-time stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the West London School of Art and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor. The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents' garden at Haverstock Hill. This included a 20-minute burlesque version of Hamlet, in which George played the title role; Weedon was Ophelia.|$|E
