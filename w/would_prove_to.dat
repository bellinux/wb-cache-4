5|$|In October 2012, Achebe's publishers, Penguin Books, {{released}} There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra.

5|$|Napoleon I {{embarked}} on an invasion of Russia in 1812. This war <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be the turning point in his fortunes, as the expedition failed miserably and Napoleon was forced to retreat with an army in tatters.|$|E
50|$|His {{five years}} {{coaching}} stint with the Bolts <b>would</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> be dismal {{as he was}} unsuccessful to lead Meralco beyond the quarterfinals. Assortment of injuries to key players, and trades that hurt the team's chemistry contributed to the Bolts downfall.|$|R

5|$|As the Union army retreated towards Washington, it {{paused to}} re-group at Centreville, Virginia. On August 31, 1862, Gen. Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Jackson to flank the Union right and {{to cut the}} Union army off from Washington. This {{flanking}} effort resulted in the Battle of Chantilly which <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be the most disastrous engagement of the entire war for the 21st Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|He {{ruptured}} his Achilles {{midway through}} the 1987–88 season and missed almost a year of first team action. Whiteside's goal in a 2–1 win over Derby County in a league match at the Baseball Ground on 10 February 1988 <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be his last for Manchester United. He was limited to just six goalless appearances in 1988–89.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} that followed, the Ministerium became less {{concerned}} with {{its relationship with the}} Reformed church and saw a significant increase in Lutheran identity and the importance of the Lutheran Confessions. Thus, in 1853, the Ministerium rejoined other Lutherans in the General Synod. However, this renewed relationship <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be short-lived.|$|E

5000|$|According to the Sherman Brothers, {{they raised}} {{a concern with}} Walt Disney when they were given the {{assignment}} to write this song. The songwriters believed that it <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> difficult <b>to</b> enunciate the two letter [...] "t"s, one immediately following the other (i.e. [...] "ParenT Trap" [...] <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> difficult <b>to</b> say quickly.) Nevertheless, Disney {{wanted to keep the}} title of the film and so the music underneath the title line of the song compensates for this problem by putting a short break between the words.|$|R

5|$|King Ottokar's Sceptre {{was first}} serialised in Le Petit Vingtième from 4 August 1938 to 10 August 1939 {{under the title}} Tintin En Syldavie ("Tintin in Syldavia"). It <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be the last Tintin {{adventure}} {{to be published in}} its entirety in Le Petit Vingtième. From 14 May 1939, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, Cœurs Vaillants.|$|E
5|$|The E-1s {{came off}} the {{production}} line in February 1938, {{in time for a}} number of these aircraft to serve in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938. The RLM thought that because the E variant could outrun enemy fighters in Spain, {{there was no need to}} upgrade the defensive weaponry, which <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be a mistake in later years.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the late}} 70s and 80s, {{many of the}} series between the West Indies and England had been {{dominated}} by the West Indies who had won fourteen of the fifteen Tests, often by large margins.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Hamilton's lead in the Drivers' Championship was cut down to 41 points, with Rosberg still in second place. Sebastian Vettel moved closer as well, now being 49 points behind Hamilton. Felipe Massa's {{retirement}} saw him drop from fourth to sixth in the standings, being overtaken by both Räikkönen and Bottas. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari closed the gap to leaders Mercedes, now trailing 310 to 463 points. This race <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be the only one that Lewis Hamilton did not finish in the season.|$|E
5|$|By November 1998, UBS's {{losses from}} its {{exposure}} to LTCM were estimated {{at the level}} of approximately CHF 790million. UBS <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be the largest single loser in the LTCM collapse, ultimately writing off CHF 950million. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of US$3.625billion by the hedge fund's major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. UBS contributed US$300million to the bailout effort, which would largely be recovered. In the aftermath of the LTCM collapse, Mathis Cabiallavetta resigned as chairman of UBS, along with three other executives.|$|E
5|$|Former All Black Jamie Joseph {{was hired}} as coach for the 2011 Super Rugby season, while Jamie Mackintosh {{replaced}} Cowan as team captain. The campaign <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be the franchise's most successful in several years, as they raced out to a 3–0 start including a monumental away win over the Bulls in Pretoria. They remained in playoff contention for almost the entire season, sitting 8–4 at one juncture, before slumping under an injury cloud {{at the end of}} the year to finish 8th on the table.|$|E

Smith was sacked after a poor start, but his replacement Colin Todd failed {{to improve the}} club's form, and Todd was sacked and replaced with John Gregory, with similarly poor results. Higginbotham scored his first goal in English football on 16 March 2002, converting a penalty to secure a 3–1 victory over Bolton Wanderers after striker Fabrizio Ravanelli backed out of taking the penalty. This <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be the last win of a relegation campaign, with the only remaining positive to the season for Higginbotham coming when he was voted as the fans' Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} during her North American debut in 2011, Kurosaki mentioned {{that it had}} been her long-time dream to perform theme songs for anime series, and that anime {{is a big part of}} her life. She related her experiences working at Dear Stage, where originally worked as a waitress and performer. She said that she worked hard to meet customer expectations, and that performing at the venue's stage <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be a valuable experience as it would allow her to perform at larger stages with more imagination and inspiration. She mentioned that while writing lyrics for anime series, she wants the tone and mood of her songs to match the anime's setting.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> {{be a very}} {{competent}} administrator, {{with the}} Soviet standard of living rising considerably due to his moderately reformist policy. Kosygin's moderate 1965 reform, as with Nikita Khrushchev's thaw, radicalised the Soviet reform movement. While Leonid Brezhnev was content to maintain the centralised structure of the Soviet planned economy, Kosygin attempted to revitalise the ailing economic system by decentralising management. Following Brezhnev's death in 1982, the reform movement was split between Yuri Andropov's path of discipline and control and Gorbachev's liberalisation of all aspects of public life.|$|E

5|$|New York's 1988 season {{got off to}} a {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks in 12 games. The intense worry and scrutiny <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be for naught as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor would pass his drug tests.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1961, {{the stadium}} {{was used for}} Motorcycle {{speedway}} when it {{was chosen as the}} host for the Speedway World Championship Final. The event, {{the first of its kind}} not to be staged at Wembley Stadium in England, was won by Swedish rider and defending champion Ove Fundin who won the third of his five Individual World Championships. It <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be the only World Final staged at Malmö Stadion. From 1964, World Final's held in Sweden were run at the Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Argyle manager Neil Warnock picked ten {{players who}} had started both of the club's semi-final matches, with Ronnie Mauge keeping {{his place in the}} team having {{replaced}} Chris Billy for the second leg. The match was to be goalkeeper Steve Cherry's last for the club, having returned for a second stint with the club three months earlier. Darlington manager Jim Platt, who was taking charge of the team for the last time before the return of David Hodgson, made one change to the side that secured progress from the semi-final stage with Tony Carss coming in at the expense of Matt Carmichael. The final <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> <b>to</b> be Man of the Match Matty Appleby's last for Darlington.|$|E
