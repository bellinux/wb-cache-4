2500|$|The {{incumbent}} Labor-led government {{argued for}} {{a need for a}} [...] "safe pair of hands" [...] to manage an economic shift from mining-oriented growth to something else; while the opposition said that it would prevent a recession that could be caused by a budget deficit. The Sydney Morning Herald suggested both arguments hedged on the mining boom going bust. Rudd officially began the campaign season on 1 September in his hometown of Brisbane. At the rally, he promised tax breaks for small businesses and more work for local contractors on infrastructure projects. He said: [...] "In this election, we are now engaged in the fight of our lives. It is a fight about the values that underpin Australia's future, a fight about our vision for Australia's future. It's a fight about how <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> building Australia's future, a future for the many, not just for the few." [...] He also dismissed the opinion polls that showed him trailing to Abbott in gaining a parliamentary plurality.|$|E
2500|$|The Pussycat Dolls {{were created}} by {{choreographer}} Robin Antin and her roommate Christina Applegate in 1993 after inviting several dancers to explore Antin's idea of classic Las Vegas-style burlesque {{and give it a}} more contemporary spin. In 1995, the group began performing every Thursday at Johnny Depp's Los Angeles club, the Viper Room. In 2000, Gwen Stefani was invited to sing and perform with the Dolls and brought along Interscope Geffen A chairman Jimmy Iovine and then-president of A Records; both took interest into turning it in a singing group. In 2003, Antin struck a joint venture with Interscope Records to develop the Pussycat Dolls into a brand, with Iovine assigning the project to Fair. Fair stated that he wanted to create an album which would [...] "involve music and visuals". He explained that [...] "there's going to be some technological changes as well as creative changes in the way <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] The auditions drew about 500 aspiring performers, of which two singers—Nicole Scherzinger and Melody Thornton—were recruited, joining Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta and Kimberly Wyatt to form a new recording group. Fair stated that even though [...] "there were some adequate voices in the original group," [...] Scherzinger and Thornton where needed [...] "to bring the ability." [...] In 2004, they recorded [...] "We Went as Far as We Felt Like Going" [...] for the Shark Tale soundtrack and recorded their own version of [...] "Sway", which was released as single to promote the movie Shall We Dance?.|$|E

60|$|These days of {{our stay}} in London were not pleasant. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> little, and enjoyed nothing. At last Pomona came to us, her face pale but determined.|$|R
5000|$|Chadbourne {{railed against}} the Smoot-Hawley Tariff:“How have <b>we</b> <b>gone</b> <b>about</b> the {{business}} of protecting and promoting the world trade so vital to our prosperity? We pass the highest tariff bill in history…and with what result? Already some forty-five nations have raised tariff walls of their own in direct retaliation.” ...|$|R
60|$|So off <b>we</b> <b>went,</b> <b>about</b> {{twenty of}} the village natives, a motley crew armed with every kind of gun, marching ahead and singing songs. Then came the waggon with Captain Robertson and myself seated on the driving-box, and lastly Umslopogaas and his Zulus, except the two who had been left behind.|$|R

6000|$|... "After all," [...] he said, [...] "it is {{possible}}--yes, it {{is possible}} that you may succeed. Adventures wait for us everywhere, if only <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> in a proper frame of mind. We will lunch, I think, at the Café Grand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So long, {{my young}} friend!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "You see, I've {{got them to}} {{let me make a}} start. Next time <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> the country in a saloon car together, I hope we'll have better luck. Say, but I'm groggy about the knees!" ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> Venice {{tracking}} down pictures and spiral staircases and such-like things, and my brains were busy {{all the time}} with such things as a comparison of Venice and its nearest modern equivalent, New York, with the elaboration of schemes of action when we returned to London, with the development of a theory of Margaret.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, after <b>we</b> had <b>gone</b> <b>about</b> in the {{workshops}} till {{we had seen}} enough, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to the Louvre to see the paintings; though on the way we stopped to see a crèche." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} all of us that we were in more danger through {{information}} which Elias might give, than we would have been while playing the spy with him safely cared for on one of the vessels of Commodore Barney's flotilla, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> the work as if it was possible to feel the chafing of British halters around our necks.|$|R
6000|$|... "So they are," [...] Julien replied. [...] "Life is only {{a holiday}} over here. In England <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> with our eyes fixed upon the deadliest thing in life we can imagine. Over here, {{depression}} is a crime. They call into their minds the most joyous thing they can think of. It becomes a habit. They think only of the pleasantness of life. They keep their troubles buried underneath." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And it is {{not only}} me--I should say I," [...] I continued; [...] "I don't want you to run away with the idea that I am the only good man in the world. That's what I like about Christmas, it makes {{everybody}} good. The lovely sentiments <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> repeating! the noble deeds we do! from a little before Christmas up to, say, the end of January! why noting them down must be a comfort to you." ...|$|E
60|$|In winter, {{nature is}} a cabinet of curiosities, full of dried specimens, {{in their natural}} order and position. The meadows and forests are a hortus siccus. The leaves and grasses stand {{perfectly}} pressed by the air without screw or gum, and the birds' nests are not hung on an artificial twig, but where they builded them. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> dryshod to inspect the summer's work in the rank swamp, and see what a growth have got the alders, the willows, and the maples; testifying to how many warm suns, and fertilizing dews and showers. See what strides their boughs took in the luxuriant summer,--and anon these dormant buds will carry them onward and upward another span into the heavens.|$|E

5000|$|.....<b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> a {{year ago}} ... {{to apply for a}} license. Our attempt proved quite humorous to your employees, who sent us away with word of [...] "Forget it." [...] Further {{investigations}} showed us why our attempt was then so comical. Licenses were so expensive and hard to get that even small stations were being sold for millions. Broadcasting was reserved for power men.|$|R

Depend on't some of the {{provisions}} have been stranded among the rocks, and, as they will be smashed to pieces before long, the sooner <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> it the better. The truth is, that while you have been wastin' your time running about the island, Master Burns and I have been doin' this, an' we've saved some things already--among them a barrel of pork. Come, rouse up and go to work--some to the shore, others to make a camp in the bush." ...|$|E
60|$|I became {{interested}} in the worker's side of this organisation. I insist on seeing the entrances, the clothes-changing places, the lavatories, and so forth of the organisation. As <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> we pass a string of electric trolleys steered by important-looking girls, and loaded with shell, finished as far as these works are concerned and {{on their way to the}} railway siding. We visit the hospital, for these works demand a medical staff. It is not only that men and women faint or fall ill, but there are accidents, burns, crushings, and the like. The war casualties begin already here, and they fall chiefly among the women. I saw a wounded woman with a bandaged face sitting very quietly in the corner.|$|E
60|$|But if {{we believe}} that from God, the fount of justice, comes all our justice; that from God, the fount of truth, comes all our truthfulness, then we shall cry earnestly to him, day by day, as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> this world's work, to be kept from all injustice, and from all falsehood. We shall entreat him to cleanse us from our secret faults, and to give us truth in the inward parts; to pour into our hearts that love to our {{neighbour}} which is justice itself, for it worketh no ill to its neighbour, and so fulfils the law. We shall dread all meanness and cruelty, as sins against the very Spirit of God; and our most earnest and solemn endeavour in life will be, to keep innocence, and take heed to {{the thing that is}} right; for that will bring us peace at the last.|$|E
60|$|And yet, though I even {{removed the}} handcuffs, {{we could not}} adjust {{ourselves}} to his condition. Our minds revolted. To us {{he was full of}} potentiality. We knew not what to expect of him next, what fearful thing, rising above the flesh, he might break out and do. Our experience warranted this state of mind, and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> our work with anxiety always upon us.|$|R
5000|$|Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher {{told reporters}} on May 22, {{as he left}} the Capitol to attend funeral visitation for the victims, [...] "I think we have a {{preliminary}} cause right now, and that's an explosion that occurred from a contained area that apparently was leaking...That's why <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> setting a new protocol to check all of the non-conventional containment procedures.

40|$|Developing a new {{leading edge}} IA- 32 {{microprocessor}} is an immensely complicated undertaking. In {{the case of}} the Pentium ® 4 processor, the microarchitecture is significantly more complex than any previous IA- 32 microprocessor and the implementation borrows almost nothing from any previous implementation. This paper describes how <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> the task of finding bugs in the Pentium ® 4 processor design prior to initial silicon, and what we found along the way...|$|R
60|$|Therefore, {{to bring}} the words of my text to our present occasion, I shall endeavour, in a further {{prosecution}} of them, to evince the great necessity of a nice and curious inspection into the several recesses of the heart, being the surest and the shortest method that a wicked man can take to reform himself: For let us but stop the fountain, and the streams will spend and waste themselves away in a very little time; but if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>about,</b> like children, to raise a bank, and to stop the current, not taking notice all the while of the spring which continually feeds it, when the next flood of temptation rises, and breaks in upon it, then we shall find that we have begun at {{the wrong end of}} our duty, and that we are very little more the better for it, than if we had sat still, and made no advances at all.|$|E
60|$|Edith's {{home was}} more prosperous than Mary's; {{she brought her}} own money to it; the {{bringing}} up of her children was a far more efficient business than Mary's instinctive proceedings. Hugh had very nearly died {{in his first year}} of life; some summer infection had snatched at him; that had tied him to his father's heart by a knot of fear; but no infection had ever come near Edith's own nursery. And it was Hugh that Mr. Britling had seen, small and green-faced and pitiful under an anaesthetic for some necessary small operation to his adenoids. His younger children had never stabbed to Mr. Britling's heart with any such pitifulness; they were not so thin-skinned as their elder brother, not so assailable by the little animosities of dust and germ. And out of such things as this evolved a shapeless cloud of championship for Hugh. Jealousies and suspicions are latent in every human relationship. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> the affairs of life pretending magnificently that they are not so, pretending to the generosities we desire. And in all step-relationships jealousy and suspicion are not merely latent, they stir.|$|E

Each of us has had her little fling at maternity--about as much as a washerwoman does in her odd time every two or three years--and that is our uttermost reality. All the rest,--trimmings! <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> the world, Stephen, dressing and meeting each other with immense ceremony, we have our seasonal movements in relation to the ritual of politics and sport, we travel south for the Budget and north for the grouse, we play games to amuse the men who keep us--not a woman would play a game for its own sake--we dabble with social reform and politics, for which few of us care a rap except as an occupation, we 'discover' artists or musicians or lecturers (as though we cared), we try to believe in lovers or, still harder, try to believe in old or new religions, and most of us--I don't--do our best to give the gratifications and exercise the fascinations that are expected of us....|$|E

6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> to a {{clump of}} bushes, and Tom made {{everybody}} swear to keep the secret, and then showed them {{a hole in the}} hill, right in the thickest part of the bushes.

6000|$|She {{was able}} to walk a little now and {{together}} <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>about</b> the village, and visited relatives and neighbors in the country.

Up the valleys, down the valleys go they, saying, [...] "Here {{is a place}} to build a breastwork; here can ye pitch a fort. Here can ye hold the road against an army"--the very roads for which I paid out the rupees monthly. The Government knows, but does nothing. The three other Kings, who were not paid for guarding the Passes, tell them by runner of the bad faith of Bunar and Hilas.

To some people a restricted income doesn’t matter a bit, in fact it often seems to help {{as a means for}} getting a lot of reality out of life; I am sure there are men and women who do their shopping in little back streets of Paris, buying four carrots and a shred of beef for their daily sustenance, who lead a perfectly real and eventful existence. Lack of initiative is the thing that really cripples one, and that is where you and I and Uncle James are so hopelessly shut in. We are just so many animals stuck down on a Mappin terrace, with this difference in our disfavour, that the animals are there to be looked at, while nobody wants to look at us. As a matter of fact there would be nothing to look at. We get colds in winter and hay fever in summer, and if a wasp happens to sting one of us, well, that is the wasp’s initiative, not ours; all we do is to wait for the swelling to go down. Whenever we do climb into local fame and notice, it is by indirect methods; if it happens to be a good flowering year for magnolias the neighbourhood observes: ‘Have you seen the Gurtleberry’s magnolia?
