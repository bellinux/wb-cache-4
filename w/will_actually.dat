5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. This situation is described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> reset the stun meter.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes is smuggled {{back into}} Chester by Trevor after Grace is {{arrested and charged}} with her murder in an attempt to prove her innocence. Mercedes is later kidnapped by Freddie and he forces her to leave the village again, or he <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> kill her. Mercedes is caught in the garage by Phoebe, however, and she urges her to visit Nana in {{hospital}} after being trapped in a fire. When she visits Nana, her family are furious with her for her behavior and what she has put them through, telling them to leave, While Mercedes is leaving the hospital, she is caught by Trevor and he tells her that if she doesn't stay in the village, then he will kill Phoebe. Unknown to him, Mercedes later falls pregnant with Joe's child. Joe is later admitted to hospital and loses the use of his legs after an attack from his half-brother Robbie Roscoe (Charlie Wernham). Mercedes begins sleeping with Porsche's husband Lockie Campbell (Nick Rhys) {{and at the same time}} she slowly starts to develop feelings for Joe. She doesn't believe she can stay faithful to him, however, and goes to Valencia with Freddie. She later decides not to go through with it and decides to be with Joe. Their happiness doesn't last however, when during a heated argument Mercedes reveals that Joe is not the father of her baby.|$|E

25|$|Whether {{glitches}} <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> occur {{depends on}} the physical nature of the implementation, and whether we {{need to worry about}} it {{depends on the}} application.

25|$|Rastas do {{not believe}} that there is a {{specific}} afterlife to which human individuals go following bodily death. They believe in the possibility of eternal life, and that only those who shun righteousness <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> die. One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to go through a process of reincarnation, with an individual's identity remaining throughout each of their incarnations.|$|E
25|$|ClearType in Windows XP {{currently}} {{supports the}} RGB and BGR sub pixel structures. Rotated displays, {{in which the}} subpixels are arranged vertically rather than horizontally, are not currently supported. Using ClearType on these display configurations <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> reduce the display quality. The best option for users of Windows XP having rotated LCD displays (Tablet PCs or swivel-stand LCD displays) is using regular anti-aliasing, or switching off font-smoothing altogether.|$|E
25|$|A random {{variable}} {{is defined as}} a function that maps outcomes to numerical quantities (labels), typically real numbers. In this sense, it is a procedure for assigning a numerical quantity to each physical outcome, and, contrary to its name, this procedure itself is neither random nor variable. What is random is the unstable physics that describes how the coin lands, and the uncertainty of which outcome <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> be observed.|$|E

25|$|These four-digit {{numbers are}} dialled before the {{destination}} number to complete and bill a call by a carrier {{other than the}} subscriber's service provider. For example, to use AAPT to call a number in Tokyo, Japan, subscribers would dial 1414 0011 81 3 xxxx xxxx, or to use Optus to call a Perth they would dial 1456 08 xxxx xxxx. It is not clear if all these prefixes <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> work.|$|E

Boattailed bullets need very little expansion, while unjacketed lead bullets require more expansion to prevent shaving of lead when the bullet is seated.|$|E
25|$|Whichever {{method is}} used, the {{introduction}} of recombinant DNA into the chosen host organism is usually a low efficiency process; that is, {{only a small fraction}} of the cells <b>will</b> <b>actually</b> take up DNA.

50|$|A {{proponent of}} metaphysical voluntarism is 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.
