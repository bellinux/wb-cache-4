50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>Boards.</b> The 24 <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> (Waterschappen) are key {{institutions}} {{in charge of}} water resources management in the Netherlands. They are decentralised public authorities with their own legal personality and financial resources. <b>Water</b> <b>boards</b> {{are based on the}} Dutch Constitution. Their responsibilities are outlined in the <b>Water</b> <b>Boards</b> Act of 1995. <b>Water</b> <b>boards</b> are responsible for flood control, management of regional water resources (quantity and quality) and treatment of urban wastewater. The oldest <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> date from the 13th century, making them the oldest democratic structure in the Netherlands. The umbrella organisation of the <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> is the Association of Dutch <b>Water</b> <b>Boards</b> (Unie van Waterschappen). Many <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> contract out services to the private sector, such as through DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, Operate) contracts for wastewater treatment plants involving private operation for a period of 30 years.|$|R
25|$|The Act also {{modified}} {{the role of}} <b>Water</b> <b>Boards,</b> providing a clear legal definition of the functions of <b>Water</b> <b>Boards</b> and municipalities. <b>Water</b> <b>Boards</b> have historically been the only bulk water providers. Municipalities were obliged to buy water through them. The Act allowed municipalities {{to develop their own}} bulk water supply infrastructure or to buy bulk water from providers other than <b>Water</b> <b>Boards.</b> Conversely it also allowed <b>Water</b> <b>Boards</b> to provide retail water services at the request of municipalities. Since the Act has been passed the capacity of both <b>Water</b> <b>Boards</b> and many <b>water</b> service providers has increased significantly.|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, {{the rural}} <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> created a {{national}} association, the Associación Hondureña de Juntas Administradoras de Agua (...) or Honduran Association of <b>Water</b> <b>Boards</b> {{in order to}} protect their interests. In 2004, the association had about 500 <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> as members, representing 380,000 users. The <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> pay 10 to 15% of their tariff income to AHJAS.|$|R
5|$|In 1879, an Act of Parliament {{was passed}} {{to set up}} a water company for the town; pumping {{machinery}} was installed and works constructed in 1880 to provide a clean water supply to the town. In 1948, the council took over the company and in 1962 its operation was handed to the Kesteven <b>Water</b> <b>Board,</b> which was absorbed by the Anglian Water Authority in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Another example, is the Junta Administradora del Acueducto La Sirena en el Valle del Cauca (<b>Water</b> <b>Board</b> La Sirena) in {{the southwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Cali, which manages 778 residential connections, offering continuous service to some 4,200 users. It operates a sewerage system and a wastewater treatment plant. Water consumption is metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The former fishing {{hamlet of}} Holywell (local {{pronunciation}} ‘holly well’) was situated by the cliff on a ledge some 400 {{yards to the}} southwest of the public garden known as the Holywell Retreat. It was approached from what is now Holywell Road via the lane between the present Helen Gardens and StBede’s School {{which leads to the}} chalk pinnacle formerly known locally as ‘Gibraltar’ or the 'Sugar Loaf'. The ground around the pinnacle was the site of lime kilns also worked by the fishermen. The fishing hamlet at Holywell was taken over by the local <b>water</b> <b>board</b> in 1896 to exploit the springs in the cliffs. The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now even most of the foundations of the cottages have gone over the cliff.|$|E
50|$|By 1850 {{there were}} about 3,500 <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> in the country. In modern times <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> merged as they dealt with joint (and {{sometimes}} conflicting) interests. Mergers eventually reduced the number to 25 <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> in 2011.|$|R

25|$|Bulk water tariffs vary greatly. In 2011 {{the largest}} <b>water</b> <b>board,</b> Rand Water, charged Rand 3.97 (US$0.48) per cubic meter.

40|$|The Netherlands is {{particularly}} vulnerable for {{the impacts of}} climate change on the water system. Regional water authorities, or <b>water</b> <b>boards,</b> are given {{an important role to}} design and implement specific adaptation policies and measures to manage these impacts. From the early 2000 s onwards <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> are starting to adapt to climate change impacts, yet no systematic assessments exist to assess whether or not progress is being made and what explains similarities and differences across <b>water</b> <b>boards.</b> This paper aims to address these critical questions by analyzing the progress of all Dutch <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> for the period 2005 – 2016. We systematically collected and analyzed three consecutive water management plans for all 23 <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> in the Netherlands. We use content analysis methods to analyze progress by looking into their vulnerability and three levels of adaptation: recognition, groundwork and adaptation action. The results show that over time the number of reported climate change adaptation initiatives by the <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> is increasing, but most climate change adaptation is still at the recognition or groundwork level. Our findings reveal a diversity of efforts to adapt to climate change among Dutch <b>water</b> <b>boards.</b> We conclude that while (inter) national water and climate change adaptation policies have called for more adaptation action at regional levels, the unequal progress across the Netherlands suggests that existing ‘soft’ policy measures to push for adaptation might not be sufficient to ensure progress on adaptation across all <b>water</b> <b>boards.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|The first dikes {{and water}} control {{structures}} were built and maintained by those directly benefiting from them, mostly farmers. As the structures got more extensive and complex councils were formed from {{people with a}} common interest in the control of water levels on their land and so the first <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> began to emerge. These often controlled only a small area, a single polder or dike. Later they merged or an overall organization was formed when different <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> had conflicting interests. The original <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> differed much {{from each other in}} the organisation, power, and area that they managed. The differences were often regional and were dictated by differing circumstances, whether they had to defend a sea dike against a storm surge or keep the water level in a polder within bounds. In the middle of the 20th century there were about 2,700 <b>water</b> control <b>boards.</b> After many mergers there are currently 27 <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> left. <b>Water</b> <b>boards</b> hold separate elections, levy taxes, and function independently from other government bodies.|$|R
50|$|The {{tasks of}} <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> remain {{basically}} unchanged. Having a rich history {{dating back to}} the Middle Ages, they are the oldest governing bodies and the oldest democratic institutions in the Netherlands. Dutch <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> have their own coat of arms, a colourful reminder of their importance in Dutch history. The historic buildings that used to house the <b>water</b> <b>boards</b> are another legacy. Called gemeenlandshuis or waterschaphuis, these charming old buildings {{can be found at the}} heart of many Dutch towns.|$|R
