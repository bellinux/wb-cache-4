5|$|A {{sequel to}} the game, Ace Attorney Investigations 2, was {{released}} in Japan on February 3, 2011. There are currently no plans for Capcom to release it internationally, but a fan translation has been made and released on the internet. In July 2013, Eshiro {{said that he and}} Yamazaki <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a third Investigations game, and that he intended to secure the needed Capcom personnel and plan everything out in the future, but that he could not make any promises.|$|E
5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state that they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It {{turns out that}} this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers {{that he was having}} a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

25|$|Viguié's {{interest}} in the motion picture industry came about in 1901, after viewing the first silent film, an Eduardo Hervet presentation, exhibited in Teatro La Perla in Ponce. During a trip to Paris, France, he witnessed Auguste and Louis Lumière's first public motion picture exhibition at the Caf-Les Capucinos. Upon his return to Puerto Rico he found {{a job as a}} movie projectionist at the Teatro Habana in his hometown. Viguié was inspired by what he saw and decided that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> movies himself. In 1911, he sent one of his friends to France to purchase a Pathe camera with the money that he had earned.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking him whether he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a final statement on his own behalf. In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute. Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass final sentence upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest. When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.|$|E

500|$|The total {{prize money}} on offer {{for the first}} event in 1989 was US$250,000, {{including}} $50,000 for {{the winner of the}} general classification. This, together with the race's place in the international calendar between the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France, made it attractive to high-profile riders and teams, but the event did not attract large crowds. Interviewed on NBC {{prior to the start of}} the 1989 race, Trump stated that [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this the equivalent of the Tour de France". The race filled a gap left by the demise of the Coors International Bicycle Classic, which had been North America's major stage race but which folded following its 1988 edition. Some European teams reportedly missed the Vuelta a España in order to race the Tour de Trump.|$|E

500|$|Much of Albert Victor's time at {{his post}} in Aldershot was spent drilling, which he disliked, {{though he did}} like to play polo. He passed his examinations, and in March 1887, he was posted to Hounslow where he was {{promoted}} to captain. He was given more public engagements, visited Ireland and Gibraltar, and opened the Hammersmith suspension bridge. Of his private life, a childhood friend of Albert Victor later recalled that it was uneventful: [...] "his brother officers had said that they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a man of the world of him. Into that world he refused to be initiated."

I think that will not only bring some kind of heartfelt drama but humor into it". Wong also stated [...] "we don't want to have the audience expect to see a serial killer every week. ...

Greenhalgh worked on the script at the same time as he was writing his BBC Three series Burn It, also set in Manchester.
