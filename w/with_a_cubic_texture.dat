The work is based on the following hypothesis: increasing the stacking fault energy Esf, and, as <b>a</b> consequence, <b>cubic</b> structure formation is possible due to rather strong compressive stress in the ribbon. On the conceptions developed, two new ways for production of <b>a</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>texture</b> in the ribbon were realized: (i) TiN thin layer plasma deposition, and (ii) Ni–W alloy rolling under conditions providing dislocation high density ("extreme rolling").

40|$|Abstract. Texture {{evolution}} in Mg- 13 wt%Li-X alloy cold-rolled from 1. 35 mm to 0. 34 mm thickness was investigated, by obtaining pole figures and orientation distribution functions (ODFs). Punching {{tests were conducted}} to reveal the effect of texture nature on formability. It was found that: (1) the textures of the as-received sheet are characterized by α fiber texture, a γ fiber <b>texture</b> and <b>a</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>texture</b> in both cold-rolled and annealed conditions; (2) with thickness reduction though rolling, {{the intensity of the}} γ fiber texture continuously increases and finally the γ fiber texture connects into { 111 } tube texture, the texture of orientation flows towards { 223 } along α fiber, the <b>cubic</b> <b>texture</b> of { 001 } turns into { 035 }, while some grains concentrate at { 011 } orientation; (3) good punching behavior of the cold-rolled sheet corresponds to the appearance of a well-developed γ fiber texture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of structure and properties of Ti-Ta-Mo layers produced on the surface of commercially pure (cp) titanium using non-vacuum electron beam processing. Due to electron-beam surface alloying, a thick defect-free layer with increased hardness was produced. The average concentration of Ta and Mo was 22 % (wt.) and 9 % (wt.) respectively, which {{led to the formation of}} the β-Ti matrix with nanoscale precipitation of the ω-phase. The electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) study revealed the formation of <b>a</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>texture</b> along the direction of β-Ti normal to the sample surface, during crystallization of the surface layer. The results of this study can be used to predict the properties, particularly, the Young modulus of surface alloyed titanium, which may be of interest for biomedical application...|$|R
