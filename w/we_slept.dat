500|$|However, {{because of}} the devastation caused in Haiti, these plans were postponed. Phillips said that Jones had called Lionel and said, [...] "this is what this song is written for, as a {{fundraising}} vehicle for causes, tragedies, catastrophes like this. Why don't we take over the process, call our friends, and actually do this?" [...] Lionel understood the urgency of Haiti, and in January 2010, {{it was agreed that}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] would be re-recorded to help benefit Haiti, similar to how the original recording helped famine relief in Africa. Richie commented, [...] "Unfortunately, sometimes it takes a hit record to make someone decide to save a life. I want this song to be the battle cry again. Every once in a while, you have to wake the world up. <b>We</b> <b>slept</b> right through Katrina. If we are not a socially aware culture, we're going to fail." ...|$|E
500|$|Romeo Void's {{best known}} song is [...] "Never Say Never", which {{contains}} the famous line [...] "I might like you better if <b>we</b> <b>slept</b> together." [...] Allmusic writer Heather Phares {{has argued that}} Iyall's [...] "teasing, existential musings [...] predated and predicted the aloof yet frank sexuality of early- and mid-'90s artists such as Elastica and Liz Phair". Phares concluded that the song was [...] "a subversive, influential classic" [...] and [...] "one of new wave's most distinctive and innovative moments. [...] " [...] The song has been covered by many artists, among them are Queens of the Stone Age and Amanda Blank. The song [...] "A Girl in Trouble (Is a Temporary Thing)", their highest-charting single, was reportedly written {{as a response to}} Michael Jackson's hit song [...] "Billie Jean", but can also be seen as a tribute to women who have experienced traumatizing events. Iyall also wrote songs that touched on themes like social alienation ("Undercover Kept") and generation gaps ("Chinatown").|$|E

500|$|The Danville Political Club, a debating {{society which}} existed between 1786 and 1790, {{frequently}} held its {{meetings at the}} tavern. Many members of this society {{went on to become}} prominent political leaders at the state and national levels. Eleven of the Club's thirty members would participate in {{at least one of the}} ten constitutional conventions that helped separate Kentucky from Virginia. Among the members were Kentucky's first Secretary of State (and future U.S. Senator from Louisiana), James Brown; its third governor, Christopher Greenup; chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, George Muter; federal judges Harry Innes, William McClung, and Samuel McDowell; Congressmen Willis Green, Stephen Ormsby, Thomas Speed, David Walker, and Matthew Walton; U.S. Senator John Brown; and Thomas Todd, a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The existence of the club was lost to history until Speed's grandson, Thomas Speed II, discovered extensive minutes of its meetings that his grandfather, the club secretary, had taken and stored in a desk drawer. The younger Speed later published these minutes with his own commentary about the club, in which he opined that [...] "Full and complete biographies of some of the members would present a history of Kentucky from the beginning of its settlement past the first quarter of the ensuing century." [...] One of the few extant references to the Club outside Speed's meeting minutes is an entry in the journal of a U.S. Army paymaster named Major Beatty; while staying overnight at Grayson's Tavern, Beatty recorded that he and his companions were [...] "very much disturbed by a Political Club which met in the next house where <b>we</b> <b>slept</b> and kept us awake till 12 or 1 o'clock." ...|$|E

2500|$|The early European {{name for}} the {{district}} was [...] "Limestone Plains". In 1820, following the discovery of Lake George and the Yass River, Governor Lachlan Macquarie decided to send a party, with provisions for one month, to discover the Murrumbidgee River. Joseph Wild was accompanied by James Vaughan, a constable, and Charles Throsby Smith, a nephew of the explorer Charles Throsby. Detailed instructions {{had been given to}} the explorers by Charles Throsby, who had accompanied the Lake George exploration party earlier in the year. They were provided with acid to test for limestone. On 7 December 1820, Smith recorded in his journal: ... Came on to one of the plains we saw at 11 o’clock. At half past 1, came to a very extensive plain, fine Rich Soil and plenty of grass. Came to a Beautiful River plains that was running thro’ the plains in a S.W. direction, by the side of which <b>we</b> <b>slept</b> that night. When we made the Hut this evening, we saw several pieces of stone that had been burnt by all appearances. I then examined some of it, which proved to be limestone. ...|$|E
60|$|We made seven miles, and {{camped in}} the desert. Young Clagett (now member of Congress from Montana) unharnessed and fed and watered the horses; Oliphant and I cut sagebrush, built {{the fire and}} brought water to cook with; and old Mr. Ballou the {{blacksmith}} did the cooking. This division of labor, and this appointment, was adhered to throughout the journey. We had no tent, and so <b>we</b> <b>slept</b> under our blankets in the open plain. We were so tired that <b>we</b> <b>slept</b> soundly.|$|E
6000|$|After {{reading this}} {{telegram}} to Lucilla, I {{sent it to}} Oscar at Browndown. Judge for yourself how he slept, and how <b>we</b> <b>slept,</b> that night! ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> never <b>slept</b> in our [...] "house." [...] It never recurred to us, for one thing; and besides, it {{was built}} to hold the ground, and that was enough. We {{did not wish to}} strain it.|$|R
60|$|Arthur and Quincey {{came home}} with me, {{and we tried to}} cheer each other on the way. We had left behind the child in safety, and were tired. So <b>we</b> all <b>slept</b> with more or less reality of sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "What did {{you gain}} by this disagreeable habit of early rising?"--This is a {{question}} I have often asked myself since.

6000|$|... 'Yes there is,' said Rasmus; 'when {{we were on}} our way south, <b>we</b> <b>slept</b> in {{the wood}} near here one night, and I shot a stag.' ...|$|E

60|$|The police decided, {{after hearing}} by {{telegram}} from London, {{that we must}} go up at once by the night express, which they stopped for the purpose. They were forced to divide us. I took the sleeping-car; Harold travelled with two constables in a ordinary carriage. Strange to say, notwithstanding all this, so great was our relief from the tension of our flight, that <b>we</b> both <b>slept</b> soundly.|$|R

60|$|I've {{heard of}} the people going into raptures over beds of coal. <b>We</b> <b>slept</b> in one every night and {{were not in the}} least stuck up about it.|$|E

5000|$|The ornate three-part {{keyboard}} accompaniment {{is derived}} from the opening notes of the hymn and a separate [...] "joy motif" [...] that permeates the piece, exquisitely [...] "winding above and around chorale melody like a luxurious garland of amaranth." [...] Only four lines of the cantus firmus are heard in the tenor pedal, the chorale prelude closing with a seemingly timeless bell-like coda over a pedal point, perhaps illustrating the final lines of the hymn, [...] "after death we will be buried deep in the earth; when <b>we</b> have <b>slept,</b> <b>we</b> will be awoken by God." [...] It is also interesting to note that in this [...] "bell" [...] coda, the note c1 sharp is heard 7 times consecutively, within a fourth voice, outside of the three accompaniment voices. This would seem to be indicative of the German funeral bell.|$|R
5000|$|Elsewhere Luther {{states that}} [...] As soon as thy eyes have closed shalt thou be woken, a {{thousand}} years shall be as if thou hadst slept but a little half hour.

6000|$|Young Crusty and I were inseparable companions; <b>we</b> had <b>slept</b> in {{the same}} room, hunted over the same ground, and {{scribbled}} at the same desk during the whole winter, and now we purchased a small hunting canoe from an Indian, {{for the purpose of}} roaming about together in spring.

60|$|This was on {{the second}} day of our flight, after <b>we</b> had <b>slept</b> one night in the rain upon the {{inclination}} of a mountain.
