5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors would prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{in their best interest}} to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand that they had been deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E

25|$|Medieval writers often {{assumed that}} paganus as a {{religious}} term {{was a result of}} the conversion patterns during the Christianization of Europe, where people in towns and cities were converted more readily than those in remote regions, where old ways lingered. However, this idea has multiple problems. First, the word's usage as a reference to non-Christians pre-dates that period in history. Second, paganism within the Roman Empire centred on cities. The concept of an urban Christianity as opposed to a rural paganism would not have occurred to Romans during Early Christianity. Third, unlike words such as , paganus had not yet fully acquired the meanings (of uncultured backwardness) used to explain <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been applied to pagans.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the HDP and the PKK has been put forward by the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) as a reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be better for the}} HDP to not gain representation in Parliament, though government journalists alleged that this would result in greater violence by the PKK and attempts to establish a separate parliament in Diyarbakır. In election posters and propaganda, the HDP has been accused of scaremongering and using the PKK to coerce voters into voting for them, stating that there would be more violence if the HDP failed to pass the election threshold. In contrast, HDP politicians also accused the AKP of scaremongering when they claimed that their affiliation to the PKK made them unfit for parliamentary representation. PKK militants have also been accused of raiding local shops and cafes in the south-east of Turkey and demanding votes for the HDP, with one civilian being wounded when a group of PKK youth militants raided a cafe in Silvan. Selahattin Demirtaş has denied having an 'organic relationship' with the PKK and claimed that the allegations of PKK militants demanding votes for the HDP from voters was untrue.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} that Nottingham could not support a tramway company; that there was this, that, and the other special reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be all moonshine in Nottingham. It was said again that the uneven roads would necessitate the {{employment}} of too many extra horses to make the company pay; but these prognosticators {{did not know that}} uneven roads create traffic; that people are ever ready to jump into a car, and even pay a full fare to simply ride {{to the top of a}} hill. Now it happens that these prophets are without honour in their native land. The tramways company is a great success in the town, as we shall see very soon. The first section was opened on September the 18th last year, the running being to and from the Railway Stations, the Trent Bridge , and St. Peter's Church. On that first day 2,277 persons were carried in four inside cars, which were worked by 27 horse, the fare being twopence all the way. But here is something rather good. In the week ending October the 5th (Goose Fair week mind) no fewer than 32,619 persons were carried in five cars; and this result was said by experienced men to be unparalleled in the history of tramways.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there are}} no known records {{from the time the}} canal was constructed, the lock at Hudd's Mill was {{documented}} by Thomas Surbey in 1699. Surbey was a water engineer, and made notes and drawings when he visited it, during a journey from London to York. The lock chamber was [...] long and [...] wide. The gates were hung on stone piers, but the banks between them were of earth. The gates were conventional 'V' gates, similar to modern ones, which included some sort of paddle, but did not include balance beams. Instead, a chain or rope was attached to the mid-stream edge of the gate and to the bank. While this would have made opening the gates possible, it is not obvious how they were shut. The measurements match those of the surviving structures, with the exception of Briggin's lock, which appears to only be [...] long. There is no visible evidence that it was shortened at some point, nor any obvious reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been built shorter than all the others.|$|E
500|$|... "First Strike" [...] first {{surfaced}} on September 2006. It {{was conceived}} {{after the completion}} of the mid-season two-parter, [...] "The Return", where writer Martin Gero wanted Atlantis leave the planet, but didn't know how and <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> happen until the episode was written. Gero also wanted Atlantis damaged and drop out of hyperspace into deep space by the end, so the following episode [...] "Adrift" [...] would follow. The Stargate satellite was originally meant to be a moon-sized satellite sent to destroy Lantea, but was dropped in favour for the Stargate satellite to destroy Atlantis, since a previous episode [...] "Echoes" [...] involved the saving of Lantea, and Brad Wright deemed its proposed destruction inappropriate. The scene where Weir thought her leadership challenged was needed to be written, since there were several instances in past episodes where the military step in as leaders. The scene where Ronon Dex says he needs to learn more science was written to parallel Ronon's appearance in only a few scenes. Gero also wrote the Fantastic Four into the scene, where Sheppard compared Teyla Emmagan to the Invisible Woman, paralleling the lack of Teyla's appearance as well.|$|E
500|$|Other philosophers, however, have {{suggested}} that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes. No one has given a causal explanation, they argue, of <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be possible for a functionally equivalent non-conscious organism (i.e., a philosophical zombie) to achieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism. If evolutionary processes are blind {{to the difference between}} function F being performed by conscious organism O and non-conscious organism O*, it is unclear what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide. As a result, an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation but was an exaptation arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement. Consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the retina where it is not an adaption of the retina, but instead just a by-product of the way the retinal axons were wired. [...] Several scholars including Pinker, Chomsky, Edelman, and Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory {{in the context of the}} development of higher-order consciousness (see Neural correlates section above).|$|E

2500|$|Scholars {{disagree}} on whether Robertet received his painting or not. In January 1507 Francesco Pandolfini, the Florentine {{ambassador to the}} French court in Blois, reported that “a little picture by [...] hand has recently been brought here and is held to be an excellent thing”. The Madonna does not, however, appear in a posthumous inventory of Robertet’s collection made in 1532 (though {{the authenticity of the}} inventory has been called into question).

2500|$|A related {{constraint}} {{is imposed}} by the relative timescales seen in some bursts between the short-timescale variability and the total length of the GRB. Often this variability timescale is far shorter than the total burst length. For example, in bursts as long as 100 seconds, {{the majority of the}} energy can be released in short episodes less than 1 second long. If the GRB were due to matter moving towards Earth (as the relativistic motion argument enforces), it is hard to understand <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> release its energy in such brief interludes. The generally accepted explanation for this is that these bursts involve the collision of multiple shells traveling at slightly different velocities; so-called [...] "internal shocks".

2500|$|However, {{procedural}} {{processes are}} not always necessarily damning in this way. Immanuel Kant, a great influence for Rawls, similarly applies a lot of procedural practice within the practical application of The Categorical Imperative, however, this is indeed not based solely on 'fairness'. Even though an example like the one above regarding the orange would not be something that required the practical application of The Categorical Imperative, it is important [...] to draw distinction between Kant and Rawls, and note that Kant's Theory would not necessarily lead to the same problems Rawls' does— i.e., the cutting in half of the orange. Kant's Theory promotes acting out of Duty— acting for the Summum Bonum for him, The Good Will - and in fact encourages Judgement, too. What this would mean [...] is that {{the outcome of the}} Orange's distribution would not be such a simple process for Kant as the reason <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be wanted by both parties would necessarily have {{to be a part of}} the Judgement process, thus eliminating the problem that Rawls' account suffers here.|$|E
