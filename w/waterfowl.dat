5|$|Lead, one of {{the leading}} causes of {{toxicity}} in <b>waterfowl,</b> has been known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations. When hunters use lead shot, <b>waterfowl</b> such as ducks can ingest the spent pellets later and be poisoned; predators that eat these birds are also at risk. Lead shot-related <b>waterfowl</b> poisonings were first documented in the US in the 1880s. By 1919, the spent lead pellets from <b>waterfowl</b> hunting was positively identified as the source of <b>waterfowl</b> deaths. Lead shot has been banned for hunting <b>waterfowl</b> in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Other threats to wildlife include lead paint, sediment from lead mines and smelters, and lead weights from fishing lines. Lead in some fishing gear has been banned in several countries.|$|E
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{attract a}} wide variety of <b>waterfowl.</b> Lake Phelps is just one of several large, shallow {{freshwater}} lakes on the Pamlico-Albemarle Peninsula. These lakes are all winter grounds for ducks, geese and swans. The <b>waterfowl</b> at Lake Phelps use the area primarily for roosting purpose before flying off to nearby feeding sites. Tundra swans and Canada geese feed in nearby farm fields and the ducks feed in the wetlands. The <b>waterfowl</b> usually arrive in the area in October and overwinter until February or March. Commonly seen <b>waterfowl</b> are Canada geese, tundra swans, mallards, American black ducks and northern pintail.|$|E
5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are {{especially}} important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory <b>waterfowl</b> and shorebirds. <b>Waterfowl</b> observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, tundra swan, long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern shoveler.|$|E

5000|$|Most male <b>waterfowls</b> {{are very}} {{protective}} in raising their offspring, sharing scout duties with the female. Examples are the geese, swans, gulls, loons, {{and a few}} species of ducks. When the families of most of these <b>waterfowls</b> travel, they usually travel in a line and the fathers are usually the ones guarding the offspring {{at the end of}} the line while the mothers lead the way.|$|R
5|$|The mallard is {{considered}} to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Unlike many <b>waterfowl,</b> mallards are considered an invasive species in some regions. It is a very adaptable species, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of <b>waterfowl</b> before development. The non-migratory mallard interbreeds with indigenous wild ducks of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous <b>waterfowl.</b> The wild mallard is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted by the domesticated and feral mallard populations.|$|E

5|$|As a {{breeding}} ground for <b>waterfowl,</b> Lågskär has the status of an Important Bird Area (IBA) and is frequented by ornithologists who use the Lågskär Lighthouse buildings during their stay. In the past, several vessels have sunk off the coast.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{were among}} the wild animals hunted for food before the Neolithic {{revolution}} {{and the development of}} agriculture. For example, in the Epipaleolithic of the Levant, between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both <b>waterfowl</b> and migratory birds were eaten. Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example <b>waterfowl</b> captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.|$|E

A colony {{of up to}} 20,000 barnacle geese, over 10,000 greylag geese and thousands of waders stop on the coastal pastures in spring. The most numerous birds of passage (around 1.6 million) are long-tailed ducks. Approximately 35,000—40,000 ducks feed in the reedbeds in spring. In autumn, about 300,000 migratory <b>waterfowl</b> pass Matsalu. The wetland is the biggest autumn stopping ground of common cranes in Europe. The highest recorded number of cranes at the park has been 23,000.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in <b>waterfowl,</b> which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for <b>waterfowl</b> must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate {{the effects of the}} addition of wintering <b>waterfowl’s</b> feces prior to plantingrice on nutrient dynamics, rice growth, and decomposition of rice straws in a controlled mesocosm. <b>Waterfowl’s</b> fecesand rice straws were placed on paddy soils in a mesocosm and the water level maintained at 5 cm. The amounts of suppliedfeces were 0 (control), 222, and 444 g/m 2. While the addition of feces showed no immediate effects, nutrients in thesurface water increased in the month following treatment. Nutrients increased to a greater degree in the treatments withmore feces added. Simultaneously, the decomposition of rice straws was promoted, indicating that more nutrients wouldbe made available over time. The rice showed high productivity in the period during which nutrient level was increased,when rice needs more nutrients for the tillering stage. Therefore, the wintering <b>waterfowl’s</b> feces could be associated withincreased productivity during the growing season of rice through promoting nutrient supply and rapid decomposition ofrice residue...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried (1) {{to analyze the}} phylogenetic {{relationship}} of fragment hemaglutinin (HA) geneof avian influenza viruses (AIV) subtype H 5 N 1 isolated from apparently healthy backyard <b>waterfowls</b> inWest Java with representative of animal and human isolates from Indonesia and some countries in Asia;(2) to find out cross-reactivity of those viruses with a standard Indonesian strain. Nucleotide sequences ofHA gene of AIV H 5 N 1 from backyard <b>waterfowls</b> along with other H 5 N 1 isolates of Indonesian and Asianorigin were aligned using with ClustalW of MEGA 3. 1 program. Estimation of genetic distance and theconstruction phylogenetic tree were conducted by Neighbor Joining method and calculation of distancematrix using Kimura 2 -parameter. Antigenic analysis was conducted using hemagglutination inhibition(HI) test. Result of phylogenetic analysis indicated that all viruses from backyard <b>waterfowls</b> form threedistinct sublineages.

5|$|Unlike many <b>waterfowl,</b> mallards {{have benefited}} from human {{alterations}} to the worldso much {{so that they are}} now considered an invasive species in some regions. They are a common sight in urban parks, lakes, ponds, and other man-made water features in the regions they inhabit, and are often tolerated or encouraged in human habitat due to their placid nature towards humans and their beautiful and iridescent colours. While most are not domesticated, mallards are so successful at coexisting in human regions that the main conservation risk they pose comes from the loss of genetic diversity among a region's traditional ducks once humans and mallards colonise an area. Mallards are very adaptable, being able to live and even thrive in urban areas which may have supported more localised, sensitive species of <b>waterfowl</b> before development. The release of feral mallards in areas where they are not native sometimes creates problems through interbreeding with indigenous <b>waterfowl.</b> These non-migratory mallards interbreed with indigenous wild ducks from local populations of closely related species through genetic pollution by producing fertile offspring. Complete hybridisation of various species of wild duck gene pools could result in the extinction of many indigenous <b>waterfowl.</b> The wild mallard itself is the ancestor of most domestic ducks, and its naturally evolved wild gene pool gets genetically polluted in turn by the domesticated and feral populations.|$|E
