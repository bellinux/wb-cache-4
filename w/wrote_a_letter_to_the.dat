This was declared successful on 8 February 2013 when the DfE opted to leave Seacole on the curriculum.|$|E
5|$|Specter has {{received}} a 61% rating from the AFL-CIO. He voted for cloture on the Employee Free Choice Act in 2007. In early 2009, Specter announced {{he would not be}} voting for cloture on the same act in the 111th Congress. After Specter switched parties, he changed his position on the issue again, and <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unions indicating he supported card check legislation.|$|E

5|$|Ryba {{announced}} on 1 December 1980 {{that he intended}} to bar the dissenting players from the Poland squad. When {{the rest of the team}} returned to Poland, Terlecki once again attempted to form a footballers' union. Securing the support of 16 other Poland international players, he <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PZPN declaring their intention to do so, leading the authorities to order them to face a tribunal. Only Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk continued to endorse the letter when challenged in court.|$|E
5|$|Blaine and {{his wife}} and daughters sailed for Europe in June 1887, visiting England, Ireland, Germany, France, Austria-Hungary, and finally Scotland, where they stayed at the summer home of Andrew Carnegie. While in France, Blaine <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New-York Tribune criticizing Cleveland’s plans to reduce the tariff, saying that free trade with Europe would {{impoverish}} American workers and farmers. The family returned to the United States in August 1887. His letter in the Tribune had raised his political profile even higher, and by 1888 Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, both former opponents, urged Blaine to run against Cleveland again. Opinion within the party was overwhelmingly in favor of renominating Blaine.|$|E
5|$|Carr Gomm {{contacted}} {{other institutions}} and hospitals {{more suited to}} caring for chronic cases, but none would accept Merrick. Gomm <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Times, printed on 4 December, outlining Merrick's case and asking readers for suggestions. The public response—in letters and donations—was significant, and the situation was even covered by the British Medical Journal. With the financial backing of the many donors, Gomm {{was able to make}} a convincing case to the committee for keeping Merrick in the hospital. It was decided that he would be allowed to stay there for the remainder of his life. He was moved from the attic to two rooms in the basement adjacent to a small courtyard. The rooms were adapted and furnished to suit Merrick, with a specially constructed bed and—at Treves's instruction—no mirrors.|$|E

5|$|During the 1840s, {{students}} in Philadelphia schools began {{the day with}} reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teaching while at school. As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child {{should be forced to}} participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, and {{the siege}} of Basing House between 1643 and 1645, the town played host to large numbers of Parliamentarians. During this time, St. Michael's Church was damaged whilst being used as an {{explosive}} store and lead was stripped {{from the roof of}} the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, Basingstoke leading to its eventual ruin. It had been incorporated in 1524, but was effectively out of use after the Civil War. The 17th century saw serious damage to much of the town and its churches, because of the great fires of 1601 and 1656. Cromwell is thought to have stayed here towards the end of {{the siege of}} Basing House, and <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Speaker of the House of Commons addressed from Basingstoke.|$|E
5|$|Harrison lost {{a bid for}} Senate in 1831, {{and found}} {{insufficient}} support to mount {{a run for the}} House of Representatives in 1832. His large family gave him money problems, and he remained out of public life in the early 1830s. By 1834, opposition to President Jackson was coalescing into {{what became known as the}} Whig Party. Harrison, though several years out of active politics was a war hero with roots in both North and South, and had been fired by Jackson. Thus, he looked attractive as a possible presidential candidate to the new party, something that Harrison did nothing to discourage. Harrison <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> newspapers that won over many Whigs, assuring them of his fidelity to party principles, such as the limited power of the executive and federal subsidies for roads, canals and railroads.|$|E

5|$|In 1694, two Franciscan friars set {{out from}} Guatemala {{to see if they}} could succeed where the Dominicans had failed. Antonio Margil and Melchor López left Cobán in August 1693 to seek out the hostile Lakandon Ch'ols in the depths of the rainforest. Antionio Margil had already spent two years among the Manche Ch'ol. Although they found the Lakandon, the mission was a failure and the friars were forced to flee. Disappointed by their failure, in April 1694 the friars <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{president}} of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, Jacinto de Barrios Leal, stating their belief that any further peaceful attempts at converting the Ch'ol peoples were pointless, and that the time had come for military action.|$|E
5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns. Her most significant {{objection to the}} ordinance {{was that it would}} allow homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school. She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos of child pornography by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified. Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more public role.|$|E
5|$|Marshall {{returned}} to the East Coast in late September 1931. Although he was writing Arctic Village, he also wrote prolifically on other topics and published several articles about American forestry. In particular, he was concerned that few articles of this time {{addressed the issue of}} deforestation, and he <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> president of the American Forestry Association, George D. Pratt, on the matter. He also pursued a variety of other activities: he accepted an invitation to serve on a committee to dedicate a memorial (Louis Marshall Memorial Hall) to his father at the forestry college in Syracuse. He lectured in various cities, delivering speeches about his travels and wilderness preservation.|$|E

5|$|The {{author and}} biographer Tom Rolt, visited {{the line in}} 1949, along with the {{locomotive}} engineer David Curwen. In the summer of 1950, Rolt <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Birmingham Post newspaper suggesting that a rescue of the Talyllyn be undertaken. He received sufficient positive response for a meeting of interested enthusiasts to be held on 11 October 1950 at the Imperial Hotel in Birmingham. Around 70people, including Patrick Whitehouse, attended the meeting, with Rolt proposing {{the formation of a}} committee to look into the acquisition of the railway. With the support of the meeting, the committee – with Rolt as chairman and Whitehouse as Secretary – {{met for the first time}} on 23 October and immediately entered into negotiation with Haydn Jones' executors.|$|E
5|$|A {{road from}} Julian to Kane Springs was {{completed}} in 1925. Efforts to include this road extending to Brawley into the state highway system date back from 1927, {{in order to receive}} state funding for the road. Plans for a cross-country road through Borrego Springs were being discussed by county government officials in 1927, as there were no east–west state highways in between Mountain Springs and Riverside. Those living in Calipatria and Westmorland supported the prospect of the road to Julian being improved, and included in the state highway system. In 1928, state assembly member Myron Witter <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> San Diego County Board of Supervisors to suggest that the highway be incorporated as a second entrance to the county from the east, and that it would not detract from the progress of the other highway from El Centro; however, the county wanted to prioritize the paving over the designation. Chambers of commerce in the Imperial Valley generally agreed with Witter, proposing that the El Centro–Calexico road be made a part of the state highway system, and the Kane Springs–Julian road be given second priority for inclusion.|$|E
5|$|Both Boycott and McGregor Blacker were {{involved}} in a protracted dispute with Mr Carr, the agent for the Achill Church Mission Estate, from whom McGregor Blacker leased the lands, and Mr O'Donnell, Carr's bailiff. The dispute began when Boycott and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate, and Boycott's candidates won. Carr was also the local receiver of wrecks, which meant that he was entitled to collect the salvage from all shipwrecks in the area, and guard it until it was sold in a public auction. The local receiver had a right to a percentage of the sale and to keep whatever did not sell. In 1860 Carr <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Official Receiver of Wrecks stating that Boycott and his men had illegally broken up a wreck and moved the salvage to Boycott's property. In response to this accusation, Boycott sued Carr for libel and claimed £500 in damages.|$|E

5|$|On 29 January 1536, when Anne miscarried a son, {{the king}} began to reflect {{again on the}} biblical {{prohibitions}} that had haunted him during his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. Shortly after the miscarriage, the king started to {{take an interest in}} Jane Seymour. By 24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare the case for a divorce. Unaware of these plans, Cranmer had continued to write letters to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April. Anne was sent to the Tower of London on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell. On the very next day, Cranmer <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king expressing his doubts about the queen's guilt, highlighting his own esteem for Anne. After it was delivered, however, Cranmer was resigned {{to the fact that the}} end of Anne's marriage was inevitable. On 16 May, he saw Anne in the Tower and heard her confession and the following day, he pronounced the marriage null and void. Two days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death.|$|E
5|$|Taking an {{advantage}} of Mathabar's absence in Kathmandu, the military battalions {{under his command}} were distributed to other courtiers during the annual muster {{at the beginning of}} 1837. Nevertheless, Bhimsen managed to secure his and his family members' positions in the civil and military offices. An investigation was also started to check Bhimsen's expenditures in establishing various battalions. Such events led the courtiers to feel that Bhimsen's mukhtiyari would not last very long; thus Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the hopes of becoming the next mukhtiyar, <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> King asking him to be recalled to Kathmandu from Palpa. His wish was granted; and Bhimsen, pleased to see his brother after many years, made Ranbir Singh the acting Mukhtiyar and decided to go to his ancestral home in Borlang Gorkha for the sake of pilgrimage. But in truth, Bhimsen had gone to Gorkha to placate his nephew and bring him back to Kathmandu.|$|E
5|$|The {{setback for}} the reformers was short-lived. By September, Henry was displeased {{with the results}} of the Act and its promulgators; the ever-loyal Cranmer and Cromwell were back in favour. The king asked his {{archbishop}} to write a new preface for the Great Bible, an English translation of the Bible that was first published in April 1539 under the direction of Cromwell. The preface was {{in the form of a}} sermon addressed to readers. As for Cromwell, he was delighted that his plan of a royal marriage between Henry and Anne of Cleves, the sister of a German prince was accepted by the king. In Cromwell's view, the marriage could potentially bring back contacts with the Schmalkaldic League. Henry was dismayed with Anne when they first met on 1 January 1540 but married her reluctantly on 6 January in a ceremony officiated by Cranmer. However, the marriage ended in disaster as Henry decided shortly thereafter that he would request a royal divorce. This resulted in Henry being placed in an embarrassing position and Cromwell suffered the consequences. His old enemies, including the Duke of Norfolk, took advantage of the weakened Cromwell and he was arrested on 10 June. He immediately lost the support of all his friends, including Cranmer. However, as Cranmer had done for Anne Boleyn, he <b>wrote</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king defending the past work of Cromwell. Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleves was quickly annulled on 9 July by the vice-gerential synod, now led by Cranmer and Gardiner.|$|E
