It builds on the insight that often the owner <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> can use <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> to derive greater value than that which would be obtained from an immediate sale. For example, a machine may be profitably employed in a business but no more than scrap value could be obtained from its sale (net selling price).|$|R

The victims were transferred to Biarritz which took them to Folkestone before resuming her voyage to Boulogne. The Dover Lifeboat and a tug from Dover searched for the remaining two victims.

In this sector, the entity deals with <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> specific cases but has to follow the common accounting principles at the same time.

The practical part of the study is relevant here since accounting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular company is analyzed. The data used in the theoretic part of the thesis are based on literature. The data used in the practical part were provided by the surveyed company.

40|$|Highway {{agencies}} {{attempt to}} apply efficient accounting systems {{to help improve}} the transparency of their budget allocation and their overall performance. The accrual accounting system has been adopted to substitute the cash accounting system by many central governments around the world. The system reports transactions of economic value changes rather than when cash movements are made. The asset value and its depreciation determined by the accrual accounting system illustrate {{the total amount of}} economic value owned by an agency and the consumption of the future economic benefits for <b>an</b> <b>asset.</b> The age-based depreciation approach, which is a traditional approach, is applied to determine the depreciation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> based on the defined useful life and the straight-line depreciation method. The advantage of this approach is its simplicity and its ability to support the long-term asset management system. The condition-based depreciation is recommended as an alternative approach since the actual condition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> can reflect its depreciation. The depreciation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> based on the condition-based approach is suitable for single-year maintenance planning since the executives cannot estimate the required budget for replacing or preserving <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> in the long-term period. This research focuses on developing the new depreciation approach by integrating the age-based and the condition-based depreciation approaches in order to strategically plan long-term highway maintenance and to enable the actual condition <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> to be reflected.
