Approximately 3,800 people, {{representing}} 199 scientific institutes and 43 countries, form the CMS collaboration who built and now operate the detector.

2500|$|Although the Higgs {{field is}} non-zero {{everywhere}} {{and its effects}} ubiquitous, proving its existence was far from easy. In principle, it can be proved to exist by detecting its excitations, which manifest as Higgs particles (the Higgs boson), but these are extremely difficult to produce and to detect. The importance of this fundamental question led to a 40-year search, {{and the construction of}} one of the world's most expensive and complex experimental facilities to date, CERN's Large Hadron Collider, in an attempt to create Higgs bosons and other particles for observation and study. On 4 July 2012, the discovery of a new particle with a mass between 125 and [...] was announced; physicists suspected that it was the Higgs boson.Q: 'If we don't know the new particle is a Higgs, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about it?'

A traveler is lost on a Western prairie. He has wandered all day, far from home and with nothing to eat. Night comes on. The wolves begin to howl in the darkness. At last he reaches a log cabin, almost in ruins. No matter, it will afford him shelter for the night. Scarcely has he entered and composed himself to rest when a violent storm arises. Thunders roar. Lightnings flash. The snow heaps against the door. It grows bitterly cold. What shall he do? He can't stay there and freeze to death. Let me illustrate. Two darkies, walking down Broadway, saw a quarter of a dollar on the sidewalk. One of the colored gentlemen said to his companion, 'Sambo, don't you freeze to dat quarter. I seed it first.' That is just the idea. He can't stay there and freeze. His soul—but <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about the soul? Is it homogeneous or heterogeneous? Who can tell?
