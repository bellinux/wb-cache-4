5|$|Hillcourt was tasked {{to write}} a new manual for Scoutmasters in 1934 and worked <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>good</b> friend and {{colleague}} E. Urner Goodman, the national program director of the BSA. He and his wife moved to a house in Mendham Borough, New Jersey, to be near Schiff Scout Reservation, the BSA's national training center, {{so he could be}} in place to put this theories to a practical test. In order to do so, he founded Troop 1 of Mendham in 1935 as a unit directly chartered to the National Council of the BSA. As the Scoutmaster, he used Troop 1 to test and validate his work for 16years.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said of Hannah de Rothschild that she {{grew up with a}} good sense and {{presence}} of mind, enabling her to deputise for her mother on grand social occasions at Mentmore and in London. This gave her confidence and the experience to be the perfect political wife. Marriage to her altered Rosebery's status, too: while his wife acquired Christian respectability and a title, Rosebery moved from being one of many wealthy and capable young noblemen to being one with unfathomable riches. This, coupled <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>good</b> looks, appealed to the public's imagination and gave him glamour.|$|E

5|$|As it {{had become}} evident that the Aouzou Strip was being used by Libya {{as a base for}} deeper {{involvement}} in Chad, Malloum decided to bring the issue of the Strip's occupation before the UN and the Organisation of African Unity. Malloum also decided he needed new allies; he negotiated a formal alliance with Habré, the Khartoum Accord, in September. This accord was kept secret until 22 January, when a Fundamental Charter was signed, following which a National Union Government was formed on 29 August 1978 with Habré as Prime Minister. The Malloum-Habré accord was actively promoted by Sudan and Saudi Arabia, both of which feared a radical Chad controlled by Gaddafi. The two nations saw in Habré, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>good</b> Muslim and anti-colonialialist credentials, the only chance to thwart Gaddafi's plans.|$|E
5|$|The fourth match, between Minoru Suzuki and Kazushi Sakuraba, was {{conducted}} under UWFi rules; {{it would end}} with a knockout, submission, or referee stoppage. During the match, Sakuraba and Suzuki battled onto the entrance ramp, where Sakuraba used a kimura lock to injure Suzuki's arm. When {{they returned to the}} ring, Sakuraba targeted Suzuki's injured arm with kicks, stomps, and a cross armbreaker hold. Suzuki withstood the assault, responding with slaps <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>good</b> arm and a running kick to Sakuraba's face. Suzuki applied a rear naked choke, making a judo throw while maintaining the choke (Saka Otoshi). Sakuraba fought the hold until he lost consciousness, at which point the referee stopped the match in favour of Suzuki at 9 minutes and 21 seconds. After the match, the wrestlers shook hands and embraced.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>his</b> <b>good</b> {{academic}} reputation, several {{staff members}} {{provided him with}} work as a tutor in Ancient History in the Department of Tutorial Classes, but he was prevented from doing so by the Chancellor of the University, Sir William Cullen, who feared that Childe would propagate socialism to students. This infringement of Childe's civil rights was condemned in the leftist community, and the issue {{was brought up in}} the Parliament of Australia by centre-left politicians William McKell and T.J. Smith. Moving to Maryborough, Queensland, in October 1918 Childe took up employment teaching Latin at the Maryborough Grammar School. Here too his political affiliations became known, and he was subject to an opposition campaign from local conservative groups and the Maryborough Chronicle, resulting in abuse from disobedient pupils. He soon resigned.|$|E

5|$|Feynman {{spent several}} weeks in Rio de Janeiro in July 1949, {{and brought back}} a woman called Clotilde from Copacabana who lived with him in Ithaca for a time. As well as the cold weather, {{there was also the}} Cold War. The Soviet Union detonated its first atomic bomb in 1949, {{generating}} anti-communist hysteria. Fuchs was arrested as a Soviet spy in 1950, and the FBI questioned Bethe about Feynman's loyalty. Physicist David Bohm was arrested on December 4, 1950, and emigrated to Brazil in October 1951. A girlfriend told Feynman that he should consider moving to South America. He had a sabbatical coming for 1951–52, and elected to spend it in Brazil, where he gave courses at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas Físicas. In Brazil, Feynman was particularly impressed with the Samba music, and learned to play a metal percussion instrument, the frigideira. He was an enthusiastic amateur player of bongo drums and often played them in the pit orchestra in musicals. He spent time in Rio <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>good</b> friend Bohm, but Bohm could not convince Feynman to take up investigating Bohm's ideas on physics.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved on}} to Ipswich Town in 1969 {{and it was there}} that he {{established}} his reputation as a successful manager, supported by the club chairman John Cobbold and then later by his brother Patrick Cobbold. He won the vacant job at the Suffolk club after a chance encounter with Town director Murray Sangster while scouting at Portman Road for Chelsea manager Dave Sexton. After four mediocre seasons, Robson led Ipswich to fourth place in the First Division and success in the Texaco Cup in the 1972–73 season. In the following nine seasons, Ipswich finished lower than sixth place in the First Division only once, in the 1977–78 season. However, that season was a success with a 1–0 victory over Arsenal] in the FA Cup final. His reign at Ipswich lasted 13 years, during which time the club twice finished as League runners-up, and made regular appearances in European competitions, capturing the UEFA Cup in 1981 with a 5–4 aggregate victory over Dutch side AZ 67 Alkmaar. During his 13-year tenure, he brought in only 14 players from other clubs, most notably Allan Hunter, Bryan Hamilton and Paul Mariner, relying instead on players developed through Ipswich's youth programmes, including Terry Butcher, George Burley, John Wark, Mick Mills, Colin Viljoen, Alan Brazil, Trevor Whymark, Brian Talbot, Kevin Beattie and Eric Gates, who all went on to play international football. His imports included Dutch players Frans Thijssen and Arnold Mühren. Robson was not a tactical genius but he showed a talent for developing new players, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>good</b> interpersonal skills, caring attitude, hard work and enthusiasm helping them to achieve their best.|$|E
