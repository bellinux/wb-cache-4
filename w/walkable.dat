5|$|According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 18.6% of Seattle {{residents}} {{used one}} of the three public transit systems that serve the city, giving it the highest transit ridership of all major cities without heavy or light rail prior to the completion of Sound Transit's Central Link line. The city has also been described by Bert Sperling as the fourth most <b>walkable</b> U.S. city and by Walk Score as the sixth most <b>walkable</b> of the fifty largest U.S. cities.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 {{study by}} Walk Score ranked Omaha 21st most <b>walkable</b> of fifty largest U.S. cities. There is an {{extensive}} trail system {{throughout the city}} for walkers, runners, bicyclists, and other pedestrian modes of transportation.|$|E
5|$|The library {{supports}} {{the use of}} public transportation and active transportation by virtue of its central location in a dense, <b>walkable</b> district served by numerous bus routes, and by providing onsite bike parking.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 {{study by}} Walk Score ranked Denver sixteenth most <b>walkable</b> of fifty largest U.S. cities, though massive {{gaps in the}} cities {{sidewalks}} remain an oft-discussed issue. Many walkability advocates believe the city's need for pedestrian infrastructure is only growing as Denver and the Colorado Department of Transportation place the needs of cars over the needs of people by widening roads or the purposeful plowing of snow onto sidewalks during winter storms.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2010 study, Washington-area commuters spent 70hours a year {{in traffic}} delays, which tied with Chicago for having the nation's worst road congestion. However, 37% of Washington-area commuters take public {{transportation}} to work, the second-highest rate in the country. An additional 12% of D.C. commuters walked to work, 6% carpooled, and 3% traveled by bicycle in 2010. A 2011 study by Walk Score found that Washington was the seventh-most <b>walkable</b> {{city in the country}} with 80% of residents living in neighborhoods that are not car dependent.|$|E
5|$|The programmers {{identified}} {{early on}} that pathfinding—the ability of the variable-sized characters to navigate through the environment—would be a problem. Huebner cited the difficulty of programming characters to navigate {{an environment in which}} level designers are free to add stairs, ramps, and other 3D objects. They came up with a temporary solution and planned to improve the pathfinding later into development. By the time they properly addressed the problem, many of the levels were almost complete and featured few markers the programmers could use to control movement. They could identify <b>walkable</b> tiles but not walls, cliffs, and other environmental hazards. Ideal solutions, such as creating zones for characters could walk through would have taken too much time to retroactively add into the 100 created levels, so the programmers spent several weeks making small, iterative fixes to conceal the obvious errors in the pathfinding and leave less obvious ones intact.|$|E

25|$|Marquette has an {{extensive}} network of biking and walking paths. The {{city has been}} gradually expanding the paths and has been promoting itself as a <b>walkable</b> and livable community. Cross Country ski trails are also located at Presque Isle Park and the Fit Strip.|$|E
25|$|Cities {{are shaped}} by their {{transport}} systems. In The City in History, Lewis Mumford documented how the location and layout of cities was shaped around a <b>walkable</b> center, often located near a port or waterway, and with suburbs accessible by animal transport or, later, by rail or tram lines.|$|E
25|$|The World Naked Bike Ride {{was born}} in 2001 in Spain with the first naked bike rides, which then emerged as the WNBR in 2004 a concept which rapidly spread through collaborations with many {{different}} activist groups and individuals {{around the world to}} promote bicycle transportation, renewable energy, recreation, <b>walkable</b> communities, and environmentally responsible, sustainable solutions to living in the twenty-first century.|$|E
25|$|The Portland {{metropolitan}} area has transportation services common to major U.S. cities, though Oregon's emphasis on proactive land-use planning and transit-oriented development within the urban growth boundary means that commuters have multiple well-developed options. In 2014, Travel + Leisure magazine rated Portland as the #1 most pedestrian and transit-friendly {{city in the}} United States. A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Portland 12th most <b>walkable</b> of fifty largest U.S. cities.|$|E
25|$|New urbanism is an American {{urban design}} {{movement}} that {{arose in the}} early 1980s. Its goal has been to reform all aspects of real estate development and urban planning, from urban retrofits to suburban infill. New urbanist neighborhoods are designed to contain a diverse range of housing and jobs, and to be <b>walkable.</b> Other, more auto-oriented cities are also making incremental changes to provide transportation alternatives through Complete streets improvements.|$|E
25|$|Milwaukee is {{a popular}} venue for Lake Michigan sailing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, ethnic dining, and {{cultural}} festivals. Often {{referred to as the}} City of Festivals, Milwaukee has various cultural events which take place throughout the summer at Henry Maier Festival Park, on the lake. Museums and cultural events, such as Jazz in the Park, occur weekly in downtown parks. A 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Milwaukee 15th most <b>walkable</b> of fifty largest U.S. cities.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Chicago {{was ranked}} the sixth-most <b>walkable</b> large {{city in the}} United States. Many of the city's {{residential}} streets have a wide patch of grass and/or trees between {{the street and the}} sidewalk itself. This helps to keep pedestrians on the sidewalk further away from the street traffic. Chicago's Western Avenue is the longest continuous urban street in the world. Other famous streets include Michigan Avenue, State Street, Clark Street, and Belmont Avenue. The City Beautiful movement inspired Chicago's boulevards and parkways.|$|E
25|$|After November 1614, Archduke Maximilian III summoned Scheiner to Innsbruck {{several times}} to discuss astronomical and {{mathematical}} questions. The Archduke had received an astronomical telescope with two convex lenses which showed objects upside down and the wrong way round. Scheiner added a third lens, thus manufacturing a terrestrial telescope which allowed Maximilian to see the beautiful stretches of his country while standing upright. A portable camera obscura was developed by Scheiner in Innsbruck. Furthermore, a <b>walkable</b> camera obscura was constructed.|$|E
25|$|The University District is {{characterized}} {{as one of}} the most diverse, <b>walkable</b> and lively neighbourhoods in the City of Kingston. Within its borders, Queen's University offers publicly accessible athletic facilities, art galleries, museums and libraries. The District also contains other institutions such as KCVI, Kingston General Hospital, and many local businesses. The density of rental housing for students in the area coupled with its very close proximity to the university makes its existence a pull factor for prospective students who are considering attending Queen's.|$|E
25|$|Oakland {{has more}} than 50 {{distinct}} neighborhoods. The city's greater divisions include downtown Oakland and its greater Central Business District, Lake Merritt, East Oakland, North Oakland, West Oakland, and the Oakland Hills. East Oakland, which includes the East Oakland Hills, encompasses {{more than half of}} Oakland's land area, stretching from Lakeshore Avenue on the east shore of Lake Merritt southeast to the San Leandro border. North Oakland encompasses the neighborhoods between downtown and Berkeley and Emeryville. West Oakland is the area between downtown and the Bay, partially surrounded by the Oakland Point, and encompassing the Port of Oakland. In 2011, Oakland was ranked the 10th most <b>walkable</b> city in the United States.|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 2010, it was {{announced}} by the New Jersey Department of Transportation that Montclair, along with Somerville, had been designated as transit villages. These transit villages are designated to provide residents and people public transit with public services including new residences and stores. Montclair was given high regard for the work done at Bay Street station to make it possible, including a new parking deck, and a complex of seven residential units along Pine Street. These transit villages would also be {{given a chance to}} get $100,000 in funding to continue the station's development. Although Montclair's transit village is mostly built at Bay Street, the township also serves five other stations, all in <b>walkable</b> distance from residences.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery {{has been}} {{recognized}} nationally for its continuing downtown revitalization. In the early 2000s, the city constructed the Montgomery Biscuits minor league baseball stadium and Riverfront Park. Following those developments, {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars have been invested by private companies that have adapted old warehouses and office buildings into loft apartments, restaurants, retail, hotels, and businesses. The demand for downtown living space has risen, as people want to have <b>walkable,</b> lively neighborhoods. More than 500 apartment units are under construction, including The Heights on Maxwell Boulevard, The Market District on Dexter Avenue, the Kress Building on Dexter Avenue, The Bell Building on Montgomery Street, and a new complex by the convention center.|$|E
25|$|Various current {{movements}} in urban design seek to create sustainable urban environments with long-lasting structures, buildings {{and a great}} liveability for its inhabitants. The most clearly defined form of <b>walkable</b> urbanism {{is known as the}} Charter of New Urbanism. It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities that support sustainable transport. Residents in compact urban neighbourhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures compared with those living in sprawling suburbs. The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{the city}} {{commission}} approved the new Miami 21 zoning policy {{that was considered}} a landmark example of New Urbanism, winning then-Mayor Miami Diaz the 2009 American Architectural Foundation's Keystone Award for taking on Miami 21. As the population grows in the region, especially in the greater downtown Miami area, graded and textured crosswalks are added to slow traffic along busy streets such as Brickell Avenue and Biscayne Boulevard (US 1). New crosswalks installed in the Upper Eastside along Biscayne Boulevard in late 2011 will also be outlined with flashing lights, as well as having islands {{in the center of}} the road and large speed feedback signs to warn automotive traffic. Plans have been floated to close the already <b>walkable</b> Flagler Street in Downtown Miami to traffic altogether or for festivals.|$|E
25|$|As {{a growing}} urban area, Ithaca is facing steady {{increases}} {{in levels of}} vehicular traffic on the city grid and on the state highways. Outlying areas have limited bus service, and many people consider a car essential. However, many consider Ithaca a <b>walkable</b> and bikeable community. One positive trend {{for the health of}} downtown Ithaca is the new wave of increasing urban density in and around the Ithaca Commons. Because the downtown area is the region's central business district, dense mixed-use development that includes housing may increase the proportion of people who can walk to work and recreation, and mitigate the likely increased pressure on already busy roads as Ithaca grows. The downtown area is also the area best served by frequent public transportation. Still, traffic congestion around the Commons is likely to progressively increase.|$|E
