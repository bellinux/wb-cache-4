5|$|All of the inert {{versions}} <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> manufacturers {{directly to}} Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by rail, {{where they were}} used by the 216th Base Unit in flight testing of the bomb. Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron as training exercises. The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval Ammunition Depot, McAlester, Oklahoma, for filling with explosives. The Composition B was poured as a slurry, solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours, sealed, and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, California, for shipment by sea to Tinian.|$|E
5|$|In July 1886 an Australian {{prospector}} {{reported to}} the Transvaal government his discovery of an unprecedented gold reef between Pretoria and Heidelberg. The South African Republic's formal proclamation of this two months later prompted the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg, which {{within a few years}} was the largest city in southern Africa, populated almost entirely by uitlanders. The economic landscape of the region was transformed overnight—the South African Republic <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> verge of bankruptcy in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to the Cape Colony's the following year. The British became anxious to link Johannesburg to the Cape and Natal by rail, but Kruger thought this might have undesirable geopolitical and economic implications if done prematurely and gave the Delagoa Bay line first priority.|$|E

5|$|State {{highways}} {{were first}} formally {{defined by the}} state legislature in 1909 and given numeric designations, although these initial designations were not publicly signed. Portions of modern Route22 were defined as part of legislative routes1 and 22. Legislative route1 <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> New York City line north along the White Plains Post Road to White Plains, then detoured to Harrison (via Westchester Avenue), before proceeding north to Armonk (via modern NY120). Legislative route1 continued north along modern NY22 to Austerlitz, where it then turned northwest to Valatie (via modern NY203 and NY980B), then followed US9 to Albany. Legislative route22 had two segments. The southern segment began in Troy, following NY7 to Hoosick, then went north along modern NY22 up to Putnam Station (south of Ticonderoga).|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Tarbosaurus was {{completely}} described {{for the first}} time in 2003. Scientists noted key differences between Tarbosaurus and the North American tyrannosaurids. Many of these differences are related to the handling of stress by the skull bones during a bite. When the upper jaw bit down on an object, force was transmitted up through the maxilla, the primary tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw, into surrounding skull bones. In North American tyrannosaurids, this force <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> maxilla into the fused nasal bones on top of the snout, which were firmly connected in the rear to the lacrimal bones by bony struts. These struts locked the two bones together, suggesting that force was then transmitted from the nasals to the lacrimals.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route18, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} {{ran from the}} Pennsylvania state line at Ripley {{to the mouth of}} the Niagara River north of Youngstown with a gap through the city of Buffalo. North of Buffalo, Route18 followed Niagara Falls Boulevard (modern NY950K and U.S. Route62 or US62) to Niagara Falls and current NY104 and NY18F between Niagara Falls and Lake Ontario. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of legislative Route18 north of Buffalo became the basis for NY34, which began at Main Street (NY5) in Buffalo and followed the path of legislative Route18 through Niagara Falls and along the Niagara River to Lake Ontario. NY18 was assigned at the same time; however, it initially <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania state line at Limestone north to Buffalo along what is now US219, NY417, NY353 and US62. In Cattaraugus County, NY18 initially followed Leon and New Albion Roads between Cattaraugus and Little Valley.|$|E

5|$|In November 1933 Serong {{applied to}} the Royal Military College, Duntroon, but was unsuccessful. He {{subsequently}} joined the CMF, serving in the 57th/60th Battalion, and was based in Heidelberg, in outer Melbourne. In a five-month period he <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rank of private to lance corporal. He also studied the military and civilian subjects that made up Duntroon's first-year curriculum {{in the hope of}} gaining entry into the college at second-year level in 1934. Serong successfully completed the service entry exam in August 1934, entering RMC in February 1935. In 1936 Serong won the welterweight category of the RMC boxing championship. At the end of 1937 he graduated from Duntroon as a lieutenant, and initially served with the coastal artillery, being posted to Queenscliff in 1938. Subsequent postings included Fort Largs near Adelaide to help raise and train Militia and develop the artillery installation there, before returning to Queenscliff as an instructor in 1940.|$|E

He played clay-court tournaments in Europe which conflict with the WTT schedule. Player-coach Frew McMillan was the only Golden Gaters returning player in 1978. In addition to newcomers Mayer and Wade, Ilana Kloss returned to the league and the team after a two-year absence, and the Golden Gaters signed Michael Wayman and Marise Kruger. In June, the Golden Gaters hired Tom Dietrich as assistant coach replacing Henry Schneidman who remained with the organization. Just {{before the start of the}} playoffs, the Golden Gaters signed Tom Leonard who was a regular member of the playoff lineup.|$|E

25|$|Culture in the Low Countries {{at the end}} of the 15th {{century was}} {{influenced}} by the Italian Renaissance, through trade via Bruges which made Flanders wealthy. Its nobles commissioned artists who became known across Europe. In science, the anatomist Andreas Vesalius led the way; in cartography, Gerardus Mercator's map assisted explorers and navigators. In art, Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting <b>went</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> strange work of Hieronymus Bosch to the everyday life of Pieter Brueghel the Elder. In architecture, music and literature too, the culture of the Low Countries moved into the Renaissance style.|$|E
