500|$|Wizards & Warriors has {{received}} scant coverage from modern video gaming websites. Video gaming website GamesRadar named the opening {{theme for the}} game as [...] "Game music of the day", noting that the theme [...] "suggests, from the moment {{you turn on the}} game, that knights, wizards, goblins and who knows <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>are</b> about to collide in a battle so epic it's destined for a Frazetta painting." [...] JC Fletcher from Joystiq called the game [...] "a simple action-platformer about a guy in thick armor who kicks open treasure chests in order to bribe knights". He also notes the variety of good and bad items such as the [...] "Staff of Power" [...] which inflicts much damage to enemies and conversely the [...] "Cloak of Darkness", which he says [...] "makes Kuros invisible to you but not to enemies". He said that the game has an arcade feel, with unlimited continues, a high-score list, name entry for high scores, and good music. Houston Press Jef Rouner lauded the game's music and animation, and noted its high difficulty level, especially during boss battles. IGN listed Wizards & Warriors at #56 on its [...] "Top 100 NES Games" [...] list, reviewer Sam Claiborn said that the game was inspired by Dungeons & Dragons-type RPGs, but it went further in incorporating action platforming elements along with more traditional RPG elements. Columnist and comedy writer Seanbaby humorously criticized the game for items that did not work as intended, including the [...] "Cloak of Darkness" [...] and the [...] "Boots of Lava Walk".|$|E
2500|$|Five {{pitchers}} {{who were}} primarily relievers have been {{inducted into the}} Baseball Hall of Fame. Hoyt Wilhelm {{was the first to}} be elected in 1985, followed by Rollie Fingers, Dennis Eckersley, Bruce Sutter, and Goose Gossage. Eckersley was the first closer in the one-inning save era to be inducted. He believed that he was inducted because he was both a starter and a reliever. [...] "If I came up today as a closer and played 20 years, would I have made it ? These pitchers did the job they were supposed to do for 20 years. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>are</b> they supposed to do?" [...] said Eckersley.|$|E

But I was very interested in machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture– thought it was silly and stupid– then, when I saw the astronauts: <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>are</b> they but part of a machine?

2500|$|In his Octavius, Marcus Minucius Felix(? — c. 250AD, Rome), {{responding}} to the pagan jibe that Christians worship wooden crosses – {{an indication of how}} the cross symbol was already associated with Christians – denies the charge and then retorts that the cross shape (a crossbeam placed on an upright) is honoured even by pagans in the form of their standards and trophies and is in any case found in nature: [...] "Crosses, moreover, we neither worship nor wish for. You, indeed, who consecrate gods of wood, adore wooden crosses perhaps as parts of your gods. For your very standards, as well as your banners; and flags of your camp, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>are</b> they but crosses gilded and adorned? Your victorious trophies not only imitate the appearance of a simple cross, but also that of a man affixed to it. We assuredly see the sign of a cross, naturally, in the ship when it is carried along with swelling sails, when it glides forward with expanded oars; and when the military yoke is lifted up, it is the sign of a cross; and when a man adores God with a pure mind, with hands outstretched. Thus {{the sign of the cross}} either is sustained by a natural reason, or your own religion is formed with respect to it." ...|$|E

One and all, the professors, the preachers, and the editors, hold their jobs by serving the Plutocracy, and their service consists of propagating only such ideas as are either harmless to or commendatory of the Plutocracy.

60|$|In {{one of his}} least convincing phrases, Nietzsche {{had said}} that just as the ape {{ultimately}} produced the man, so should we ultimately produce something higher than the man. The immediate answer, of course, is sufficiently obvious: the ape did not worry about the man, so why should we worry about the Superman? If the Superman will come by natural selection, may we leave it to natural selection? If the Superman will come by human selection, what sort of Superman are we to select? If he is simply to be more just, more brave, or more merciful, then Zarathustra sinks into a Sunday-school teacher; {{the only way we}} can work for it is to be more just, more brave, and more merciful; sensible advice, but hardly startling. If he is to be anything else than this, why should we desire him, or <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>are</b> we to desire? These questions have been many times asked of the Nietzscheites, and none of the Nietzscheites have even attempted to answer them.|$|E
60|$|This further is {{observable}} in number, {{that it is}} {{that which}} the mind makes use of in measuring all things that by us are measurable, which principally are EXPANSION and DURATION; and our idea of infinity, even when applied to those, seems to be nothing but the infinity of number. For <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>are</b> our ideas of Eternity and Immensity, but the repeated additions of certain ideas of imagined parts of duration and expansion, with the infinity of number; {{in which we can}} come to no end of addition? For such an inexhaustible stock, number (of all other our ideas) most clearly furnishes us with, as is obvious to every one. For let a man collect into one sum as great a number as he pleases, this multitude how great soever, lessens not one jot the power of adding to it, or brings him any nearer the end of the inexhaustible stock of number; where still there remains as much to be added, as if none were taken out. And this ENDLESS ADDITION or ADDIBILITY (if any one like the word better) of numbers, so apparent to the mind, is that, I think, which gives us the clearest and most distinct idea of infinity: of which more in the following chapter.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have written}} and ordered your last book, THE REAL THING, {{so be sure}} and don't send it. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>are</b> you doing or {{thinking}} of doing? News I have none, and don't want any. I have had to stop all strong drink and all tobacco, and am now in a transition state between the two, {{which seems to be}} near madness. You never smoked, I think, so you can never taste the joys of stopping it. But at least you have drunk, and you can enter perhaps into my annoyance when I suddenly find a glass of claret or a brandy-and-water give me a splitting headache the next morning. No mistake about it; drink anything, and there's your headache. Tobacco just as bad for me. If I live through this breach of habit, I shall be a white- livered puppy indeed. Actually I am so made, or so twisted, that I do not like to think of a life without the red wine on the table and the tobacco with its lovely little coal of fire. It doesn't amuse me from a distance. I may find it the Garden of Eden when I go in, but I don't like the colour of the gate-posts. Suppose somebody said to you, you are to leave your home, and your books, and your clubs, and go out and camp in mid-Africa, and command an expedition, you would howl, and kick, and flee. I think the same of a life without wine and tobacco; and if this goes on, I've got to go and do it, sir, in the living flesh! ...|$|E
