40|$|A new <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control</b> {{algorithm}} that {{adjusts the}} power {{output of the}} most upstream wind turbine in a wind farm for power increase and load reduction was developed in this study. The algorithm finds power commands to individual wind turbines to maximize the total power output from the wind farm when the power command from the transmission system operator {{is larger than the}} total available power from the wind farm. To validate this <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control</b> algorithm, a relatively high fidelity wind farm simulation tool developed in the previous study was modified to include a wind farm controller which consists of a wind speed estimator, a power command calculator and a simplified wind farm model. In addition, the wind turbine controller in the simulation tool was modified to include a demanded power tracking algorithm. For a virtual wind farm with three 5 MW wind turbines aligned with the wind, simulations were performed with various ambient turbulent intensities, turbine spacing, and control frequencies. It was found from the dynamic simulation using turbulent winds that the proposed <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control</b> algorithm can increase the power output and decrease the tower load of the most upstream wind turbine compared with the results with the conventional <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control...</b>|$|E

For an unconstraint wind farm, UIGF is based upon actual megawatt output received through supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system while in case of constraint wind farms, UIGF is based on meteorological forecast based upon number of available wind turbine, wind speed and megawatt set point. AWEFS performs three validation checks prior to every dispatch interval {{to determine if a}} wind farm’s output is being limited below its wind speed-based forecast (potential power): ① Is the <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control</b> system set point less than the registered capacity of the wind farm? ② Is the <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control</b> system set point less than active power plus 5 % of registered capacity? ③ Is the <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control</b> system set point less than potential power? If all three validation checks pass, AWEFS produces a wind speed-based UIGF. If any of these checks fail, AWEFS reverts to producing a UIGF based on the active power SCADA output.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{the recent}} years the wind turbine {{industry}} has focused on optimizing the cost of energy. One of the important factors in this is to increase reliability of the wind turbines. Advanced fault detection, isolation and accommodation are important tools in this process. Clearly most faults are dealt with best at a wind turbine control level. However, some faults are better dealt with at the <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control</b> level. In this paper a benchmark model for fault detection and isolation, and fault tolerant control of wind turbines implemented at the <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control</b> level is presented.

40|$|Renewable {{energy is}} {{becoming}} more and more important in today's society. Wind energy plays an important role in the production of renewable energy. Due to economic advantages, wind turbines are often sited close together, creating wind farms. As a result, the wind turbines in the farm become interconnected due to the wakes of the turbines. In conventional <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control,</b> this interconnection is ignored, and wind turbines are operated at their own local optimum. This control strategy is referred to as greedy con- trol. In the wake of a turbine, the wind speed is reduced. As a result, the power production of a wind turbine that is situated in a wake is also significantly lower. The greedy control strategy may therefore not be optimal for <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control,</b> which subsequently has been receiving an increasing amount of attention recently. Most research on <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>control</b> focusses on steady- state optimization, i. e., finding the optimal steady-state given certain con- stant conditions. Since wind flow is always subject to change, the potential gain of this procedure is limited. In this thesis, a closed-loop dynamic wind farm controller is presented us- ing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework. The control objective is to maximize the power production of the wind farm, resulting in an eco- nomic MPC problem. As the optimal input is time-dependent, the number of control inputs and states involved increase as the prediction horizon of the MPC problem increases, resulting in a more complex problem than the steady-state optimization problem. As a model, WFSim is used, which is based on 2 -dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. This results in a high-dimensional problem from which the opti- mum is unknown. The adjoint method is applied to determine the gradient of the objective function in a time-efficient manner. The controller developed in this thesis increases the power production of a wind farm with respect to the conventional greedy control stategy, and is able to adapt to changes in the atmospheric conditions. The adjoint-based MPC algorithm therefore shows real potential to perform real-time dynamic control on wind farms.

40|$|Reducing wake {{losses in}} <b>wind</b> <b>farms</b> by {{deflecting}} the wakes through turbine yawing {{has been shown}} to be a feasible <b>wind</b> <b>farm</b> <b>controls</b> approach. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of yawing depends not only on the degree of wake deflection but also on the resulting shape of the wake. In this work, the deflection and morphology of wakes behind a wind turbine operating in yawed conditions are studied using wind tunnel experiments of a wind turbine modeled as a porous disk in a uniform inflow. First, by measuring velocity distributions at various downstream positions and comparing with prior studies, we confirm that the non-rotating wind turbine model in yaw generates realistic wake deflections. Second, we characterize the wake shape and make first observations of what is termed a curled wake, displaying significant spanwise asymmetry. The wake curling observed in the experiments is also reproduced qualitatively in large eddy simulations using both actuator disk and actuator line models. When a wind turbine is yawed for the benefit of downstream turbines, the asymmetric shape of the wake must be taken into account since it affects how much of it intersects the downstream turbines.
