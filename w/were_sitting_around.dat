As the Panthers <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>around,</b> awaiting Warner's pre-game talk, Heisman began to orate in the adjoining room. In his charge to the Tech squad, Heisman became flowery and fiery. He brought the heroes of ancient Greece and the soldier dead in his armor among the ruins of Pompeii. It was terrific and the Panthers sat, spellbound. When Heisman had finished, Warner chortled and quietly said to his players: 'Okay, boys. There's the speech. Now go out and knock them off.' ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, recalling {{that it was}} the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come {{up with the idea of}} using Starr's verbal misstep: [...] "The title was Ringo's.

So we <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong.

Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know it was all in good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|After his arrest, mafioso Giovanni Brusca {{described}} the ceremony {{in which he}} was formally made a full member of Cosa Nostra.

He was brought into a room where several mafiosi <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> a table upon which sat a pistol, a dagger, and a piece of paper bearing the image of a saint. They questioned his commitment and his feelings regarding criminality and murder (despite his already having a history of such acts). When he affirmed himself, Salvatore Riina, then the most powerful boss of Cosa Nostra, took a needle and pricked Brusca's finger. Brusca smeared his blood on the image of the saint, which he held in his cupped hands as Riina set it alight. As Brusca juggled the burning image in his hands, Riina said to him: [...] "If you betray Cosa Nostra, your flesh will burn like this saint." ...|$|E

60|$|In an August orchard six {{children}} and a grown-up <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> the pulpit stone. The grown-up was Miss Reade, who had been up to give the girls their music lesson and had consented to stay to tea, much to the rapture of the said girls, who continued to worship her with unabated and romantic ardour. To us, over the golden grasses, came the Story Girl, carrying in her hand a single large poppy, like a blood-red chalice filled with the wine of August wizardry. She proffered it to Miss Reade and, as the latter took it into her singularly slender, beautiful hand, I saw a ring on her third finger. I noticed it, because I had heard the girls say that Miss Reade never wore rings, not liking them. It was not a new ring; it was handsome, but of an old-fashioned design and setting, with a glint of diamonds about a central sapphire. Later on, when Miss Reade had gone, I asked the Story Girl if she had noticed the ring. She nodded, but seemed disinclined to say more about it.|$|E
6000|$|This {{rendered}} {{his situation}} a dangerous one, and, {{on more than}} one [...] occasion, placed his life in jeopardy. At one time in particular, as [...] he was riding after sunset on a summer evening, he came suddenly [...] upon a gang of the most desperate smugglers {{in that part of the}} [...] country. They surrounded him, without violence, but in such a manner [...] as to show that it would be resorted to if he offered resistance, [...] and gave him to understand he must spend the evening with them, [...] since they had met so happily. The officer did not attempt [...] opposition, but only asked leave to send a country lad to tell his [...] wife and family that he should be detained later than he expected. [...] As he had to charge the boy with this message in the presence of the [...] smugglers, he could found no hope of deliverance from it, save what [...] might arise from the sharpness of the lad's observation, and the [...] natural anxiety and affection of his wife. But if his errand should [...] be delivered and received literally, as he was conscious the [...] smugglers expected, it was likely that it might, by suspending alarm [...] about his absence from home, postpone all search after him till it [...] might be useless. Making a merit of necessity, therefore, he [...] instructed and dispatched his messenger, and went with the [...] contraband traders, with seeming willingness, to one of their [...] ordinary haunts. He sat down at table with them, and they began to [...] drink and indulge themselves in gross jokes, while, like Mirabel in [...] the [...] "Inconstant," [...] their prisoner had the heavy task of receiving [...] their insolence as wit, answering their insults with good-humour, [...] and withholding from them the opportunity which they sought of [...] engaging him in a quarrel, that they might have a pretence for [...] misusing him. He succeeded for some time, but soon became satisfied [...] it was their purpose to murder him out-right, or else to beat him in [...] such a manner as scarce to leave him with life. A regard for the [...] sanctity of the Sabbath evening, which still oddly subsisted among [...] these ferocious men, amidst their habitual violation of divine and [...] social law, prevented their commencing their intended cruelty until [...] the Sabbath should be terminated. They <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>around</b> their [...] anxious prisoner, muttering to each other words of terrible import, [...] and watching the index of a clock, which was shortly to strike the [...] hour at which, in their apprehension, murder would become lawful, [...] when their intended victim heard a distant rustling like the wind [...] among withered leaves. It came nearer, and resembled the sound of a [...] brook in flood chafing within its banks; it came nearer yet, and was [...] plainly distinguished as the galloping of a party of horse. The [...] absence of her husband, and the account given by the boy of the [...] suspicious appearance of those with whom he had remained, had [...] induced Mrs--to apply to the neighbouring town for a party of [...] dragoons, who thus providentially arrived in time to save him from [...] extreme violence, if not from actual destruction.] ...|$|E
