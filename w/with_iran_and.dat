5|$|After winning {{re-election}} by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama {{was sworn}} in {{for a second term}} in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted inclusiveness for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal <b>with</b> <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> normalized U.S. relations with Cuba.

Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt helped China kill off a statement on the Xinjiang situation in the OIC. There has been no public reaction by the Arab League, Saudi Arabia and Iran on the situation and China has built stronger relations <b>with</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> Saudi Arabia due to their influence in the Islamic world.|$|E

Sharif's government criticised Iraq for invading the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan's relationships with Iraq.

The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency. Republicans took control of the Senate after the 2014 elections, and Obama continued to grapple with Congressional Republicans over government spending, immigration, judicial nominations, and other issues.|$|E
25|$|After Khomeini gained power, skirmishes between Iraq {{and revolutionary}} Iran {{occurred}} for ten months over {{the sovereignty of}} the disputed Shatt al-Arab waterway, which divides the two countries. During this period, Saddam Hussein publicly maintained that it was in Iraq's interest not to engage <b>with</b> <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> that it was in the interests of both nations to maintain peaceful relations. However, in a private meeting with Salah Omar al-Ali, Iraq's permanent ambassador to the United Nations, he revealed that he intended to invade and occupy a large part of Iran within months. Later (probably to appeal for support from the United States and most Western nations), he would make toppling the Islamic government one of his intentions as well.|$|E

25|$|The {{foreign policy}} of Barack Obama was the {{foreign policy of}} the United States during his administration. Obama named his chief rival for the {{nomination}} Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State during his first term, with Massachusetts Senator John Kerry taking over the post in February 2013. Supporters of Obama's foreign policy applaud what they describe as his cooperation with allies and multilateralism, his ending of the Iraq War, his continuation {{of the process of}} ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, the administration's attempts at destroying al-Qaeda's core leadership, particularly the killing of Osama bin Laden; promoting discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, brokering a nuclear deal <b>with</b> <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> normalizing U.S. relations with Cuba.|$|E
25|$|In 1987â€“88, Argentina's National Atomic Energy Commission {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Iran to help in converting the reactor from highly enriched uranium fuel to 19.75% low-enriched uranium, and to supply the low-enriched uranium to Iran. According to a report by the Argentine justice in 2006, during the late 1980s and early 1990s the US pressured Argentina to terminate its nuclear cooperation <b>with</b> <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> from early 1992 to 1994 negotiations between Argentina and Iran took place with the aim of re-establishing the three agreements made in 1987â€“88. Some have linked attacks such as the 1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires and the AMIA bombing as part of an Iranian campaign to pressure Argentina into honoring the agreements. The uranium was delivered in 1993.|$|E
25|$|Afazaliâ€™s {{tactical}} {{vision and}} practical savvy {{did not go}} unnoticed. After a friendly match between Iran national football team and Shahab Zanjan in Tehran, Iranâ€™s then head coach Miroslav Ciro Blazevic, who had already guided his Croatian side to third place in the 1998 World Cup, invited Afazeli to join the national team staff as technical adviser and analyst. After Ciro departed, Afazeli stayed with the national team for four more years with newly promoted Branko Ivankovic He gained {{a gold medal in}} the 2002 Asian Games, third-place finish in Asian Cup 2004, a World Cup 2006 appearance <b>with</b> <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> more than 100 international matches as an assistant and analyst for the national team.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu (who held office {{for all but}} two months of Obama's presidency) was notably icy, with many commenting on their mutual distaste for each other. On taking office, Obama appointed George J. Mitchell as a special envoy to the Middle East to work towards a settlement of the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict, but Mitchell made little progress before stepping down in 2011. In March 2010, Secretary of State Clinton criticized the Israeli government for approving expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem. Netanyahu strongly opposed Obama's efforts to negotiate <b>with</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> was seen as favoring Mitt Romney in the 2012 US presidential election. However, Obama continued the US policy of vetoing UN resolutions calling for a Palestinian state, and the administration continued to advocate for a negotiated two-state solution. Obama also increased aid to Israel, including funding for the Iron Dome air defense program.|$|E
25|$|Before the war, many {{observers}} believed the US {{and its allies}} could win but might suffer substantial casualties (certainly more than any conflict since Vietnam), and that the tank battles across the harsh desert might rival those of North Africa during World War II. After nearly 50 years of proxy wars, and constant fears of another war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, some thought the Persian Gulf War might finally {{answer the question of}} which military philosophy would have reigned supreme. Iraqi forces were battle-hardened after 8 years of war <b>with</b> <b>Iran,</b> <b>and</b> they were well equipped with late model Soviet tanks and jet fighters, but the antiaircraft weapons were crippled; in comparison, the US had no large-scale combat experience since its withdrawal from Vietnam nearly 20 years earlier, and major changes in US doctrine, equipment and technology since then had never been tested under fire.|$|E
25|$|International {{experts have}} also {{weighed in on}} the controversies {{surrounding}} Brazilâ€™s nuclear program. Hans RÃ¼hle, a former official from the German defense ministry who also worked with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) wrote an article in 2010 in which he indicated that Brazil {{might be on the}} path toward getting the bomb. He based his argument on the submarine project, which may involve the production of highly enriched uranium, and the fact that Brazil seeks to develop capacity to conduct all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle indigenously. While RÃ¼hle affirms that there is no hard proof of a nuclear weapons program in Brazil, he suggests that Brazilâ€™s relations <b>with</b> <b>Iran</b> <b>and</b> defense of the Iranian nuclear program should be seen as a clue of the path Brazil wants to tread. Commenting on RÃ¼hleâ€™s article, the Argentine scholars Federico Merke and Florencia Montal said that Brazil might develop the capacity to manufacture a bomb but that it didnâ€™t seem to have the intention to do so.|$|E
