The release of TNF-α binding to TNF receptor results in receptor internalization and activates caspase-8. Caspase-8-induced apoptosis can either trigger mitochondrial response or directly cause PARP activation by caspase-3. However, rECP-induced apoptosis shows no effects on mitochondrial responses. Accordingly, <b>we</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> rECP induces mitochondria-independent apoptosis.|$|E
