The Turks also controlled the Silk Route, the Black Sea and the eastern half of the Mediterranean. The sultan governed the empire from Constantinople, where architects, painters, calligraphers, jewellers, ceramists, poets, etc., worked for him. Murad, a grandson of Süleyman the Magnificent, was a learned, sybarite sultan, a foremost patron of the arts and responsible to a considerable degree for the great development of Turkish-Ottoman painting in the 16th and early 17th centuries, deemed to be its most fertile period. His reign was also marked by constant <b>warring</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iran</b> and the Christian states of Europe.|$|R

40|$|Since Saddam Hussein {{took power}} in 1979, Iraq {{was engaged in}} <b>wars</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iran,</b> Kuwait, and twice with the United States. The years between the <b>wars</b> <b>with</b> the United States, 1991 - 2003 were {{characterized}} by economic sanctions that destroyed the social fabric the wars had missed. In 2003, after major combat operations were complete, the United Nations created the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) {{to prop up the}} nation in hopes of returning it to a self-sustaining country capable of managing itself economically and politically. This thesis assesses the success of the UNAMI based on two metrics relating to effectiveness and efficiency. The first metric hinges on stated objectives compared to goals achieved and the second will examine the three primary human development indicators; life expectancy at birth, adult literacy, and GDP per capita. The purpose is to determine if the method by which a project is measured determines its effectiveness and efficiency. After reviewing the UNAMI and applying two measures of effectiveness and efficiency, the assessment is the mission is only partially effective and all aspects are inefficient.

According to Hersh this proposed provocation was rejected. Hersh's allegation has not been verified.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the Al-Hussein could {{be traced back to}} the first stages of the <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iran.</b> Iraq was the first belligerent to use long range {{artillery}} rockets during the Iran–Iraq War, firing limited numbers of FROG-7s at the towns of Dezful and Ahvaz. Iran responded with Scud-Bs obtained from Libya. These missiles can hit a target 185 miles away, therefore key Iraqi cities like Sulaymaniya, Kirkuk, and Baghdad itself came within the range of this weapon.|$|E
25|$|Iraq {{had been}} {{listed as a}} State sponsor of {{terrorism}} by the U.S. since 1990, when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.

25|$|The British {{began to}} accuse Iran of {{supporting}} Nazism and being pro-German. Although Reza Shah declared neutrality {{at an early}} stage of the Second World War, Iran assumed greater strategic importance to the British government, which feared that the Abadan Refinery (of the UK-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) might fall into German hands; producing eight million tons of oil in 1940, the refinery was a crucial part of the Allied <b>war</b> effort. Tensions <b>with</b> <b>Iran</b> had been strained since 1931 when the Shah cancelled the D'Arcy Concession, which gave the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company the exclusive right to sell Iranian oil, <b>with</b> <b>Iran</b> receiving only 10 percent (possibly 16 percent) of the revenue or of the profits.|$|R
25|$|The author {{analyzes}} the strategies {{available to the}} U.S. {{to deal with the}} Iran nuclear situation both diplomatically and militarily, and argues combat would not be feasible. Nance warns that <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iran</b> in order to potentially limit their nuclear capabilities would lead to financial ruin in America, retaliatory strikes against Israel, increased oil values, conflict by Iran with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and closure of shipping lanes for oil. Nance acknowledges that Iran contributes significantly to supporting terrorists activities around the planet, {{but at the same time}} argues that a peaceful resolution to the nuclear issue with the country is worthy of seeing if it can come to fruition.|$|E

50|$|Although some eastern {{emperors}} occasionally {{attempted to}} {{campaign in the}} West, none were as successful as Justinian. After 600, events conspired to drive the Western provinces out of Constantinople's control, with imperial attention focused on the pressing issues of <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Sasanian <b>Iran</b> and then the rise of Arab power. For a while, the West remained important, with the Emperor Constans II ruling from Sicily a Roman Empire that still stretched from North Africa to the Caucasus in the 660s, but thereafter imperial attention declined rapidly, with Constantinople itself being besieged in the 670s, renewed <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Arabs in the 680s, and then a period of chaos between 695 and 717, during which time Africa was finally lost to the Romans once and for all.

25|$|The {{political}} novel, The Writing on the Wall, an anti-war {{novel and}} roman à clef {{based on a}} possible John McCain presidency in 2008, warns against <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iran</b> by portraying a worst-case scenario of its outcomes. In it, author Hannes Artens portrays a global depression {{as a result of}} the oil price shooting past $140 per barrel and depicts the falsity of thinking that limited aerial strikes on Iran will end the problem. The story shows them eventually leading to a ground invasion and a military draft in the United States. The book ends with the Iran war escalating into a conflagration seizing the entire Middle East and ultimately culminates in a nuclear showdown between Pakistan and India after an Islamist coup in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Before the war, many {{observers}} believed the US {{and its allies}} could win but might suffer substantial casualties (certainly more than any conflict since Vietnam), and that the tank battles across the harsh desert might rival those of North Africa during World War II. After nearly 50 years of proxy wars, and constant fears of another war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, some thought the Persian Gulf War might finally {{answer the question of}} which military philosophy would have reigned supreme. Iraqi forces were battle-hardened after 8 years of <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iran,</b> and they were well equipped with late model Soviet tanks and jet fighters, but the antiaircraft weapons were crippled; in comparison, the US had no large-scale combat experience since its withdrawal from Vietnam nearly 20 years earlier, and major changes in US doctrine, equipment and technology since then had never been tested under fire.|$|E
25|$|Mir-i Arab Madrassah (1535-1536). The {{construction}} of Mir-i-Arab Madrasah (Miri Arab Madrasah) is ascribed to Sheikh Abdullah Yamani of Yemen - called Mir-i-Arab - the spiritual mentor of Ubaidullah-khan {{and his son}} Abdul-Aziz-khan. Ubaidullah-khan waged permanent successful <b>war</b> <b>with</b> <b>Iran.</b> At least three times his troops seized Herat. Each of such plundering raids on Iran was accompanied by capture of great many captives. They say that Ubaidullah-khan had invested money gained from redemption of more than three thousand Persian captives into {{construction of}} Mir-i-Arab Madrasah. Ubaidullah-khan was very religious. He had been nurtured in high respect for Islam {{in the spirit of}} Sufism. His father named him in honor of prominent sheikh of the 15th century Ubaidullah al-Ahrar (1404-1490), by origin from Tashkent Region. By the thirties of the 16th century the time, when sovereigns erected splendid mausoleums for themselves and for their relatives, was over. Khans of Shaibanid dynasty were standard-bearers of Koran traditions. The significance of religion was so great that even such famed khan as Ubaidullah was conveyed to earth close by his mentor in his madrasah. In the middle of the vault (gurhana) in Mir-i-Arab Madrasah is situated the wooden tomb of Ubaidullah-khan. At his head is wrapped in the moulds his mentor - Mir-i-Arab. Muhammad Kasim, mudarris (a senior teacher) of the madrasah (died in 1047 hijra) is also interred near by here. The portal of Miri Arab Madrasah is situated on one axis with the portal of the Kalyan Mosque. However, because of some lowering of the square to the east it was necessary to raise a little an edifice of the madrasah on a platform.|$|E
50|$|Conflict {{was thus}} inevitable. Iraqi planes bombed Kurdish positions, while Mulla Mustafa mobilized his forces and warned of all-out war.

Mulla Mustafa increased his demands to proposing Kirkuk as the capital of an autonomous Kurdistan. Nevertheless, in October the Ba'ath announced its decision to go ahead with a draft autonomy law under the auspices of discussion with 600 anti-Barzani Kurds. The Ba'ath were willing to ignore the KDP if necessary. Warm discussions between Kurdish socialists and communists and the Ba'ath angered Mulla Mustafa, and his Savak-trained security force, the Parastin, began rounding up and murdering Kurdish communists.|$|R

Following Nasser's death in 1970, the presidency of Anwar Sadat turned this around quickly into an open and cordial friendship. In 1971, Sadat addressed the Iranian parliament in Tehran in fluent Persian, describing the 2,500-year-old historic connectivity between the two nations. Overnight, Egypt and Iran were turned from bitter enemies into fast friends.

Uzbek bands attempted to invade north-east Iran before being repulsed by the governor of Mashhad. The most important event of Mohammad’s reign was the <b>war</b> <b>with</b> the Ottomans. In 1578, the Ottoman sultan Murad III began a <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Safavid <b>Iran</b> which was to last until 1590. In the first attack, the sultan's vizier Lala Mustafa Pasha invaded the Safavid territories comprising Georgia and Shirvan. Shirvan fell {{before the end of the}} summer of 1578, by which fact the Ottomans had now control of almost all territories west of the Caspian Sea coast, and it also opened the way for an attack on what is nowadays the core of Armenia and Azerbaijan, which were subsequently attacked in 1579 by a large contingent of Crimean Tatars, led by Adil Giray Khan, but he was captured in a remarkable counterattack led by Mirza Salman Jabiri and Hamza Mirza, and later executed in Qazvin, the Safavid capital at that time. Another Ottoman army under the leadership of Osman Pasha and Ferhat Pasha crossed into Iran and captured Tabriz in 1585. Sultan Mohammad sent Hamza Mirza to fight the Ottomans but the young prince was murdered during this campaign and the city remained in Ottoman hands for 20 years.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the fall}} of Mohammed Reza Shah in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran has {{remained}} politically isolated from the United States and the West. After eight years of brutal <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Iraq, <b>Iran</b> {{has embarked on a}} major effort to rebuild its devastated military. A major element of its military reconstruction has been the acquisition of advanced weapons systems with strategic applications, such as long-range bombers, submarines, advanced underwater mines, and ballistic missiles. Iran is also suspected of pursuing the development and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. Given Iran's latent hostility towards the United States and its past willingness to engage in terrorism, these activities are a most serious concern. This thesis will examine Iran's strategic motivations, beliefs, intentions, and capabilities, as well as the impact of these capabilities on U. S. interests in the Persian Gulf. It will also examine a range of U. S. policy options in response to Iran's pursuit of strategic military capabilities.
