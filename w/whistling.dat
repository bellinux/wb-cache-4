5|$|Adult {{birds in}} Asia can be {{confused}} with the similar lesser <b>whistling</b> duck, although that species is smaller, has a blackish crown and lacks an obvious dark stripe down the back of the neck. Juvenile fulvous <b>whistling</b> ducks are very like young lesser <b>whistling</b> ducks, but the crown colour is still a distinction. Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than <b>whistling</b> ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced <b>whistling</b> ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E
5|$|The fulvous <b>whistling</b> duck or {{fulvous tree duck}} (Dendrocygna bicolor) is a <b>whistling</b> duck that breeds {{across the}} world's {{tropical}} regions in much of Mexico and South America, the West Indies, the southern US, sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It has mainly reddish brown plumage, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail in flight. Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a <b>whistling</b> call which is given in flight or on the ground. The preferred habitat is shallow lakes, paddy fields or other wetlands with plentiful vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>whistling</b> ducks, Dendrocygna, are a {{distinctive}} {{group of eight}} bird species within the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. They were an early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the Late Miocene before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the Pliocene and later. The fulvous <b>whistling</b> duck forms a superspecies with the wandering <b>whistling</b> duck. It has no recognised subspecies, although the birds in northern Mexico and the southern US {{have in the past}} been assigned to D. b. helva, described as having paler and brighter underparts and a lighter crown than D. b. bicolor.|$|E

50|$|Variable pitch <b>whistle</b> - a <b>whistle</b> {{containing}} {{an internal}} piston available for changing pitch. This <b>whistle</b> type {{could be made}} to sound like a siren or to play a melody. Often called a fire alarm <b>whistle,</b> wildcat <b>whistle,</b> or mocking bird <b>whistle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Toroidal or Levavasseur <b>whistle</b> - a <b>whistle</b> with a torus-shaped (doughnut-shaped) {{resonant}} cavity paralleling the annular gas orifice, named after Robert Levavasseur, its inventor. Unlike a conventional <b>whistle,</b> the diameter (and sound level) of a ring-shaped <b>whistle</b> {{can be increased}} without altering resonance chamber cross-sectional area (preserving frequency), allowing construction {{of a very large}} diameter high frequency <b>whistle.</b> The frequency of a conventional <b>whistle</b> declines as diameter is increased. Other ring-shaped <b>whistles</b> include the Hall-Teichmann <b>whistle,</b> Graber <b>whistle,</b> Ultrawhistle, and Dynawhistle.|$|R

5|$|The striped honeyeater's song is {{described}} as a chirp, chirp, cherry, cherry, its contact call as a sharp chewee and its alarm call as a shrill <b>whistling</b> note.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} usually found in small groups, {{although}} substantial flocks can form at favoured sites. It walks well, without waddling, {{and although it}} normally feeds by upending, it can dive if necessary. It does not often perch in trees, unlike other <b>whistling</b> ducks. It flies at low altitude with slow wingbeats and trailing feet, in loose flocks rather than tight formation. It feeds {{during the day and}} at night in fairly large flocks, often with other <b>whistling</b> duck species, but rests or sleeps in smaller groups {{in the middle of the}} day. They are noisy and display their aggression towards other individuals by throwing back their heads. Before taking off in alarm, they often shake their head sideways.|$|E
50|$|Helmholtz <b>whistle</b> - a <b>whistle</b> with a {{cross-sectional}} area exceeding {{that of the}} <b>whistle</b> bell opening, often shaped like a bottle or incandescent light bulb. The frequency of this <b>whistle</b> relative to its size is {{lower than that of}} a conventional <b>whistle</b> and therefore these <b>whistles</b> have found application in small gauge steam locomotives. Also termed a Bangham <b>whistle.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{effectiveness}} of electronic deer <b>whistles</b> in scaring away sika deer {{that are likely to}} run onto roads, resulting in accidents. These <b>whistles</b> have been used in the U. S. A. and other countries. In this study, two types of deer <b>whistles</b> were tested: one that has a continuous tone with a fixed frequency (<b>Whistle</b> A) and the other that has an intermittent tone with a modulated frequency (<b>Whistle</b> B). To assess {{the effectiveness of}} the <b>whistles</b> in alerting deer, the deer's reactions to the <b>whistles</b> were observed by blowing the <b>whistle</b> from a fixed place that is visible to the deer when they appear by the roadside. For the control sample, deer's behavior when no <b>whistle</b> was blown was observed. When no <b>whistle</b> was blown, 51 % of the deer were on alert about the observers. When <b>Whistle</b> A was blown, 67 % of the deer were on alert; this figure increased to 95 % when <b>Whistle</b> B was blown. The time durations for which the deer were alert when no <b>whistle</b> was blown, <b>Whistle</b> A was blown, and <b>Whistle</b> B was blown were 20 %, 42 %, and 73 %, respectively. These results indicated that the deer <b>whistles</b> are effective in alerting deer, and that <b>Whistle</b> B is more effective than <b>Whistle</b> A. Vehicles can be equipped with deer <b>whistles</b> to alert deer about on-coming vehicles so as to prevent them from crossing roads, and consequently reduce deer-vehicle collisions. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|Chime <b>whistle</b> - {{two or more}} {{resonant}} bells or chambers {{that sound}} simultaneously. In America, railway steam <b>whistles</b> were typically compact chime <b>whistles</b> {{with more than one}} <b>whistle</b> contained within, creating a chord. In Australia the New South Wales Government Railways after the 1924 re-classification many steam locomotives either had 5 chimes <b>whistles</b> fitted (this include many locomotives from the pre 1924 re-classification, or were built new with 5 chime <b>whistles.</b> 3-chimes (3 compact <b>whistles</b> within one) were very popular, as well as 5-chimes, and 6-chimes. In some cases chime <b>whistles</b> were used in Europe. Ships such as the Titanic were equipped with chimes consisting of three separate <b>whistles</b> (in the case of the Titanic the <b>whistles</b> measured 9, 12, and 15 inches diameter). The Japanese National Railways used a chime <b>whistle</b> that sounds like a very deep single-note plain <b>whistle,</b> because the chords where just accessed in a simple parallel circuit if the <b>whistle</b> trigger is pulled down.|$|R
5|$|An {{individual}} male {{may have}} a repertoire of more than 100phrases, many copied from its parents and neighbouring birds. Mimicry may include the imitation of man-made items like telephones, and the song thrush will also repeat the calls of captive birds, including exotics such as the white-faced <b>whistling</b> duck.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, a few {{records of}} {{hybridization}} with the white-faced <b>whistling</b> duck {{have been noted}} in the wild, although {{in most parts of}} southern Africa, the two species breed at different times, bicolor during the dry season (April to September) and viduata during the rains (October to March). Hybridization in captivity is more frequent but limited to other species in the genus Dendrocygna.|$|E
5|$|Red wattlebirds are noisy animals, {{producing}} {{a range of}} raucous calls. Pairs of birds appear to duet, particularly at food sources, with the male {{producing a}} loud cackle and the female a <b>whistling</b> call. The male's cackle is loudest between 1and 3kHz frequency. A guttural-sounding call, it has been variously described as having a squawking, coughing or hiccuping sound. Males cackle when foraging by themselves, when with other birds, or when declaring their territory to other birds. The <b>whistling</b> call consists of up to five rapid whistles {{that may or may}} not ascend in tone and are repeated 3–4 times. Both sexes commonly utter a single chock note that may be harsh and guttural or have 4–5 harmonics. This is thought to be a contact call. These calls all carry over long distances.|$|E

40|$|Several {{methods have}} been used to compare the <b>whistles</b> {{produced}} by dolphins. The two methods used in this study are: (1) a classification of <b>whistle</b> contours in six categories (i. e. constant frequency, upsweep, downsweep, concave, convex, and sine) and (2) the extraction of frequency and time parameters from each <b>whistle</b> contour. Bottlenose Dolphin Tursiops truncatus <b>whistles</b> are described in the same way when comparing <b>whistle</b> contour distributions in each of the six categories and <b>whistle</b> frequency and time parameters using Discriminant Function Analysis. For Spinner Dolphin Stenella longirostris <b>whistles,</b> each method describes <b>whistles</b> differently. Several facts may explain these differences in describing dolphin <b>whistles,</b> such as a greater fluidity of Spinner Dolphin groups when compared to Bottlenose Dolphin groups, greater geographic variation in the <b>whistles</b> of Bottlenose Dolphins than in those of Spinner Dolphins, an average beginning frequency 16 % lower than the average ending frequency in Spinner Dolphin <b>whistles</b> compared to a varied relationship for Bottlenose Dolphins, and stricter criteria used to define <b>whistle</b> contour categories in the study of Spinner Dolphin <b>whistles</b> than in the Bottlenose Dolphin <b>whistle</b> study...|$|R

5|$|The fulvous <b>whistling</b> duck has a {{very large}} range {{extending}} across four continents. It breeds in lowland South America from northern Argentina to Colombia and then up to the southern US and the West Indies.

5|$|These are noisy {{birds with}} a clear <b>whistling</b> kee-wee-ooo call given {{on the ground or}} in flight. Quarrelling birds also have a harsh {{repeated}} kee. In flight, the beating wings produce a dull sound. The calls of males and females show differences in structure and an acoustic analysis on 59 captive birds demonstrated 100% accuracy in sexing when compared with molecular methods.|$|E
5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} incense cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and <b>whistling</b> swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|E

50|$|Signature <b>whistles</b> are {{difficult}} to identify because bottlenose dolphins emit non-signature <b>whistles</b> as well. However, there is a distinct {{amount of time in}} between each signature <b>whistle</b> that helps researchers distinguish them from the rest of dolphin noises. Signature <b>whistles</b> are emitted within 1 to 10 milliseconds of each other. Non-signature <b>whistles</b> occur with longer or shorter intervals between each <b>whistle.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} <b>whistles</b> can easily play {{notes in the}} keys of D and G major.

5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint <b>whistling</b> noise.|$|E
5|$|Bohor reedbuck {{are active}} {{throughout}} the day, seeking cover during the daytime and grazing in the night. A {{large proportion of}} the whole day is spent on feeding and vigilance. They can easily camouflage in grasses and reeds, and hide themselves rather than running from danger. When threatened, they usually remain motionless or retreat slowly into cover for defense, but if the threat is close, they flee, <b>whistling</b> shrilly to alert the others. It hides from predators rather than forming herds in defense. Many predators, including lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, African wild dogs and Nile crocodiles, prey on the reedbuck.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually <b>whistling.</b> If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he raises his head and back and whistles.|$|E
50|$|Organ <b>whistle</b> - a <b>whistle</b> with mouths {{cut in the}} side, {{usually a}} long <b>whistle</b> in {{relation}} to diameter, hence the name. These <b>whistle</b> were very common on steamships, especially those manufactured in the UK.|$|R

5|$|Breeding {{coincides with}} the {{availability}} of water. In South America and South Africa, the main nesting period is December–February, in Nigeria it is July–December, and in North America mid-May–August. In India, the breeding season is from June to October but peaking in July and August. Fulvous <b>whistling</b> ducks show lifelong monogamy, although the courtship display is limited to some mutual head-dipping before mating and a short dance after copulation in which the birds raise their bodies side-by-side while treading water.|$|E
