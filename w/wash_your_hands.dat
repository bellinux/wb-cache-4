40|$|What is Clostridium difficile {{infection}} (CDI) ? Clostridium difficile is {{the most}} commonly recognised cause of infectious diarrhoea in hospitalised patients. Clostridium difficile is a germ {{that can be found}} in the bowel. It was first recognised in the 1970 ’s as a common cause of diarrhoea in hospitalised patients. In 2010, Australia reported a new type of Clostridium difficile. Since then the number of cases have increased. This germ can survive for a long time outside the body, that’s why cleaning in hospitals is so important. <b>Washing</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> with soap and water is better than using hand gels for this particular infection. What are the symptoms? The most common symptom is watery diarrhoea. People who have the germ may also feel sick, bloated, have a high temperature, tummy pain and don’t want to eat anything. How do I get Clostridium difficile Infection? By coming into contact with “dirty surfaces ” (contaminated with faeces which you can’t see) and not <b>washing</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> afterwards. In hospital and residential care facilities (nursing homes), common “dirty surfaces ” are toilet areas...|$|R
