40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) approach by addressing the modeling based on Cessna 310 <b>wing</b> <b>bracket</b> to collect its baseline data. SHM {{is a novel}} technology application in most engineering field including aircraft and aerospace field for defect detection including crack and other damage area. The main purpose of this project is to assess their structural integrity due to designated loading and boundary conditions using ABAQUS modeling technique application. These parts were selected as its structures are specifically complex and considered as ageing aircraft parts. The work can be also regarded as platform for CAD model database for ageing aircraft parts investigation upon their structural analyses and design preference. The works begins with a precise measurement using basic gauges {{and transfer to a}} 3 -D solid modeling using CATIA V 6. The optimization technique introduces in this work will be of a novel approach since the CATIA will be combined with the Matlab programming software and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model in order to predict the damage location with respect to the prescribing boundaries and loadings conditions. The present works shows the application of the FEA of Abaqus / CAE software programming to build its graphical user interface (GUI) and Matlab software used to control its algorithms for its structural analysis in relation to the components...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to check the rate of canine {{retraction}} with bodily mechanics using two different pre-adjusted edgewise bracket Systems. Materials and Methods: A split mouth study with twenty patients who were randomly selected and allotted to a single operator. Duration of canine retraction, angulation of canine during its retraction, degree of Rotation, anchorage Loss, distance between canine and premolar at different time intervals were then evaluated, pre- (To), 3 months- (T 1) and canine tip touches the second premolar- (T 2). Descriptive statistics including mean values and standard deviations were calculated. Paired and unpaired t-test was performed to evaluate the differences between the groups. Results: Rotation and angulation of the canines did not show significant difference in both the systems. There was statistically significant difference (P< 0. 01) in anchorage loss between single wing and Siamese bracket being 2. 65 ± 1. 41 mm and 1. 31 ± 0. 93 respectively. There was statistically significant intergroup difference (P< 0. 01) in canine movement i. e distance between canine and premolar was recorded as 4. 72 mm (15. 06 ± 1. 69 to 10. 34 ± 1. 68 mm) in single <b>wing</b> <b>bracket</b> and 6. 25 mm in Siamese (15. 52 ± 1. 41 to 9. 27 ± 1. 94). Conclusion: In cases where high anchorage is required and the rate of canine retraction is a concern, Siamese brackets pose a definite advantage over Single wing brackets...|$|E

50|$|Newer {{weldable}} {{aluminium alloys}} {{are used in}} the A380's airframe. This enables the widespread use of laser beam welding manufacturing techniques, eliminating rows of rivets and resulting in a lighter, stronger structure. High-strength aluminium (type 7449) reinforced with carbon fibre was used in the <b>wing</b> <b>brackets</b> of the first 120 A380s to reduce weight, but cracks have been discovered and new sets of the more critical brackets will be made of standard aluminium 7010, increasing weight by 90 kg (198 lb). Repair costs for earlier aircraft are expected to be around €500 million (US$629 million).|$|R
50|$|Seat Wing - The seat {{is mounted}} on the seat wings. The seat <b>wings</b> are <b>brackets</b> that have three rollers each, which permit the seat {{assembly}} to travel back and forth freely as the rider rows, the 6 rollers wear out {{and need to be}} replaced regularly.|$|R
5|$|Delivery {{takes place}} in Hamburg for {{customers}} from Europe and the Middle East and in Toulouse for customers {{from the rest of}} the world. EADS explained that deliveries in 2013 were to be slowed temporarily to accommodate replacement of the <b>wing</b> rib <b>brackets</b> where cracks were detected earlier in the existing fleet.|$|R
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the <b>wing's</b> pylon mounting <b>bracket</b> that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the <b>wing's</b> mounting <b>bracket</b> in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|R

50|$|Knutsen started {{building}} Hawaiian steel guitars {{as early as}} 1908. Most of the guitars produced by Knutsen have spruce tops, all have lateral or diagonal bracing on the back, also due to his eccentric building skills many of his guitars used some crude solutions such as: wide number of screws, <b>brackets,</b> <b>wing</b> nuts, sheared-off tuning machine plates, odd-shaped nuts and dressmaker's seam tape rather than wood strips to reinforce ribs and butt fitted back plates.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this article}} was to assess how {{intraoral}} biodegradation influenced the surface characteristics and friction levels of metallic brackets used during 12 and 24 months of orthodontic treatment and also to compare the static friction generated in these brackets with four different methods of the ligation of orthodontic wires. Material and Methods: Seventy premolar brackets as received from the manufacturer and 224 brackets that were used in previous orthodontic treatments were evaluated in this experiment. The surface morphology and the composition of the deposits found in the brackets were evaluated with rugosimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Friction was analyzed by applying tensile tests simulating sliding mechanics with a 0. 019 x 0. 025 " steel wire. The static friction levels produced by the following ligation methods were evaluated: loosely attached steel ligature around all four <b>bracket</b> <b>wings,</b> steel ligature attached to only two wings, conventional elastomeric ligation around all 4 <b>bracket</b> <b>wings,</b> and non-conventional Slide&# 174; elastomeric ligature. Results: The results demonstrated the presence of biodegradation effects such as corrosion pits, plastic deformation, cracks, and material deposits. The main chemical elements found on these deposits were Carbon and Oxygen. The maximum friction produced by each ligation method changed according to the time of intraoral use. The steel ligature loosely attached to all four <b>bracket</b> <b>wings</b> produced the lowest friction levels in the new brackets. The conventional elastic ligatures generated the highest friction levels. The metallic brackets underwent significant degradation during orthodontic treatment, showing an increase in surface roughness and the deposit of chemical elements on the surface. Conclusion: The levels of static friction decreased with use. The non-conventional elastic ligatures were the best alternative to reduce friction...|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} model XA remains popular on {{the used}} aircraft market and aircraft for sale command high prices. Long operational {{use and the}} rigours of land and water operation have resulted in weak points in the design being identified as many older aircraft have suffered from bent wing trailing edges, <b>wing</b> root tube <b>brackets,</b> flying wire shackles and tail boom tubes. Cracked aft vertical stabilizer tubes and main bulkheads are also common. All of these deficiencies can be repaired in used aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Objective: In an {{in-vitro}} experimental set-up, {{we tested}} the ef-ficacy of different electric toothbrushes in cleaning teeth with a multibracket appliance. Material and Methods: The efficacy of three sonic and four ro-tating toothbrushes were compared; the brushes removed artifi-cial plaque from plastic teeth. The amount of removed plaque substitute was determined via a comparative photo-analysis with one picture of the teeth before and one picture after the brushing cycle. Two views of the tooth segment were chosen: one vestibu-lar view and one apical view of the areas behind the <b>bracket</b> <b>wings.</b> All tests were carried out with water, elmex ® and Pearls & Dents as brushing media. Results: The data showed greater brushing efficacy when Pearls & Dents toothpaste was used. The Sonicare ® toothbrush was the most efficient. The Sonicmax ™ and rotating Oral-B ® Profession-alCare ™ 7000 were also very efficacious. On average, all the other toothbrushes performed less well. All toothbrushes were capable of brushing the undercut areas behind the <b>bracket</b> <b>wings,</b> with plaque removal being the greatest when the Sonicare® toothbrush was used together with Pearls & Dents. Conclusions: The best electric toothbrushes did not demonstrate good tooth cleaning. Longer brushing times, mastery of the proper brushing technique, and/or special toothbrush heads are absolutely necessary...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Scale-resolving {{simulations}} such as hybrid RANS/LES methods (HRLM) {{are considered}} as promising approaches for improved numerical predictions of aeronautical flows near the boarder {{of the flight}} envelope. Due to the requirement to locally resolve turbulent fluctua-tions, these methods rely on an accurate spatial discretization, {{both in terms of}} the grid reso-lution and the numerical scheme for the flow equations. For this reason, most scale-resolving flow solvers apply structured grid metrics, which provide regular mesh cells and allow for rather easy implementation of higher-order schemes. However, with the increasing demand for simulations of complex geometries, e. g., high-lift <b>wings</b> with <b>brackets</b> and in-stalled engines, the generation of purely structured grids becomes infeasible and is often abandoned in favour of unstructured methods, such as the widely-used DLR-TAU code. To qualify the TAU code for accurate scale-resolving simulations, a low-dissipation low-dispersion (LD 2) scheme suitable for unstructured solvers has recently been developed [1]. While the LD 2 -scheme has already been shown to improve HRLM predictions on structured grids [2], the present work comprises first systematic studies on the applicability and accura-cy of the LD 2 -scheme on industry-relevant unstructured or hybrid grids...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the chassis}} monocoques for 701/2 and 701/4 had been {{manufactured}} by March, the final buildup {{of the cars}} was by Tyrrell mechanics. As a result, the blue Tyrrell cars incorporated {{a significant number of}} differences and tweaks in their configuration to the cars run by the works March team and those supplied to other customers. The first major difference was the specification of Dunlop tyres, rather than the Firestone rubber with which the works cars were equipped and the 701 had been designed around. In an attempt to develop the car and improve its handling the Tyrrell team made adjustments to the position of the suspension mounting points and added a damper to the steering system. More subtle variations related to the positioning of exhaust pipe <b>brackets,</b> <b>wing</b> struts, the oil radiator, and the pipe runs for lubrication and coolant fluids.|$|R
5000|$|The Dr. G.S. Martin House is a {{historic}} residence located in Maquoketa, Iowa, United States.

40|$|The Hopkins Phoenix Observatory {{has been}} doing high {{resolution}} spectroscopy on the 3 rd magnitude long period (27. 1 year) {{eclipsing binary star system}} epsilon Aurigae since August 2008 using a Lhires III spectrograph with a 2, 400 line/mm grating mounted on a 12 " Meade LX 200 GPS telescope. Observations have been in both the sodium D line region of the spectrum and with near continuous observations of the hydrogen alpha region. The out-of-eclipse hydrogen alpha spectrum shows significant night-to-night variation. While many star systems exhibit a strong hydrogen alpha absorption line, like Be stars. Epsilon Aurigae also shows strong blue and red shifted emission components sometimes called <b>wings</b> or horns <b>bracketing</b> the absorption line. Unlike the Be stars where the blue and red horns remain relatively constant, the hydrogen alpha horns of epsilon Aurigae seem to be in a wild dance with continuous motion up and down. This paper will discuss techniques and result of recent out-of-eclipse high resolution spectroscopy of epsilon Aurigae. 1...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{adhesive}} {{capacity of}} 17 different bracket types was evaluated in an in vitro peel/shear test. METHODS: Silane-treated metal bars {{were used as}} substrates with all bonding being performed using the orthodontic adhesive Concise. The effect of aluminium oxide air abrasion on the bonding performance of recycled metal bracket bases was evaluated. Morphological examination of the bracket bases was carried out under scanning electron microscopy. Statistics analysis included one-way ANOVA with Tukey's Studentized Range Test, two-way ANOVA and Weibull analysis. RESULTS: Mean peel/shear bond strength values range from 13. 9 MPa for Allure Accu Arch, a ceramic bracket type, to 1. 6 MPa for the plastic bracket CeramaFlex Advant Edge. Allure Accu Arch performed {{the best of all}} the ceramic <b>brackets.</b> However, <b>bracket</b> <b>wing</b> fracture was observed. The metal brackets Mini masters and Omni Arch showed no significant difference in bond strength compared with the ceramic bracket Allure Accu Arch (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: The type of the bracket base determines its adhesive capacity. Sandblasting the base of recycled metal brackets had no uniform effect. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a noise prediction model for aircraft Krueger flap devices that are considered as alternatives to leading edge slotted slats. The prediction model decomposes the total Krueger noise into four components, generated by the unsteady flows, respectively, in the cove under the pressure side surface of the Krueger, in the gap between the Krueger trailing edge and the main <b>wing,</b> around the <b>brackets</b> supporting the Krueger device, and around the cavity on the lower side of the main wing. For each noise component, the modeling follows a physics-based approach that aims at capturing the dominant noise-generating features in the flow and developing correlations between the noise and the flow parameters that control the noise generation processes. The far field noise is modeled using each of the four noise component's respective spectral functions, far field directivities, Mach number dependencies, component amplitudes, and other parametric trends. Preliminary validations are carried out by using small scale experimental data, and two applications are discussed; one for conventional aircraft and the other for advanced configurations. The former focuses on the parametric trends of Krueger noise on design parameters, while the latter reveals its importance in relation to other airframe noise components...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{debonding}} time and pain or discomfort between con-ventional mechanical debonding with sonic and ultrasonic debonding of stainless steel brackets. One hundred fifty brackets were debonded at the end of 2 years of comprehensive orthodontic treatment from 12 patients of both sexes of age range between 15 - 25 years using non probability sampling technique. Mechanical debonding of brackets was done with debonding plier using wing method. Ultrasonic and sonic scalers were used to debond the brackets engaging the bracket from incisal side. Debonding time in seconds and patient perception of pain on a scale of 0 - 4 was noted. One way ANOVA was used to compare these three techniques in terms of time efficiency and pain or discomfort at time of debonding. Mechanical debonding was successful in all the cases while ultrasonic and sonic debonding failed to debond the brackets in 16 % and 36 % of the cases respectively. Mechanical <b>wing</b> method debonds <b>brackets</b> in 1. 28 ± 0. 49 seconds, ultrasonic debonding in 42. 53 ± 20. 25 while sonic method debonds brackets in 70. 18 ± 22. 28 seconds. More pain was felt by mechanical debonding followed by sonic and ultrasonic debonding respectively. Difference in debonding time and pain were found statistically significant between these three different techniques. It was concluded that that no single method is time efficient and at the same time least painful for the patient. Mechanical debonding was most time efficient while ultrasonic debonding was least painful...|$|R
