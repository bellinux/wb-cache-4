"Follow Me Home" [...] {{was written}} by the Sugababes—Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena, and Heidi Range—in {{collaboration}} with Jonathan Lipsey, Karen Poole, and Jeremy Shaw, for the group's fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways (2005). Lipsey developed {{the idea of a}} close person as the song's inspiration. Buena wrote the first verse based upon her daughter Tahlia, who was born in March 2005. While writing the verse, she pondered questions such as 'What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to her if she was ever in trouble?', and 'How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> I’ll always be there for you?'. Buena wanted people to interpret the verse in different ways, and stated that the lyrics came naturally. Buchanan drew inspiration from her close friend when she wrote the other verse. Lipsey produced the song under his production name Jony Rockstar. [...] "Follow Me Home" [...] was mixed and engineered at Metropolis Studios by Tom Elmhirst and Richard Wilkinson, respectively.|$|E

On a rainy afternoon, at 5:30p.m., Peter Heenan handed Hepburn a pair of scissors with which to cut the ribbon crossing the road and declare the highway open.

The crowd cheered and Hepburn cut the ribbon.|$|E
500|$|Between the {{aforementioned}} {{carrier air group}} losses, which deprived Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa's ships of their pilots, and losses of experienced land-based attack units like the TAir Attack Force, there remained no real prospect of providing air cover over the Japanese fleet for the coming Battle of Leyte Gulf. Both historians of the battle and IJN commanders have acknowledged this factor as {{the primary reason for}} the Sho plan's failure. H.P. Willmott writes: [...] "In large measure, the Japanese defeat in the Philippines had assumed substance...prior to the landing operations of 17 and 20October. This was the case because of {{the nature and extent of}} the victory won by American carrier air groups in the course of their operations after 10October." [...] Toyoda, when posed the question [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> was the primary cause for the lack of success in that operation?" [...] responded, [...] "Our weakness in air, and...the fact that our pilots under Admiral Ozawa were not sufficiently trained." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around 1880, {{when the}} anti-liberal pole was {{organizing}} {{itself into the}} Conservative Party, Fleva was being identified by his adversaries as a main exponent of a new National Liberal ideology and morality. Writing for Timpul, the national conservative poet and essayist Mihai Eminescu stirred passions with his radical critique of this emerging group, nominating Fleva alongside Pherekyde and others as [...] "foreign" [...] and [...] "superimposed" [...] enemies of national development. In one of his lampoons, published in August 1882, Eminescu uses analogy to suggest that Pherekyde's shadow cabinet was an anti-national abomination: [...] "Dear people! What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> if the Chancellor of Germany were named Pherekydes, if its ministers were named Carada, Fleva and Chirițopol , if in that somewhere where all people have names like Meyer and Müller, all of its governing class were foreign?

Yallop could be dull; if Dean Jones set the pulses of Melbourne grandmothers racing {{like a couple of}} shandies over lunch, then Yallop was the comforting mug of Milo who put them back to sleep. He was decidedly more at home when the spinners were on. He was also, {{especially}} at his 1983 peak, the epitome of rocklike solidity. And yes, he was a fatally flawed, forlorn captain... He was unimaginative, tactically unsophisticated and lacked the respect of his players. And because he had predicted they would win 6–0, in the dumbest press conference any Australian captain ever gave... More than anyone, Yallop suffered from the chaos of ... He was used and abused at every turn. He is not the only Australian batsman of the last 25 years to have been mistreated by selectors...

2500|$|During the {{six years}} after A ribbon of poems was {{published}} about 100 copies were sold. The first edition consisted of sewed books, printed by printer Joh. Enschedé and sons. The cover was designed by Ludwig Willem Reymert Wenckebach. The cover of the second edition, which was published by L.J. Veen in 1893, was designed by P. de Josselin de Jong, made after an idea of Louis Couperus and printed by printer H.C.A. Thieme (Nijmegen). Of this edition of about 350-500 copies, in 1905 135 still remained with the publisher, who let 25 copies bind in a blue cover with red page cuts. L.J. Veen acquired the right to publish Couperus' poetry editions A ribbon of poems and [...] Orchids in 1892 and announced a reprint of A ribbon of poems in December of that same year. After he was notified Couperus wrote to Veen: If you like my poetry that much what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> if we publish another book with verses; he wanted to include the poems called Fragment (renamed to Melancholy) Viviane, Williswinde, Ginevra, Semiramis and Fragments from the Apocapyps of John the Apostle. Veen however refused this offer {{because he was not}} interested in an enlarged reprint of Orchids. At the beginning of December 1894 Couperus informed Veen that he agreed with a reprint of Orchids and a new book {{with the rest of his}} verses for the sum of 200 guilders.|$|E
2500|$|The next track, [...] "The Sound of War" [...] is a near eight-minute {{folk song}} that {{declares}} [...] "chaos remains." [...] It features the lyric [...] "the buzzing of the drones," [...] which appear {{later in the}} song, adding a [...] "moody, cinematic soundscape." [...] The track begins [...] "with {{the sound of a}} mountain stream and all manner of bird calls, it blossoms out into a modern madrigal, with lute-like guitar and Sundfør's voice restrained and husky. About halfway through, it falls away to leave a hellish, industrial synth drone, reminiscent of the textures of The Knife's Shaking The Habitual, or the ambient sound design of a David Lynch soundtrack." [...] Described as [...] "an art installation-like interlude," [...] the [...] "glitchy" [...] title track begins with an echoing voice punctuated by bleeps (samples of Gesang der Jünglinge by Karlheinz Stockhausen) that recall sound effects from 80s sci-fi, and follows with a spoken passage from naturist Andres Roberts, in which he responds to the question: [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to someone who has given up on life?" [...] asked in an interview by Sundfør. Halfway through the song, a plucked acoustic guitar, later accompanied by a flute, carries the song to its conclusion. Tom Pinnock of Fopp said Sundfør embraces musique concrète on the track. The [...] "spooky, meditative" [...] track [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] contains [...] "ambient footsteps, cell phone beeps, and wandering clarinet that highlight the cruel boredom of insomnia." [...] The Quietus described it as the album's [...] "most lyrical moment: a sweeping fusion of piano and clarinet that recalls the heady, jazz-flecked adventuring of Joni Mitchell and her woodwind virtuoso Tom Scott on For the Roses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early on, Hayashi {{said they}} {{attempted}} to move on from relying just on sex and violence: [...] "We’re {{trying to focus on}} the real women that surround us; the voice of a female, the mannerisms. We are being realistic about it. We want to show something that’s more high class, that adult males of our generation could look at a woman [...] and be impressed with her as a woman, not just as a pin-up," [...] as opposed to the previous concept of just [...] "make her breasts big and just make them jiggle." [...] Dead or Alive 5s overseas producer Peter Garza said the game's revised aesthetic direction: [...] "Dead or Alive is known for its sexiness and high-kicking characters and certain aspects of the physics engine... Those are definitely going to be in Dead or Alive 5 - it's part of the series, it's part of its history and it's part of why people like it. But we're trying to take a bit more of a mature take on it." [...] After the release, the game's director Yohei Shimbori said they were originally [...] "getting feedback from the overseas offices to tone down the sexuality -- to tone down the sexiness of the game, and of the characters." [...] However, the team then changed their decision due to negative feedback from fans who were playing the alpha demo version who demanded bigger breasts. Shimbori said: [...] "That was kind of surprising. There's definitely still room for having sexualized aspects," [...] adding that he [...] "really tries" [...] to take fan feedback into account and to keep an open mind. Hayashi himself made a 180 turn from his previous position. Asked [...] "what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to those people who think that the bikini-clad babes in DOA5 are sexist," [...] he said their goal was to create [...] "the cutest chicks in videogames" [...] and so they made a lot of effort to develop an advanced breast physics model that works differently with various types of clothing. Their product received the ESRB rating of Mature 17+ (Partial Nudity, Sexual Themes, Violence).|$|E
