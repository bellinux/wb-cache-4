25|$|That November, Fisher sat his lieutenant's {{examination}} and passed with flying colours. He received top grades in seamanship and gunnery, and {{achieved the highest score}} ever — 963/1000 — for navigation. For this, {{he was awarded}} the Beaufort Testimonial, an annual prize of books and instruments; but in the meantime he had to <b>wait</b> <b>around,</b> unpaid, until his appointment came through officially. He {{was one of the last}} Royal Navy officers to receive basic training entirely at sea.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also some}} {{evidence}} that road-killed birds and animals are also consumed both on the wintering grounds and on the breeding grounds. The species commonly follows tractors and other agricultural equipment during haying or ploughing, where rodents are exposed for the hawks to capture, or insects are uncovered after crop cutting. Wildfires often attract foraging Swainson's hawks, especially grass fires in their South American wintering range. In South American grass fires, the hawks frequently <b>wait</b> <b>around</b> {{the edges of the}} fire, picking off not only insects but also vertebrates including nothuras, lizards and snakes.|$|E

500|$|Following 2006's Straight Outta Lynwood, Yankovic {{decided to}} explore digital {{distribution}} {{as a means}} to promote his music. In late 2008, he announced plans to release a parody of [...] "Whatever You Like" [...] by [...] artist T.I. In October 2008, Yankovic told Billboard that he had come up with the idea two weeks before and that, with the benefit of digital distribution, he would not [...] "have to <b>wait</b> <b>around</b> while my songs get old and dated— get them out on the Internet almost immediately." [...] The single was recorded on September 26, 2008, and was exclusively uploaded to iTunes on October 8 before it was available to other digital distribution platforms two weeks later.|$|E

On {{the two-year}} anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, he called for funds to be withdrawn and federal aid be cut off for the recovery effort. He remarked that it was time, [...] "the taxpayer gravy train left the New Orleans station." [...] The move was perhaps a step for the candidate to woo fiscal conservatives and advocates for states' rights, commenting that [...] "at some point, {{state and local officials}} and individuals have got {{to step up to the}} plate and take some initiative, the mentality that people can <b>wait</b> <b>around</b> indefinitely for the federal taxpayer to solve all their worldly problems has got to come to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{interview}} with actress Kristin Chenoweth, who was originally cast as Rapunzel, reveals {{that at some}} point Rapunzel was intended to be a squirrel. As directors, Greno and Howard felt it essential that Rapunzel resemble a less [...] "passive" [...] heroine than the way she is depicted in the original fairy tale. [...] "We knew we were making this movie for a contemporary audience and we wanted Rapunzel to be a real role model in a way. We wanted all this girl power and to really drive this story, so she doesn't <b>wait</b> <b>around</b> for anything ... she's a smart girl, she has these hopes and dreams and she's going to get what she wants out of life." [...] Tangleds production was surrounded by rumors that it would be Disney's last princess film.|$|E

500|$|Aurora is {{a member}} of a trifecta known as the [...] "Golden Era" [...] of Disney heroines. Alongside her two {{predecessors}} Snow White and Cinderella, Aurora is one of the three original Disney princesses. Kit Steinkellner of HelloGiggles wrote that Aurora continued the [...] "trend of passive heroines who <b>wait</b> <b>around</b> for magic to change their lives," [...] a recurring theme shared by Disney princesses who were introduced both during and prior to the 1950s. Sonia Saraiya of Nerve dubbed Aurora [...] "the apex" [...] of [...] "women who made no choices for themselves". Writing for MTV, Lauren Vino felt that the character [...] "followed the basic princess tenants of loving animals and sleeping in makeup", while About.com's David Nusair wrote that Aurora followed the [...] "pattern of kind yet helpless princesses", similar to Snow White and Cinderella. Mary Grace Garis of Bustle observed that the original trio [...] "seek out marriage as both their endgame and salvation", elaborating, [...] "It's literally their own means of escape, and their only final objective." [...] However, Aurora's dreams and fantasies are different {{in the sense that they}} are drawn from loneliness and isolation; the character essentially longs [...] "for human connections beyond her three fairy surrogate mothers." [...] The Walt Disney Family Museum volunteer Lucas O. Seastrom agreed that Aurora is more [...] "self-confident" [...] and [...] "more of repose than the usual naiveté of Disney heroines." [...] Observing that Aurora's actions are influenced by the decisions and opinions of those around her, while most of the film's action involves Prince Phillip, Steinkellner joked that the character is so passive that she remains asleep during the film's climax. Dubbing her [...] "a girl of reaction," [...] nerdology.org's Lisa Kaye Cunningham felt that Aurora's [...] "little screen time makes [...] difficult to classify as a feminist, but her single active decision shows great promise in the evolution of feminist Disney princesses," [...] despite the fact that her agency is constantly undermined by other characters. Cunningham concluded, [...] "By making one active decision to try and follow her dreams, this princess made a big step forward as a stronger feminist than Snow White, though Aurora remains bogged down with passive reactivity." [...] Author Melissa G. Wilson observed in her book Mashups for Teens: From Sleeping Beauty to Beyonce that Aurora's reaction upon learning that she is a princess differs from what one would expect from a young woman.|$|E
2500|$|Abramović had {{proposed}} some solo performances during her career that never were performed. One proposal was titled [...] "Come to Wash with Me." [...] This performance {{would take place}} in a gallery space that was to be transformed into a laundry with sinks placed all around the walls of the gallery. The public would enter the space and be asked to take off all of their clothes and give them to Abramović. The individuals would then <b>wait</b> <b>around</b> as she would wash, dry and iron their cloths for them, and once she was done, she would give them back their clothing, and they could get dressed and then leave. She proposed this in 1969 for the Galerija Doma Omladine in Belgrade. The proposal was refused.|$|E
2500|$|The win {{attracted}} further {{attention on}} social media because Gun Runner ran the final half mile with a horseshoe caught in his tail: a shoe from Cautious Giant flew loose just as Gun Runner was starting his move. [...] "We watched the tape repeatedly, repeatedly," [...] said Asmussen, [...] "and if you never seen anything before, just <b>wait</b> <b>around.</b> Can you believe that? I mean if we tried to throw one and stick in one's tail as he was standing, still we'd go 0-for-1,000 – let alone at a run, let alone Gun Runner, let alone in the Whitney – and it stayed. [...] how fast he was going , it was held out from him. When he slowed down to walk, then it came into him. We were obviously unaware of it until {{he came back to}} the winner's circle, but not a nick on him. I mean, there's still nails in it." [...] The race improved Gun Runner's rating to 127 in the World's Best Racehorse Rankings August update, maintaining his third place ranking worldwide.|$|E

6000|$|It must be {{confessed that}} the troops under Colonel Washington formed a motley collection. Many {{of the best}} of the pioneers and frontiersmen had grown tired of the delays in the past and now refused to re-enlist, fearful that they would be called on to do nothing but <b>wait</b> <b>around</b> the fort, while the summer harvests at home demanded their attention. Drumming up {{recruits}} proved the hardest kind of work, and the companies were made up in some cases of men who knew not the meaning of home life--hardy trappers and traders, some industrious enough, but others given to drink and brawling, and not a few who lived almost as the Indians did, using the redmen's style of dress and occasionally painting their faces, [...] "jes' fer the sport on't," [...] as they expressed it. When it came to fighting these men were like human tigers, but in camp and on the march it was next to impossible to bring them under military discipline. Many refused to carry rations as the regular soldiers did, preferring to bring down game as they needed it, and if game was not handy they appropriated a pig or a cow belonging to some settler--thus bringing additional trouble on the command.|$|E
