40|$|Stress Engineering Services (SES) was {{contracted}} by Mr. John Watts to {{test his}} ''WW'' threaded connection developed for oilfield oil and gas service. This work was a continuation of testing performed by SES as reported in August of 1999. The connection design tested was identified as ''WW''. The samples were all integral (no coupled connections) and contained a <b>wedge</b> <b>thread</b> form with 90 {sup o} flank angles relative to the pipe centerline. The <b>wedge</b> <b>thread</b> form is a variable width thread that primarily engages on the flanks. This thread form provides very high torque capacity and good stabbing ability and makeup. The test procedure selected {{for one of the}} samples was the newly written ISO 13679 procedure for full scale testing of casing and tubing connections, which is currently going through the ISO acceptance process. The ISO procedure requires a variety of tests that includes makeup/breakout testing, internal gas sealability/external water sealability testing with axial tension, axial compression, bending, internal gas thermal cycle tests and limit load (failure) tests. This test procedure was performed with one sample. Four samples were tested to failure. Table 1 contains a summary of the tasks performed by SES. The project started with the delivery of test samples by Mr. Watts. Pipe from the previous round of tests was used for the new samples. Figure 1 shows the structural and sealing results relative to the pipe body. Sample 1 was used to determine the torque capacity of the connection. Torque was applied to the capacity of SES's equipment which was 28, 424 ft-lbs. From this, an initial recommended torque range of 7, 200 to 8, 800 ft-lbs. was selected. The sample was disassembled and while there was no galling observed in the threads, the end of the pin had collapsed inward. Sample 2 received three makeups. Breakouts 1 and 2 also had collapsing of the pin end, with no thread galling. From these make/breaks, it was decided {{to reduce the amount of}} lubricant applied to the connection by applying it to the box or pin only and reducing the amount applied. Samples 3 and 4 received one makeup only. Sample 5 initially received two make/breaks to test for galling resistance before final makeup, No galling was observed. Later, three additional make/breaks were performed with no pin end collapse and galling over 1 / 2 a thread occurring on one of the breakouts. During the make/break tests, the stabbing and hand tight makeup of the WW connection was found to be very easy and trouble free. There was no tendency to crossthread, even when stabbed at an angle, and it screwed together very smoothly up to hand tight. During power tight makeup, there was no heat generated in the box (as checked by hand contact) and no jerkiness associated with any of the makeups or breakouts. Sample 2 was tested in pure compression. The maximum load obtained was 1, 051 kips and the connection was beginning to significantly deform as the sample buckled. Actual pipe yield was 1, 226 kips. Sample 3 was capped-end pressure tested to failure. The capped-end yield pressure of the pipe was 16, 572 psi and the sample began to leak at 12, 000 psi. Sample 4 was tested in pure tension. The maximum load obtained was 978 kips and the connection failed by fracture at the pin critical section. Actual pipe yield was 1, 226 kips. Sample 5 was tested in combined tension/compression and internal gas pressure. The sample was assembled, setup and tested four times. The first time was with a torque of 7, 298 ft-lbs and the connection leaked halfway to ISO Load Point 2 with loads of 693 kips and 4, 312 psi. The second time the torque was increased to 14, 488 ft-lbs and a leak occurred at 849 kips and 9, 400 psi, which was ISO Load Point 2. The third time the makeup torque was again increased, to 20, 456 ft-lbs, and a leak occurred at 716 kips and 11, 342 psi, ISO Load Point 4. The fourth test was with the same torque as before, 20, 617 ft-lbs, and the connection successfully tested up to load step 56, ISO Load Point 6 (second round) before leaking at 354 kips and 11, 876 psi. At this point, time and funds prevented additional testing to be performed...|$|E
5000|$|In rock climbing, a nut (or chock or chockstone) is a metal <b>wedge</b> <b>threaded</b> on a {{wire and}} is used for {{protection}} by wedging it into {{a crack in the}} rock. Quickdraws are clipped to the nut wire by the ascending climber and the rope threads through the quickdraw. Nuts {{come in a variety of}} sizes and styles, and several different brands are made by competing manufacturers. Most nuts are made of aluminum. Larger nuts may be threaded on Dyneema cord instead of wire, but this has become unusual.|$|R

There are three basic styles of <b>wedge</b> anchors: fully <b>threaded,</b> partial threaded and the full-bodied wedge anchor. As shown in the figure, tightening the bolt results in a wedge being driven up against a sleeve. This jams the end of the bolt, and provides the strength. Many different manufacturers provide a variation on this theme, usually depending on the condition of the concrete, and the type of load. If a mechanical anchor fails, it is usually in the form of pulling out a wedge of concrete, and for this reason, proper design looks at the depth of embedment and ensures that the bolts are not spaced too closely.|$|R
