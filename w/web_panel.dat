Light gauge cold-formed steel sections {{have been developed}} as more economical building solutions to the alternative heavier hot-rolled sections in the commercial and residential markets. Cold-formed lipped channel beams (LCB), LiteSteel beams (LSB) and hollow flange beams (HFB) are commonly used as flexural members such as floor joists and bearers. However, their shear capacities are determined based on conservative design rules. For the shear design of cold-formed <b>web</b> <b>panels,</b> their elastic shear buckling strength must be determined accurately including the potential post-buckling strength. Currently the elastic shear buckling coefficients of <b>web</b> <b>panels</b> are determined by assuming conservatively that the <b>web</b> <b>panels</b> are simply supported at the junction between the flange and web elements and ignore the post-buckling strength. Hence experimental and numerical studies were conducted to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of LSBs, LCBs and HFBs. New direct strength method (DSM) based design equations were proposed to determine the ultimate shear capacities of cold-formed steel beams. An improved equation for the higher elastic shear buckling coefficient of cold-formed steel beams was proposed based on finite element analysis results and included in the DSM design equations.

The FE analyses showed that their typical shear buckling failures were affected by the structural relationship between the <b>web</b> <b>panel</b> and each stiffener in the plate girder, to resist shear buckling of the <b>web</b> <b>panel.</b> Their critical shear buckling loads decreased from 82 % to 59 %, and their shear buckling strength decreased from 88 % to 76 %, due to the effect of corrosion of the stiffeners on their shear buckling behavior.

The unique LSB sections are produced by a patented manufacturing process involving simultaneous cold-forming and electric resistance welding. To date, limited research has been undertaken on the shear yielding and buckling behaviour of LiteSteel beams with torsionally rigid, rectangular hollow flanges. For the shear design of LSB <b>web</b> <b>panels,</b> their elastic buckling strength under shear loading must be determined accurately including the potential post-buckling strength. Currently the elastic shear buckling coefficients of <b>web</b> <b>panels</b> are determined by assuming conservatively that the <b>web</b> <b>panels</b> are simply supported at the junction between the flange and web elements. However, depending on the geometric properties of LSBs, the elastically restrained supports is closer to a fixed support. In the present study, a series of numerical analyses based on three-dimensional finite element modelling was carried out to investigate the shear buckling behaviour of 13 different LSB sections. The results were then evaluated {{to determine the effects of}} the important geometric parameters on the resulting support condition at the junction between the flange and web elements.

The {{aim of the}} study was to explore for the presence of non-response bias in two Swedish research projects on HIV [‘HIV in Sweden’ (HIS 11) ] and sexuality [‘Sex and health’ (UngKAB 09) ]. Methods: The study used four data sets (two from each project), each of which had been generated using different methods. By comparing means and percentages on 15 items across the data sets, we explore the potential presence of non-response bias due to interest in the survey topic (topic salience), and discuss the suitability of two increasingly common methods for recruiting respondents: the pre-recruited probability <b>web</b> <b>panel</b> and the self-selected web survey. Results: While a higher proportion of the respondents in the HIS 11 substudies had been tested for HIV and were inclined to perceive themselves as being at high risk of HIV infection, the respondents in the UngKAB 09 substudies were on average more sexually active. Further, while there was little variation in the results between the HIS 11 substudies (postal/web survey and prerecruited <b>web</b> <b>panel),</b> there were some fairly large differences in the results between the UngKAB 09 substudies (web surveys, one of which was based on a self-selected sample). Conclusion: The study concludes that (i) there are signs of non-response bias that may be due to topic salience, (ii) while care must be taken when using self-selection sampling methods, the pre-recruited probability <b>web</b> <b>panel</b> might provide a cost- and time-effective alternative for recruiting respondents in future population surveys...|$|E

A qualitative ana 1 ysis was made of the fatigue behavior of individual thin <b>web</b> girder <b>panels</b> with initial lateral web deflections.
