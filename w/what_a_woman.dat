500|$|... "Judas" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. The song {{has a similar}} sound to Gaga's previous RedOne-produced tracks, including [...] "Poker Face", [...] "LoveGame", [...] "Bad Romance", and [...] "Alejandro". It contains three distinct hooks and a house-influenced break down. Gaga explained that the lines spoken during the breakdown talk about her as beyond redemption, regarding the traditional views of <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> should be. [...] "Judas" [...] initially had a strong sales opening, but was less successful commercially in comparison to Gaga's previous singles. The song reached the top ten of the charts in most major music markets, and also {{reached the top of}} the charts in South Korea.|$|E
500|$|Gaga had posted some of {{the lyrics}} of the song in February 2011, and next month she {{revealed}} more lyrics for [...] "Judas" [...] in the Google interview. Gaga also confirmed that the song {{was influenced by the}} Biblical Judas Iscariot. According to Popjustice, lyrically on the surface [...] "Judas" [...] is a song about being double-crossed and contemplating revenge, but being repeatedly drawn to awfulness. The middle eight of the song, with the lyrics [...] "But in the cultural sense I just speak in future tense. Judas kiss me if offenced, or wear an ear condom next time", talks about Gaga being beyond the ability to redeem herself, in terms of the traditional views of <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> is supposed to be. [...] "But I don't want to redeem myself, because in the cultural sense I believe that I'm just before my time. And if you don't like it, wear an ear condom," [...] she explained. The main portion of the song is about Gaga in private and the middle eight is about Gaga in public, two themes that are explored elsewhere on the parent album too.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{exploring}} indigenous issues, Praed {{documents in}} her novels [...] "a female {{perspective on the}} Australian bush", demonstrating her conviction that women could not achieve [...] "a decent life" [...] As she wrote in The Luck of the Leura, [...] "The woman always pays ... In spite of her husband's protestations, and to his genuine distress, {{she had to do}} all those things which he had declared should never be required of her". Spender argues that the similarities between the Brenda of this book and Praed's mother are [...] "impossible to ignore". However, she says that Praed does not endlessly copy her mother, creating instead [...] "realistic characters" [...] through which she generalised about the experience of women in the bush. Many of her heroines, too, confronted the question of whether to marry. In The Bond of Wedlock (1887) she explores violent marriage, and in Nadine: The Study of a Woman (1882) she looks at <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> can do when she has a child and no husband.|$|E

2500|$|Rich {{struggled}} throughout 1979 having hits with United Artists and Epic. His singles were moderate hits that year, {{the biggest}} of them on either UA or Epic was a version of [...] "Spanish Eyes", which became a top-20 country hit. Rich appeared as himself in the 1978 Clint Eastwood movie, Every Which Way but Loose, in which he performed the song [...] "I'll Wake You Up When I Get Home". This song hit number three on the charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to Elektra Records, and released a number-12 single, [...] "A Man Just Don't Know <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>Woman</b> Goes Through" [...] {{in the fall of}} that year. One more top-40 hit followed, the Gary Stewart song [...] "Are We Dreamin' the Same Dream" [...] early in 1981, but Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight. For over a decade, Rich was silent, living off his investments in semiretirement and only playing occasional concerts. He also played a bit part in the 1981 movie Take This Job and Shove It which yielded his last charted single, [...] "You Made It Beautiful".|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Doesn't Really Matter", Jackson {{speaks of}} looking past {{physical}} appearance, choosing {{to love the}} person inside. Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> is supposed to look like – all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny when you hear that Janet and Klump have a relationship, but they make it believable." ...|$|E
